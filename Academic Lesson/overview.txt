1. **Integral of x^3 - 2x^4/x^2 dx:**
   We simplified the integral by distributing the division by \(x^2\) across both terms, transforming it into \(x^3 - 2x^{1/4}\). Then we applied the power rule, integrating each term separately:
   - Integrated \(x^3\) to get \(\frac{x^4}{4}\), then differentiated once more to add an exponent of 1 and divide by the new exponent, resulting in \(\frac{1}{2}x^2\).
   - Integrated \(x^{1/4}\) to get \(\frac{x^{5/4}}{5/4}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{4}{5}x^{5/4}\). Then we differentiated this result once, increasing the exponent by 1 and dividing by it, resulting in \(2x^{3/4}\).
   - Integrated \(2x^{3/4}\) to get \(\frac{4}{7}x^{7/4}\), then differentiated once more to add an exponent of 1 and divide, resulting in \(4x\).
   We added a constant of integration, \(C\), at the end.

2. **Integral of x^4/x^2 dx - x minus 2x^(1/4) over x^2 dx:**
   Simplified and rewrote as \(-7x^{1/4}\) over \(x^2\), then applied the power rule to integrate:
   - Integrated \(-7x^{1/4}\) to get \(-\frac{7}{5}x^{5/4}\).
   - Integrated \(1/x^2\) to get \(-\frac{1}{x}\), then differentiated this result once, resulting in \(\frac{1}{2x}\).
   We added a constant of integration, \(C\).

3. **Integral of cos(3x) dx:**
   Recognized that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), and knowing that the derivative of sin(3x) would be 3cos(3x), we undid this by dividing by 3 to get:
   - Integrated cos(3x) to get \(\frac{1}{3}\)sin(3x) plus a constant of integration, \(C\).

These examples show the application of the power rule and the ability to manipulate expressions before and after differentiation or integration. Practice these techniques and others to improve your proficiency with integrals and antiderivatives.
