Today's video, we're going to take a look at answering the big question.
What is calculus?
And really calculus is going to be the answer to three questions.
The first question that we're going to attempt to answer and we're going to focus on here
in chapter two is what is it getting close to?
And this in calculus we're going to affectionately call the limit.
The second question we're going to attempt to answer and it's really the focus of chapter
three is what is the slope?
Specifically what is the slope at this given point?
And there we're going to call that in calculus the derivative.
The third question we're going to attempt to answer is what is the area?
And we're not going to really dive into that question until we get to calc two next term.
But for now I'll just tell you that that is the integral of the function.
So to kind of set this up, we're going to take a look at first the tangent problem.
For the tangent problem I want to first consider how fast these lines are changing.
And we really call that our rate of change.
So I'm going to put three graphs up here.
First graph is going to be y equals two-thirds x minus one.
And this graph I'll have a y intercept at negative one and it will rise two and run
three to another point so it's going to look something like that.
The second graph we're going to look at is y equals negative three x plus two.
And so that graph has a y intercept at two and it slopes down three over one.
And it looks like this guy.
And the third graph we're going to look at is y equals negative one.
And that's just a flat line right at negative one.
And the question here that we're considering is how fast are these lines changing?
How are these lines changing?
The first graph here, the two-thirds x minus one, we see it is going uphill from left to
right but it's going uphill slowly.
It's kind of gradually working its way uphill.
Which is different than the second graph because not only is it going downhill but it's also
going down much quicker.
It's going downhill quickly.
And that's going to be different than this third graph which really isn't going up or
down.
It's kind of flat lined.
So we'll say this is a flat or no change.
Now what's interesting here is these lines are really easy to see how the graph is changing
because they're just a straight line.
They're always changing at the same rate.
A is always going up slowly, B is always going down quickly, and C is always flat without
any change.
But this is not always the case.
The most functions do not have a constant rate of change.
For example, if we consider the graph, y equals x squared plus two.
Now y equals x squared plus two has a vertex rated two, it's got the point at one three
and negative one three and then six and negative six or I'm sorry three six and three negative
three six.
So here is the graph of x squared plus two.
Now if we consider at the point zero where x is equal to zero, if I were to look at that
graph it's kind of leveled out there at the bottom, we could draw a line that's tangent
to that point and right now it has a slope of zero.
It's really not changing at that point.
It's not going up or down, it's kind of leveled out at the bottom.
It's a little different than if I consider the point that's just one to the right because
at that point it's actually got a much steeper tangent line that could be drawn that barely
attaches it.
And there the slope of that graph, it's going uphill, it's actually rising two and running
one.
If I could grab a different color, we could look at this point at negative one or negative
two.
Looking at the point at negative two we see it's very very very steep.
In fact the slope there is going to be negative four and we'll talk later about how we can
actually calculate those exact slopes.
But what's interesting here is this graph starts out with a very steep negative slope
and then it levels out and turns into a positive slope which gets steeper and steeper.
I've already hinted at this but the lines that touch the graph
are what we're going to call tangent lines where they touch the graph in one point and
then go off into the distance.
So the question we're going to attempt to find out is what is the slope of these tangent
lines?
To do that we're going to set up another thing called the secant line.
We can actually approximate the rate of change
or tangent line with what we're going to call a secant line.
Here's what we mean by that.
So we've got some graph here, we're going to say it comes in, goes up and levels off
and right here we're going to say is A, means if we go up this point here is going to be
at F of A and then a little bit over from A is B and if we go up from B that point right
there will be at F of B. If we connect A and B with a line that is called a secant line.
A secant line is going to go through two points on the line.
In fact we know what those two points are, let's go ahead and label those in brown.
The x-coordinate of this first point is A and the y-coordinate is F of A and the second
one with B, the x-coordinate is B and the y-coordinate is F of B. If we wanted to calculate the slope
which we always use M for slope of the secant line we know it's y2 minus y1 over x2 minus
x1 so that would be F of B minus F of A over the B minus the A. This is going to be an
important formula for us, the formula for the slope of the secant line and what's interesting
about this is as A and B get closer and closer together, let's draw another graph, as A and
B get close. Let's see if I can draw that same graph on here approximately and if we keep A at
about the same spot and so F of A is still at the same spot but if we put B right next
to it, notice it's closer now for F of B, the secant line that connects them is starting
to look like a tangent line that only touches in one spot.
In other words as A and B get closer together we get closer to the tangent line. This is
the big idea that we're going to go after today is can we get A and B close enough together
so that we can estimate what is the tangent line. Let's try it though with some numbers
in there to make things a little clearer. So let's do number four, we're going to do an
example here, we're going to estimate the slope and equation while we're at it of the
tangent line to the function F of X equals 2X squared minus 3 at the point 2,5. Now the
idea here is we want to estimate what it is using a different X and Y point where we're
going to try and get closer and closer and closer to our actual point of 2. So we know
at 2 the Y coordinates 5 so we'll start kind of close to 2, maybe we'll start at 2.1, then
we'll get a little closer 2.01, then we'll get a little closer 2.001 and then finally
a little bit closer 2.0001. And we're going to see what Y equals at each of these points.
We know at 2 it's going to hit 5 but what's it going to hit as we get close to 2 as we
pull B closer and closer to our A. Fortunately this is going to be really easy to do on our
calculators. So if we turn our calculators on and hit the Y equals button we can type
in our function in Y equals and our function is 2X squared minus 3. Then what we're going
to do is if we hit the second button and then right above graph we see in blue it says table
and we should be able to delete these values out of here. If you cannot delete the values
out of your table first hit second and then above window you see it says table set and
we're going to change the independent variable the X to ask so that we can pick what we want
that X to be equal to. Now go back to second table and now we can enter in our values we
want for X. The first value we want is 2.1, the second value is 2.01, the third value
is 2.001, and the third value is 2.001. And we start to see we get these values for Y.
Let's record them in our Y column here that's 5.82, the next one was 5.0802, the next one
was 5.008, and then finally it was 5.008. So now what we really end up with is a third
column let me label it in black here X comma Y is going to be our third column these are
going to be our points that we're going to compare to the original point of 2.5. So X
comma Y is 2.1 comma 5.82, then we had 2.01 comma 5.008, then we had 2.001 comma 5.008,
and then finally 2.001 comma 5.008. We're going to use these points and the original
point the 2 comma 5 to calculate a whole bunch of slopes of the secant line. And again we're
going to use the calculator to help us out with that to make some of these calculations
easier. If we hit second quit it'll take us back to the home screen quit is right above
the mode button. And then we're just going to type in our slope formula where the numerator
and denominator need to be in parentheses. So the Y2 we calculated from the first point
was 5.82 minus the Y1 was 5 because we always go back to the original point divided by the
X1 from the point we found the 2.1, oops need to put it in parentheses, 2.1 minus the 2
close the parentheses and when we hit enter we find our slope right now is 8.2. So let's
go ahead and record that our slope right now is 8.2. But then we're going to move a little
bit closer. Now we're going to use our second point which is the 2.01 comma 5.0802. Again
Y2 minus Y1 so 5.0802 minus the Y from our original point of 5 divided by the 2.01 minus
the 2. Again remember numerator and denominator in parentheses. And now we have a slope of
8.02. Let's try our third point. Our third point was 5.008 minus the 5 divided by the
2.001 minus the 2 and now we're going to get this nice pretty 8. Our slope right now is
8. In fact when we do it again for the third point we're going to get the exact same thing
because we are so close the difference is going to be minuscule 5.0008 minus the 5 divided
by the 2.0001 minus the 2 and again we get 8 for the slope. So we can use this fact to
estimate the slope of the tangent line now. We see the slope of the secant line is getting
closer and closer to 8.0 so the slope of the tangent line is probably that 8.0 that we're
getting closer and closer to. So if it is 8.0 then we're ready to actually calculate
the equation at that point and going back to our algebra days a good equation to remember
that the equation of the line is equal to y equals m times x minus x1 plus y1 where x1
and y1 are a point we know that's on the line and m is the slope. This is a good equation
to commit to memory because we are going to use this equation a lot in this course. So
for our purposes we've got y equals m the slope of the tangent line we just found out
was 8 times x minus x1 going back to our original point the x coordinate was 2 plus the y coordinate
of 5 the equation of our tangent line 2x squared minus 3 at 2 5 is this guy y equals 8 times
x minus 2 plus 5. We can use this concept in physics to look at what's called the average
velocity and the instantaneous velocity. Velocity is really talking about speed so
if we're talking about the average velocity or the average speed
speed doesn't really have direction and velocity does have direction it's only real different.
The average velocity of an object can be found by the velocity average is equal to the function
at the first point at the initial point of time minus the function at the final point
of time all over the difference in the times. Really you'll notice that this equation while
I mark it as an important equation that we need to know for our course it really is the
same equation as the secant that we've already worked with. Then if that's the average velocity
over an amount of time we can find the instantaneous velocity or how fast the object is moving at
a specific point in time instead of an average over a range it is found by making t2 closer to t1.
In other words the same idea we did before if we try closer and closer and closer numbers
we'll get closer and closer to the actual instantaneous velocity which is the slope of
a tangent line. Let's try an example problem where we can see that actually done. Let's
say an object is dropped from the top of a 144 foot cliff and it will land three seconds
later. We can actually find the function for its height. Its height is given by the function
f of x equals negative actually let's not do f of x let's make it more descriptive we're
doing height so let's say height of t or height of time is equal to negative 16 t squared plus 144.
We're going to find the average velocity between two seconds and 2.01 seconds and between 1.90
seconds and 2 seconds so the average velocity just after 2 seconds and the average velocity
just before 2 seconds and see what we can learn about that. So first for the first point I'll
do this first point in blue the average velocity we need to know what the height is at those
two points so we'll say h of 2 and I'm just going to plug this into our calculator negative 16 times
2 squared plus 144 when I do that on the calculator we get 80 so the height that 2 is 80 and the
height just afterwards at 2.01 again if I plug that into my calculator negative 16 times 2.01
squared plus 144 that's going to equal 79.3584 79.35 let's just round it to 8 so the average
velocity then is going to be the slope between these two points so the average velocity is equal
to y2 which is 80 minus y1 79.358 over the difference in the x's 2 minus 2.01 the average
velocity here is negative 64.2 feet per second so just after 2 seconds the object is moving
at 64.2 feet per second it's negative because it's going down let's see what's happening
just before we'll do this in green off to the right here so we keep these separate so we
need to know what the height is at 1.99 and what the height is at 2 fortunately we already
calculated the height at 2 that's 80 if we put the 1.99 in our calculator we'll end up
with approximately 80.638 so to find the average velocity here we'll take the subtract the
y's divided by subtracting the x's so 80.638 minus 80 divided by 1.99 minus 2 and when
we do this we find out the average velocity just before 2 seconds is negative 63.8 feet
per second and what you'll notice is both of these are really close 0.2 away of each
side of the negative 64 so we can actually find out or estimate the instantaneous velocity
to be somewhere in the middle of these two guys so between 64.2 and 63.8 it's probably
at 2 seconds at that exact moment in time moving approximately negative 64 feet per
second that would be the tangent line or the instantaneous velocity so with this preview
so far we've answered really the first two questions we've been looking at what is the
slope or the tangent and then also what is that secant line getting close to let's take
a look at a little preview of the third question of calculus we won't spend much time on this
because it's really a second quarter calculus question but the question is what is the area
here's what that looks like in calculus going back to part C addressing the area problem
we are going to consider actually let's make this number one consider the area under y equals
x minus 3 squared plus 1 between the x values of 0 to 3 we're going to need a really tall
graph for this that shouldn't be too bad we've got plenty of space here so we know x squared
is the parabola shape the minus 3 moves it to the right 3 the plus 1 moves it up one
so the graph is going to look something like this and it wants the area between 0 and 3
so between 0 and 3 what we're really doing is saying what is the area that fills in underneath
the graph what we want is the area shaded in green here is how much area is underneath
the graph so we can estimate it and the way we're going to estimate it is we're going
to say hey it's really easy to find the area of a rectangle so we can use rectangles where
the right corner of the rectangle actually touches the graph that we're talking about
so let me see if I can recreate the graph here
so it hits at 9, 3, 1
is that right?
so here's our graph roughly drawn and what we're going to do is we're going to take
each point and make it into a rectangle where the right corner of the rectangle touches the
graph so each rectangle is one wide and the first rectangle is one high the second rectangle
you see is too high and the third rectangle I think it's 5 high yeah it's 5 high so we
could say that the area under here is 5 plus 2 plus 1 or the area is approximately 8 when
we use rectangles on the right side where the right corner hits the graph but we could
also do it the other way because the problem here is we end up a little bit short let's
use just some gray space for the short notice we miss this gray triangle and another gray
triangle and another gray triangle we're short because we went to the right so to avoid being
short we could draw rectangles that the left corner touches the graph and see how that
compares so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 1 2 3 4 5 putting our key points on here of 3 1
over 1 and up 1 over 1 and up 1 2 3 and then finally the 9 so if I wanted to draw rectangles
were the right corner or the left corner touch the graph we would start at the top point
and say okay come out from the left corner and there is my first rectangle then come
out from the left corner go over 1 unit and there's your next and come out from the left
and there's our next rectangle and so we end up with 3 rectangles again and we can find
the area of those rectangles the first rectangle on the left has a height of 10 actually let's
put whoops let's put a wrong color let's put the heights on the right here the height
of 10 the second rectangle is a height of 1 2 3 4 5 and the third rectangle has a height
of 2 so when we add those together the area that we end up with is going to be 10 plus
5 plus 2 the area comes out to be approximately 17 but again we've got a problem because now
instead of having too little area we end up with too much area we've kind of got this
area that I'm going to color in in gray that sticks up above the graph so the first time
we were too low the second time we're too high how are we going to estimate what the actual
value is well we could estimate since we're just estimating the actual area is in the
middle of these two values so we could just average the 8 and 17 8 plus 17 divided by
2 when we do that we get a 12.5 so we're going to say our final estimate is that the area
underneath y equals x minus 3 squared plus 1 between 0 and 3 we're going to estimate
that it's about 12.5 well as you might expect this process is not perfect because actually
the actual area is 12 exactly so we got an extra 0.5 out of it but that's not a bad estimate
for just kind of drawing rectangles and estimating and making a guess at it now in calc 2 we'll
talk about some methods to find that exact area of 12 but for now I just want to kind
of expose you this is this whole lesson today is just a preview of calculus just expose you
to the idea of the three questions that we're going to be addressing in calculus what is
it getting close to we call that a limit we're going to focus on that in chapter 2 what is
the slope we call that the derivative and we'll focus on finding that in chapter 3 and
then finally what is the area we call that the integral and we're going to find that
in calc 2 so hope you enjoyed this preview of calculus take a look at the practice problems
in the book and I'll look forward to seeing you in class as we dive into our study of
calculus we need to answer the first foundational question of what is a limit so we're going
to answer that question kind of broadly today and then a little bit later we'll answer it
more precisely so we're going to kind of say the intuitive definition of a limit so the
general idea that we're going for when we say a limit we're saying what value what should
be there even if it is not there
what should be in the function even if it's not actually in the function at that point
and symbolically how we'll represent that is we will say that the limit as x approaches
some number of f of x equals l or the limit so again mathematically or in words what those
symbols up above there mean is that as x gets closer to a the f of x gets closer to l so
we're trying to figure out what is the function approaching what is it getting closer to as
our x gets closer to some value of a so there's two main ways that we're going to do this
the first way that we can find a limit is what we're going to call the table method
where we basically take that definition that says as x gets closer to a well let's try
and get closer to a we're going to try values closer and closer to a or to that number that
x is supposed to get close to so what I mean by that is we are going to find the limit as
x approaches two of x squared minus four over x minus two now if I were to just try and find
what two actually equals in this function you'll notice it's going to end up being undefined
there's actually nothing at two but we're not interested in what's actually happening at two
we're interested in what should be at two even if it's not at two so to set this up we're going
to make a table where we're going to take various values of x that are going to get closer and
closer to two and we're going to see how that compares to f of x or our function so we'll start
maybe at one point nine that's a little shy of two and then we'll get closer one point nine nine
and then a little closer one point nine nine nine and even closer one point nine nine nine we're
going to get really close to two and see what happens to f now an important part of a limit is
it has to work on both sides so we can't just do values a little bit smaller than two we need
to pick values for x and calculate f of x that are a little bit bigger than two so we might start
with two point one go a little bit closer two point oh one a little bit closer two point oh
oh one now fortunately our calculators table settings are going to make these calculations
quite nice for us so if we turn on our calculator and go into the y equals function i can hit clear
to delete anything that might be in there already and the function we're working with is x squared
minus four over x minus two now to preserve the order of operations i need to put in parentheses
the numerator and denominator so x squared minus four close the parentheses divided by open a parentheses
x minus two and close the parentheses and now we'll go to our table by hitting second table
and there's values in here from a previous problem we don't need so i'm going to delete
those all out our x is here go start at one point nine enter then we've got one point nine nine
whoops too many nines enter then three nines one point nine nine nine and then finally one point
nine nine nine nine four nines
there we go and what we see is we get three point nine three point nine nine three point
nine and nine so let's record these so first we start with three point nine then f of x becomes
three point nine nine then it became three point nine nine nine nine then it became three point
nine nine nine nine you can kind of see that's getting closer and closer to a very clear number
but to check it we have to go on the other side so let's delete out what's in the table here
and let's check these other values the two point one the two point oh one
the two point oh oh one whoops too many zeros again and then the two point oh oh one
and we kind of see the same pattern here it won't always be a clear pattern like this but this one's
kind of nice so we can record our f of x became four point one four point oh one four point oh
oh one and then finally four point oh oh one and what we see is from the left side these numbers
are getting closer to four growing and growing and growing to four from the right side these values
are also getting closer and closer shrinking and shrinking down to four as we shrink and shrink
down to two and so what we can say then is that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus
four over x minus two seems to be from this table equal to four now this doesn't mean that x squared
minus four over x minus two is equal to four when x is two because it's undefined at that point
there's nothing there the limit is just what should be there even if it's not so we'd say
four probably should be in there but it's not as we get really close to two we're getting
really close to four let's try another example
the table method's really nice when it works but it doesn't always work as beautifully as we
would hope we're going to find the limit as x approaches zero of the cosine of one over x
and again just like before we're going to take some values for x that are a little bit smaller
it's a little bit smaller than zero might be negative point one negative point oh one negative
point oh one negative point oh oh one and we're going to find what f of x equals
and then we'll try some values for x that are just to the right of zero point one point oh one
point oh oh one and point oh oh one getting closer and closer to zero from each side
again we're going to have our calculator do the dirty work for us but we need to change the function
so we'll clear out the old function starting with our function is cosine of one over x close the
parentheses now something to check if i hit the mode button which is right next to second i should
see that radians is highlighted we will always be in radians in this course so make sure the radians
is highlighted so we've got the cosine of one over x and then when we go to our table hit second
table i've got to delete out the old values and for the first column we've got negative point one
negative point oh one then we've got negative point oh oh one whoops got an extra zero negative
point oh oh one and finally negative point oh oh oh one and this guy seems quite all over the board
what you see is f of x begins by equally negative point eight three nine one then it was positive
point eight six two three then it was positive point five six two three eight then it was negative
again at point nine five two two let's try delete these out let's try the other side see what patterns
we see on the other side point one point oh one point oh oh one and point oh oh oh one we get
actually the exact same numbers with the exact same randomness f of x seems to be negative point eight
three nine one point eight six two three two and then point five six two three eight
and then finally negative point nine five two two now in the first example coming from the left we
started approaching a number and coming from the right we started approaching a number but this time
we don't seem to be doing that we are not approaching any one value
which actually if we were to graph this function using a graphing calculator or maybe a great
website is desmos where you can graph it this graph kind of goes up and down and then it starts
to become really crazy as it gets next to zero and then it just becomes really crazy
so it's really hard to see what's happening
because it's going crazy it's not approaching any one value so in this case when our table
method fails we say the limit as x equals zero actually let's do this in red
we will say the limit as x equals zero or x approaches zero of cosine of one over x
equals dne which is going to be an abbreviation for does not exist
because it's not approaching any one value it's kind of going all over the place
we're going to say this limit does not exist
so our first strategy for finding the limit is what's called the table method we take values
that are closer and closer to the number we want and see what the function is getting closer and
closer to on both the left and right side the second method is what's called the graph method
where we can actually look at the graph and see what y value
is the graph approaching
so let's draw a graph here that we can play with
so
and let's see we're going to put a vertical asymptote here at two
I'm going to put a point at negative one comma three
I'm going to put a hole at one comma two but I'm also going to put a point at one comma negative one
I'm also going to put a point at two comma one
and then an open point at two comma negative one
I'm going to bring the graph down from that two comma negative one
starting at the asymptote I'm going to come up from the asymptote
and then kind of go through my points
all right so we got this funky looking graph a lot of weird things happening but that's okay
the first question we're going to attempt to answer is to see if we can find the limit as x
approaches negative one of this function
so as x approaches negative one what we see is the graph is really approaching a y value
of three so we will say the limit as x approaches negative one on this graph is three
what's the limit as x approaches positive one of this graph
now it's interesting to note at positive one this graph clearly is equal to negative one
because that's where the solid dot is there is an open dot on the graph which means there's a hole
that's not actually there but with limits we're interested in what actually should be there
even if it's missing and you see the graph coming in from both the left and the right are really
getting close to a height of two and so we'll say this graph is getting closer and closer to two
as we get closer and closer to one even though if I were to ask what f of one is f of one is
actually equal to negative one but it doesn't matter what the point actually is what matters
is what is the point getting closer and closer to one more let's take the limit as x approaches two
of f of x now at two this is interesting because at two from the left side let me say I can get
rid of some of this red it's kind of getting in the way
at two we see from the left side the graph is getting close to one but when we come in from
the right side it seems the graph is getting closer and closer to negative one since those are not
the same values it's not approaching the same value from both sides we have to say that this
limit does not exist because we're not approaching one value we can't say there's one value that
should be there because it's really approaching two different values which kind of sets up the idea
that if we're approaching one value on the left and one value on the right
why don't we call those two different limits and that sets up this idea of what we're going to call
a one sided limit where we have this notation of the limit as x approaches some number a and we'll
put a little negative sign like a superscript of f of x and when we see that negative sign that
negative sign means I'm only interested in coming from the left side coming from where all the
negatives are on the left side of the graph versus if I want the limit as x approaches a with a
little positive subscript that positive superscript means I only want to come from the right side
so for example
if I have a graph like this
let's say
comes down kind of like x squared up until we have a gap at one an empty hole at one
and it's going to drop down to negative two and become a straight line from there
so now I can ask what is the limit as x approaches one even though it approaches two different values
at one if I put a little negative superscript that means I'm only interested in coming in
from the left side and so when I come in from the left side we see it's approaching positive one
which is different than if I ask for the limit as x approaches one from the right side of the function
coming in from the right side of the function it's going down here to a y value of negative two
so now we can calculate the limits if we specify if we're coming from the left or the right side
notice however we still cannot say the limit as x approaches one because these are not approaching
the same value from one side it's one from the other side it's negative two it does not exist in fact it
only exists
if the left and right are the same
now if they happen to both be the same that's great then it exists but if they're not the same
then it's not going to work let's look at the idea of one-sided limits
not with the graph method but with the table method that we did at the beginning of this lecture
number two
let's make what's called a piecewise function if f of x is equal to and it's got two parts
it's equal to x minus two if x is less than one and it's equal to x squared plus one
if x is greater than or equal to one so just like before it's got one part on the left and
one part on the right we use one equation for small values of x we use another equation for
bigger values of x so we're going to use a table
to find three things the limit as x goes to one from the left of f of x
the limit as x goes to one from the right of f of x and then we're going to use that to decide if
the limit as x goes to one of f of x actually exists and if it exists what is that number
so let's start with the table on the left side
we're going to look at values of x from the left of one which means we want to be a little bit
less than one so maybe 0.9 getting closer 0.99 getting closer 0.999 and then even
closer 0.999 to see what the f of x equals
so on our calculator we'll hit y equals clear out the old equation
when we're on the left we're smaller than one so smaller than one
is going to be x minus two because x is smaller than one and we'll hit second table
to weed out the old values because they're not doing us any good
the new values are 0.9 0.99 0.999 and 0.49 9999
and what we see is essentially what we're ending up with is negative 1.1 negative 1.01
negative 1.001 and ultimately pretty much negative one when we round it off
so what that tells me then is that the limit as x approaches one from the left using numbers
slightly smaller of f of x we're approaching or getting closer to negative one
now let's look at the right side
using x values to the right slightly higher than one we might start with 1.1
1.01 1.001 and 1.001 and we're going to see what happens to f of x
the key here now is I have to go to y equals and delete out my old function or clear out my old
function because now that x is bigger than one we have to use the other equation the second
equation which is x squared plus one and when we hit second table and clear out the old values
our new values are 1.1 1.01
1.001
and 1.001
and we see a definite pattern emerging as we fill in our f of x column that was 2.21
2.0201 2.002 and 2.0002 but we see those are definitely approaching a clear number
so we can announce that the limit as x approaches one from the right of f of x using slightly bigger
numbers we're getting closer and closer to two so what does it all mean about the limit as x
approaches one of f of x overall well because the left and right are approaching different
numbers one's approaching negative one and one's approaching positive two these are not the same
so the limit does not exist purely at one
now there is another case that I want to look at of what can happen as you're trying to make your
table we're up to e now what I'm going to call infinite limits
for example
if I take the limit as x approaches three we'll go from the left this time of one over x minus three
didn't need to be in parentheses but it will be in parentheses for our calculator anyways
so we're going to look at values for x and see how our f of x compares
I said only on the left so we need a little bit smaller than three we'll start at 2.9 then we'll
try 2.99 2.999 and 2.999 to get us really really close hit y equals clear out the function one
divided by in parentheses so we don't lose our order of operations x minus three
close the parentheses and then we'll head to our table second table
clear out these numbers because we're interested in 2.9 2.99 2.999 and 2.999
and there's a clear pattern here we go from negative 10 to negative 100 to negative 1000 to negative
10000 so when we're trying to calculate the limit as x goes to three from the left of one over x
minus three we see it's not necessarily approaching any one number but it's definitely going somewhere
specifically it's getting bigger and bigger or more and more negative would be a better way to
say it so what I'm going to say is this is actually going to negative infinity because as I get closer
and closer to three I'm going to get a more and more negative number in fact a similar thing happens
if we go to the other side of the function let's take the limit as x goes to three from the right
of one over x minus three and look at various values for x and how f of x compares
from the right we need to be slightly bigger than three so we'll start at 3.1 get a little closer
3.01 closer 3.001 and closer 3.001
and let's see how this compares on our calculator
same function so I don't have to type it in again
but for my x values we're going from 3.1 to 3.01 to 3.001
whoops got an extra zero 3.001 and then finally 3.001 and we see the exact same pattern
starting to happen here we've got 10 100 1000 and 10 000 the only difference is
now the graph is not negative instead it's positive so the limit as x goes to three from
the right of one over x minus three it's getting bigger and bigger and positive so we will say it's
going to positive infinity so our limits can actually be infinite positive or negative infinity
if it truly is getting bigger and bigger or negative bigger and bigger without bound and what this
actually means about the graph this means the graph
has a vertical asymptote
at three
or x equals three would be a better way to say it
in other words if I were to sketch a graph of this guy really quick and I'll just make a small
version of it one two three at three there's going to be a vertical asymptote
and the graph is going to bend around that vertical asymptote and so you see when we're
approaching from the left it's going down to negative infinity and when we're approaching
three from the right it goes to positive infinity
before we wrap up here let's do one more problem where we just find a bunch of limits
just to practice
I'm going to draw a graph on here
we're going to go for each direction
and at negative three comma three we're going to put a point
and from that point it's going to curve up to the left
we're also at negative three two going to put an open point
then at negative one comma four
we're going to put an open point
and then at two we're going to put a vertical asymptote
so we're going to connect the open point to open point is the maximum and then come down to the
asymptote and then at three comma two we'll put another point
and kind of bring the graph down and into that point
I want to put one more point on this graph at negative one comma one
we have that open dot at negative one
the closed point means where the point actually is might not be where it's supposed to be but
that's where it actually is so I've got nine of these I want to see if we can calculate
first we're going to find the limit as x approaches negative one of f of x
now at negative one what is the graph getting close to not where the graph is actually
you'll see from the left and the right the graph is getting closer and closer to a height of four
so we say the limit at negative one is four because that's what should be there even if it's not
notice that's different than asking what is f at negative one where is f actually at negative one
and at negative one on the curve there's a hole at negative one the actual negative one point
is at a height of one how about this one the limit as x approaches negative three from the left
of f of x
well at negative three from the left we see this graph is approaching a height of three
we can compare that with the limit as x approaches negative three from the right
of f of x when we come from the right or the positive side notice it comes down a bit lower
to a height of two so the limit there is approaching two which means if i asked
what the limit as x approaches negative three of f of x is
we can see already from the left and the right we're approaching two different values they're
not the same because they're not the same this limit does not exist it must be the same to exist
how about the limit as x approaches two from the left of f of x
as we get closer from the left side to two notice this graph is going down to a vertical
asymptote because we're going down all the way this is actually equal to negative infinity it
goes down all the way to infinity before it actually gets to two because it will never touch
that vertical asymptote
similarly the limit as x approaches two from the right of f of x
looking at the right side we see the graph is going up up and up and up without bound or stopping
it's going to be equal to positive infinity
what's the limit as x approaches three of f of x
now three is right where this point is on the right side
and notice when we come in from the left or the right it's going to that same height of two
so we'll say the limit is approaching two and what you might also notice is the point
that should be there actually is there so we can also say that f of three
is also equal to two and so when the limit and the point are equal to each other that's
significant to us we say that means the graph is continuous at that point because the limit
and the point are the same but we're going to spend a whole day on continuity a little bit later
right now what's important is that you get very comfortable finding limits both from the graph
method and also from the table method so take a look at some of the assignments in the book
and i look forward to seeing you in class so that we can discuss these limits in more detail
today we're going to take a look at the question how can we evaluate limits
in our last lesson we looked at how we can use a table or a graph to evaluate a limit by getting
closer and closer to a specific value what we're going to do today is take a look at some limit
laws that we can use to help us find limits quicker and more accurately first there are two basic
limit laws the first is that the limit as x approaches a of x since x is a straight line
with no holds or gaps or any funny actions happening on the graph we can say that that
limit is going to equal whatever number we're checking on the graph
the second limit is as x approaches a of some constant
where c is just any number but there's no x's in there then that is going to always approach
that constant or c these two are our basic limit laws and important that we should be
very comfortable calculating those limits as soon as we see them so for example if i ask what is the
limit as x goes to negative four of x we should know right away that's going to equal the number
or the negative four similarly if i want to know what the limit is as x approaches seven of two
two is just a number or a constant this function is always equal to two regardless of what x is so
even at seven x is still or the function is still equal to two in addition to the basic limit laws
there are six other properties of limits or limit laws that we should be comfortable working with
we'll list all six here and then we'll look at some examples of how these limit laws can be worked
out first is the sum or difference as they both work the same
and the idea here is if we take the limit as x approaches sum number a of two parts that are
added together maybe f of x plus g of x that is actually the same as if we took the limits of
the two parts individually the limit as x approaches a of the f of x and added the limit as x approaches
a of g of x if we take the two parts individually we'll get the same result and it works for
subtraction also so i'm going to change this to plus or minus
the next limit law is what we call the constant multiplier
where we're going to take the limit as x approaches a of some constant times something with x in it
the way we can work here is that constant actually is multiplied by whatever the limit as x approaches
a of that function actually is we also have the product rule
which says if i want the limit as x approaches a of f of x times g of x two things multiplied together
we can actually take the limits of the two parts the limit as x approaches a of the first part
times the limit as x approaches a of the second part or the g of x
same idea works for a quotient
because really multiplication and division are just inverse reciprocals of each other
so limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by g of x
that is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x
divided by the limit as x approaches a of g of x
we also have what's called the power rule
the power rule says if i'm interested in finding a limit as x approaches a
of some function that is raised to some type of exponent
we can find the limit first and then raise the answer
to some exponent
and because exponents and radicals are really the same thing
we can extend this to number six what we call the radical rule
which is that the limit as x approaches a of the square root of some function
is equal to the square root of the limit
so i'm going to highlight all six of these limit laws as important limit laws that we know and
understand but this is a case as is often the case with calculus is it's more important that
we understand how to use the six rules than it is that we can actually quote the six rules from
memory because if we understand the process of what we're doing we just have to straight out
solve the problems instead of going through memorizing a whole bunch of formulas which
should not be the goal in any calculus class basically what we're saying here is that we
can take the limits of the pieces we can and we can add and subtract them we've got constant
multipliers limit pieces can be multiplied divided exponents radicals we can just take
the limits of the individual pieces maybe it's easier to explain with some examples
if we want the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three x plus four
we know from our limit laws that this added and subtracted can be broken into three pieces
we also know that the exponents and constants can be pulled outside of the limit
so what this really means we can do is we can take the limit as x approaches two of the x
and then square it minus three times the limit as x approaches two of the x and add four
actually add the limit
as x approaches two of the four now we have the two basic limit laws that says the limit of x is the
number and that the limit of a constant is equal to the constant and so if we plug that in the limit
as x approaches two of x becomes two squared minus three times the limit as x approaches two of x is
just two plus four and i can plug this into my calculator and we'll end up with two let's try
another one the limit as x approaches negative one of the square root of x plus five
again limits go through exponents radicals pluses minuses fractions so what we really can say is
this is the square root of the limit as x goes to negative one of x
plus the limit as x goes to negative one of five
and we know the limit of x is the number the limit of a constant is the constant so this is
the square root of negative one plus five which is the square root of four or also two
what you might notice here is instead of doing all the work of putting that limit through all the
pieces what we're really doing is whenever possible we're taking the number we're working with
and plugging it in to the x in summary what we're really doing is what's called direct substitution
in other words if i had an example like the limit
as x approaches one of x squared minus four over x squared plus two x plus one
what that really means is we can put the one in for the x to see what's happening around one
if i put the one in we get one squared minus four over one squared plus two times one plus one
one minus four is negative three and one plus two plus one is four and so the limit as x approaches
one is negative three fourths so in summary the easiest way we can calculate a limit
is to directly plug that number into the function however that doesn't always work
perfectly and so we've got a couple techniques to handle what we do if direct substitution
doesn't quite work so let's call this additional techniques
that we will use when substitution
does not work
so first we're going to find the limit as x approaches negative three
of x squared plus four x plus three over two x squared plus five x minus three
now what i want to notice is when we plug negative three in especially interested in
the denominator we get two times nine minus fifteen minus three which is zero so what we're
noticing is substitution divides by zero we can't divide by zero we can't have zero in the denominator
so we need an additional technique our additional technique is going to be to factor
and reduce
hopefully when we do this we'll be able to actually take the limit through direct substitution
so we're going to take the limit as x goes to negative three the numerator factors nicely x
squared is x times x three is three times one both positive gives us four x in the middle
in the denominator two x squared is two x times x three is three times one is that the right order
six and one if we do plus six and a minus one it will work
and what's really nice there is now you see that x plus three reduces out
and so we're left with the limit as x goes to negative three of x plus one over two x minus one
now direct substitution works great because no longer does our denominator equals zero
we're no longer dividing by zero instead we have negative three plus one over two times negative
three minus one which is negative two over negative seven and a negative divided by a negative is a
positive so for our final answer this limit equals two sevenths
so our first technique if we're dividing by zero we can factor and hopefully reduce out the part
that equals zero here's a second problem the limit as x goes to eight
of the square root of x plus one minus three over x minus eight
again we have the same note
if we substitute in the denominator at eight minus eight will be zero so substitution
divides by zero
we can't do that so we need another trick this time we can't factor because there's a radical
in there however there's a trick that we use with radicals if radicals are getting inconvenient
we'll get rid of the radicals by multiplying by the conjugate
this is similar what we did in precalculus and algebra when we were rationalizing the
denominator we multiplied by the conjugate this time we're going to rationalize the numerator
and see if that helps us so we'll change the sign in the middle everything else is the same
the square root of x plus one and three is the same but instead of subtracting we're going to add
in the numerator and the denominator
when we do that the numerator becomes nice limit as x goes to eight still
because these are conjugates a sum and a difference the first part is squared
and when we square a square root we just get the inside stuff x plus one
then it's always a minus and then we square the last part three squared is nine
over let's keep the denominator factored x minus eight times the square root of x plus one plus three
well that's nice because in the numerator we can simplify
and notice one minus nine is x minus eight
we still have the same denominator don't need to multiply that out
because we want to stay factored so we can divide out that x minus eight
remember if everything divides out there's still a one up there that doesn't disappear
and so now we're taking the limit as x goes to eight
of one over the square root of x plus one plus three
now we can plug our number in because the denominator no longer will equal zero
we have one over the square root plugging eight in eight plus one plus three
equals one over the square root of nine is three plus three is six
and we now know our limit is one sixth
another example
let's find the limit as x approaches three of one over x plus two
minus one over five all over x minus three
again we have the same notes the same problem
substitution means we're dividing by zero we can't divide by zero
however we've dealt with complex fractions fractions and fractions before we multiply
top and bottom by the least common denominator
which in this case is a five and an x plus two so we'll multiply by five x plus two and just
distribute it through five x plus two and the denominator also by five x plus two
when we do that the x plus two and the fives divide out
be careful with the negative it's going to have to distribute through the parentheses
don't get in trouble with that negative and get us some more whiteboard space
so now we have the limit as x goes to three of five minus x minus two
distributing the negative all the way through all over x minus three times five times x plus two
clean up by reduced by combining like terms in the numerator the limit as x goes to three
of three minus x over x minus three times five times x plus two
we've got our subtraction backwards with the three minus x and the x minus three
but that's okay because if we remember from precalc those can reduce out if there's a negative one
left behind the negative one swaps the order of the subtraction
so now we have the limit as x goes to three of negative one over five times x plus two
now we can do direct substitution because no longer are we dividing by zero so negative one
over five times three plus two which is negative one over five times five or 25
so there's three tricks here and these three tricks are going to come back again when we're
talking about derivatives so it's good to take a moment to go over what we just did
the first trick we did is we can find a limit by factoring and reducing
we also can get rid of radicals by multiplying by conjugates
and we also can get rid of complex fractions by multiplying top and bottom by the lcd
three tricks that are going to be very useful to us so that we can use that direct substitution
in order to find a limit
while we're talking about finding limits though i want to go back to the discussion we had about
the two cited limits and how we can handle those
if you remember in our previous lesson we talked about coming in from the left and coming in from
the right well for a two-sided limits the left and the right must be equal
so if we're working with a piecewise function like f of x is equal to x plus three
if x is greater than negative three and it's equal to x squared
if x is less than or equal to negative three
we need to consider at negative three what's happening on the left and the right
so first let's look at the limit as x approaches negative three from the left of f of x
from the left we're dealing with smaller values of negative three smaller values less than or equal to three is x squared
so we'll directly plug in the negative three into the x squared or negative three squared
which is nine let's compare that with the limit as x approaches negative three from the right
of f of x coming from the right we're talking about bigger values or x is greater than
negative three so that's the x plus three direct substitution negative three plus three is equal
to zero and what you'll notice is those two limits are not the same
so what does that mean about the limit as x approaches three of f of x
well we know it does not exist
let's do one more example of a two-sided limit with a piecewise function
let's look at f of x equals two x
if x is less than two and x squared if x is greater than or equal to two
so what's the limit at two well we got to come in from each side
the limit as x approaches two from the left of f of x
from the left those are the smaller values where x is less than two so let's plug in two
two times two is equal to four
looking at the other side the limit as x approaches two from the right of f of x
coming from the right means we want bigger values or when x is greater than or equal to two
so we'll plug it into x squared two squared is equal to four
this time you notice we have the same value for both the left and the right-sided limits
when we have the same value then we can say the limit as x approaches two of f of x
still does exist in fact that limit is four whatever is the same on both the left
and the right side so the important thing with piecewise functions is we have to be
equal to the same number on both sides of the function
with our limit discussion we talked a bit about infinite limits so let's look at
how we can work with infinite limits
calculating them with this whole idea of substitution
with infinite limits there are two properties that will help us calculate the infinite limits
first property is that the limit as x approaches a from the left of one over x minus a
if we're coming in from the left on this guy this function will always go to negative infinity
because all the pieces are positive it's going to go down to negative infinity
similarly as x approaches a from the right of one over x minus a
coming in from the right we're going to go up to positive infinity
these two limits are going to be the key to finding infinite limits
by hand rather than going through the table method or the graph method
let's first look at the limit as x approaches two
from the left of x plus one over x squared minus four
we can't directly plug two in because it makes it undefined so we would start the factor to see
if that helps us to see if we can remove the discontinuity
so x plus one over x squared minus four is x plus two times x minus two but the frustrating part
there is that x minus two doesn't divide out so we can't divide out the bad part
so what we'll do is we'll isolate the bad part in a separate fraction one over the bad part
this is going to give us the limit as x approaches two from the left of x plus one
over x plus two times one over x minus two
now we can do direct substitution on the good part
and for the bad part that's been isolated we're coming in from the left
and we know when we come in from the left that's going to go to a negative infinity
so let's look at each of these pieces plugging two in
we've got two plus one over two plus two times the negative infinity
well two plus one is three two plus two is four times the negative infinity
the answer here is going to be infinity but what we have to decide is we've got a positive
times a negative is going to equal a negative and so we end up with this function going out to
negative infinity
let's do that one more time where we isolate the bad part
let's come in from the other direction let's take the limit as x goes to two from the right
of the x plus one over x squared minus four
and again we start out the same as x going to two from the right by factoring
the denominator to x plus two x minus two and then isolating the bad part as a fraction one over that
and so we end up with the limit as x goes to two from the right of x plus one over x plus two
times the bad part of one over x minus two
this time we're going in from the plus or positive side that's the second property
that's now going to go to a positive infinity
so when we make our substitution step we're going to plug positive infinity
in for that second part plugging two in we have two plus one over two plus two
times positive infinity which is three fourths times positive infinity
a positive times a positive is positive
this graph's going to positive infinity from the right
I have one more limit trick that I want to look at
we call this guy the squeeze theorem
and it's particularly useful to find limits with trig properties
the idea with the squeeze theorem is if I've got some function
and I don't know what the limit is but I can find a function that goes above it
and a function that goes below it so that they all meet in the center at the same exact point
so we've got one that's always above
one that's always below
but they all meet together in the same point at that same point they will all
have the same limit if they all meet at the same point
my picture doesn't show them meeting at the same point really well but the idea is
the top one the bottom one and the middle function all converge together at that same point in the
center then they all have the same exact limit
so let me show you what this looks like let's say we want to know the limit as x goes to zero
of x squared times the cosine of x we don't have a limit rule yet that says we can just
plug the number into the cosine just into polynomials into fractions into multiplication
into radicals but not into cosine so we need to use the squeeze theorem to get at it
and how the squeeze theorem works is we're going to look particularly at the cosine
and say one thing we know about the cosine not the sine the cosine
the cosine of x has a very bounded domain it's always between a negative one and a positive one
same thing for the sine so what we want to do is manipulate this inequality
so that it looks like the entire function x squared times the cosine
well the center is just missing a multiply by x squared so if we do that on all three parts
we end up with negative x squared is less than or equal to x squared cosine x
which is less than or equal to x squared
we can take the limit of each of these parts
the limit as x goes to zero of negative x squared is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to
zero of x squared cosine x which is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared
and what's nice about this is the left and the right we can do direct substitution on
if i plug in zero we get negative zero squared which is just zero is less than or equal to
the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x which is less than or equal to
here we have a polynomial direct substitution we plug zero in zero squared is just zero
so if the limit is less than zero and greater than zero or equal to it must be equal to zero
so the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x is equal
to zero because it's been squeezed in between these other two functions that both go to zero
they all are at the same point they all have the same limit one is always below and one is always
above so that wraps up our discussion of all of the limit tricks the basic idea is direct
substitution we want to plug the number that we're take that we have for the limit
into the function and simplify we have a couple tricks we did if that doesn't work to get it
to a point that it does work but ultimately if we can plug the number in it's very easy to take
the limit
working with limits leads us directly into an important conversation around the topic of
continuity so we're going to answer the question when is a function
continuous
well in order to determine when the function is or is not continuous we need to know what
continuous means
first kind of an informal definition the idea of continuous means basically I can draw the graph
without lifting
my pencil
it's just a continuous a curve without lifting the pencil for a gap or a jump or a asymptote
it's just continuous now a more formal mathematical definition states that a continuous function
will satisfy
three conditions
for all points and we'll call those points a
the first condition is that f of a is defined
so the function can't be undefined at the given point
in addition we need the limit as x approaches a of f of x to exist
so for example if the function is approaching two different numbers from two different sides
the limit does not exist but the all important one that we probably go to to check the most
for continuity is that the limit as x approaches a of f of x is actually equal to whatever f of a
is in other words we can do the direct substitution to calculate the limit because the limit
is equal to the point itself
these three definitions and specifically this last one being the most important
are what makes a function continuous
so what does it mean to be discontinuous or not a continuous function
well there are actually three types of discontinuity which means not continuous
the first type of discontinuity is what we call a removable discontinuity
and here's what a removable discontinuity looks like it's something like f of x
equals x squared plus x minus 12 over x minus three
notice if we tried to calculate f of three or just directly substitute the three n
we would get three squared plus three minus 12 which is zero divided by the important part
three minus three is zero and we can't divide by zero
so f of x or f of a f of three is undefined
however if i took my function and i factored it
we'd get what four and three it's plus four and minus three
over x minus three we can then divide out the x minus three
and we've removed the discontinuity or the problem now because we've been able to remove
the discontinuity we could calculate the limit so this is a removable discontinuity because we
were able to algebraically remove the part that was discontinuous
now the way this looks on a graph and we'll go ahead and just graph this same function
not to scale here so we'll come up and call this four here
but the idea is this graph is going to go through four and it's going to have a hole
that's been removed right at three that it goes around we can't
graph this without lifting our pencil because we have to lift our pencil at the hole in the graph
so we could say that the hole in the graph
is removable it is a removable discontinuity the first type of discontinuity
the second type of discontinuity that we're going to look at
is called an infinite discontinuity and the example we're going to use here is f of x
is equal to x minus three over x plus one
we would end up with a vertical asymptote at one
and there's actually also a horizontal asymptote at one so this graph looks like this
no it doesn't
it looks like this
but specifically what we find is the infinite discontinuity
so that is our second type of discontinuity
the third type of discontinuity is what we call a jump discontinuity
and it does exactly what you expect the graph to do it jumps
so if we have f of x equals the piecewise function x squared minus one
for x less than one and x plus one for x greater than or equal to one
what we're going to find is
the limit again is not going to exist because if we take the limit as x goes to one
from the left or smaller values we use the first equation so we'll directly substitute one into
x squared minus one and we get one squared minus one which is zero
and we compare that to the limit coming in from the right of one
well coming in from the right we want the bigger values so we'll plug it into x plus one
or one plus one which is two and because these are not the same
we have a jump in the graph
and the limit as x approaches one again does not exist
what does this look like as a graph just like you'd expect it to
that's x squared minus one
so it's going to come oops different color the graph's going to come down
and then we've got a jump at one
and then it turns into the line but specifically what we're interested in is the graph jumps
so again the whole idea of discontinuity versus continuity is can you draw the graph
without lifting your pencil specifically does the function at a equal to limit as x approaches
a kind of a corollary that comes out of this idea of continuity
is this idea of what we call the intermediate
value theorem
which is often abbreviated with the first letters i v t intermediate value theorem
and what the intermediate value theorem says is that if a function f of x is continuous
if the function always equals its limit on some interval from a to b
and there's another number z that's between
f of a
and f of b
then there exists
another number we'll call it c that is in a b
such that
f of c will equal that z
okay that definition is really weird let's draw a picture that really illustrates what this means
i've got a graph we're going to go from a to c a to b sorry
so the graph goes from a to b say a is down low b is up high
and it might do something interesting and crazy but it's continuous so i can draw it without lifting
my pencil and go all the way from a to b well a hits at f of a and b hits up on top at f of b
the idea of the intermediate value theorem is i can pick any z that is between f of a and f of b
any z i want and wherever i pick that z
there is a guarantee that there will be a solution
some c that will get me that solution
in fact there could be more than one solution if i pick a z kind of down towards the center you
see there's three solutions in there but there's always at least one solution for any z that's
in the middle of those basically we're going to hit every single value all the way up from f of
a to f of b because there's no other way to connect the dots
now there's a couple cautions
about what this theorem actually says so before we get to an example of how to use it
i want to make sure we clearly understand what this is actually saying first the definition
started out that if f is continuous this does not work
if f is not continuous
but it could
but
we just don't have the guarantee that we get from continuity so drawing a picture of what i mean
by that here we've got a here we've got b
so there's a point at a and there's a point at b
so we've got f of b and f of a the intermediate value theorem says that i can pick any z
in between f of a and f of b as long as it's continuous
but if this function just kind of goes like this and then there's a jump discontinuity
and it goes like that
notice if i pick a z right in the middle of that jump discontinuity i do not get a solution
i could if i picked a z up high enough that it actually hit the graph
i could get a result but i'm not guaranteed a result because of that jump discontinuity
so it does not work if f is not continuous
the other important thing is it does not work
if z is outside of f of a and f of b
but it could
again it could work we just don't have that guarantee so again we're going to go from a to b
a's here b's here which means f of a is at the lower point where a is f of b at the higher point
and if f of a is connected somehow but my z is too low or too high
i'm not guaranteed that it's going to work that i'm going to cross the graph
it doesn't necessarily mean no though because if the graph did go up and down and really wiggle
it could go down and hit z but i don't have any guarantee that it does
so it's really important for the intermediate value theorem that z has to be between
the two y values
the one other thing this tells us this theorem only tells us
there is at least
one solution
there may or may not be more
and i kind of hinted at this with my original drawing
but again we've got a and we've got b
put a down low and b up high and the graph is going to wiggle
but specifically f of a aligns with a and f of b aligns with b
and if i pick z in the middle of this graph what you'll see is i actually get one two
three solutions so there's actually three points that work that could be our c
we are guaranteed with the intermediate value theorem that there is at least one solution for z
there could be more but we have no way of knowing if there is or is not more
so that's really what this intermediate value theorem is trying to say
is if f of x is continuous and our z is somewhere between
those y values of f of a and f of b then there exist at least one c
such that when we plug c into the function we get z for a solution
how do we use this
well here's how we use this we use this to show
that we do have solutions to functions even if we can't solve them
but
we can show that zero equals one over x plus sine x
has at least
one solution
we know this function is continuous except at zero so we're going to stay away from zero so that
we're continuous between our a and our b in order to show that it has one solution what we're going
to attempt to do a solution happens at zero it says what we're going to attempt to do is
find the point where the graph crosses zero notice before zero
the graph is negative after zero this graph is positive
zero is going to be between negative and positive
so if i can show that there is a solution that's negative
and that this guy has a solution that's positive everything between it including zero must exist
well one thing we know about sine
is where is sine positive we're going to add sine of x
well sine is the y coordinate on the unit circle so i imagine my unit circle
the y coordinate is positive
so let's make a note of what we're doing here
we are going we need to find
a negative
and positive
solution
or better than saying solution let's say output
four f of x and then zero between it must exist as an output
so on the unit circle sine sine is the y coordinate the y coordinate i notice is very
positive up here on top that's at pi over two and it's also very negative down here at the bottom
at three pi over two let's see what those give us when we plug them in
so let's find f of pi over two which is equal to one over pi over two plus the sine of pi over two
one over pi over two that's the reciprocal so we have two over pi
plus the sine of pi over two is one that's definitely positive actually if i put it in my calculator i get 1.64 or so
then the other point to try and get negative we said the most negative point for sine is at three pi over two
so let's see what that gives us
one over three pi over two plus the sine of three pi over two
is equal to one of the reciprocal of three pi over two is two over three pi
plus the sine of three pi over two is negative one and sure enough that's negative 0.788
therefore by the way these three triangles these three dots in a triangle that means therefore
it's a nice shorthand for mathematicians therefore we know that all outputs
between 1.64 and negative 0.788
are possible
specifically they're possible when x is between
three pi over two and pi over two
therefore zero which is between those values
is a solution
the intermediate value theorem tells us that there has to be a result an output between 1.64
and negative 0.788
zero is between there therefore zero is a solution
that's a quick look at continuity and the intermediate value theorem
take a look at some of the problems in your book to practice this a bit
but i'll look forward to seeing you in class so we can talk about continuity a little bit more
thus far in our studies of limit we have kind of been waving our hands over the definition
of a limit and talking more generally about the definition rather than the precise definition
so that's what we're going to take a look at today the question is what is
the precise definition of a limit
so first we're going to look at the definition
and then we'll take a look at kind of the meat of this lesson which is how do we show
that a value actually is the limit of some type of function so first graphically to get an idea
of what we're going to be talking about here let's say we've got
some graph maybe it curves up like this
and we want to know what is the limit of f of x
as x approaches some number actually let's call it a not c as x approaches a of f of x
well the way we actually define the derivative is we're going to say
we're going to move from a out a little bit each direction because remember our limit we
need both sides that little tiny change that we move we call delta so we add delta and we
subtract delta to get to two more spots and the idea is if I go up to the point on the graph
what I can do is I can box in the actual point on the graph
within that range so the point on the graph in green here where a actually hits or where a should
be it might not actually be there we're going to call that l the limit and the idea is that the
deltas will box it in within some epsilon above or epsilon below the challenge that we're going
to have is to find the connection between the delta that we move left and right on the bottom
and the epsilon that we move up and down from the right and so the idea is if we zoom in and
zoom in and zoom in and get closer and closer to the actual point will continue to be boxed in
around some epsilon that box is what allows us to not actually have a point there because we
just have to be around the point basically infinitely close to the point but not actually at
the point what are we at so for every epsilon we need to be able to find a delta and this is what
gives rise to in words the precise definition for the limit we say that for all epsilon that's a
greek letter epsilon greater than zero that there exists a delta greater than zero another greek
letter such that if the absolute value of x minus a is less than delta remember a is that x
coordinate that we want to find the limit at then the absolute value we do absolute value
because we can do plus or minus the absolute value of f of x minus l is less than epsilon
in other words on the right side we're within an epsilon of the actual limit
now because mathematicians like to show off and make things more complicated than they really are
we actually can represent this entire definition symbolically
so this is a neat party trick is to just be able to write down really quick the
precise definition of a limit without writing a single word so here is symbolically the precise
definition of a limit this is a thing of beauty the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l
implies that for all epsilon greater than zero there exists a delta greater than zero such that
the absolute value of x minus a is less than delta implies that the absolute value of f of x
minus the limit is less than epsilon
so a great party trick is the precise definition of a limit i enjoy putting this on the test for
extra credit but it is quite fancy looking so what we really want to be able to do with this
definition though is actually be able to take a limit and say hey if this is the limit i can prove
it's actually the limit by identifying this relationship between epsilon and delta we call
these our epsilon delta proofs and every single proof looks identical and so to help you set up
your proofs i'm going to show you the structure of the proof that the limit as x approaches a
of f of x equals l you're going to do four steps and three of the four steps are really scripted
and the fourth one is just a little bit of algebra that's actually quite easy the first step is
you're always going to say we let epsilon be greater than zero that has to be true and that's
always the same every proof let epsilon be greater than zero then you'll say choose a delta that is
equal to something and actually we're going to find this later and i should do that in different
color because it's not actually part of the proof but usually that something is going to have the
epsilon in it because it's going to show the relationship between epsilon and delta so just
leave it blank temporarily because the next thing you do is you assume the absolute value of x minus
a is less than the delta
and then you say the absolute value of f of x minus the limit is equal to and then you do some algebra
and after some algebra you're going to ultimately say that's less than something
which is going to require you to do some more algebra
and that will ultimately equal epsilon
move that arrow so it's a little nicer maybe make it blue
so every single proof is going to look exactly the same the only place where you actually have to
do any work is in this dot dot dot and while you do that dot dot dot of algebra it's going to tell
you what you're ultimately going to put in back in step number two for that delta
and actually steps one two and three we usually throw out on one line because they are so
straightforward so let's do a couple examples i've got four examples of proofs and then you
can practice some on your own first let's do some linear examples
and just kind of as a tip if we're dealing with a linear equation like y equals mx plus b
with linear examples the delta is generally equal to epsilon divided by something and you
have to figure out what that something is so following that same structure
first we're going to prove that the limit as x approaches three a four x minus seven equals five
notice that three is the a what x is approaching five is the limit or l
and the four minus seven four x minus seven that's the function
so here's our proof we always say let epsilon be greater than zero
choose a delta that's equal to something we'll leave that blank and then we will assume
the absolute value of x minus a a is the what the limit is approaching
is less than delta that part's really scripted the only gap is we don't know what delta equals
yet we're going to go back and fill that in in a minute now we're going to take the absolute
value of f of x minus l we let's put f of x in there actually f of x is the function
four x minus seven and then subtract the limit which is five
and now we're going to play with this and do some algebra what you might see immediately is we can
combine like terms on the seven and the five so we have the absolute value of four x minus 12
and then what we ultimately want to do is we want to find some absolute value of x minus three
so we can use what we assumed and what you might see here is all we have to do is factor out the
four and we get the absolute value of x minus three we know we know that the absolute value of
x minus three is less than delta so we're ready to do our less than statement it's less than four
times the absolute value which is less than delta
this is where we know now what we want epsilon to be or what we want delta to be because what we
ultimately want to do is when we multiply by four all that's left is epsilon so delta then is going
to be the reciprocal of what we're multiplying by the reciprocal of four is one over four so delta
is equal to epsilon over four and we stick that into the first line that might not be very clear
but it becomes clear why that's useful in the very next step because now we have four times delta is
equal to epsilon over four and now the fours divide out leaving just the epsilon and if we're able
to simplify the f of x minus l and say it is less than epsilon we have proven that this limit
is actually equal to what we said it was equal to
when we're done with a proof there's a couple ways we show that we're done in mathematics
the most common way is we write at the end qed that's latin for quite erum demonstratum that was
what we wish to show another thing i see a lot of times is people put a little box and color it in
as if to check off that it's done another thing i've seen is w to the fifth which is stands for
which was what we wanted somehow acknowledge though that you've gotten to the end of the proof
qed is really nice because it looks like you know latin and it looks smart
let's do one more linear example so that we can see kind of how another similar problem works
but every problem kind of has the same general setup for this example we're going to prove
that the limit as x goes to negative one of x squared plus four x plus three over x plus one
is equal to two and like before identifying the pieces what x is approaching that's my a
what's inside the limit that's the function and the answer that's my limit l
the first line is pretty scripted of every delta epsilon proof we let epsilon be greater than zero
we choose a delta that's equal to something leave some space we'll come back it's going to be the
reciprocal of whatever we're multiplying delta by with an epsilon in the numerator and then we
will assume the absolute value of x minus a which is negative one minus the negative ones the same
as plus one is less than delta now the next line so we do our algebra we take the absolute value
of the function which is x squared plus four x plus three over x plus one and subtract the limit of
two and hopefully after massaging it a bit we end up saying this is less than epsilon
well with rational expressions we're really comfortable with factoring to reduce so when
we factor we get x plus three times x plus one over the x plus one and we still have the minus two
at the end but this is really nice because the x plus ones divide out
which leaves us with the absolute value of x plus three minus two
and i'm going to run out of space on my next statement so let's go ahead and use the next
line and say equals the absolute value combining like terms of x plus one
and this is actually really nice because this already is the part that's less than delta
this time we don't have to factor anything out just to keep things consistent though i'm going to
factor out a one and say that's one times the absolute value because we know
that delta has to be the reciprocal of that number times epsilon well the reciprocal of one
is just one so we have epsilon over one or just epsilon delta equals epsilon
because now i know that the x plus one is less than the delta that's from my assume statement
x plus one is less than the delta and we know that the delta is equal to the epsilon which
is what we defined at the beginning and qed we have proven that this limit equals two
so with linear examples our general strategy as we work through the steps
is to make delta equal to the reciprocal of whatever is multiplied by delta
but we can also do quadratic examples pretty nicely so let's do a couple of those
quadratic examples
with quadratics what we're going to have to do is we're going to need a little bit of help to
make delta come out right and so we're going to actually give delta two options delta is
always going to be equal to the minimum of one and epsilon divided by something
we need that one to kind of set up what the divided by something is and i'll show you in
just a minute but with quadratics when you see x squared delta is going to be the minimum of one
and the reciprocal again of what's being multiplied by delta
so let's see if we can prove that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three x
is equal to negative two
again x is approaching our a value the function is what's inside the limit
and l the limit is the answer and we start filling in our proof structure
first we let epsilon be greater than zero
then we choose a delta that's going to be equal to
something we don't know yet but we know with quadratics we have to do the minimum of one and
something we don't know what the something is yet and then we will assume that the absolute
value of x minus two or our a that x is approaching is less than delta
then we go to that absolute value statement the absolute value of our function x squared minus
three x minus the limit minus the negative two means plus two and hopefully we'll work this down
and ultimately say it's less than an epsilon well with quadratics we're probably very familiar
with factoring with absolute value we just keep the absolute values around each factor
so x squared is x times x and if we do a minus two and a minus one we're completely factored
what's nice here is that we've got the x minus two that we know is less than delta
so we're going to be able to say this is less than something times delta but we need to know what to do
with the x minus one bit
this is where it's going to take a little creativeness
how we're going to get to that creativeness is we're going to play with the algebra on x minus
two is less than delta and the fact that we said delta is going to be at most one it's the minimum
of one and something else let's see we're gonna play off to the side here i'll guess i'll put it
underneath the absolute value of x minus two is less than delta but delta is no bigger than one
if the absolute value is less than a number what that really means is that the x minus two
is between negative one and positive one
we want to know what to do with the x minus one so we're going to try and change this middle stuff
to become x minus one to get x minus two to become x minus one we're going to add one
of course if we add one there we have to add one to all three parts
and when we do we get zero is less than x minus one which is less than two
now we're going to change this back to an absolute value statement that the absolute value of x minus
one is less than something and we can either say the absolute value is less than zero or less than
two we always will take the most extreme value because we want to be less than we want to keep
epsilon as small as possible so we'll take the worst case scenario and say worst case scenario
the two is more extreme so the worst case scenario the absolute value of x minus one is less than two
that is what we're going to multiply delta by because x minus two
x minus one worst case scenario is two x minus two worst case scenario is delta so at least we know
that the absolute value of x minus two times x minus one is less than two times delta
and now we know what to do with the epsilon epsilon divided by two the reciprocal of the two
because it's multiplied by delta to make the rest of the proof work we have two times delta
which is epsilon over two twos divide out and we're just left with epsilon
and we're done because we've said that the function minus the limit is less than epsilon
so we can now say we're done qed kued erum demonstrarum i'm probably pronouncing that wrong
but you don't know latin so you can't prove me wrong let's do one more quadratic because these
take a little bit more trying to manipulate that second factor in order to figure out what our
delta is going to equal so let's prove that the limit as x approaches negative one of two x squared
minus x plus one is equal to four
again identifying the pieces x is approaching our a the function is what we're taking the
limit of and the answer that is l our limit the first three statements of our proof are pretty
prescribed to us let epsilon be greater than zero we will choose a delta that's equal to
we don't know exactly what it equals yet but we do know because this is a quadratic we're
going to do the minimum of one and something the reciprocal of whatever delta is multiplied by
and then we assume the absolute value of x minus our a or what x is approaching minus negative one
means plus one is less than delta now our algebra step the function two x squared minus x plus one
minus the limit of four a little bit of cleanup the absolute value of two x squared minus x minus
three hopefully we can work with this and say it is ultimately less than epsilon well we know we
can factor it two x and x to kind of help my factoring i know i'm ultimately going to try and
get an x plus one so hopefully that x is an x plus one which means the other one's probably a minus
three and when i check that out it does work plus two minus three is the minus one nice that's what
we wanted now we have the x plus one that we like we know that's less than delta but we have to figure
out what delta is multiplied by so we need to play with the two x minus three using what we
assume so kind of off to the side in our work we assumed going back to that assumption statement
we assume that x plus one is less than delta which worst case scenario it's going to be a one
the absolute value so we remove the absolute values by saying that's between positive one
and negative one and then we want to massage this so that it looks like two x minus three
so we can figure out how extreme our situation is
i recommend doing the two x part first so we get to equal we get the two x by multiplying by two
on all three parts make sure we distribute so we get negative two is less than two x plus two
which is less than two
bias number whiteboard space
we want it to have a minus three two x minus three right now it's plus two
so to get that to be minus three we need to subtract five two minus five will be the minus
three so we subtract five from all three parts and we get negative seven is less than two x minus
three which is less than negative three changing it back to an absolute value
expression two x minus three is less than and then we pick the most extreme case
so we're always ready for a worst case scenario this time the most extreme case is on the right
side seven being more extreme than the three and positive because we're talking about absolute value
so two x minus three is less than seven that is what is being multiplied by our delta
which also tells us the reciprocal means divide by seven so our delta is epsilon
over seven so we have seven times delta which is epsilon over seven the sevens divide out and
we're just left with epsilon so we've shown that f of x minus l is less than epsilon
which qed
is what we wanted that which was to be demonstrated
so that is your general proof for
limit we're just going to work with linear examples and quadratic examples in this class
you can take more advanced classes if you really want to prove a whole bunch of delta epsilon's
but you should be very familiar with how to set up the proof always let epsilon be greater than zero
choose a delta equal to something and then assume that x minus a is less than delta
and then ultimately we play with f of x minus l that f of x minus l is less than epsilon
and if you do that you've got a perfect delta epsilon proof practice a few of these we will
see you in class where we can talk more about these proofs in more detail
chapter three is going to be all about the derivatives so to start off we really need
to know what is the derivative specifically when we're saying the derivative what we're talking
about is the slope of a tangent line to a function so the question we're going to answer is how do we
find the slope of a tangent line
and really to answer this question when we want the slope of a tangent line through a specific
point there are two methods both work equally well sometimes one is better than the other to find
the slope of a tangent line
also by way of vocabulary when we say the slope of a tangent line what we're talking about is
what is called in calculus the derivative the rate of change instantaneously at that point
so the first method we're going to look at kind of to set it up graphically
say we've got some curve going on here
and we've got some point that we want to know what is the slope what is the rate of change
of the tangent line at that point so if I go up from a we get a point on the line and that is at
f of a well to get a slope we need a second point that we can calculate it off of so we'll go off
to the right here and we'll pick some other random x which has a point on the line and some f of x
solution to that so the coordinates of that second point in red are x comma f of x and the
coordinates of the point in green are a comma f of a and the tangent line is the line that connects
those two dots actually that's a secant line but the way we make that secant line actually let's
first talk about the secant line what is the slope of the secant line well to get the slope of the
secant line it's just the slope of the slope formula that we know already y2 minus y1 and then we
divided by subtract the x's so for the slope of the secant line that's going to be f of x
minus f of a subtracting the y's divided by x minus a subtracting the x coordinates
and the way we make that secant line into a tangent line is we take x and move it closer
and closer to a we move x to a and then that line is going to become less secant and more tangent
well we know how to express that that the slope of the tangent line then is the limit as x approaches
a of that same function f of x minus f of a all over x minus a
so that is our first possible formula it's going to be an important one for us for how to find the
slope of the tangent line there is a second way that's used quite often and in fact we'll probably
use it more often overall in the course that is similar to what we just did so again
we'll make our little graph and we've got some curve going on and we'll have some a
which goes up to a point at f of a but instead of going over to some
x randomly we're going to increase what we call h so we end up with a point over here that's a
plus h and actually let me do that in red a plus h and so the a plus h gets this point up here
and so what we actually end up with is f of a plus h
so if we want the slope of the secant line that connects these two together
just like before the slope of the secant line is going to be equal to the difference in the y's
divided by the difference in the x's let's go ahead and label that this red point the x
coordinate is a plus h and the y coordinate is f of a plus h and then the green point is a comma f
of a again so for the slope subtract the y's f of a plus h minus f of a all over the x coordinates
a plus h minus a which is nice because the a is actually subtract out to zero so we really have
is f of a plus h minus f of a all over h and the way we make this slope into a or the secant line
into a tangent line is we say we want that h the amount we move over to be basically zero
so we make the h go to zero
or we say that the slope of the tangent line is equal to the limit as h goes to zero
of that function f of a plus h minus f of a all over h and that is the second way we can find
the derivative at a point and both of these functions are going to give us the same answer
but it's two ways to get at that same value and sometimes one way will be easier than another way
so what we're going to do is we're going to work through three examples where we calculate the
slope of the tangent line and also the equation of the tangent line while we're at it but we're
going to solve it both ways so we can kind of compare how the two formulas work together so
our first example that we're going to do is a polynomial first we're going to find the slope
and then we'll find the equation of the tangent line our polynomial is f of x equals x squared
minus three x and we're going to find the slope of the tangent line at x equals one
the first thing we need to know is what's the y-coordinate that we're working with
so f of one is equal to one squared minus three times one which is one minus three or negative
two so we're really working with one comma negative two as our point
so using our first formula to solve for the slope of the tangent line
we know that the slope is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x
minus a plugging in what we have then we've got the limit as x this time is going to one
of f of x which is x squared minus three x subtract the f of a which is what we just found f of one
is negative two so subtracting negative two is the same as adding two all over x minus the one
what we see here is we can't do direct substitution because if we do we divide by zero
but we worked with this problem a lot with limits in our previous unit
so we know we need to factor that numerator it's going to be x minus two times x minus one over the
x minus one and when we do that the x minus ones can divide out and now that we've removed
that discontinuity we can plug into our function the limit value of one so x minus two becomes one
minus two which means we have a slope of negative one
now i did say there were two definitions remember the second definition would be as we took the
limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h
so we have the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h remember a in this case is one so that
really means one plus h so x squared becomes one plus h squared minus three x which is one plus h
and then we subtract f of a which we've already figured out in blue up above is negative two
so minus negative two means plus two all over h
multiplying out the pieces here we've got the limit as h goes to zero
squaring it we get one plus two h plus h squared minus three minus three h plus two all over h
what's nice here is if we do the one minus three plus two one plus two is three minus three is zero
so now
we've got two or the limit as h goes to zero of two h plus h squared minus three h all over h
every single term there has an h in it that we can factor out to remove our discontinuity
h times two plus h minus three all over h i probably could have combined the two and three
one matter but ultimately those h's divide out and now we can plug in the zero for h
so we have two plus zero minus three which is negative one we get the same slope of the tangent
line the slope at one is negative one now that we know the slope we can find the equation
remember the equation is y equals m times x minus x one plus y one so plugging in the pieces
y equals the slope of negative one times x minus the x coordinate is one and the y coordinate
is negative two we have the equation of our tangent line
let's try another example where we work through both of the formulas let's do a fraction
let's say f of x is equal to three over x plus one and we want the slope of the tangent line
at x equals two well first we need to know what the y coordinate is at two so we'll find f of a
or f of two remember that's the a is equal to three over two plus one
and three over three is just equal to one so we have the point x is two y is one or a is two
and f of a is one we had two formulas to find the derivative or the slope of the tangent line at two
both of them work give you the same answer we're going to do both just so that we can see it worked
out both ways the first is the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x minus a
so for this function we're doing the limit as x approaches two this time of the function
three over x plus one minus f of a we've already found out that f of a is equal to one
all over x minus the a which is two
what we see here is we've got a complex fraction inside a limit
but we've seen this before we know we can get rid of that by multiplying by the x plus one
distributing it through on top and bottom
and when we do be careful with that negative sign
x plus ones are gone and we get the limit as x goes to two of three minus one x minus one
all over x minus two times x plus one
the limit as x goes to two of two minus x over x minus two times x plus one
and we know two minus x and x minus two can divide out as long as there's a negative one
left over because the subtraction is in the wrong order and now that we've removed that discontinuity
we can do direct substitution and plug two into the fraction so we have negative one over x which
is two plus one and this gives us negative one third for our slope the slope at two is negative one
third let's try and work that out again this time using our second definition of the derivative
at a point and that's the one where we take the limit as h goes to zero of f of a plus h
minus f of a all over h
so the limit as h goes to zero of this time we're going to take a plus h a is two because we're at
two so two plus h of three over x which is two plus h plus one
minus the f of the a we know that's one all over x or all over h
the simplifying step is going to feel almost exactly the same we need to get rid of that
denominator so we're going to multiply by two plus h plus one all the way across the numerator
and the denominator we're going to leave the denominator factored however because that's
going to reduce out the h in just a minute so first fraction we're just left with three
minus distribute the negative one through minus two minus h minus one
all over h don't forget the limit as h goes to zero all over h times two
plus h plus one and we could have combined the two and the one if we wanted to it's not going to
make much difference what's nice now though is if we do three minus two minus one that's completely
gone so why don't we do that simplifying we have the limit as h goes to zero of negative h
over h times two plus one is three plus h
and we notice those h's are gone we've removed the discontinuity and so we're able to just plug
zero in we have negative one over three plus zero which is negative one third
same answer both times so i'm feeling pretty confident going into my equation
of the tangent line here the equation is y equals my slope negative one third times x
minus the x coordinate which is two plus the y coordinate which is one the equation of the
tangent line to three over x plus one at x equals two is y equals negative one third
times x minus two plus one one more example that i want to work through using both equations
this one is going to be finding the derivative with a radical
we're going to find the derivative or the slope of the tangent line of f of x equals the square root
of x plus one at x equals three x equals eight sorry at x equals eight
so to do that we first need to know the y coordinate so f of eight is equal to the
square root of eight plus one eight plus one is nine square root is three so we're talking about the
point eight comma three we have two ways to find the derivative we're going to do both here so you
can see how they both work out the first is the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a
all over x minus a so for our problem the limit as x is going to an x coordinate of eight
of f of x which is the square root of x plus one minus f of a and we just found out that f of a f of
eight is three all over x minus a and that a value was eight
now we've worked with limits with removable discontinuities and radicals before our strategy
in the past was we get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate and so we'll do
just that we'll multiply by the square root of x plus one change it to a plus three over the square
root of x plus one plus three and that's going to remove the radical in the numerator and hopefully
set up something we can reduce so we now have the limit as x goes to eight in the numerator
conjugates will just square both of them and put minus between them when we square a square root
we're just left with the stuff x plus one always a minus between them and three squared is nine
over we've got the x minus eight times the square root of x plus one plus three
clean up a bit to combine like terms in the numerator we've got the limit as x approaches eight
of x minus eight over x minus eight times the square root of x plus one plus three
and that's nice because the x minus eights divide out
always remember when we divide out everything there's still a one in the numerator
and what's really nice is we've removed that discontinuity so we're ready to plug that eight
into x we've got one over the square root of eight plus one plus three
eight plus one is nine the square root of nine is three plus three is six we seem to be getting
a slope of one sixth at x equals eight
now just to practice the other definition as well we've got the limit as h approaches zero
of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h
i like writing it every time until you get this ingrained in your head it's an important formula
to know for the rest of this unit and beyond so we've got the limit as h goes to zero of f of a
this time a is eight so we're going to plug eight plus h into the x the square root of eight plus
h and there's a plus one minus f of a we've already calculated that to be three all over h
same strategy from here we're going to get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate
which is the square root of um let's go ahead and combine the like terms eight plus one is
nine plus h we're going to make it a plus three square root of nine plus h plus three
and when we do that let's go on to the next line we've got the limit as h goes to zero of
square the square root we get nine plus h negative three plus three is negative nine
over h times the square root of nine plus h plus three which is really nice because nine minus nine
is zero and that leaves us with the limit as h goes to zero of h over h times the square root of
nine plus h plus three reduce out the h's remembering that leaves us with one but what's
important there is we have removed our discontinuity so we're ready to plug zero in for h we've got one
over the square root of nine plus zero plus three which is one over nine plus zero is nine
the square root of nine is three plus three is six and we get the exact same slope so we are ready
to write the equation of our tangent line at eight is y equals m the slope of one sixth
times x minus the x coordinate of eight plus the y coordinate of three
y equals one sixth times x minus eight plus three and so that's how we can find the equation of
the tangent line at a point we can use one of these two formulas i believe the homework assignment
tells you which formula to use for a given problem so you get practice using both formulas
with similar types of problems but once you find the slope of the tangent line from one of those
points we just plug it into our equation formula take a look at some problems and we will see you in
class in our previous lesson we talked about how we could find the derivative at a specific point
but today we're going to extend that discussion and answer the question of how
can we calculate
the derivative
at every point
so to set this up we are going to expand our definition of the derivative to instead of
just calculating the slope of the tangent line at a specific point we're going to start to look
at the derivative as a function
and specifically that function is going to be written as f with a little mark that we call
prime f prime of x that means it's the derivative of f at x f prime of x is equal to the limit
as h goes to zero and we're going to take that second definition of a derivative and kind of
generalize it to f of x plus h minus f of x all over h and this is going to be our equation to
calculate the derivative as a function for all points x so if we can just calculate this thing
we just have to plug in the x value to get the actual derivative at any point we're interested in
so let's see if we can actually use this formula to find the derivative of let's start with f of x
equals x squared minus 4x plus 1
so to calculate the derivative f prime of x we're going to replace each of the x's with the x plus h
so x plus h it becomes x plus h squared whoops forgot the limit part don't forget the limit part
that's important limit as h goes to zero of x plus h squared minus 4 times x which is now x plus h
plus 1 and then the derivative function says subtract the entire function f of x
it's very important when you do this you put the function in parentheses because otherwise
we're going to run into a sin air we're not just subtracting the first term now we want to make
sure we subtract the entire thing that negative is gonna ultimately in our next step distribute
through that parentheses onto the entire polynomial there we'll get there in a minute but don't forget
to put the function in parentheses and it's all over h
so cleaning this up then we're going to end up with the limit as h goes to zero of
and when we square we get x squared plus 2x h plus h squared distribute the negative 4 3 we get
negative 4x minus 4h plus a 1 then distributing the negative through we get negative x squared
positive 4x and a negative 1 distributing that negative all the way through all over h
but what's nice now is this is as ugly as it gets because you'll start to see lots of things
are going to disappear we've got x squared and negative x squared those go to zero
we've got a negative 4x and a positive 4x those go to zero we've got a positive one
and a negative one those go to zero and so when we clean up we just have left the limit as h goes
to zero of 2x h plus h squared minus 4h all over h we want to remove the discontinuity at h
and it's nice because we can factor out in h so we have the limit as h goes to zero of h times 2x
plus h minus 4 all over h and now we divide out the h's we've removed the discontinuity
so we can replace h with what it's approaching zero 2x plus zero minus 4 or just 2x minus 4
is the equation for the derivative of the tangent line of x squared minus 4x plus 1
now if we wanted to know the derivative at any value we just plug in that number
if we want to know what the derivative is when x equals zero plug zero in we get negative four
if we want to know what the derivative is at 10 we plug 10 in we get 20 minus 4 which is 16
and it's really quick to calculate the derivative now that we have a function to describe it
let's try one more example
let's take f of x is equal to the square root of 2x plus 1 and see if we can calculate
her derivative so to calculate the derivative f prime of x it's equal to the limit as h approaches
zero of f of x plus h we're going to replace the x with x plus h that gives us the square root of 2
times x plus h plus 1 minus the function itself which is the square root of 2x plus 1
all over the h
well we've seen square roots before we know to get rid of them we multiply by the conjugate so we
have the square root of and i'm going to go ahead and distribute just to save us the work 2x plus 2h
plus 1 we use plus the opposite sign the square root of 2x plus 1 and do the same thing in the
denominator 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1
when we do that we have the limit as h goes to zero we square the square roots they're gone
we've got a minus in between them so we have 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus
minus between them don't forget the minus between them minus and i'm going to go
ahead and distribute that negative onto both parts make sure it goes onto both parts negative 2x
minus 1 all over h times and we'll leave this factor because we want to be able to reduce
the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1
and then things become nice for us 2x minus 2x is zero one minus one is zero and so we just have
the limit as h goes to zero of 2h over h times the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1
plus the square root of 2x plus 1
and ultimately those h's divide out and we have removed our discontinuity
now we're ready to plug in what we know h is zero so we have 2 over the square root of 2x plus 2
times zero plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1
what's nice is that 2 times zero is actually equal to zero so we have matching radicals
in the denominator 2x plus 1 times 2x plus 1
so we've got two of those so we have 2 over 2 square roots of 2x plus 1
and actually we can reduce out the 2's
which is going to leave behind a 1 so for our final function 1 over the square root of 2x plus 1
so now that we know kind of how to calculate derivatives and there'll be a lot to practice
on the assignment and in class I want to talk a little bit about how the derivative is connected
to the graph of the function we're going to see if we can sketch a graph
of a derivative
because remember the derivative describes the slope or the rate of change
of the tangent line in fact let's write that down the derivative
is the slope of the tangent line
so if the graph is increasing
if the graph is going uphill then it's got a positive slope because the slope is going uphill
in other words f prime of x has to be greater than zero
that means the graph must be going uphill somehow you see it's going uphill from left to right it's
got a positive slope if the slope or if the graph is decreasing
the graph is going downhill the tangent line will also go downhill so the slope of the tangent
line is negative in other words the derivative f prime of x is negative it's less than zero
the graph is going downhill so the graph of the tangent line is also negative showing the downhill
slope I guess we could also say the neutral statement that if the graph hits a flat point
the graph is flat
then we could say the slope is zero
in other words we would say f prime of x is equal to zero
and that could happen a couple of ways it could be going up and level out so there's your slope
zero right on top it could be going down and leveling out so your slope is zero down there on
the bottom it's completely flat or it could make a trough where it comes up levels out and comes
keeps going up or keeps going down but you notice right in the middle there the tangent
line does level out as it changes direction so what this looks like then
on a graph is for an example as if I have a function here
we'll call this f of x
and uh let's see we're going to put a point on the graph at um let's give it some height to
we'll put a point on this graph at negative three negative two
and another point at negative one comma two
then a point at two comma negative two and then we'll connect it by coming in from the top
hitting the first point and going up hitting the second point and going down and we're going
to make a trough where we level out and keep going down at the third point
let me see if I can make that a little better here down maximum level off there we go maybe
we'll call that good enough
in order to draw a graph of the derivative of this function
a graph of f prime of x what we'll do is we'll kind of make some observations about this graph
the first observation that's going to be helpful to us is identifying where the tangent line is
completely flat because at all of those points where the tangent line is flat we know the slope
is equal to zero which means we've got a zero on our graph at each of those points so the slope
is zero here at negative three at negative three there's a zero at negative one the slope is zero
and at positive two the slope is zero that's where we've got our x intercepts of zero
because the graph is describing the slope the next thing I notice is the graph starts going downhill
the slope is negative so we need to start negative on our graph until we hit that point
after that the graph starts going uphill it's increasing the slope is positive until the next
zero so we need to make sure our graph is positive till we hit the next zero notice the green line
is now all above the x-axis positive to the next zero then we're decreasing
to the next zero so we're going to be negative need to be negative to the next zero
but afterwards it's still decreasing which means after the next zero we still need to be decreasing
we still need to be negative so the graph starts negative turns positive turns negative
and then stays negative and so we've sketched approximately not exactly but pretty close
to what the derivative of this first function looks like because we know that if the graph is
increasing the derivative is positive if the graph is decreasing the derivative is negative
and if the graph is flat the derivative is zero
I have one more extension I want to put onto this lesson and it's really just more of the same
of what we saw at the beginning along with a little bit of notation
and it's this idea of what we call higher ordered derivatives
and the idea here is if we take a function and we can find its derivative which is also a function
we should be able to take its derivative to get another function and then take its derivative
to get another function and just keep taking derivatives of derivatives derivatives
of derivatives
and to set this up I want to talk a little bit about notation
and one of the challenges of calculus that came out of it calculus was developed simultaneously
by both Newton who gets all the credit and Leibniz I'm probably pronouncing his name wrong
but both of them used a different notation for how to express the derivative and so as a result
we have two different notations for how to express the derivative Newton used f of x
and his compadre used y and so when we're talking about the first derivative the derivative that we
just take Newton would just put a prime on it so we'd see f prime of x to represent the first
derivative alternatively with just the y we could call that dy dx which is the derivative of y
with respect to x what the variable is that we're working with the second derivative then
the derivative of the derivative with f of x notation we just do a double prime to show
the derivative has been taken twice however with the dy dx notation we say we take the
derivatives twice of y with respect to x twice and so we get d2y over dx2 and then we kind of
extend that to the third fourth fifth and beyond derivatives where you'll see three primes to
represent the third derivative and then it's d3y for the third derivative of y with respect to x
three times so that's kind of the notation you might see but really it just means take the same
formula for the same idea in other words the derivative of the derivative or f prime prime of x
is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f prime of x plus h minus f prime of x all over h
in fact i'm not even going to mark this as a key formula because it's the exact same derivative
formula this time we're just working with the derivative to calculate the second derivative
let's do an example where we can see that worked out
we're going to find the second derivative of 3x squared minus 4x plus 1
well in order to find the second derivative we first have to know what the first derivative is
so let's find the first derivative f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to zero
of f of x plus h we're going to replace the x's with x plus h three times x plus h squared minus
four times x plus h plus one minus the f of x which we're going to put in parentheses so we
don't forget to distribute the negative through minus 3x squared minus 4x plus one all over h
which is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of with this first part we have to square the x
plus h and then distribute a three through so i'm just going to square it off to the side
here x squared plus 2xh plus h squared and then i'll distribute the three into that so we have
3x squared plus 6xh plus 3h squared distribute the negative to get negative 4x minus 4h plus one
distribute the negative through to get negative 3x squared plus 4x minus one all over h
hopefully we can clean this up a bit 3x squared minus 3x squared is zero
negative 4x plus 4x is zero one minus one is zero and so we have the limit as h goes to zero
of 6xh plus 3h squared minus 4h all over h
and we remove that discontinuity by factoring out the h times 6x plus 3h minus 4 all over the h
the h is divide out and now we can just plug in the zero so we have 6x plus three times zero
minus four which is equal to just 6x minus four but that is just the first derivative
this problem wanted us to find the second derivative so using our new function we take the derivative
again f prime prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h we're going to
replace the x with x plus h so we have 6 times x plus h minus 4 subtract the function or subtract
the 6x minus 4 and put it all over h distributing through we get the limit as h goes to zero of 6x
plus 6h minus 4 minus 6x plus 4 distributing that negative through all over h fortunately we can
subtract some things out 6 minus 6x is zero negative 4 plus 4 is zero and so we have the limit as h goes
to zero of 6h over h which is really nice because the h is divide out and we're just left with a
single simple number six as our second derivative of 3x squared minus 4x plus one if i wanted to find
the third derivative we would just run through the formula again but ultimately with this lesson
today the important key thing is that you know the function for the derivative is the limit as h
goes to zero of f of x plus h minus f of x all over h try if you in practice this we'll take a look
at it more in class and we will see you then now that we've gotten comfortable with the definition
of the derivative the common frustration is how tedious that formula is so the question that
starts to come up is what are some derivative shortcuts so that we don't have to go through
that formula every time and you can imagine as a function becomes very complicated the derivative
function could become very tedious to work through well there's lots of derivative shortcuts we're
going to look at over the next several lessons we're going to look today at four basic shortcuts
and then after that we'll take a look at two important shortcuts that are a little bit more
involved the most basic is the constant shortcut and the idea of this constant shortcut is if we
take the derivative d dx is the alternative location notation for a derivative the derivative
of some constant or some number we're going to always get zero for our answer because if a constant
is a straight line the derivative of a straight flat line is zero so for example if i wanted to
calculate the derivative of five a constant well that's just going to be zero because five is not
changing it has a slope of zero the second basic shortcut is the power rule and this is probably
the one we will use the most and the idea is if we're taking the derivative of x raised to some
exponent when we have x raised to some exponent we'll pull that exponent out in front and then
we will reduce the exponent by one and this is probably the most used derivative shortcut
with polynomials we pull the exponent out front and then decrease the exponent by one so for
example if i wanted the derivative of x to the seventh power all i have to do is i move that
seventh power out front and then i reduce the exponent by one and we get seven x to the sixth
a third rule i'm going to call it the sum rule uh it's often called the difference rule as well
because it works with plus or minus and the idea is if i take the derivative of some function
plus or minus another function where i know the derivative of the individual pieces
all i have to do is take the derivative of the individual pieces and it's f prime plus g prime of x
so for example combining the power rule and the sum rule together should be plus or minus
if i wanted the derivative of x to the fifth minus x squared plus x plus two
we just take the derivatives of the individual pieces power rule says we move the exponent
out front and subtract one so we get five x to the fourth minus x squared bring the two out front
subtract one from the exponent we just have x plus with x that's really x to the first so
we pull the one out front and drop it by one x to the zero is just one and then the derivative of
two a constant is just zero so all that we're left with is the five x to the fourth minus two x
plus one
the final basic shortcut is the constant multiplier
which says if i'm taking the derivative of some constant times a function
we keep that constant in front and multiply it by the derivative of that inside function
and that is the fourth basic shortcut
so for example
if i wanted the derivative now of three x to the fifth minus two x to the fourth plus
five x squared minus seven x plus one let's get us a little more whiteboard space so we can put it
right underneath it the three can just be multiplied by whatever the derivative is of x to the fifth
well we know we pull that exponent out front so three times five is 15
x to the one less fourth power minus bringing the exponent out front two times four is eight
x cubed shrinking the exponent by one plus two times five is 10 x shrinking the exponent by one
minus seven times one is seven shrink the exponent by one and the x disappears and the derivative
of the constant is zero so now we have our new derivative of that polynomial
these four basic rules of differentiation will save us a lot of work and time on that derivative
formula now in fact we should be able to quite quickly find let's do this in black quite quickly
find the equation
of the tangent line
two
f of x equals four x cubed minus two x squared plus five x minus one at x equals negative one
well first we need to know what the y coordinate is that we're going to end up with
actually no first let's actually find the derivative at one so first we're going to take
the derivative f prime of x is equal to four times three is 12 x squared subtract one from the exponent
minus two times two is four x plus five and the x disappears
we want it at specifically x equals negative one so we'll do f prime of negative one which
is 12 times negative one squared minus four times negative one plus five and if we work that out
it becomes 12 plus four plus five is 21
so the slope we now know is 21 we do need to know the y coordinate
of this point when x is one what is y equal so we do need to plug the negative one into the
original function as well f of negative one is equal to four times negative one cube minus two
times negative one squared plus five times negative one minus one so our y coordinate is equal to
negative four plus two minus five minus one which gives us negative 12
so for the equation of our line y equals the slope we found out was 21 times x minus x one
minus the negative one is plus one minus 12 and our line tangent to our function
is 21 times x plus one minus 12 so those are our basic properties to help with differentiation
the next two are a little more involved and they take a bit of practice to get used to using
we'll see a lot of errors with this one particularly which is the product rule
the product rule says that the derivative of two pieces that are multiplied by each other
f of x times g of x the common error I see is people just take the derivative of both and
multiply and they say f prime times g prime that is incorrect and it does not work what we actually
do is the derivative of the first part times the second part plus the derivative of the
second part times the first part so there's two parts to it and we take the derivative of the
first part in the first part and the derivative of the second part in the second part so for example
So if I wanted to take the derivative of 3x squared minus 5x plus 1, times 2x squared
plus 4x minus 7, we've got two individual parts.
So the formula says we take the derivative of the first part.
The first part, the 3x squared, let's color code these, we'll do the first part in blue
and the second part in green, just so we can see how this works out.
So in blue, the derivative of the first part is 6x minus 5.
Then that is multiplied by the second part, 2x squared plus 4x minus 7.
Plus, then we take the derivative of the second part.
The derivative of the second part is 4x plus 4 times the second part, 3x squared minus
5x plus 1.
And this then, as ugly as it looks, is the correct answer for the derivative of that
product.
Derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first.
Let's look at one more.
Let's do the derivative of 5 over x squared plus 3 over x times 2x cubed minus 7.
Whoa, we don't really have a derivative trick for x as being in the denominator.
Actually we do.
We just need to tweak this problem a little bit and rewrite it as the derivative of, and
think about what type of exponent sticks things in the denominator.
Well, a negative exponent does that.
This is really 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the negative 1 times the 2x cubed minus
7.
So again now we're multiplying two polynomials, a first part times a second part.
And the formula says it's equal to the derivative of the first.
Subtract times negative 2 is negative 10x.
And if we subtract 1 from negative 2, the new exponent is negative 3.
Three times negative 1 is negative 3x.
Subtract 1 from the exponent and we get negative 2.
The derivative of the first times the second, 2x cubed minus 7 plus the derivative of the
second, 2 times 3 is 6x squared and the negative 7 is a constant so there's nothing there.
Times the first, 5x to the negative 1, I'm sorry 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the
negative 1.
And this then is the derivative of that product.
That is the product rule.
Similar to the product rule is what we're going to call the quotient rule and I should
probably label this as C. The quotient rule.
It's got two tweaks to make it different but it's very similar.
If I'm taking the derivative of two things that are divided, f of x divided by g of x.
Be careful this is not f prime divided by g prime, we can't just divide the derivatives.
Instead we will take the derivative of the first times the second and because this is
division we'll actually subtract the derivative of the second times the first and the big
difference here is we have to divide by the denominator squared.
It's kind of interesting we end up with the square denominator in the denominator.
So for example if I'm being asked to find the derivative of 4x squared minus 5x plus
1 over x squared minus 7, we've got a top piece and we've got a bottom piece.
Keeping track of that then we take the derivative of the first piece, 4 times 2 is 8x minus 5
times the denominator just like it is x squared minus 7.
Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator, x squared becomes 2x times the numerator which
is 4x squared minus 5x plus 1 and then in the denominator we take the old denominator x
squared minus 7 and we square it to get our final big ugly but correct derivative.
This formula takes a little bit of practice to get really comfortable with but it certainly
is much nicer than doing it with the derivative formula.
Let's do another one.
Let's take the derivative of the square root of x over 2x cubed minus 7 over x.
One thing you might notice right away is that we need to rewrite that so it's that friendly
polynomial so we can use our exponent trick.
So we're going to actually find the derivative.
Square root is really just a one half power over 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one
which is what moved that x into the denominator.
Now we have a clear numerator and denominator to use in our formula.
We take the derivative of the first one, pull the x point out front, x, subtract one from
one half.
One half minus one is negative one half times the denominator which is 2x cubed minus 7x
to the negative one, subtract and then we take the derivative of the denominator.
Two times three is six x squared, negative seven times negative one is positive seven
x to the now negative two times the first function which is x to the one half.
This is all over that denominator 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one squared.
We now have the derivative of our quotient.
Now that we have a couple derivative rules we can actually take a look at some applications
of the derivative and solve some more interesting problems and one of the most common applications
of the derivative is the relationship between the position of an object, the velocity of
that object, and that object's acceleration.
All three of these things are connected by derivatives because the derivative is the
rate of change and so the velocity describes how the position is changing.
The acceleration describes how the velocity is changing.
These three variables or functions really we can make for each of them.
The position describes where the object is at time t and we will use the function s of
t to represent the object's position at a given moment of time.
But it's moving and so to describe the speed or rate at which it's moving we have the
velocity which the velocity can be thought of as speed but speed doesn't really have
a direction, velocity does have a direction, positive generally meaning to the right, negative
generally meaning to the left, so speed with direction or the rate of change at which the
position is changing, so the change in position.
So we will use v of t to represent the velocity at a specific point in time but because it's
the change in position we say that it's the derivative of the position.
Finally we have the acceleration or how fast the velocity is changing, the change in velocity.
And we use a of t to represent the acceleration and because that's describing the change in
velocity that's the derivative of the velocity or the second derivative of the position.
So knowing that we have this relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration
all connected by the derivative we can solve problems in relationship to these three questions.
So for example if the position of an object in feet after t seconds is given by s of
t is equal to t cubed divided by 5 minus 3 over t squared, what is its velocity and
acceleration after 2 seconds.
First thing I'm going to do with this function is I'm going to change it to be a nicer polynomial
because I don't like having the, or a nicer rational expression, I don't like having the
fraction and a fraction so I'm going to write that as t to the negative 2.
So s of t is equal to t cubed over 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 power and then we can
take the derivative of this function to find the velocity function.
So the velocity at time t this is a quotient so we take the derivative of the top which
is 3 t squared times the denominator which is 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 minus the
derivative of the denominator which is negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6 t to the
negative 3 times the numerator t cubed all over the denominator 5 minus 3 t to the negative
2 squared.
I'm going to clean that up a little bit just so that we can take a second derivative of
it because we're also being asked about the acceleration.
So when we distribute through we get 3 times 5 is 15 t squared minus 9 and when we add
the exponents we get 0 t's and then minus 6 and we have 0 t's.
Once we have negative 9 minus 6 I'm going to write that as negative 15 over and I'm
going to go ahead and square this out we've got 25 minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus 9
t to the negative 4.
So we should be able to calculate the velocity after two seconds by plugging 2 into this
formula 15 times 2 squared minus 15 over 25 minus 30 times not t but 2 to the negative
2 plus 9 t which is 2 to the negative 4 power and we can plug this into our handy dandy
calculator.
Second quit to get me to the home screen.
We need a parenthesis around the numerator 15 times 2 squared minus 15 close the parenthesis
divided by parenthesis for the denominator 25 minus 30 times 2 raised to the negative
2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power and then close the parenthesis on
the denominator and my velocity at 2 seconds seems to be about 2.49 feet per second almost
two and a half feet every second this guy is going to travel.
That's the velocity but the problem is also asking for the acceleration so let's scroll
down to give us some more whiteboard space.
The acceleration then at t is going to be the derivative of the velocity so we've got
this derivative of a velocity function.
So we'll take the derivative of the numerator which is 30 t times the denominator which
is 25 minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative 4 minus the derivative of
the denominator negative 30 times negative 2 is positive 60 t to the negative 3 minus
36 t to the negative 5 times the numerator which is 15 t squared minus 15 and then that
is all over the denominator squared 25 minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative
4 all squared.
Now the problem was asking us what's the acceleration at 2 seconds so in order to get that we're
going to need to go back to our calculators I'm not going to write it out I'm just going
to put 2 in for everything all the way across here.
So we've got a numerator parenthesis 30 times 2 open a parenthesis 25 minus 30 times 2 raised
to the negative 2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power close the parenthesis
minus open a parenthesis 60 times 2 raised to the negative 3 power minus 36 times 2 raised
to the negative 5 power close the parenthesis open a parenthesis 15 times 2 squared minus
15 close the parenthesis and close the parenthesis on the numerator divided by denominator open
a parenthesis 25 minus 30 t which we know is 2 raised to the negative 2 power plus 9
times 2 raised to the negative 4 power close the parenthesis on the denominator and square
the denominator and hit enter to find out our acceleration is 2.44 feet per second squared.
So it might have been ugly to type in the calculator but it just took time it wasn't
difficult plugging 2 in for all those t's.
So that's velocity, acceleration, and position derivatives of each other but the big thing
that I want you to practice with these differentiation rules specifically focus on the product rule
and the quotient rule the sooner you master those the more advantage you will have moving
forward in our calculus class.
So take a look at those practice practice practice and we will see you in class to practice
some more.
Now that we're able to quickly calculate derivatives we're able to look at some applications of
how we can use the derivative to model some real world situations.
So our question is what are some applications of the derivative?
And the first one we've already kind of hinted at over the past couple lessons but we're
going to formalize our discussion around position which we use s of t as a function to represent
position over time, velocity where we use v of t to represent the velocity over time,
and acceleration where we use a of t to represent the acceleration at some point in time.
Now we've already discussed the fact that the velocity is the derivative of position
or more specifically v of t is equal to the s prime of t.
And we've also discussed that the acceleration is the derivative of the velocity or a of
t is equal to v prime of t or the second derivative of the position s prime of t.
But what we haven't discussed is how velocity and acceleration work together or against
each other.
For example I want to look at if the acceleration is in the same direction
as the velocity, in other words we're getting more and more push in the direction that we're
going.
If you think about the football player who's trying to get the first down on third and
inches, the players on his own team are pushing him as he accelerates in the same direction
as the push, he's going to end up going further and faster.
So the object will speed up because we're being pushed in the direction we're running
so we will run faster.
And the opposite is also true if they are in opposite directions.
Sticking with the football player analogy, you've got a football player running down
field and the defender grabs him and pulls him backwards.
It doesn't necessarily mean he's going to go backwards but he's not going to go forward
at the same speed because those forces are in opposite directions.
So because the push and the speed are in opposite directions, it or the person slows down.
So the acceleration pushes or pulls to either speed up or slow down.
The question is, are they going in the same direction?
So let's look at an example.
The position of an object, we're going to have two examples.
So let's say number three is examples and example A is going to be the position of an
object in t seconds is given by S of t equals t cubed minus three t squared minus forty
five t plus seven.
The question we want to know is when is it speeding up?
And when is it slowing down?
When are the acceleration and velocity pushing in the same direction and when are they pushing
pulling against each other in opposite directions?
Let's get us some space to work on that and we'll attempt to answer that by first finding
the function for the velocity which is the derivative of the S of t and the derivative
there is going to be three t squared minus six t minus forty five.
The acceleration then is going to be the derivative of the velocity which is going to be six
t minus six.
So we need to know when these are changing directions.
When does the velocity change directions from left to right?
When does the acceleration change from speed up to slow down or push to pull?
And so really what we need to know is when do they each cross the threshold of zero?
Because that's when they change directions from positive to negative, from push to pull,
from faster to slower.
So for each of these we're going to solve for when they equal zero.
With the velocity zero equals three t squared minus six t minus forty five and we can solve
that by first factoring out the GCF of three t squared minus two t minus fifteen and then
continuing to factor that's t minus five t plus three and so setting each factor equal
to zero t is equal to five or negative three.
Now generally we don't talk about negative times so we're going to start at zero for
all of our time references so really we don't care about the three but at five things are
probably changing at five because the velocity is changing direction at five.
Same thing with the acceleration we want to know when that changes so we'll make that
equal to zero, six t minus six, add six to both sides and six t equals six, divide by
six and t equals one so something else of note is happening at one.
So what we want to know is if I make a little timeline here, something happens at one and
something happens at five.
We're going to look at how the velocity and the acceleration are behaving in these time
ranges.
Are they specifically what we're interested in is are they positive or are they negative
because that's going to tell us if they're pushing each other or if they're pulling against
each other.
Fortunately this is really easy to do on our calculators.
What we're going to do is we're going to type in the function for the velocity in y1 and
then we'll type in the function for the acceleration in y2.
So y1 the velocity is three t squared, we don't really have a t so we're going to use
x minus six t or x minus 45 and in y2 it's six t or six x minus six.
Then we're going to go to the table settings, second table and we can delete out whatever
we were working on before and what we'll do for our x is we're going to pick an x that
falls within each range on this number line.
So first we need something between zero and one because our graph really starts at zero
and we want to know what's happening in the middle of each of these areas.
So between zero and one a good number is point five, hit enter and looking at that I see that
they're both negative.
For the first the middle column the y1 is the velocity, the next one the y2 is the acceleration
but they're both negative and that's what's important to me right now is they are negative
between zero and one.
Now let's pick something between one and five, maybe three, three falls between one and five.
Is there the first one the velocity is negative but the acceleration is positive.
So the velocity is negative but the acceleration is positive.
Finally we need something past five, maybe eight, we can pick any number past five and
when I do that I see that they are both positive.
So the velocity is positive and the acceleration is positive.
Now we're ready to kind of interpret what we've got here.
When the velocity and the acceleration are both going in the same direction, notice between
zero and one they're both negative.
That means the velocity it's going backwards and the acceleration is pushing further backwards
same direction we're going backwards at a faster and faster rate we're actually speeding
up between zero and one.
Then between one and five we see they're going in opposite directions.
The velocity is negative so we're going backwards but the acceleration is pulling it forward
so it's starting to slow down and slow down and slow down because they're pulling in opposite
directions.
Now finally the acceleration wins and gets the velocity going in the other direction
and now they're both going in the positive direction with the acceleration pushing in
the positive direction so we're going faster and faster.
So again when they're the same we're speeding up, when they're different we're slowing down.
So giving it as a range this item is speeding up between zero and one second, union five
all the way to infinity it will always speed up while it's going to slow down between one
and five.
Let's do another example where we can take a look at how the position of an object is
changing whether it's being pushed or pulled in the same direction or in the opposite direction.
So let's say the position of an object in seconds using t for seconds is given by s
of t equals x cubed minus nine x squared plus twenty four x minus three.
And so our question, our theme is when is it speeding up and slowing down.
And we can decide that by looking at the velocity function and the acceleration function and
determine when they're pushing or pulling in the same direction or opposite directions.
So the velocity that's just the derivative of the position which is three x squared minus
eighteen x plus twenty four.
The acceleration it's the derivative of the velocity so that's six x minus eighteen and
we're specifically interested when both of these are changing between positive and negative
because that's where things are going to change and they change at zero.
So zero equals three x squared minus eighteen x plus twenty four.
On the velocity we'll factor out a three x squared minus six x plus four, nope, plus
eight, sorry, twenty four divided by three is eight.
Zero equals three times x minus four times x minus two and so this time we have two solutions
x equals four and x equals two.
With the acceleration we get our other key point by making it equal to zero, six x minus
eighteen.
If we add eighteen to both sides and divide by six we get x is equal to three.
So something is probably happening at two, three, and four.
So we'll make our little number line here zero, two, three, and four and we're going
to be interested in what happens to the velocity and what happens to the acceleration.
Again we'll use our calculator to help us do this a little quicker, hit y equals and
we're going to clear out the functions that are in here, make sure you clear them out
so you don't accidentally get the previous problem in here.
The velocity was three x squared minus eighteen x, oops, x, eighteen x, there we go, plus
twenty four and the acceleration is six x minus eighteen, hit second table, delete
out the old points, and we need something between zero and two, one is between zero
and two and we've got a positive then a negative and the velocity is positive, the acceleration
is negative.
We're going in opposite directions to begin with.
Between two and three, let's try two point five.
Now they're both negative, looks like the acceleration ended up winning here.
So the velocity is negative and the acceleration is negative.
Pick something between three and four, maybe three point five.
Now notice the velocity is negative but the acceleration has changed to positive.
The velocity is still negative but the acceleration is now pulling it in the positive direction.
And finally bigger than four, we can pick any number bigger than four, I picked five,
we see they're both positive.
So now the velocity is positive and the acceleration is positive and it's going to stay that way.
All the way up to infinity.
So we see initially the velocity is positive, the acceleration is negative, they're in
opposite directions, it's going to slow down there.
Between two and three they're in the same direction, it's going to speed up.
Between three and four they're in opposite directions, slowing down, and then four on
up it's going to speed up.
So writing that as a range, we're speeding up between two and three, union from four
to infinity, and we're slowing down from zero to two, union from three to four, this particle
is actually slowing down to ultimately change directions.
So that's one application of the derivative, position, velocity, acceleration, speeding
up and slowing down.
A second application that we're going to take a look at is in business.
It's the idea of revenue, cost, profit, and what are called marginal changes.
When we say a marginal change in business, that is the change for one more.
And usually this is on the large scale.
So once I make a thousand widgets, if I make one more widget, a thousand and one widget,
is it more profitable or less profitable, more cost, less cost, making one more, how's
that going to affect my bottom line?
And that can help us make the decision if it's worth expanding or shrinking the business
at this given time.
Because we're talking about change, a marginal change, which is a very small change, we can
estimate the marginal change with the derivative.
Let's break down some of these business terms.
We've got cost, which we normally represent with c of x, and we've got marginal cost.
For marginal cost, we do mc of x for marginal cost, which is actually estimated, not actually,
but estimated by the derivative of the cost function.
We've also got revenue.
Revenue we usually use r of x for revenue, and often we have to find that because what
we actually have is some price function that needs to be multiplied by the number of things
that we sell.
So if the price is $5 and we sell $7, 5 times 7, we've made $21 in revenue.
This price function, the price per item, is often a function because the price is going
to be dependent on various variables.
So we've got the revenue, and we've also got marginal revenue, and as you might expect,
we use mr for marginal revenue of x, which can be estimated using the derivative of the
revenue.
And finally, what we're always interested in in business is the profit.
The profit is p of x, which is simply calculated by taking the revenue or the amount of money
we took in and subtracting the cost that it took to bring in that money.
And we also have a marginal profit.
Or how much more money do we make for selling one more?
The marginal profit of x, as you might expect, is equal to the derivative of the profit at
x.
So those are kind of the parts of the profit function.
Let's take a look at some examples and see if we can wrap our head around what is this
marginal profit, marginal cost, and marginal revenue.
First, the cost to develop a product is c of x is equal to 500 plus 12x.
What cost of 500, and then each one cost $12.
You want to know what is the marginal cost of the 101st item.
Now a nice way to estimate the marginal cost of x is to simply take the derivative of the
cost function.
This is really nice because the derivative of 500 plus 12x is just 12.
So we'll estimate that the 12th item will cost $12 extra, I'm sorry the 100th item
will cost $12 extra because every single one we add to it costs $12 extra.
That's probably a less exciting example, so let's try a price function.
The price function for the product, same product, is p equals 126 minus 0.16x.
You want to know what is the marginal revenue for the 101st item.
First we need to know what is the revenue expression function.
Remember revenue is always x times the price function.
The number of things we sell times the price for each one of those, so that's 126 minus
0.16x, and if I distribute to make the derivative easier, 126x minus 0.16x squared.
So then the marginal revenue of x is pretty darn close to the derivative of the revenue.
So that's 126 minus 0.32x, and we want to know the marginal revenue of the 101st item.
So we can plug 101 into this function to estimate it, 126 minus 0.32x101, and quickly typing
that in my calculator, we'll get $93.68.
Which means after I've sold 100 items, the 101st item is going to make me another $93.68.
Or so.
How accurate is that estimate?
Because remember I did say it is an estimate.
Let's find out, note the actual.
Because the derivative is just an estimate, it's going to be off by a bit, because the
tangent line touches at 100, but not necessarily at 101, it's off by a little bit.
So we could calculate the revenue at 100, how much revenue we've already made at 100.
So the revenue equation was 126 times 100 minus 0.16 times 100 squared, and plug that into
my calculator, we actually make $11,000.
The revenue at 101 is 126 times 101 minus 0.16 times 101 squared, we make $11,093.84.
And so if we want the marginal revenue, that's how much more we made for the 101st item.
We subtract these, 11,093.84 minus 11,000.
We actually get $93.84 as the actual marginal revenue.
The 101st item actually brings us at 93.84, but much quicker with the derivative, we estimated
93.68, which is pretty darn close and probably good enough for this business to make a decision
based on.
We're not going to care about less than about 15 cents, 16 cents of a difference when we're
trying to make decisions on our product, whether to expand or contract.
So that's why it's always better to use the derivative because it's quicker, it's easier,
it's clearer to understand, the actuals just take too long to calculate and really don't
make much of a difference.
So we've done cost and we've done revenue.
Let's add one more though, what's the marginal profit
for the 101st item?
Remember P of x, the profit is equal to the revenue function minus the cost function.
The revenue function, we've got it up here above on part B, it's 126x minus 0.16x squared
minus the cost function, which was given to us up here in part A, 500 plus 12x.
And that minus, because we have to subtract the whole thing, minus 500 minus 12x.
And then actually combining like terms we get negative 0.16x squared plus 114x minus 16x,
oops minus 500, keep things in the right order.
And so if we want the marginal profit, we take the derivative, the marginal profit of
x is equal to the derivative of the profit function, which is negative 0.32x plus 114.
And we want the marginal profit of the 101st item.
So plugging 101 in there, negative 0.32 times 101 plus 114.
If we were to make one more item, we would make an additional $81.68, our marginal profit.
I want to do one more application of the derivative based on where we're at right now.
And that is in population change.
Truth is anytime you see the word change, we're really dealing with a derivative in action.
Anything that changes is the derivative.
So with population change, if we use p of t to represent the population at time t, then
the derivative p prime of t is the rate of change of the population.
So for example, if I have a bacteria population that is growing according to the function,
p of t is equal to x cubed minus 18x squared plus 96x plus 20, where t is in hours, when
is the population growing and shrinking?
We want to know when it's growing and shrinking, we're talking about the derivative.
We're talking about the change.
So the change in the population, p prime of t, the derivative of that function is 3x
squared minus 36x plus 96.
And where the change happens between growth and shrinking, growth the derivative is positive
because it's going up.
Shrinking the derivative is negative, it's going down.
So it changes when the derivative is equal to 0.
So 0 equals 3x squared minus 36x plus 96, and we know we can solve this by factoring.
Factor out the GCF of 3 times x squared minus 12x plus 32.
0 equals 3 times x minus 8 and x minus 4, and x is equal to 8 and 4 hours.
So at 8 and 4 things are changing.
So if we got a timeline here, at 4 things change and at 8 things change.
What is happening with p prime of x?
What is happening to the derivative?
Are we increasing or decreasing?
Is the derivative positive or negative?
So again we'll go to our calculator, hit y equals, clear out these other formulas, and
our population is changing according to 3x squared minus 36x plus 96.
And if we hit second table we can try out a few values for time and see if this is the
derivative is positive or negative.
If it's positive it's increasing, if it's negative it's decreasing.
Between 0 and 4 we'll try 2, we see it's positive.
Between 4 and 8 we'll try 5, negative, bigger than 8, 9, it's positive.
So it goes positive, negative, positive, positive, negative, positive.
So what that means is the population is growing wherever the derivative is positive.
Between 0 and 4 hours, union, and then from 8 to infinite hours it's never going to stop
growing, and it's shrinking in between 4 and 8 hours because the derivative is negative.
So we're talking about population, business, and physics with velocity and acceleration,
a couple key applications of the derivative.
We'll talk about more as the course develops, but that's enough to get you going for now.
We will see you in class to dive into these a little bit deeper.
Up until now we've avoided really talking about trigonometric functions and the derivatives.
So today we're going to attempt to answer the question of what are the derivatives of
the trig functions, sine, cosine, tangent, and also the less used ones of cosecant, secant,
and cotangent.
To begin setting this up we're going to look at the graph of f of x equals sine x.
And you'll remember from your days of trigonometry it has a maximum of 1 and a minimum at negative
1, and then at pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, and 2 pi, things get exciting, going the other
direction, same thing, negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over 2, and negative
2 pi.
And if you remember the sine of x starts at 0, it reaches a maximum at pi over 2, back
to 0, minimum at 3 pi over 2, and back to 0, doing kind of the same exact thing in the
opposite direction when we are on the other side.
So the sine of x is this familiar graph.
If that's the sine of x, then what I want to graph next to it is see if we can graph
the derivative of the sine of x.
Using kind of the same scale we had before with pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, 2 pi, negative
pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over 2, and negative 2 pi.
And what I want to notice as we graph the derivative, f prime of x, as we graph the derivative
I want to notice first off where the derivative is 0.
Notice the derivative is 0 at negative 3 pi over 2, it's 0 at negative pi over 2, it's
0 at positive pi over 2, and it's 0 at 3 pi over 2.
And also I want to notice it starts out increasing from the negative 2 pi up to the 0.
So that means it's going to start positive down to our negative 3 pi over 2.
And it's decreasing, meaning our derivative is negative up until it reaches pi over 2.
Then we're going uphill and we're positive again up until the graph equals pi over 2,
then decreasing all the way until we equal 3 pi over 2, then increasing or positive all
the way up to 2 pi.
And so we end up with this derivative graph and what's interesting is this derivative
graph should look familiar to us.
Notice at 0 it starts at 1 and it's got the same shape as our familiar cosine of x function.
So in other words what we've discovered here is that the derivative of sine appears at
least from the graph to be the cosine of x.
Well let's take the derivative of this graph, it's a little too tall, I want to have room
for a label, and doing the same thing now, oops let's try that again, let's see if we
get something else familiar when we take the second derivative, f prime prime of x,
or the derivative of cosine to see what we end up with here.
Let's label here we've got negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over 2, and
negative 2 pi, going the other direction we have pi over 2 pi, 3 pi over 2, and 2 pi.
And again noticing where the derivative is 0 at negative 2 pi, it's 0 at negative pi,
it's 0 at 0, and it's 0 at pi, and again it's going to be 0 at 2 pi.
But this time the graph starts out decreasing, which means it has to start off negative.
So it's going to start off negative up until it reaches the negative pi.
Then between the zeros it's increasing, so the derivative has to be positive until it
reaches the zero, decreasing indicating the derivative is negative, and then increasing
indicating the derivative is positive, up until the zero.
Now what we might hope is that there's this relationship that the derivative of sine
is cosine and the derivative of cosine is sine, but that's not quite the case, because
sine starts out increasing, this one starts out decreasing.
It's actually flipped over the x-axis from the sine graph.
In other words, this red graph here is actually the graph of negative sine of x.
So really what we found is that the derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of
x, and that the derivative of the cosine of x turned out to be the negative sine of x,
at least graphically.
So can we use that information then to learn what the derivative is of the tangent of x?
Well what's nice about the tangent is we know that tangent is actually the sine of x divided
by the cosine of x.
We have that property from trig, which means really all we have to do is use the quotient
rule.
The derivative of sine, we said was cosine x times the denominator, cosine x, minus the
derivative of the denominator, the derivative of cosine is negative sine, negative, negative
makes it positive, times the numerator, which is the sine of x, all over the denominator
squared.
So what we have really is cosine squared of x plus sine squared of x, all over cosine
squared of x, but that numerator should look really familiar to us.
We should recognize from our trig days that sine squared plus cosine squared is one.
So we have one over cosine squared of x, but cosine is just the reciprocal of secant,
and so we end up with secant squared of x.
The derivative of tangent is secant squared.
Well similar to what we just did with the tangent of x and using the quotient rule,
we can work our way through all the other trig derivatives.
So similarly, we complete all the trig derivatives.
In fact the remaining three are left to a homework assignment, but here they are in
their properties.
The derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of x.
The derivative of the cosine of x is the negative sine of x.
The derivative of the tangent of x is the secant squared of x.
Those are the ones we just played with, but the other three which are left to an exercise
in the homework, the derivative of the secant of x, turns out to be the secant of x times
the tangent of x.
The derivative of the reciprocal of cosine, or I'm sorry, the derivative of the reciprocal
of sine, which is cosecant of x, is negative cosecant x, cotangent x, and the derivative
of the cotangent of x is equal to negative cosecant squared of x.
These six trig identities, at least sine and cosine you should have memorized, but ultimately
we're going to have to be able to use all six of these trig derivatives.
Six important formulas for us to learn.
And that's what we're going to focus on today.
Actually, that's all there is that's new.
We can just combine all of this with things like our product rule, our quotient rule,
our polynomial rules, and calculate a whole bunch of derivatives.
So let's see if we can use these in a couple examples.
First we're going to look at f of x equals 3x to the fourth sine of x plus 7 over x.
Now one thing you might notice is that 7 over x we can rewrite.
So let's rewrite it as 3x to the fourth sine x plus 7x to the negative one so we can use
our polynomial formulas.
And then we'll start calculating the derivative of f of x.
First thing I notice is we really have a product rule to start us off.
We've got 3x to the fourth times the sine of x.
So to do the product rule we take the derivative of the first which is 12x cubed times the
second sine of x plus the derivative of the second.
The derivative of sine is cosine x times the first and I'll just put it in front to make
it obvious that it's not inside the cosine.
And then after the product rule we still have to take care of the plus 7x to the negative
one.
7 times negative one is negative 7, x to the negative 2, and we've got our derivative.
Let's try another one that might be a little more involved.
Let's say f of x is equal to the cosine of x minus x to the fifth times the cotangent
of x plus the secant of x.
Now it should be clear here we're working with a product, two pieces multiplied together
so we have to do the product rule for f prime of x for the derivative.
So we'll take the derivative of the first term or the first factor, the derivative of
cosine x is negative sine x minus x to the fifth becomes 5x to the fourth times the second
cotangent x plus secant of x plus the derivative of the second.
The derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared of x plus the derivative of secant
is secant x tangent x, and then we have to multiply by the first part, the cosine x minus
x to the fifth.
And we've got our derivative.
One more for this video, f of x is equal to tangent of x minus 3x to the fourth over
cosecant of x minus 7.
Now we're dividing two functions.
With division we know we need to use the quotient rule, just like we always have before.
The quotient rule says we take the derivative of the top, the derivative of tangent we now
know is secant squared of x minus 3 times 4 is 12x cubed, the derivative of the top
times the bottom cosecant x minus 7 minus the derivative of the bottom.
The derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant, so a negative negative makes it positive cosecant
x cotangent x times the denominator, or I'm sorry, times the numerator, times the first
part, tangent x minus 3x to the fourth, and that's all over the denominator squared, cosecant
x minus 7 squared.
So today's video is really short because there's not a lot of new stuff to add.
All we have now is we've added the six trig derivatives, and then we kind of tie them
into all the other derivative rules that we've seen before, the quotient rule, the product
rule, the polynomial rules, and just continue to practice taking these important derivatives.
With calculus and derivatives, practice, practice, practice is the key until you can do these
derivatives in your sleep.
So go ahead and try some of these off the homework assignment.
This video is shorter to give you more time to get into the practice, and we'll dive into
these more in class.
I'll look forward to seeing you then.
Quite often when we're trying to find the derivative of a function, we find that we
actually have a composite function, or a function inside a function, and so that's the question
we're going to address today is how do we take a derivative of a composite function,
a function inside of a function?
And really the short answer to that is we use something that is called the chain rule,
which officially is written that the derivative of a function with another function inside
it is equal to the derivative of the outside function, where the inside stays the same.
Actually, I should use square brackets there, times the derivative of the inside function.
So in words, it's probably easier to remember the chain rule, is we take the derivative
of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
And that's what we're going to take a look at today.
I've got seven examples where we basically do this process over and over again.
We take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside, but this chain
rule is one that you should be very comfortable with completing, working through, in order
to take derivatives.
So let's take a look at some examples.
Where we take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
Let's say we've got a function f of x equals one over 4x minus seven cubed.
Now one thing I noticed with this to make it easier to take the derivative, we could
use the quotient rule, but that's just way too much work for what we need to do, because
we've just got a one in the numerator.
This is really 4x minus seven with a negative three exponent, because the negative exponent
makes it a reciprocal one over that.
So what we see we've actually got here is the 4x minus three as a block is all raised
to the negative three power.
If this was just x to the negative three, we know the derivative of that is negative
three x to the negative four.
So that's kind of what we're going to do here, but we're going to use the 4x minus seven
in place of that x.
So we pull the exponent out front and f prime of x is equal to negative three times the
base, the 4x minus seven, all to the negative four power.
Now the only thing we have to do is multiply by the derivative of the inside, and the derivative
of 4x minus seven is just four.
We'll clean that up a bit.
Let's see the negative three times four is negative twelve, so we've got negative twelve
times 4x minus seven to the negative four power as our final derivative.
But the idea here is we identified that we've got that 4x minus seven inside another function,
which is the x to the negative three.
So we took the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
So let's look at another one.
Let's say we had f of x equals the square root of 3x squared minus 7x plus one.
Now again, we recognize square root is really an exponent.
We've really got 3x squared minus 7x plus one to the one half power.
And so what we need to recognize here is we have a function inside of a function.
What we really have is the 3x squared minus 7x plus one, that function sitting inside
a one half power.
In other words, this is kind of the same idea as if we had x to the one half power.
We know how to take the derivative of x to the one half power.
That's one half x to the negative one half, bringing the exponent out front and then reducing
the exponent by one.
The only difference is instead of having an x, we're going to have the 3x squared minus
7x plus one.
So our derivative is we pull the exponent out front.
That's one half times the stuff, 3x squared minus 7x plus one.
And then we reduce the exponent by one, giving us negative one half.
The only thing we have to do in addition is multiply by the derivative of what's inside.
The derivative of 3x squared minus 7x plus one is 6x minus 7.
And there we have our final answer.
The only thing we might want to do is clean up a bit because we've got that negative exponent
and a fraction going on.
I'll leave the 6x minus 7 in the numerator.
The 2 is in a denominator and the 3x squared minus 7x plus one with the negative exponent
moves down.
That just cleans it up.
It's not really a needed step, but it does make it a little prettier.
But now we have our derivative.
Let's try to increase in complexity a little bit as we continue working through these problems.
Let's go to a trig problem.
What if we have f of x equals the cosine of 5x squared?
With this one, what you notice is we have got the 5x squared sitting inside of a cosine.
So we'll take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
So the derivative of cosine is, let's mark this as f prime of x equals, the derivative
of cosine is negative sine of the stuff, 5x squared.
And then we multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is 10x.
Clean this up a little bit and we'll move the 10x to the front.
So we just see negative 10x sine of 5x squared and we've got our derivative.
The derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
What about this one?
F of x equals secant squared of x.
What's the outside and what's the inside function?
Another way to think about secant squared of x is, that's really secant of x squared.
So actually our inside function is the secant of x.
The outside function is that we're squaring it.
So if we're squaring it, we know we bring, or f prime of x, we bring the exponent out
front and then reduce the exponent by 1.
And we multiply by the derivative of the inside.
The derivative of secant is secant tangent.
Just to clean this up a bit, secant times secant is secant squared.
So we have 2 secant squared x tangent x.
And we've got our derivative.
Let's try another one.
How about if we had f of x is equal to cosecant of 3x squared minus 5x.
Again we've got a function inside of a function.
Identifying what's inside is the 3x squared minus 5x.
So we'll take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside.
And the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent.
So we have f prime of x equals negative cosecant of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x cotangent
of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside.
Well the derivative of the inside using our power rule is 6x minus 5.
There's not much to clean up on this one.
The only thing we might be able to do is move the 6x minus 5 to the front so it's really
clear that that part is not part of the cotangent or cosecant.
So we have negative 6x minus 5, don't lose the parenthesis, cosecant of 3x squared minus
5, cotangent of 3x squared minus 5.
And we've found our derivative.
To make these a little more exciting we can combine different rules together to find derivatives.
Number 6 is an example of this where we have f of x equals 4x plus 5 cubed times 2x squared
minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh power.
This problem is going to combine the chain rule along with the product rule.
So we see we're working with a product, but the product is of functions within functions.
On the left side we see 4x plus 5 is inside the cube function.
On the right side we see 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 is inside the seventh power function.
So let's use our product rule along with our chain rule in order to find the derivative.
The product rule says we take the derivative of the first part times the second part.
So the derivative of the first part we bring the exponent out front 3 times 4x plus 5,
reduce the exponent by 1 so it's squared, and then we multiply by the derivative of
the inside, which is just 4.
Then that's the derivative of the first part.
We still need to multiply by the second part, 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh
power plus.
Now the product rule says we take the derivative of the second part times the first part.
The second part is a chain rule again.
We bring the 7 out front times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 now to the sixth power because
we've reduced the exponent by 1 times the derivative of the inside.
The inside has a derivative of 4x minus 6 and that part is the derivative of the second
part.
We still have to multiply by the first part, which is 4x plus 5, cubed.
From here there's just a little bit of clean up.
I'm going to multiply 3 times 4 to get 12 times 4x plus 5 squared times 2x squared minus
6x plus 1 to the seventh power.
The second part doesn't really have any clean up to do, so we'll just keep that all the
same.
7 times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 to the sixth power times 4x minus 6 times 4x plus 5 cubed.
That big ugly thing is the derivative of our function.
To get that derivative we had to combine both the chain rule and the product rule.
We knew the product rule was the derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative
of the second times the first, but in order to take those derivatives in each of those
parts we had to use the chain rule where we took the derivative of the outside times the
derivative of the inside.
We not only can combine the chain rule with other rules, we can combine the chain rule
with the chain rule.
If we've got functions inside of functions inside of functions we can just keep applying
the chain rule, taking the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside
times the derivative of what's inside that times the derivative of what's inside that
until we run out of things to take the derivative of.
For our final example, if f of x is equal to the tangent cubed of 5x squared minus 7,
what you'll see we have here, and maybe we should rewrite, remember tangent cubed means
we really have the tangent of 5x squared minus 7 to the third power.
So we've got a tangent inside of cubed, but then we've also got a 5x squared minus 7 inside
of the tangent, and those colors are overlapping making it very difficult to see, but you
get the idea.
So we're going to first take the derivative of the outside function, which is cubed.
So for the derivative of a cubed we pull the 3 outside and reduce the exponent by 1.
Now it's tangent squared of 5x squared minus 7.
Then we take the derivative of the inside, well the derivative of tangent is the secant
squared of the inside stuff, 5x squared minus 7.
But we're still not done because we can take the derivative of the inside stuff, which
is going to be the 5x squared minus 7, the derivative of that is just 10x.
Cleaning up a little bit, 3 times 10 is 30, so f prime of x is equal to 30x tangent squared
of 5x squared minus 7 times secant squared of 5x squared minus 7.
And now we've got our derivative, which required us to use the chain rule on the chain rule,
which all we do is just start peeling off layers like peeling the layers off an onion.
The derivative of the outside times the derivative of what's in that, times the derivative of
what's in that, times the derivative of what's in that until we finally reach the end.
So that's the chain rule.
The chain rule is we just keep taking derivatives and multiplying until we reach the far inside
of our function.
This video is a little bit shorter because it's going to give you time to practice this
on your own before you come to class, and then we'll dive into it a little deeper in
class and answer any questions.
I'll look forward to seeing you then so that we can work on the chain rule.
As we continue to work with derivatives, we want to continue to expand the types of functions
we can take the derivative of.
And there's another one that we've missed, and that is the inverse trig functions.
So the question we're going to answer is what are the derivatives of the inverse trig functions?
And before we can actually answer the question about what are the derivatives of the inverse
trig functions, we really have to understand how derivatives of inverses work.
And there's a nice little theorem that says that if f inverse of x is the inverse of f
of x, then the derivative of f inverse at x is simply the reciprocal of the derivative
at that inverse point.
Maybe a better way to say that that's not so mathematical is if a, b is a point on
f of x, then the slope of the tangent line is f prime of a.
We stick that x coordinate into the derivative.
We already know that though, that's just our basic definition of the slope of a tangent
line that we've been working with thus far.
So if a, b is a point on f of x, then b, a, switching the x and y coordinates is on f
inverse of x, and the slope of the tangent line is, and it turns out to be just the reciprocal
of the slope of the standard function.
So the slope of the inverse is the reciprocal of the slope of the function.
We'll say one over f prime of a, and that's probably an important slope to know, one over
the derivative at that point.
So let's take a look at how we can do some of these reciprocals of slopes or derivatives
to calculate some tangent lines on inverse functions.
So for example, we're going to find the equation of a tangent line
of the inverse of f of x equals x cubed minus 7x plus 5 at 5.
So we're going to break this down into three parts.
It's really important as we're talking about this, we keep track of our five, is that the
x coordinate or the y coordinate of the function or of the inverse, because the function and
the inverse have the same x and y coordinates, they're just switched and backwards, and it's
really easy to get those confused.
So let's take a moment to really clearly say that five is the x coordinate of the inverse.
We're finding the equation of the tangent line of the inverse at five.
So five is the x coordinate of the inverse, which means it is the y or the f of x for the
regular function.
Maybe I should say y for the f of x.
So it's the x of the inverse and it's the y for the function, which means we need to
still find the other coordinate, the x of the f of x.
So if f of x is x cubed minus 7x plus 5, and 5 is that y coordinate, this is like saying
it equals 5.
And we can solve this really quickly for x.
We'll subtract 5 from both sides to make it equal to zero.
x cubed minus 7x equals zero.
Factoring out the x from both sides, or factoring out the x of both terms, sorry, we get x squared
minus 7 equals zero.
And let's scroll down a little more here, give me some more space.
And we'll set each factor equal to zero, so x equals zero, and x squared minus 7 equals
zero.
So x is equal to plus or minus the square root of seven.
So we've got three possible values for our x coordinate to make the y coordinate 5, zero,
square root of seven, or negative square root of seven.
In fact, let's clearly state that on f of x, the point we're talking about is zero comma
five, square root of seven comma five, and negative square root of seven comma five.
We've got three points.
Which means on the inverse, we're talking about the opposites, five comma zero, five
comma square root of seven, and five comma negative square root of seven.
Keeping track of what's x, what's y on which function.
Probably the most challenging part of this section is keeping track of what is what.
All right, so next thing we're ready to do is, now that we know what our x and y coordinates
are that we're working with, we still need to find the slope of the tangent line of f
of x, because we know that the slope of the tangent line of the inverse is just the reciprocal
of this slope.
So just because it's off my screen, I'm going to write the function again, x cubed minus
seven x plus five, so that we can take the derivative at three x squared minus seven.
So we need to find the slope at each of the three points, at each of the three x coordinates
that we just found, so we're going to find f prime of zero, f prime of the square root
of seven, and f prime of negative square root of seven.
We're going to have three because we're dealing with three points.
I think the homework assignment specifies a specific range, so you're only doing one
of the points, but the process is the same, so let's take the extra practice.
Just plugging zero into the derivative, we have three times zero squared minus seven,
that's just going to equal negative seven.
Plugging square root of seven in, we've got three times the square root of seven squared
minus seven, that's three times seven, or twenty-one minus seven, that's equal to fourteen.
Really similar with the negative square root of seven, because squaring a negative is the
same as squaring a positive, so we've got three times seven, or twenty-one minus seven
is fourteen.
Now we can make the equations of the tangent line on f prime, oops not f prime, f inverse
of x.
Remember with f inverse, we have to switch coordinates, because x is y and y is x on
the inverse, we also have to do the reciprocal slopes.
For our first point, let's see if I can get the points on the screen here.
On the inverse, the first point was five comma zero, and at that point we found the slope
was equal to negative one-seventh, the reciprocal of the negative seven.
So we have y equals negative one-seventh times x minus five plus the zero, that's the equation
of the tangent line at five zero.
What if we wanted to do it at five square root of seven?
Actually let's do this in a different color, just to keep the different colors separate.
Second point was five square root of seven, there the slope is the reciprocal of fourteen,
or one over fourteen, so we have y equals one-fourteenth times x minus five plus the
square root of seven.
We had a third point, our third point was at five comma negative square root of seven,
that slope is going to be the reciprocal of fourteen, which is one over fourteen.
So for that equation, we have got y equals one-fourteenth times x minus five minus the
square root of seven.
And now we have got our three tangent lines that are tangent at an x coordinate of five
to paint on the y coordinate, because this inverse isn't actually a function, so we
probably should have restricted the domain, but it provided us the chance to practice
three times with this process of finding the slope of the tangent line to the function,
knowing the inverse is the reciprocal slope.
Let's try one more example that uses this idea before we get to trig.
How about this example?
The point four comma one is on the inverse of f of x equals x to the fifth minus three
x squared plus four squared.
Find the equation of the tangent line.
Well we know the tangent line is going to have the reciprocal slope of the function's
tangent line slope.
So let's find the function's tangent line slope, f prime of x equals, this is a chain
rule here, we'll take the derivative of the outside, which is two times x to the fifth
minus three x squared plus four times the derivative of the inside, which is five x to the fourth
minus six x.
Now remember, four one is on the inverse, so the point we want that's on the standard
function before the inverse is actually reversed, it's actually one comma four, so we want to
make our x equal to one, because we're dealing with the standard function, not its inverse.
So f prime of one is equal to two times one to the fifth minus three times one squared
plus four times five times one to the fourth minus six times one.
And maybe use a calculator to do that real quick.
One's nice because it's not going to do anything exciting when we multiply it or when we do
exponents with it.
So we've got two times one to the fifth, which is just one minus three times one squared,
which is just three plus four, close the parentheses, then we have five times one to the fourth,
which is just five minus six times one, which is just six.
And so we get this nice slope of negative four.
So if that's the slope of the function at one, the slope at the inverse, at the alternative
coordinates, the slope of the inverse that we're going for is negative one fourth, and
the point we're working with is four comma one, so we just go straight to our equation
y equals negative one fourth times x minus four plus one.
That's going to go through the point four one.
It's on the inverse of its tangent to the inverse of our function.
But the original question that we're dealing with had to do with the inverse of the trig
functions.
So we haven't touched any trig functions yet.
Let's see if we can use what we've just learned about inverses to find the derivatives of
the inverse trig functions.
To set this up, I want to consider f of x equals sine x.
If we want the inverse of sine x, we remember from our trig days, we call that just the
sine inverse of x, and it's really important to note that that negative one is not an exponent.
It's not an exponent.
That doesn't mean sine to the negative one power.
That means the inverse sine of x.
It might be called the arc sine of x.
Using what we know, then what we know about inverses is we can find the derivative of
the inverse using the derivative of the standard function.
The derivative of the standard function f prime of x, the derivative of sine, is cosine
of x.
We know that the derivative of an inverse is equal to one over the derivative of the
functions inverse.
In our case, that's going to be one over f prime, the derivative is cosine of the inverse
function, which is sine inverse of x.
If we think back to our trig days, we remember to find sine inverse of x.
We say, hey, well, we've got a triangle, the cosine of the sine inverse.
We've got a triangle.
We like to make the radius equal to one, and we want the sine inverse of x.
Sine inverse of x.
We're talking about x, so the opposite over the hypotenuse is the sine.
Opposite over the hypotenuse is x.
X over one is x, and then using the Pythagorean theorem, the other side has to be one minus
x squared, the square root of all of that.
That's our triangle for the sine inverse of x.
We want to take the cosine of that.
Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse.
The adjacent over the hypotenuse, this case, is the square root over one, which is just
the square root, and so we end up with one over the square root of one minus x squared.
One over the square root of one minus x squared, then, is the derivative of the inverse sine.
In this exact same process, we can actually find the derivative of all the inverse sine
functions, or inverse trig functions.
Similarly, we get the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.
Six inverse trig functions.
The derivative of sine inverse of x, we just found out that that was one over the square
root of one minus x squared.
Similarly, the derivative of cosine inverse of x turns out to be negative one over the
square root of one minus x squared.
The derivative of tangent inverse of x, using the same process, will be one over one plus
x squared, and then we can find the derivative of the reciprocals.
The reciprocal of sine is cosecant.
Its derivative is negative one over the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared
minus one.
The derivative of secant inverse of x is one over the absolute value of x times the square
root of x squared minus one, and the derivative of cotangent inverse of x is negative one
over one plus x squared.
You've got six more important derivatives to add to your list of derivatives.
Nice part about these is if you know your trig well enough, you should be able to derive
them all using our inverse formula that we just found.
Or you can memorize them, which comes quite naturally out of just trying a few of these
over and over again in practice.
Let's do just that.
Let's do two examples where we're finding the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.
Let's say f of x equals the cosine inverse of x squared.
We're dealing with a chain rule here.
We've got x squared inside the cosine inverse, so let's see how that comes out.
The derivative of cosine inverse is negative one over the square root of one minus x squared,
but x squared is in there, so we've got x squared squared.
x squared squared is x to the fourth, knowing that we multiply those exponents times the
derivative of the inside.
The derivative of x squared is 2x, and since that's really 2x over one, we can simplify
to get negative 2x over the square root of one minus x to the fourth.
Let's try another one.
Let's say f of x equals the square root of x times the secant inverse of x.
By this point in our study of calculus, when we see that square root of x, we should immediately
know to change that to x to the one-half power so that we can use our exponent properties.
We have x to the one-half secant inverse of x.
Let's start taking the derivative using the product rule, because we're dealing with
a product.
The derivative of the first is one-half times x to the negative one-half times the second,
which is secant inverse of x, plus the derivative of the second part.
The derivative of secant inverse is one over the absolute value of x times the square root
of x squared minus one times the first, which is x to the one-half.
Let's clean that up a little bit.
Let's go ahead and use our negative exponents.
One-half means we've got a 2 in the denominator, x to the one-half sticks the square root
of x in the denominator.
Now be careful with secant inverse.
That is not secant to the negative one power.
That is not a negative exponent.
That's an inverse trig function.
So we'll put the secant inverse of x in the numerator, plus x to the one-half, that's
really the square root of x in the numerator, absolute value of x times the square root
of x squared minus one.
Now we've got the derivative of that function.
We did a little bit of work today with inverse functions, but the big idea that I want you
to be able to pull out of this lesson is how to take the derivative of the inverse functions
using these six derivative properties.
We'll also do a little bit of work with inverses in general, but the bulk is going to be here
on the trig derivatives.
Practice a few of these.
We will see you in class to dive into them a little bit deeper.
Now that we're able to use the chain rule in order to calculate more complex derivatives,
we are actually ready to answer a deeper question about finding derivatives, and that's for
finding derivatives around functions, or not functions, but relations between x and y that
are more complex than a function.
This would include things like circles, ellipses, hyperbolas, or more complex graphs and non-functions
that do not pass the vertical line test.
So the question is going to be how do we take the derivative if it is not a function of
x?
In other words, it's going to fail the vertical line test.
It's not a function, and everything we've done thus far has been all predicated on the
idea of a function.
What we're going to have to do is if it's not a function, we're going to have to use
what's called implicit differentiation.
The idea with implicit differentiation is we're going to have a function where y is a function
of x, we don't know what it is, or it's too complex for us to work with, and so we'll
just take the derivative of y times the derivative of what's inside it, and the derivative of
y we know is just dy dx.
So in summary, we can use the chain rule with this idea that the derivative of y with respect
to x is dy dx.
But of course, dy dx is what we're trying to find, what is the derivative of y with respect
to x?
What we will then do is we will then solve for dy dx, and generally dy dx will be a
linear function, so we'll be able to get all the dy dx's on one side, factor out dy dx,
and divide by whatever it's multiplied by.
But to get an idea of what this looks like, let's start with a simple example, just a
basic circle with a radius of six has the equation x squared plus y squared equals 36.
And just kind of to draw a picture off to the side, we won't normally do this, but just
to get an idea of what we're talking about here is we've got a circle with a radius of
six.
And the idea is that we could in theory come up with a tangent line to this circle that
touches at one point, and we could put that tangent line anywhere on the circle.
And so what we want to do is come up with what is the equation of the slope of that
tangent line?
What is dy dx?
But we can't do it by our traditional means because this thing is not a function.
It does not pass the vertical line test because it's going to, a vertical line will cross
the graph twice.
So because it doesn't pass the vertical line test, because it's not a function, we will
take the derivative implicitly, which means we're going to use this idea of the chain
rule whenever we come across the y.
So first, the derivative of x squared is 2x, plus the derivative of y squared.
Now keep in mind the chain rule, we're going to treat the y like it's the inside stuff.
And so the derivative of y squared is 2y, but we have to multiply by the derivative
of the inside.
And the derivative of y is dy dx.
Equals, we'll do the same thing on the other side, the derivative of 36 is 0.
And now I've got something that I can solve for the dy dx.
To solve for the dy dx, we'll subtract 2x from both sides, and we have 2y dy dx equals
negative 2x.
Get the y by itself, or the dy dx by itself, by dividing by 2y, and we get negative 2x
over 2y.
Or by reducing out the 2s, we have dy dx is equal to negative x over y.
So the slope of the tangent line of this circle is negative x over y.
We would then know from our point what x and y are, and we'd be able to find the slope
at any given point.
Now that was a simple example.
These examples can quickly increase in complexity as we combine quotient rules and product rules
and chain rules and all the other rules we've seen.
So let's try several of these examples.
We'll do two more examples where we're just solving for dy dx, and then we'll also look
at how we can find the equation of these tangent lines.
So first we're going to look at x cubed y squared minus the sine of x equals the tangent
of y.
To take the derivative implicitly, because solving for y would be a headache, we'll take
the derivative of the first part here.
We notice we've got a product, the x squared times the y squared, so we will use the product
rule.
The derivative of x cubed is 3x squared times the second part, which is y squared, plus
the derivative of the second part, which is 2y dy dx, and I'll just put that in parentheses
so we can see what we're solving for, times the first part, which is x cubed.
Now that we've used the product rule, we keep going down our function.
The derivative of negative sine is negative cosine of x equals the derivative of tangent
is secant squared of y, but times the derivative of the inside, whenever we take the derivative
with the y, we have to multiply by dy dx.
Now we just have to solve for the dy dx.
To do that, we're going to get all the dy dx's on one side, so I'm going to move that
2y dy dx, that's a terrible y, the 2y dy dx times x cubed, we're going to move that
to the left side.
So we now have 3x squared, it should be green, 3x squared y squared minus the cosine of x
equals the secant squared of y times dy dx, minus 2y x cubed times the dy dx, and then
because the dy dx is on both terms, we're able to factor that out, dy dx times the secant
squared of y minus 2y x cubed, is still equal to the other side's unchanged, 3x squared
y squared minus cosine x.
And so to get the dy dx alone, we just divide by everything, it's multiplied by, and so
now we can say that dy dx, the derivative or slope of the tangent line of this relationship
is 3x squared y squared minus cosine x divided by what was multiplied by the dy dx, the secant
squared y minus 2y x cubed.
And that's how we can use this idea of implicit differentiation, we just keep taking the derivative
of both sides and then whenever we come across a y, we're going to multiply by the derivative
of y using the chain rule, which is dy dx.
Let's look at another.
Let's say we have xy plus x over y equals y times the square root of 2x plus 1.
One thing that's going to help us make this derivative a little easier is the x over y,
we can rewrite that y with a negative exponent, so we can just use the product rule instead
of the quotient rule, which is much simpler.
Also the square root, the easiest way to take a derivative with the square root is to change
that to a fractional exponent of one half and then we can just use our exponent rules.
So let's rewrite this problem as xy plus xy to the negative 1 equals y times 2x plus
1 to the one half power.
Now we're going to have to use several product rules here, so you want to make sure you keep
track of each part because we've got a product at the beginning, actually let me do this
in green so it stands out a little more.
A product at the beginning, a product in the middle, and a product at the end, which is
going to require us to use the chain rule.
So the first product, x times y, derivative of the first, the derivative of x is 1 times
y plus the derivative of the second, the derivative of y is dy dx times the first, which is x
plus the derivative of x is 1 times the second, y to the negative 1 plus the derivative of
the second, the derivative of y to the negative 1.
We bring the negative out front, so instead of plus we actually have minus y to the negative
2 times dy dx, because we were taking a derivative with y times the first, which is x, equals,
we have another product.
The derivative of the first part, the derivative of y is dy dx times the second part, which
is 2x plus 1 to the 1 half, plus the derivative of the second part, which is 1 half times
2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half, but now we have to use our chain rule because the derivative
of the 2x plus 1, the inside stuff, is 2.
Now we can multiply by the derivative, by the first part.
Looking at this ugly thing that we have, a couple things to simplify, we've got a times
2 and a divide by 2, those are going to reduce out, which is nice, so we don't have to deal
with the fraction.
Other than that, what we're going to want to do is get all of these dy dx terms, there's
1 right here, dy dx times x, we've got a negative y to the negative 2, dy dx times x, and we've
also got a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half.
Let's move all the dy dx's to the right and everything else to the left.
So on the left, we've still got the y plus y to the negative 1, and then we'll subtract
out that term at the end, the 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half times y, and I'm just
going to put that y in front, equals, we've got a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to
the 1 half.
We have to also subtract off the dy dx, which is multiplied by the x, and we're also going
to add, to get rid of the minus, a y to the negative 2x times dy dx.
Now that we've got the dy dx's on the right, the everything else on the left, we can factor
out the dy dx, which leaves us with 2x plus 1 to the 1 half minus x plus y to the negative
2x.
The other side's unchanged, y plus y to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the
negative 1 half, that's a terrible 2, there we go.
And then finally, we get the dy dx alone by dividing both sides by what it's multiplied
by, giving us y plus y to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half all
over the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half minus x plus y to the negative 2 times x.
And now we have implicitly found our derivative.
Keeping along with this same idea, I want to add to it a little twist, something we're
very familiar with, and that is finding the equation of the tangent line.
So that equation of the tangent line, same idea, let's start with x cubed y plus 5x
squared y equals negative 28, and we're going to find the equation of the tangent line at
the point 2 comma negative 1.
First we need to find the slope of the tangent line, and then it's going to be really easy
to find the actual equation.
To find the slope, we take the derivative, we've got a couple products, we're getting
really good at the product rule here.
So we've got 3x squared times y plus the derivative of y is dy dx times the x cubed plus, for
the second product, the derivative of the first part is 10x times the y plus the derivative
of the second, which is a dy dx times the first part, which is 5x squared, equals the
derivative of negative 28 is just 0.
Now solving for the dy dx's, they're all on one side, which is nice, so we just need
to get rid of the other stuff.
So we've got a dy dx times x cubed plus a dy dx times 5x squared is equal to negative
3x squared y minus 10xy, moving those things without dy dx to the other side, so that we
can factor out the dy dx, leaving behind x cubed plus 5x squared equals the negative
3x squared y minus 10xy.
Now we can divide by what dy dx is multiplied by, so we know that dy dx is equal to negative
3x squared y minus 10xy over the x cubed plus 5x squared.
We want that derivative at the point 2, negative 1.
So we'll plug 2 in for all of these x's, we'll plug negative 1 in for the y's, so we have
negative 3 times x, which is 2 squared, times y, which is negative 1, minus 10 times x,
which is 2, times y, which is negative 1, all over x cubed, x is 2 cubed, plus 5x squared,
which is 2 squared, and this is not too bad to plug in to our handy dandy calculators.
Let's just do the numerator and the denominator so it's a fraction and it looks kind of slope-esque.
We've got negative 3 times 2 squared times negative 1 minus 10 times 2 times negative
1, so the numerator is 32, over our denominator, which is 2 cubed plus 5 times 2 squared,
which is 28.
Both of those are divisible by 4, 32 divided by 4 is 8, and 28 divided by 4 is 7.
So 8 sevenths is equal to our slope at the point 2, negative 1.
For the equation of the tangent line, y equals m, my slope, 8 sevenths, times x minus x1,
which is 2, plus the y1, which is negative 1, the equation of our tangent line of this
ugly function is 8 sevenths, x minus 2, minus 1.
Let's do one more example, it's got a trig function in it.
Number 2, cosine of xy equals y, and we're going to find the equation of the tangent
line at pi over 3 comma 1.
We'll do this implicitly because it's almost impossible to solve for y, at least it would
be quite tedious.
So the derivative of cosine is negative sine of xy.
Using the chain rule, we multiply by the derivative of what's inside.
We want to make sure we multiply by the entire derivative, and because we have to use the
product rule, there's going to be a plus, so I'm going to put this in parentheses to
remind me to distribute the negative sign through the parentheses.
The derivative of x is just 1 times the y, which is y, plus the derivative of y is our
dy dx times the x, and that's equal to the derivative of y, which we know is dy dx.
We want to solve for the dy dx, we first have to get it out of the parentheses, so we're
going to distribute that negative sine xy through.
That gives us negative y sine of xy minus x sine of xy times dy dx equals dy dx.
We want to get the dy dx's all on the same side, so we'll add that x sine xy to both
sides, giving us negative y sine of xy equals dy dx plus x sine of xy dy dx.
Once they're all on one side, we can factor out dy dx, leaving behind a one, don't forget
the one, it doesn't just disappear, plus x sine of xy, still equal to negative y sine
of xy.
Finally to get the dy dx alone, we divide both sides by what it's multiplied to get
our final derivative, negative y sine of xy divided by one plus x sine of xy equals dy
dx.
We want the slope though, or we want the equation, at pi over 3 comma 1.
Let's plug that into our function, we got negative y, which is negative 1, times the
sine of x times y, 1 times pi over 3 is just pi over 3, all over 1 plus x, which is pi
over 3, times the sine of xy, which is pi over 3.
If we remember our unit circle, pi over 3, the y coordinate there is the square root
of 3 over 2, so we have negative root 3 over 2, over 1 plus pi over 3 times, again the
sine of pi over 3 is root 3 over 2, and I don't like having those fractions and fractions,
so let's clear out those fractions and fractions.
We've got a common denominator of 6, I'm going to multiply by 6 and distribute that 6 through,
6 over 2 will reduce to 3, so we have negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus 3 times 2 is 6, which
will reduce to the 6, so that's pi root 3.
It looks weird and ugly, but sure enough it is our derivative.
We have y equals our slope, which is negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus pi root 3 times x minus
the x coordinate, which is pi over 3, plus our y coordinate, which is 1.
This is the equation of the line that is tangent to cosine xy equals y, so that's implicit
differentiation.
The idea behind implicit differentiation is that we just take the derivative of both sides
of the equation using the chain rule knowing that the derivative of y is dy dx, because
y is a function of x, it's not just a variable, it is a function of x, so we use our chain
rule and multiply by the derivative of y.
Then we just have to solve the resulting equation for dy dx.
Looking forward to seeing you in class when we can work on this a little bit more, give
yourself some time to practice before then, and we'll see you in class.
Here is one more set of functions that we haven't taken a look at how to find the derivative
of, so we're going to attempt to answer that question today, is how do we find the derivative
of exponential and logarithmic functions.
We'll break that up into two halves once, we'll talk about the exponentials and then
we'll come back and talk about the logarithmic functions.
Just exponential functions, some important formulas that will help us take derivative.
The nicest derivative formula I have all, and it's also the most interesting, is that
the derivative of e to the x, the slope of the tangent line to e to the x at e to the
x is actually exactly e to the x, which is kind of weird when you think about it.
But if our base is not e to the x, it turns out the derivative of any base to the x is
that base to the x times the natural log of the base, which just so happens that the
natural log of e is just one, so we end up with two formulas that could be condensed
into one, but since we use e to the x so often, we'll give it its own little formula.
These two formulas are going to be what guide us here as we go into the first part of this
video.
So let's take a look at some examples of taking derivatives with exponentials.
Let's say f of x equals e to the cosine of x squared.
What we really have here is just a really big chain rule problem.
It's a three level chain rule, but we can do that.
f prime of x is equal to the derivative of the outside, and the derivative of e to the
x is e to the stuff, e to the cosine of x squared, times the derivative of the inside
stuff, and so the derivative of cosine is negative sign of the stuff, times the derivative
of the inside stuff, and the derivative of x squared is just two x.
Cleaning this up a little bit, putting the negative and two x out front, we'll put the
sign of x squared next, and then the e to the cosine of x squared after that just so
that it looks a little nicer, but that way we found our derivative, which contained in
e to the x.
We could even expand this into any of our rules or patterns that we've seen thus far,
so what if we did a quotient rule?
f of x is equal to e to the 3x minus 7, all over x squared plus 5x.
Well, we should be very comfortable with the quotient rule by now, so we take the derivative
of the top, which is e to the 3x minus 7, because the derivative of e to something is
e to that something, but we have to multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is
just 3, and then we have to multiply by the denominator x squared plus 5x.
Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator, which is 2x plus 5, times the numerator, which
is e to the 3x minus 7, and that's all over the denominator squared, x squared plus 5x
squared.
Not a lot to clean up in there, so after using our quotient rule and the exponent rule, we'll
call that our derivative.
Let's do one more, one that doesn't use a base of e to the x, but uses some different
base.
So let's try f of x equals 4 to the x times 5 to the x minus x.
We could distribute the 4 to the x through, and then we don't have to use the product
rule, well we still would, but let's just keep it the way it is.
f prime of x is equal to, and we'll use the product rule here.
The derivative of the first part, the derivative of 4 to the x is 4 to the x, but if the base
is not e, we need to multiply by the natural log of the base, then times the second part,
5 to the x minus 1, plus the derivative of the second part, well the derivative of an
exponential is the exponential times the natural log of the base minus the derivative of x
is 1 times the first part, which is just 4 to the x, and there's not really much that
cleans up in this example either, and so we end up with our solution.
So basically all we're doing is we're expanding our repertoire of derivatives to include these
two exponential formulas.
The derivative of anything is, I'm sorry, the derivative of the exponential is the exponential
times the natural log of the base.
If it's e to the x, it's really nice because the derivative of e to the x is just e to
the x.
We can use the fact that the exponential derivative is so simple to derive and create the derivative
of the logarithmic.
If I can spell it right, logarithmic functions, and the way we get the derivative of the
logarithmic functions is we use implicit differentiation, because we know that if y equals the natural
log of x, we can rewrite this as e to the y equals x, because the base is e, the exponent
is y, and then if we take the derivative of both sides of this guy using implicit differentiation,
the derivative of e to the y is e to the y dy dx equals, the derivative of x is 1, dividing
both sides by e to the y, we get the derivative dy dx is equal to 1 over e to the y, but the
good news is that we know what y equals, y is equal to the natural log of x.
We have 1 over e to the natural log of x, but e and the natural log with the same base
is our inverses, so that leaves us with just the x, and so we find out that dy dx is equal
to 1 over x.
Kind of need how the formula comes out, so we've got our formulas for the logarithms.
The derivative of the natural log of x we just found out is simply 1 over x.
If the base is in a base e though, we can do the derivative of any log base b of x doing
just a simple change of base formula, we end up with 1 over x natural log of b, and these
two formulas allow us to take the derivatives with logarithms.
Do more formulas to add to our derivative repertoire, and so we should be able to solve
a whole bunch of examples using all the other derivative rules we've seen, but now throwing
in some logarithms.
If f of x equals the natural log of the tangent of x squared minus 5x, what we really have
is derivatives inside of derivatives inside of derivatives, so that f prime of x equals
using the chain rule, natural log, the derivative of that is 1 over the stuff, 1 over the tangent
of x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside, well the derivative of tangent
is secant squared of the stuff x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside, which
is the x squared minus 5x, the derivative there is 2x minus 5, and all there is to do is clean
that up nicely, all that stuff multiplied, ends up in the numerator, and so we get this
nice derivative secant squared of x squared minus 5x times the 2x minus 5 all over the
tangent of x squared minus 5x.
Let's try one with the log that's got a different base.
Let's say f of x is equal to the log base 7 of 2x minus 5 times the cosine of 5x.
Here we have the product rule again, so we'll take the derivative of the first, the derivative
of log base 7 is 1 over the stuff, the 2x minus 5, and because it's not a base e we have to
multiply by the natural log of the base, or the natural log of 7 times the second part.
Actually before we get to the second part we still need to multiply by the derivative
of the inside which is just 2 times the second part which is cosine of 5x plus the derivative
of the second part, the derivative of cosine is negative sine, so let's change that to
negative sine of 5x times the derivative of the inside which is 5, and we still have
to, using the product rule, multiply by the first part which is log base 7 of 2x minus
5.
Just want to clean it up a little bit, not much to clean up, but we'll definitely make
it easier on the eyes.
We'll combine the fraction together, so we have 2 cosine of 5x over 2x minus 5, natural
log of 7, minus, we'll put the 5 out front, sine of 5x log base 7 of 2x minus 5, and we
have our derivative.
One nice thing that comes out of working with logarithms and derivatives is that logs have
some nice properties that help us simplify out to something that is very simple to take
the derivative of.
For example, if we were given f of x equals the natural log of x to the fourth cosine
of x divided by the square root of x plus 3, that looks very ugly to take the derivative
of.
However, we can break this up into three separate logarithms, one for each factor.
The logarithm from the denominator is going to be negative, and then we can also pull
exponents out in front of logarithms.
What we really have here rewriting the function is the natural log of x to the fourth, but
the four moves out front, plus the natural log of the cosine of x minus the natural log
of the x plus 3, and then the one half power can move out front.
Now we've got something that's much easier to work with, much easier to take the derivative
of.
f prime of x is equal to, we've got a constant of 4, times the derivative of the natural
log of x, which is just 1 over x, plus the natural log means the derivative is 1 over
that, so 1 over cosine of x, times the derivative of the inside, which is negative sine of x,
just stick that in the numerator, minus one half, that's a constant, so that's going to
be out front, and the derivative of the natural log is 1 over the stuff, x plus 3, times the
derivative of the inside, which is just 1, and we can clean this up a little bit even,
so that it's equal to 4 over x, we'll just say minus instead of plus or negative, and
sine over cosine we should recognize.
Sine over cosine is the tangent, minus 1 over, and we can distribute if we want, 2x plus
6, don't have to distribute, but why not, and we get this nice derivative.
So that's one nice thing that comes out of derivatives with logarithms, is quite often
logarithms help us break the problem down, where it started complex, what we end up with
is quite simple to take the logarithm of.
Another nice trick that comes out of this is what we call logarithmic differentiation,
which we use when the variable, we'll say x, but the variable is in both the exponent
and base, and the most classic example of that is if y equals x to the x power.
Here we can't really take the derivative because we could use the exponent rule, but that doesn't
work because we don't know what x is, we don't know how to do the base, we're kind of stuck
until we get this nice trick called logarithmic differentiation, where we take the natural
log of both sides, and when we do we get the natural log of y equals the natural log of
x to the x power, which allows us to use the log property, the log property says the natural
log of x to the n is equal to n times the natural log of x, we can move that exponent
out front, so now we have the natural log of y equals x times the natural log of x.
Now we can take the derivative, but because this has the natural log of y on both sides
we have to do implicit differentiation.
The derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y dy dx.
The derivative of x natural log of x, that's a product rule, we'll always end up with a
product rule here, the derivative of x is 1 times the natural log of x, plus the derivative
of natural log of x is 1 over x times the first, which is just x, but x over x is just
equal to 1, which is really nice.
What we need to do is solve for the dy dx, we know implicit differentiation, and it
always turns out to do that we multiply by y.
With implicit differentiation this step is always the same because you'll always have
1 over y, I'm sorry not with implicit differentiation, with logarithmic differentiation this step
is always the same because you'll always have 1 over y on the right, so we'll multiply both
sides by y, giving us dy dx is equal to the natural log of x plus 1 times y, so all that's
left to do then is to substitute y from the original function.
Y is equal to x to the x, so dy dx is equal to, and I'll just put the y in front, x to
the x times the natural log of x plus 1, and now we've got our derivative.
We can use this process though to solve things that are much more complex than x to the x,
we'll use this process of taking the log of both sides and then the derivative implicitly
to solve things more complex that might look something like this.
Y equals 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x power.
We have x both in the base and in the exponent, when it occurs in both places we take the
natural log of both sides, the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x to the sine of x, whoops
lost my end, not to the 6th to the sine of x, let's clean that up.
Now we have our log property that says that exponent can come out front, so we know the
natural log of y is equal to the sine of x times the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x.
Then we can take the derivative implicitly.
On the left the derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y times our dy dx is equal
to, we have a product rule here, the derivative of sine is cosine x times the natural log
of 3x squared minus 5x plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of natural
log is 1 over the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside, that'll
go in the numerator, 6x minus 5 times the first part, the sine of x.
Now we can solve for the dy dx by multiplying both sides by y, that tells us that dy dx
is equal to the cosine x natural log of 3x squared minus 5x plus 6x minus 5 times the
sine of x all over 3x squared minus 5x times y, but we know what y equals, y is equal
to the original problem, so dy dx is equal to the cosine of x times the natural log of
3x squared minus 5x plus 6x minus 5 sine of x divided by 3x squared minus 5x times our
original problem which was 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x, power.
And logarithms take that which once was impossible, now very possible and straight forward.
So we've kind of done three things today, we talked about the derivatives of the exponentials
specifically e to the x is e to the x, we talked about the derivatives of the logarithms,
the derivative of the natural log is 1 over x or 1 over the stuff, and then we talked
about doing logarithmic differentiation to take problems that would otherwise be impossible
to take derivatives of, change their form so that we can use logarithmic differentiation
to find our derivative.
Couple things to practice with, take a look at those and we will see you in class to work
on them further.
This video is going to take a look at a preview of working in two dimensions and three dimensions
and taking derivatives, thus far we've only taken derivatives in the x direction where
we've got a coordinate plane in two dimensions, but we can extend that to a three dimensional
coordinate plane and still work with derivatives, the trick is we have to decide what direction
we're going in.
So the question is going to be how do we calculate derivatives in 3D?
Now a 3D function, generally a 2D function is f of x, we've done a lot of work with that
because we just take the derivative with f of x with respect to x, but a three dimensional
function will have variables x and y in them to result in a z variable that's a solution.
So these are still a function, we've just got multiple variables inside the function,
and the way we take those derivatives is we take what is called a partial derivative,
or a derivative or rate of change in a specific direction.
In other words, are we going left and right, are we going forwards and backwards, how far
are we changing in each of these two directions?
And so to specify that we're just taking a derivative partially in one direction, we've
got a special notation to indicate this.
You will see what we call the partial derivative of f with respect to x, I'll even write that,
that's the partial derivative in the x direction, and you might think about that as the left
right direction, loosely, and it's kind of this funky D F DX that we saw before, but
now because it's got this curved looking D, that notation should tell us we're talking
about a partial derivative in the x direction, and similarly you'll see a partial derivative
with respect to y, that's the partial derivative in the y direction, or how fast we're changing
in the y direction, which you might think of loosely as the up down direction, and by
up down I mean if I'm looking down at a piece of paper away from me and towards me, up down
or left right would be the other two directions, so how are we changing left and right, how
are we changing horizontally, as we've got a partial change of the function.
And the way we actually calculate a partial derivative is we treat all other variables
as constants.
So for example, let's say we've got f of x, y is equal to 3x squared y to the fourth,
and if I wanted to calculate the partial of f with respect to x in the x direction, we're
going to take the derivative with respect to x, and we're going to pretend the y is
a constant.
So the derivative of 3x squared is 6x, and the y to the fourth is a constant, so it's
going to kind of hang out like constants do when they're multiplied by our x.
I could also take the derivative of this same function with respect to the y.
In that case, we take the derivative of the y, which is y cubed, and then we bring the
four out front, 4 times 3 is 12, and we keep the x squared as if it was a constant, as
if it was part of the three.
Really important here to note, though, that the notation and process is different than
implicit differentiation.
Implicit differentiation used that whole dy dx.
With dy dx, y was a function of x in two dimensions, y was f of x.
Now we've got a three-dimensional function that has x's and y's in the function, but
these are functions.
These pass the vertical line test, or in three dimensions the vertical plane test.
With implicit differentiation, we took the derivative of y as if it was a function of
x, and then multiplied by its derivative dy dx.
That is different than partial derivatives, where we're just going in the x direction
in three dimensions, and the y is treated like a constant, or we're going in the y direction,
and the x is treated as a constant.
Be careful not to mix these two processes, because they are very different.
Let's try a few examples, though, where we have to take a bunch of partials.
What's nice about these partial derivatives is it's a great place for us to synthesize
all the derivative rules that we have seen up to this point, and see how we do.
First take a function in x and y, let's call it 5x squared, minus 7xy, minus 9y to the
fifth, plus 2x, minus 7y, plus 3.
First we'll find the partial of f with respect to x.
We're going to pretend like all the y's are constants as we take the derivative with respect
to x.
So our first term, we know that's 10x, minus the derivative of x is 1, so we're just left
with the constants 7 and y, the 9y to the fifth, those are all constants, and the derivative
of just a constant is 0, so that term's gone, 2x, the derivative of that is just 2, again
the 7y, all constant, the 3, constant, therefore those derivatives are also 0, and so our partial
derivative of f with respect to x is 10x, minus 7y, plus 2.
We can also take the partial derivative of f with respect to the y.
With respect to the y, the 5x squared is now a constant, so that's 0, negative 7xy, the
derivative of the y is 1, so we're just left with the constant 7x, the derivative of negative
9y to the fifth is negative 45y to the fourth, bringing that 5 out front and dropping the
exponent by 1, 2x, it's all constant, the derivative of negative 7y is negative 7, and
3 is also a constant, so that derivative is 0, and now we've got our partial derivatives
with respect to x and the partial derivative with respect to y.
Let's try another one, we'll increase in complexity here, making these more interesting.
Function of f with respect to x and y, a function of f with x and y as variables is the secant
of x to the fourth y, plus 7x minus 4y, and now the partial of f with respect to x.
Here we've got a chain rule set up, we've got a secant of stuff, the derivative of secant
is secant tangent of the stuff, so the secant of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y tangent
of the stuff, which is x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y, times the derivative of the stuff
inside it with respect to x, so the x to the fourth becomes 4x cubed with the constant
of y still there, plus the derivative of 7x is just 7, negative 4y, those are all constants
because we treat the y as a constant, so it's 0, and now we've got our partial derivative
of f with respect to x.
Let's try the partial derivative of f with respect to y. Very similar, chain rule again,
the derivative of secant is still the secant tangent of the stuff, so we have the secant
of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y tangent of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y times
the derivative of the inside stuff with respect to y. Now with the x to the fourth y, the
derivative of y is just 1, so we're left with the constant x to the fourth. 7x doesn't
have any y's on it, so that goes to 0, and the derivative of negative 4y is negative
4, and now we've got the derivative, the partial derivative, with respect to y. Let's make
this a little more interesting. Let's say f is a function of x and y, which is equal
to e to the xy cosine of 2x sine of 3y, and if we want the partial of f with respect to
x. Here we've got a product with respect to x, the sine of 3y is a constant, so really
the only product is e to the xy times the cosine of 2x, and then we will have that constant
out in front. So I'm just going to go ahead and write that constant in front. The sine
of 3y times the derivative of e to the xy is e to the xy times the derivative of the
inside with respect to x is just y times the second part, which is the cosine of 2x, plus
the derivative of the second part. The derivative of cosine is negative sine. Let's make that
negative sine of 2x times the derivative of the inside, which is 2, and let's go ahead
and put that 2 actually in front of the sine just to keep it clean, times the other part,
e to the xy, and we've got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's also do the partial
derivative of f with respect to y. Very similarly, but this time, notice the factor of cosine
of 2x does not have any y's on it. That is a constant that's being multiplied by stuff
with y's, so that constant will put out front cosine of 2x times the derivative of the product.
So our product is multiplying e to the xy times the sine of 3y. So we'll take the derivative
of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first, all the partial
with respect to y. So the derivative of e to the xy is e to the xy times the derivative
of the inside, the derivative of xy with respect to y is just x, times the second part, which
is the sine of 3y, plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of sine is
the cosine of 3y, times the derivative of the inside, which is a 3, times the first part,
e to the xy. And we have our derivative. Let's try one last example. f is a function
of x and y. It's equal to the tangent of x to the fourth, y to the third, times the
natural log of 5 over xy. Now something to make life easier, you should be very good
at picking up now when we see a fraction like 5 over xy, we can think about that as 5x to
the negative 1, y to the negative 1. Because that's going to be easier to take the derivative
of. So as we take the derivative, that's the natural log of 5x to the negative 1, y to
the negative 1. And first we're going to do the partial derivative of f with respect
to x. And again we have a product rule. And each product part is going to be a chain rule.
So there's going to be a couple pieces to this one. First, the derivative of the first
times the second. The derivative of tangent is secant squared of the stuff. And then we
multiply by the derivative of the inside with respect to x. So the derivative of x to the
fourth is 4x cubed. And the y cubed is a constant. Times the natural log of 5x to the
negative 1, y to the negative 1. Plus the derivative of the second. The derivative of
natural log is 1 over the stuff, 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1. Times the
derivative of the inside with respect to x, which is going to be negative 5x to the negative
2, bringing the negative 1 out front, subtracting 1. And the y to the negative 1 is a constant.
Times the tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed. Times the first part. A little bit to clean
up. Let's move the 4x cubed, y cubed to the front. Also the 5 over 5 reduces out. The
y to the negative 1s reduce out, which is really nice. And so we're just left with an
x to the, when I move the negative 2 down, it's going to be just a positive 1 left over.
So cleaning that up, we get 4x cubed, y cubed secant squared of x to the fourth, y cubed
natural log of, let's go ahead and make this a fraction, 5 over x, y. Plus we've got the
tangent of x cubed, or I'm sorry, x to the fourth, y cubed. And all that's left from
that ugly fraction we crossed everything out is just an x in the denominator. And now we've
got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's do the partial derivative with respect
to y. It's going to be very similar because x and y appear in very similar locations.
But just to walk through it together, product rule again. So first the derivative of tangent
is secant squared of the stuff, x to the fourth, y cubed times the derivative of the inside,
this time with respect to y. In the y direction is 3y squared, and the x to the fourth is
a constant times the second part, which is the natural log of, I'll just leave it as
5 over x, y. Plus the derivative of the second part, which is natural log, is 1 over the
stuff, 1 over 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1, times the derivative of the inside,
which is going to be y to the negative 2 with a negative 5 and an x to the negative 1, because
an x is a constant, times the first part, which is tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed.
The cleanup is very similar. We'll move the 3x to the fourth, y squared to the front.
The fives are going to divide out, which is nice. Oops, I just saw an error that I missed
earlier. We had a minus and my minus disappeared. That should have been a minus on number 4.
Apologize for that. Don't lose your signs. But the x to the negative 1s do divide out,
and when we bring the y down, we'll just be left with a single y in the denominator. For
our cleaned up version, we have 3x to the fourth, y squared, secant squared of x to
the fourth, y cubed, natural log of 5 over x, y minus, because of the minus sign, not
forgetting it this time, we'll put the tangent of x cubed, x to the fourth, y cubed in the
numerator, and in the denominator, all that's left is a single y, and we have our partial
derivative with respect to y. The homework assignment with partial derivatives is really
short, but they are going to force you to review all of these derivatives properties
we've worked with here in chapter 3, which is what makes it such a great assignment.
So take a look at it, give it a good practice, and then we will see you in class to discuss
these partial derivatives in a little more detail. Chapter 4 is going to take a look
at how we can use the derivative in various contexts and applications. The first one is
what are called related rates, and so our question we're going to answer is how our
rates of change, that's a derivative, a rate of change, how are they related to each other?
And this is what brings up this idea of related rates. And basically, a related rate means
two things are changing, but they're changing in relationship to one another. One increases
at a certain rate, and it makes the other one increase or decrease at a certain rate.
The best example of this is if you think about filling up a balloon. Let's say if we have
a spherical balloon that is filled with air at a rate of three cubic inches per second.
We want to know how fast is the radius changing
the radius is four inches. As we solve these related rate problems, the radius of the balloon
is related to the amount of air in it. As we solve these problems, we're going to go
through kind of a four step process. The first step is going to be to draw a picture
with the related formulas. So we're talking here about a sphere. So we'll draw our little
spherical balloon here and the radius of r. And we're talking specifically about the
volume or how much stuff is in this circle. And we can look up or we might know the formula
for the volume of a sphere is four thirds pi times the radius cubed. Once we know that
relationship, we're ready for the second step, which is to take the derivative with respect
to time. So if I were to take the derivative of this guy, we're going to have to use implicit
differentiation because time t is not a variable here. So v, the derivative of v is just one
dv dt is equal to four thirds and pi are constants. And we know we can use our exponent rule
on the three, bringing the three out front and reducing it by one, so r squared, and
then times the derivative of r, which is dr dt. This one's kind of nice because the threes
are going to divide out. So we really say dv dt is equal to four pi r squared dr dt.
And now that we have our derivative with respect to time, let's plug in what we know, and
I can't quite fit it all on the screen, so hopefully you have it on your notes. We're
going to plug in what we know. And what we know is that the volume is increasing at a
rate of three cubic inches per second. That is the change in volume with respect to time.
We also know that the radius is currently four inches. It's not changing with respect
to time, it's at this moment exactly four inches. So when we come down to plug in dv dt, the
volume is changing at a rate of three cubic inches, equals four pi r, the radius we said
was four inches squared dr dt. And then all we have to do is solve for the remaining rate,
or dr dt, the change in the rate with respect to time. So simplifying four squared is sixteen
times four is sixty four pi dr dt. And then we can get the dr dt, or the change in the
radius with respect to time, how fast is that radius changing by dividing three by the sixty
four pi. And then we have three over sixty four pi inches per second is the rate that
the radius is changing when it's exactly four inches long, and the volume is increasing
at three cubic inches per second. Let's try another related rate problem. Let's say we
have a seven foot ladder that is sliding down the wall. And we know that the top is sliding
down at a rate of one point five feet per second. We want to know how fast is the bottom
moving along the ground. When the bottom is six feet from the wall.
Let's draw a picture to get a better idea of this. We've got a building, the ground,
and there is this ladder that's leaning against them. The problem is that ladder is sliding
down the wall at a rate of one point five feet per second. We know the ladder itself
is seven feet long, and the moment we're interested in is the fact that we are six feet from the
wall. And if we call this other side A, we don't know what A is, but we're going to
be able to find that pretty quick. The big thing though that we know, we know that the
formula for any right triangle is that A squared plus B squared equals C squared. And we can
take the derivative of this with respect to time, we have 2A times the change in A with
respect to time, or DADT, plus 2B dBDT equals 2C DCDT. Then let's go ahead and plug in
what we know and see what we come up with. We can actually figure out how long A is using
the same Pythagorean theorem. Seven squared is equal to six squared plus A squared, or
A squared plus six squared equals seven squared. A squared plus 36 equals 49, so A squared
is equal to 13, A is the square root of 13. At this moment, up the wall, the square root
of 13, high. So plugging that into the formula, we have 2 times A, which is the square root
of 13, times the change in A with respect to time. We know that A is going down, so
we're going to say it's negative to represent the downward motion, and it's moving down
at a rate, the change with respect to time is negative 1.5. Plus 2B, B is the bottom
of six, times the change in B with respect to time, and we don't know how fast this
ladder is moving out. That's what we're looking for, the DBDT. Equals 2C, C is seven feet,
but how fast is C the ladder's length changing? Well, if we think about a ladder sliding down
a wall, that ladder is not changing length at all. It's always going to be seven feet
long, whether it's completely against the wall, completely against the ground, or anywhere
in between. There's no change in the ladder's length, so we'll use zero for that length.
When we clean this up then, we end up with negative 3 square root of 13, plus 12 DBDT
equals zero. And this is going to solve quite nicely for us. Add the three root 13 to both
sides, we get 12 DBDT equals three square roots of 13, divide both sides by 12, and
the change in B of the base with respect to time is equal to three root 13 over 12, and
what's nice is the three over 12 reduce. So for our final rate, this ladder is moving
square root of 13 over four feet per second, when the ladder is six feet from the wall.
Let's try another example. Let's say a camera is 2,000 feet from a rocket
that fires vertically. And when this rocket is 500 feet in the air, its velocity, I mean
speed, but with direction, is 400 feet per second. The cameraman needs to know what is
the needed rate of change of the angle of the camera. Let's draw a picture to kind of
get an idea of what's going on. We've got a little camera here, that's my camera, which
is 2,000 feet away from the launch point for a rocket, that's my little rocket, it's going
to go up in the air, and the camera is going to change angle so that it can watch that
rocket no matter how high it gets. We need to come up with an equation that relates these
variables. Well, since we're dealing with an angle and the side's opposite and adjacent,
we should know that the tangent of that angle is equal to the height over the 2,000 feet,
the opposite over the adjacent. Then we can take the derivative of that. Actually, let's
save ourselves a little bit of work. Before we take the derivative, let's multiply both
sides by 2,000 so we don't have to worry about the fraction. It's just a constant, so it's
not going to make much difference. Now let's take the derivative of that. The derivative
is going to be 2,000 secant squared of theta with respect to time, so we have to say dTd
theta, using that implicit differentiation, equals the derivative of the height is dHdt.
So now we can plug in what we know. First, we need to figure out what secant squared
of theta is. Secant of theta, you remember, is one over the cosine of theta, or the reciprocal
of cosine. If cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, the secant is the hypotenuse over the adjacent,
the reciprocal. We already know the adjacent side is 2,000. We just need to find the hypotenuse
side. We're interested in the moment where the height is 500 feet. Fortunately, the quadratic
formula can tell us that 2,000 squared plus 500 squared is going to be equal to c squared.
If I were to do that on my calculator, we would get 425 with 4 zeros after it equals
c squared. If I take the square root, c is approximately equal to 2061.55. Plugging in
what we have, we've got 2,000 times the secant, which is the hypotenuse, 2061.55, over the
adjacent, which is 2,000 squared. Oops, I just realized I got a small error up here.
It should be d theta dt. We're taking the respect to time. The change in the angle with respect
to time is what we're solving for. The change in the height, we know the height is increasing
at 400 feet per second. The change in the height is 400 feet per second. Then we start
multiplying this out. We will do the 2,000 times 2061.55 over 2,000 squared. When I do
all of that, I get 2125 approximately d theta dt equals the 400. The change in the angle
with respect to time after I divide is 400 over 2125, which if I divide that, I get
0.1882 radians per second. When this rocket is 500 feet in the air, the camera needs to
be changing its angle at 0.1882 radians per second. Let's do one last example of these
related rates. Finding an equation that relates the rates, taking a derivative with respect
to time, plugging in what we know, and solving. Let's say I have a funnel and water is draining
from it. Water is draining from a cone shaped funnel at a rate of 0.25 cubic feet per second.
The height of the funnel is 3 feet, and the radius at the top
is 2 feet. But we're not interested in the funnel, we want to know about the water. At
what rate is the height of the water changing when the height
is 1 foot? Well, let's draw a picture of our funnel. Here's our funnel. Water is leaking
out. It's not full though, so here's the water level. The funnel itself we know is 3 feet
high. The radius on the funnel is 2 feet. That's a constant, so we'll label those constants.
We know water is coming out at 0.025 feet per second, so we'll call that negative 0.25 feet
per second. We're interested specifically in the water. We don't really know the radius
and the height because that's going to change. Those aren't constant. But what we do know
is an equation about the volume of that water. You might have to look it up, or we might
know that the volume of a cone is 1 third pi r squared times the height. The problem
we have is we end up with three variables. If we were to take the derivative, we'd have
three rates of change, the change in the height, the change in the radius, and the change in
the volume. We want to reduce that down to 2, so it's a little more manageable. Fortunately,
if we were to draw a line down the middle, you see we end up with triangles that make
up the right side, a big triangle with a height of 3 and a length of 2, and a small triangle
with a height of h and a radius of r. Those triangles, because they both have a right
angle and a sharing angle, are similar triangles, so their sides must be proportional. In other
words, if we set up the radius divided by the height on the little triangle, it would
be the same on the big triangle, a radius of 2 divided by the height of 3. We can solve
this for r really quickly by multiplying by h. r is equal to 2h over 3. Let's plug that
in to our radius. That's going to reduce out the radius variable, because we really don't
care about the radius. We care about the height, and we care about the volume of the water decreasing.
We've got height and we've got volume. We do not have anything about the radius, so let's
stick with that pattern. Our volume is one-third pi times the radius, which is 2h over 3 squared
times h. Actually, let's go ahead and simplify that. We've got one-third pi times 2 squared
is 4h squared over 3 squared is 9 times the height. Our final formula that connects the
variables of the height and the volume, let's multiply 1 times 4 is 4, 3 times 9 is 27,
so we've got 4 pi over 27 times the height cubed. Now that we have our formula connecting
our variables, we'll take the derivative. The derivative of v is 1, dv dt, the change
in the volume with respect to time. 4 pi over 27 is a constant, but the derivative of h cubed
is h squared with the 3 out front times dh dt. Let's go ahead and simplify. 3 over 27
times 9, so dv dt is equal to 4 pi over 9 h squared dh dt. Let's come over here to the
side and plug in what we know. dv dt, that's the change in the volume with respect to time.
The volume was decreasing at 0.25 cubic feet per second, decreasing so it's negative. 0.25
is equal to 4 pi over 9. The height that the moment we care about is 1 feet, so we're
going to put 1 in for our height that the moment we care about is squared. dh dt, that's
what we're looking for, the change in the height with respect to time. So we have negative
0.25 is equal to 1 squared is 1 times 4 is 4 pi over 9 dh dt. And so to get dh dt alone,
we multiply by 9 over 4 pi times the negative 0.25 and the change in height with respect
to time is equal to approximately, putting that in the calculator, negative 0.17914 feet
per second. In other words, at that moment the height is decreasing by almost 0.18 feet
per second. And that's how we're going to handle these related rates. We're going to
take a look at drawing a picture, finding a formula that relates the variables of interest,
the variables that are changing specifically. Then we'll take the derivative with respect
to time, implicitly, and then we'll plug in what we know and solve for what we don't know.
Give a couple of those some practice on the assignment and we will see you in class to
discuss this further. Sometimes it is easier to use a derivative to approximate the value
of an equation or a function than it is to actually calculate the exact value. And that's
what we're going to take a look at today. The question is going to be how do we approximate
a function at a point? And to set this up, we're going to start by asking the why it
works or what's going on in the background, the why, behind what we call linear approximation.
To set this up, we're going to recall the equation of a tangent line
to the function f of x at the point a is y equals the y-coordinate, which is just f
of a, plus the slope of the tangent line at a, which is f prime of a, times x minus the
point, which is a. And what we also know is that close to the point, close to a, it is
close to f of a. In other words, here's what I mean. Let's say I've got this curve here
and there's this point on the curve that we're going to call a. And we calculate this tangent
line at a. And if I look at a value that is close to a, it's also going to be close to
the point of the line. It's also going to be a very similar height. It's going to be
close to f of a. It's off by a little bit, but that line can give us a really good estimation
of what's happening close to the point a as it curves away from a. And the fact of the
matter is, lines are easier than curves to calculate points. And so we're going to prefer
to use that blue line that gets us close to a to calculate what's actually happening close
to a. Maybe this will look better with a more concrete example. Let's take a look at example.
Let's say we were trying to calculate the square root of 25.1 by hand. That would be very,
very difficult because it doesn't have a perfect square root. We know it's close to 5 because
the square root of 25 is 5. And that's the fact that we're going to use in order to estimate
it. We know that the square root of 25.1 is close to the square root of 25. So we can
consider. Let's say the function f of x is equal to the square root of x, or as we like
to have it in calculus, x to the one-half. Then f prime of x, the derivative is one-half
times x to the negative one-half, or 1 over 2 square root of x. We need to know what f
of 25, the easy point, and f prime of 25 is in order to estimate the not-so-easy point
of the square root of 25.1. Well, f of 25 is the square root of 25, which we know is
5. And f prime of 25 is 1 over 2 times the square root of 25, or 1 over 2 times 5, one-tenth.
So if we want the linear approximation of the square root of x at 25, that's just the
equation of our tangent line. The y-coordinate of 5 plus the slope, which is the derivative
one-tenth, times x minus the x-coordinate, which is 25. We can use this linear equation
to estimate the square root of numbers very close to 25. So we can estimate the square
root of 25.1 by using x is equal to 25.1 in this equation. So the linearization at 25.1
is equal to 5 plus one-tenth times 25.1 minus 25. And if we plug that into our calculator,
we will get that the answer is approximately 5.01. And so we're estimating that the square
root of 25.1 is about 5.01. So I know what you're thinking. How good is that estimate?
Well, let's actually find it on the calculator. We did it by hand. We're going to compare
with the square root of 25.1 on our calculator. So on my calculator, I will do the square
root of 25.1 and we get 5.00999. That's pretty darn close. 5.00999. It is quite close to
our estimated value that we found by hand. And doing it by hand with the square root
would have been a real big pain because curves are difficult to calculate, but lines are
much easier to work with. And so that's this idea of linear approximation is we're going
to estimate by finding the equation of the tangent line to see what's happening really
close. So let's try some examples. Let's see if we can get good at this. First example,
we're going to estimate 1 over 3.1 squared. Well, the function that we seem to be working
with is we're doing 1 over x squared or x to the negative 2. And then we can make the
x equal to 3. So f prime, the derivative of that is negative 2 x to the negative 3 or
negative 2 over x cubed. 3.1 is close to 3. So we're going to find f of 3 and f prime
of 3 and then we'll see what's happening close to that. So f of 3 is equal to 1 over 3 squared
which we know is 1 ninth. f prime of 3 is negative 2 over 3 cubed which is negative 2 over 27.
So let's set up our linear approximation is equal to the y-coordinate of 1 ninth plus
the slope which is negative 2 over 27 times x minus the x-coordinate. The x-coordinate
is 3. We can use this to estimate 1 over x squared near the point 3. We're particularly
interested in 3.1. So 1 ninth minus 2 over 27 times 3.1 minus 3. And if I plug 3.1 into
that, into my calculator, we get 0.1037. So let's check it on the calculator. What is
1 over 3.1 squared? 1 divided by 3.1 squared. Let's see how close we got. It's 0.1041. And
as you can see, that is quite close. We're only off by about 0.0004. Not too bad of an
estimate. Doing it by hand was much nicer than doing 3.1 squared, getting in something
with 2 decimal points, and then doing that long division. Much nicer. This even works
with trigonometry. Let's do a trig example. Let's estimate the tangent of 44 degrees.
Well, let's change that to radians first. We see that's close to 45. So we're really
working with the tangent of 45 degrees. And if you remember your unit circle, 45 degrees
is pi over 4. So we're looking at the tangent of pi over 4 to estimate our point. So f of
x is the tangent of a value, tangent of any point. We're going to find that point. f prime,
we know, is the secant squared of x. We're specifically interested in pi over 2. So f
of pi over 2 is equal to the tangent of pi over 4. The tangent of pi over 4, we should
remember, is equal to 1. f prime of pi over 4 is the secant squared of pi over 4. If it
helps to remember, secant is 1 over cosine. Cosine is the x-coordinate root 2 over 2. The
reciprocal of that is going to be, actually I'll write down what I'm talking about here
at the top. It's 1 over the cosine of pi over 4, which is 1 over root 2 over 2, which
is the reciprocal of that 2 over the square root of 2. And if I rationalize, we get 2
root 2 over 2, which is equal to just the square root of 2. So square root of 2 is the secant,
but that's squared. So it's actually equal. Square root of 2 squared is just 2. Remembering
your trig from secant, how does that work? Secant of pi over 4 is equal to 2. All right,
let's make our linearization equation then. L of x is equal to the y-coordinate of 1 plus
the slope of 2 times x minus the x-coordinate, which is pi over 4. But we want the linearization
of 44 degrees, which we have to change that 44 degrees into radians. 44 degrees. Remember,
we multiply that by pi over 180. So we have 44 pi over 180 radians. There's no reason
to reduce because we're going to use our calculator. So we're doing the linearization
of 44 pi over 180 is equal to 1 plus 2 times 44 pi over 180 minus pi over 4. Plugging that
mess into our calculator, we get 0.9651. So that's our estimate. Let's check it with
the actual value of the tangent of 44 degrees. And since our calculator is probably in radian
mode, let's do the 44 pi over 180. Verify that my mode is in radians. Yes. So we've got
the tangent of 44 pi divided by 180 and it equals 0.9657. And look how close the actual
value was. It was only off by 0.0006. Only a twentieth of a percent. So we have this
idea that we can get close to any curve using a tangent line. And so if I move a little
bit to the right or if I move a little bit to the left, I can see what's happening kind
of near that point. But it kind of begs this question. How much are we off by? How much
are we changing by? This kind of leads into this concept of what we call differentials.
How much are we off by? As x changes, how much does y change in relationship to x? Is
there a relationship there? A differential is really just the amount a function changes
as a result of a small change. I'm going to move this up. As a result of a small change
in x, not the amount, the amount. The amount a function changes as a result of a small
change in x. So we know that dy dx is equal to the derivative of the function. dy though
is representing a change in y, a small change in y. And dx is representing a small change
in x. It's the change in y with respect to x. What's happening? How are things changing
really close to that point? So if we want to know how much the y's are changing, if
we multiply both sides by dx, then we get that dy is equal to f prime of x dx. And this
formula is the formula for a differential. It tells us for every small change in y it's
equal to the derivative of the function times the small change in x. So if I was asked to
find the differential equation of y equals 4x squared minus secant x, first we can take
the derivative, which is dy dx, equals 8x minus secant x tangent x, and then multiply
both sides by the dx so that we can see what a small change in y does. It's equal to whatever
8x minus secant x tangent x dx equals. So now if I know the amount of that small change
in x, I could plug that into this equation and estimate how y is changing for a given
small change in x. In fact, let's do an example equation where we do just that. Let's find
the differential and evaluate when x is equal to zero and the small change in x dx is equal
to 0.2. And let's do the function y equals 5x minus 3 over 2x plus 1. What we're asking
for is at the point zero on this function, if the x changes a little bit, if the x changes
by 0.2, how much would we expect the y to change by? What's the little bit y changes
by? Well for this one it's going to be quite a dramatic change because of its structure.
First we have to find the derivative, dy dx, and we know the derivative of a fraction
is the derivative of the top times the bottom minus the derivative of the bottom times the
top. And so that gives us 5 times 2x plus 1 minus 2 times 5x minus 3 all over the bottom
squared, the 2x plus 1 squared. Let's clean that up a little bit. 5 times 2, let's distribute
is 10x plus 5 minus distributing the negative 2 through 10x plus 6 over 2x plus 1 squared.
And that's nice because the 10x is subtract out to zero, so we're left with 11 over 2x
plus 1 squared. To get the differential we just multiply both sides by the dx, and we
find that the differential in y, the change in y, the difference in y is equal to 11 over
2x plus 1 squared dx. Now we're asked to evaluate it. Evaluate what the change in y is when
x is zero and the change in x is 0.2. Well we'll estimate that as 11 over 2 times x,
which is 0 plus 1 squared times the differential times the 0.2, which comes out to be 11 times
0.2 over 1, which is 2.2. So at the 0.0 when x changes to 0.2 we're going to expect the
y to change by about 2.2. And that's how we can find that differential and see kind
of that estimated change at the point. So the big thing for today though is linearization
to estimate a point, and we also took a little bit of a look at differentials. Take a look
at those, practice a few, and we will see you in class. One of the most important things
the derivative can tell us is where the minimum and maximum points are on a function. So that's
what the question we're going to look at today is how do we identify the minimum or the maximum
points of a function. And to set this up there's a little bit of vocabulary that we need to
be familiar with as we work with this concept. And to help us kind of visualize the vocabulary
I'm going to put a function here, let's say it's going to start at zero, it's going to
come down, come up really high, go down really low, come up a little bit, and then go towards
an asymptote at zero. The first vocabulary word we need to know is what is the absolute
minimum. And quite simply the absolute minimum is the lowest point. So let's actually give this
graph that we just made some coordinates here. Let's call this, we'll just make it one two up,
and one two down. So you can see that the absolute minimum, the absolute lowest point is at y equals
negative two. It's down low at y equals negative two. The other word we need to know is as you might
expect the absolute maximum, as you might expect, is the highest point on the graph. And so the
highest point on this graph is up at this top peak, we're going to call it the absolute maximum,
and you see that's at a height of two, y equals two is the absolute maximum of this graph. We can kind
of generalize this idea of absoluteness with what we call the absolute extrema. And that is basically
just talking about both the absolute max and min together. So when I say what are the absolute
extrema, I'm asking what's the absolute maximum, and what's the absolute minimum. But we don't just
have absolute maximums and minimums, we also have what we call local minimums, which we'll say is the
lowest point in the area. So there's nobody lower around here, so we're going to call it the absolute
minimum. And you'll see we've got a little dip off to the right, we can call the, whoops, we can call
that the local minimum, because it's kind of a valley, it's not the lowest valley, but it is the lowest
valley in the area. So that's going to be at y equals negative one. And similarly, we can have a local
maximum, which as you would expect is the highest point in the area. And the local maximum you'll see
off to the right with this little peak is the local max. It's the highest mountain in the area, it's just
not the highest mountain overall, and that one has a height of one, so we would say that is y equals one.
And similarly, we can lump those together and call them the local extrema, which is all the local min
maxes grouped together. What's interesting about all of these points, though, is if we notice the
derivative or the tangent line at each of these points is always going to be a flat line. The
derivative at each of these points is equal to zero. They have a slope of zero, slope of zero, slope of
zero, and slope of zero. Anytime the slope is zero, that's going to identify one of these local min or local
max, and possibly an absolute min or max. We have a special name for those points, those are called
critical points. Critical points are a point where the derivative is either zero or undefined. And what's
really important there is it might be a local extrema. It's not guaranteed to be a local min or a local
max, or even an absolute min or an absolute max, but it certainly is a very good candidate for that to occur. So
using this idea, this leads into, getting away from the vocabulary now, this leads into what we call the
extreme value theorem, or affectionately called the EVT, extreme value theorem. And basically the extreme value
theorem states that if a function f is continuous on an interval between a and b, then there is an absolute
maximum on a b and an absolute minimum.
In other words, if we take a closed interval, somewhere on that interval is going to be a maximum, and somewhere on that
interval is going to be a minimum. And what's really important to note is the min and max points are either a, the first
point of the interval, b, the end of the interval, or what we're going to call c. They're either at a, b, or c, where c is when the
derivative at that point equals zero, or where c is a critical point. What this is really saying is find the critical
points and test these points and the edges. And either the critical points or the edges are going to be your minimums and or your
maximums. Let's take a look at what we mean by that. Let's say that f of x is equal to 2x cubed minus 3x squared minus 12x plus 5, and we're going to look on the interval from zero to four to find the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum in that range.
Well, first we have to find the critical points, and that's when the derivative is equal to zero. Because it might level off and come back down, so where is that derivative equal to zero? Well, the derivative is 6x squared minus 6x minus 12, and we'll set that equal to zero.
Solving, we factor out a 6x squared minus x minus 2. Continuing to factor, we have x minus 2 times x plus 1, and so we've got two potential critical points, two and negative one. These are the critical points.
That's where the derivative is zero. That's where it levels off. However, we need to be careful. All we really care about is numbers between zero and four, so negative one doesn't really help us because it's outside of the range.
So now we know our critical points. We just have to test what is f of the critical point, what is f of the edge, and f of the other edge. One of those is the minimum, and one of those is the maximum, and one we don't really care about. So let's get our calculator.
Let's get y equals. Clear out any function that might be in there, and let's just type our function in here, 2x cubed minus 3x squared minus 12x plus 2x.
And we'll hit second table so that we can enter in our own values, and let's delete out the values we don't care about. So we're interested in when x is two, when x is zero, and when x is four.
And you see our y's are negative 15, 5, and 37. Negative 15, 5, and 37. And we can see on there that negative 15 is the minimum number. The 37 is the maximum number. We don't care about the zero.
But we have a maximum of 37 at x equals four, and we have a minimum of negative 15 at x equals two. We've identified our minimum and maximum using the extreme value theorem, or EVT, for this function on this range.
Let's try one more that might be a little more open.
Let's see what happens when we say f of x equals cosine squared of x, and we're going to do it on negative infinity to infinity.
It's not really a closed interval, but the extreme value theorem should still apply here. We can't check the extremes of negative infinity and positive infinity, but we certainly can check the critical points to see if there's any minimums or maximums.
So first, f prime of x, the derivative. It's a chain rule, so we have two times the cosine of x times the derivative of cosine, which is sine.
And we want to know when that derivative is equal to zero.
Well, it's already factored. We just have the cosine of x equals zero, and the sine of x equals zero.
First, thinking about the cosine of x on our unit circle, cosine of x is equal to zero, cosine's the x coordinate, it's equal to zero at the top and at the bottom, which means x here is equal to pi over two, and then we move a pi over to three pi over two.
So it's pi over two plus n pi's. Every pi around, and n can be any element of the integers. We'll say n is some integer, one, two, three, four, or it could be negative one, negative two, negative three, negative four.
For sine of x, sine of x is going to be the x coordinates, I'm sorry, the y coordinates, and the y coordinates are zero here at zero and pi. So sine of x tells us that x is equal to pi plus n pi.
Well, let's go to our calculator and see what we have for min's and max's. Hitting y equals, clearing out the old function. We want to do parentheses, the cosine of x, and we want to square it.
Delete out the old values for the table. And our first point is pi over two, we get zero. Add n pi, so we've got pi over two plus one pi.
We get zero again, and pi over two plus two pi. We get zero again, and again, so what we see is each of these guys is going to give us zero for a height.
Let's try the other ones. Let's just try pi and plus n pi from our second, from the sine. So just pi, pi is equal to one. What if we do pi plus pi, pi plus one pi, also equal to one? What about pi plus two pi?
Also equal to one. What we see is each of these always equals two, one. So we're going to have not an absolute max or an absolute min because it doesn't peak out, but we do get these relative maximums and relative minimums.
So we can say the relative, or not relative, but local, local minimum at x equals pi, or let's say local minimum of zero at x equals pi over two plus n pi, where n is an element of the integers.
And we have a local maximum of one at x equals pi plus n pi, where n is an element of the integers again.
Just to kind of see what's happening here, if I were to actually graph this, let's adjust our window.
Let's go from negative six pi to pi, and I want to label every pi over two, and I'm going to do a minimum of negative two and a maximum of two.
Then when I graph it, you see every pi over two, there's either a local min or a local max.
I didn't do the window I wanted, but it gets the idea here. As we get a local min or a local max, every pi over two, based on what we just found, and we know the heights one and the heights are zero.
So that's the big idea for today, is the extreme value theorem, that if f is continuous, all we need to do is find the critical points and check the edges, and one of those is going to be the absolute min, and one of those is going to be the absolute max.
Take a look at it on the homework today, and we will see you in class to talk about the extreme value theorem a little bit more.
Today we're going to take a look at what's called the mean value theorem. The mean value theorem takes a look at answering the question, when is the instantaneous rate of change, or the rate of change at any specific moment, equal to the mean value theorem.
So for example, if you go on an hour long trip, and you average 40 miles an hour on that trip, when were you actually driving 40 miles an hour? Sometimes you were driving faster, sometimes you were driving slower, but when were you actually equal to 40 miles an hour, or your average for the entire trip?
And this is what the mean value theorem finds for us.
The mean value theorem, or sometimes called MVT, first before we can use the mean value theorem, there are two requirements that must be met.
And if either of these are not true, the mean value theorem does not apply.
First, the function must be continuous on the range we're talking about, from A to B.
And second, it must be differential on that same range from A to B.
If the function is continuous between two numbers, and is differentiable on those two numbers, or between those two numbers, then we can say that there exists at least one point C.
That is, between A and B, such that the derivative at that point is equal to the rate of change, or the slope.
The F of B minus F of A over B minus A.
Maybe to help us see this, it might help to see it graphically what we're talking about.
What we're saying is, if I take a curve that goes from one point around up into another point, from A to B, where we've got F of A and F of B on the y-axis.
If I was to connect the point directly from A to B with a straight line, that slope is going to be my average rate of change between the two points.
And what the mean value theorem states is that there is at least one point then in between them, called C, where this tangent line is parallel.
In other words, the instantaneous rate of change at that point is the same as the average between A and B.
In fact, you might notice that there's two points on this graph that give us a parallel slope, so maybe we could call them C1 and C2.
This graph actually has two points where the slope is equal to the average slope between the two points.
That's what the mean value theorem states, is that there's a point in the middle that has the same tangent slope as the secant from A to B.
First, I mentioned the requirements of the mean value theorem. It's always important to check the requirements.
Is it differentiable? Is it continuous?
So we could ask the question, does the mean value theorem apply?
Or maybe it would be better to say, when does the mean value theorem apply? Let's change it to that.
When does the mean value theorem apply to y equals the square root of x squared minus x minus 2?
Well, we could take the derivative of just about any point, and it's continuous at just about every point, except for one important point, or one important thing.
What's under the square root must always be greater than or equal to zero.
So what we're really saying is x squared minus x minus 2 must be greater than or equal to zero for the mean value theorem to apply, because that's the only time it's actually continuous.
Well, if we factor that, we get x minus 2 times x plus 1 is greater than or equal to zero.
And so we find out we've got these two potential solutions of 2 and negative 1.
And we want to know when those solutions are positive specifically.
So if I make a little graph here, you can see we've got a zero at negative 1 and a zero at 2.
It's an x squared graph, so we should know it's a parabola.
And specifically, we want the graph to be positive.
We know it's positive on the left and the right, but negative in the center.
When it's negative in the center, the graph's not continuous.
So the range when the mean value theorem applies when it's actually continuous is from negative infinity to negative 1.
And actually we'll include the negative 1 because it's continuous at zero.
Union from 2 to infinity.
These are the points on which our graph is positive.
The graph of what's under the square root is positive, meaning we can actually take the square root.
It's actually continuous on those points.
So those are the only ranges when the mean value theorem would apply.
We could even ask more directly, does the mean value theorem apply to maybe y equals the natural log of 5x minus 1.
Over the interval from zero to 3.
Well we know the domain of the natural log, what's inside the natural log must be greater than zero.
It can't even be equal to zero.
So what we need to check is 5x minus 1 greater than zero going to put us outside of the range of zero to three that this problem's interested in.
Add 1, 5x is greater than 1, divide by 5, x must be greater than one-fifth.
So we would say no, the mean value theorem does not apply because it is undefined from zero to one-fifth.
If we were just going from one to three, the mean value theorem would work because it's defined on all those points, it's continuous on all those points.
But because it's discontinuous from zero to one-fifth, the mean value theorem will not apply over the range of zero to three.
Let's try another one.
Y equals e to the 3x squared minus 1.
With e and with x squared and with multiplication and with subtraction, we know the graph is continuous.
There's no jumps, no breaks, no holes, no gaps.
It's also differentiable on the entire graph.
The derivative, we'd have to use a nice little chain rule, but if we took the derivative, it would be e to the 3x squared minus 1 times the derivative of the top stuff, which is 6x and the minus 1 goes to zero.
But this is also defined on all points.
So there's no where this is discontinuous, there's no where this is not differentiable.
I didn't even give the range, but let's just give it one because I should have.
Let's say over negative two to two.
Definitely between negative two and two, this is all defined, so we would say yes, the mean value theorem is going to apply to this function on this range.
Which means between negative two and two, the average rate of change can be found as an instantaneous rate of change.
We don't know where, but we definitely know it exists.
Okay then.
Let's see now that we've checked the requirements, let's see if we can use the mean value theorem.
Let's do it kind of visually.
I want to graph this function and connect the a and b, and then show tangent lines.
There's at least one.
There might be more, so I'll put the s in parentheses with the same slope.
So the graph we're working with is f of x equals x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x.
So let's take an x out to try and graph it.
It gives us x squared minus 6x plus 8.
Continuing to factor, that's x minus two times x minus four.
And so we have zeros at x equals zero, two, and four.
So we should be able to graph this.
Before we graph this, let's go ahead and figure out what the slope is between the points, between the edges.
I didn't even give a range.
Let's do the range on negative one to six.
So let's find f of negative one and f of six, and we'll have our calculator help with that.
Just to make it a little quicker, we have x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x.
And I'll go to my table, let's delete out the values we don't want.
At negative one, it's equal to negative fifteen, and at six, it's equal to forty-eight.
So we had negative fifteen and forty-eight.
So this graph's not going to be really to scale.
But at negative one, and then one, two, three, four, five, six, up here is going to be forty-eight.
That means we've got about negative fifteen down here somewhere.
We have a zero at zero, two, and four.
We know at six, it's equal to forty-eight, and at negative one, it's negative fifteen.
So this graph's going to come in, go up, go down, and up.
But what this problem really wants us to do is connect the endpoints with this line,
and then go ahead and just show graphically that we can draw a parallel line that's tangent to the graph,
at least at one point.
And you notice there's two points where those lines are parallel, probably a little too steep there.
Too far the other direction.
Tricky.
There we go.
Parallel lines, same slope, tangent to the points on the graph between our A and our B,
between negative one and negative six.
But just doing it graphically is a little boring.
Let's actually find the points.
Let's find the points C where we get that average rate of change is equal to the instantaneous rate of change,
or F prime of C, the derivative at C is F of B minus F of A over B minus A.
And let's go ahead and do the same function that we did up above.
We're going to do F of X equals X cubed minus 6X squared plus 8X on the same range of negative one comma six.
And we're trying to find these black dots that we just found.
Where are those points that we're going to get the same slope as the average slope?
Well first let's find the average slope.
That's F of B minus F of A over B minus A,
or F of 6 using the endpoints minus F of negative one over 6 minus negative one.
We just saw that F of 6 is equal to 48.
Minus F of negative one is negative 15 over 6 minus negative one.
So we have 63 over 7, which is equal to a nice pretty nine.
So we want to know when the derivative is going to be equal to nine.
So we're going to find the derivative F prime of X, which is 3X squared minus 12X plus 8.
We want to know when that's equal to the average slope or equal to nine.
We need to subtract nine from both sides to make it equal to zero.
3X squared minus 12X minus one equals zero.
And you might see that that's not going to factor very nicely.
So let's see.
RX then using the quadratic formula is equal to 12 plus or minus the square root of 12 squared
minus four times three times negative one all over two times three.
And when I do that on my calculator, I'll end up with two values.
First, if we subtract, you get negative 0.08 and 4.08.
So my graph's not really to scale, but we would have hit those slopes at negative 0.08 and 4.08.
So I went through and made a graph that was more to scale than the one that we had before.
The red curve that you see here is our function that we've been working with.
And then what I did is I put a dot at negative one comma negative 15 and six comma 48.
And you can see I've connected them with this orange line.
Then what I did is I put a purple dot here at the first point that we had, the negative 0.08, and drew a tangent line.
I also put a dot at the second point that we found at 4.08 and drew a tangent line.
And you see that those blue tangent lines are perfectly parallel to the orange tangent line.
And what that means is that the instantaneous rate of change at those two points on those blue lines
is equal to the average rate of change of the orange line that connects the two endpoints.
And that's visually how the mean value theorem works.
So our two answers do work.
The mean value theorem is right there on your screen.
The big thing we're talking about today is that if the function is continuous and differentiable
between the two endpoints, there exists at least one point C such that the instantaneous rate of change
is equal to the average rate of change or the slope between the two points.
Take a look at the assignment and try a few of these and we'll take a closer look at them.
In class.
The derivatives can tell us a whole bunch about the shape of a graph of a function.
And that's what we're going to look at today.
We're going to answer the question, what do derivatives tell us about the shape
of a graph?
First thing we're going to look at is what is called the first derivative test.
And to kind of set up what the first derivative test does, I'm going to draw a little picture here.
Actually three pictures, three little graphs.
And we're going to compare what the derivative is doing on each.
So here is some function f kind of curving upwards.
We'll have some function f curving downwards.
And then we'll have a function f that comes up to a point.
And we're going to be interested, particularly at a point c, kind of in the middle of all three of these.
And what the derivative is doing at each one of those.
Now we know the derivative is the slope of the tangent line at that point.
And so if I draw my point in the tangent line for the one that's increasing,
for the one that's curving upwards, you see the slope is also going upwards.
In other words, if the function f of x is increasing,
the derivative f prime of x is positive.
And similarly at the point c, on the curve that's decreasing or going down,
you'll see that the slope of the tangent line is going downhill.
It is negative.
So we'll say that when f of x is decreasing,
the derivative f prime of x is negative.
Now at the peak here on the third graph,
you'll notice that it's neither increasing or decreasing.
And in fact, the tangent line is completely flat at that point.
So if f of x is neither increasing nor decreasing,
then f prime of x is zero, which is neither positive nor negative.
Now we recognize that point.
As a point when the derivative is zero, we call that a critical point.
We already know that critical points are where the derivative is zero.
It's either a maximum or a minimum value.
So let's summarize that conclusion in the actual test, the first derivative test.
What we're going to do with the first derivative test to learn about the function
is first we're going to find all critical points.
And as a reminder, that's when f prime of x is equal to zero or it's undefined.
Once we find those points, we can use those points to divide f prime of x into subregions.
And then we can test each subregion.
And we'll find out where the derivative is zero.
That's going to be where the graph levels out.
And then we'll know in between those points is the graph increasing or decreasing
based on what the derivative is doing.
So let's see if we can use that test with an example here.
The example we're going to play with is f of x equals x cubed minus 12x.
We're going to decide where is the derivative zero, where is it increasing, where is it decreasing.
Well first we have to know the derivative, f prime of x is equal to 3x squared minus 12.
And to find those critical points, we set it equal to zero.
So if I add 12 to both, actually let's just factor it.
Let's do 3 times x squared minus 4 equals zero, 3 times x plus 2 times x minus 2 equals zero.
So our critical points are x equals negative 2 and positive 2.
Those are our critical points.
Then what we're going to do is we're going to divide kind of a number line into those subregions.
We've got negative 2 and positive 2 and we know at those points the derivative is zero.
So the graph is flat at those points.
So what's f prime in those regions?
The easiest way to test that is we're going to go to our calculator.
On the calculator we're going to hit the y equals button and type in our derivative function.
So we know if the derivative is positive or negative.
The derivative function was 3x squared minus 12.
And we'll go to our table, second table.
Let's delete out the old values.
Now first we need to test a point in each of these three regions.
Left of negative 2, between negative 2 and positive 2, and right of 2.
So left of negative 2 we can pick any number.
Let's pick negative 5 and we see it's a positive 63.
So left of negative 2 the derivative is positive.
What that means is that f, the function left of negative 2 is actually increasing because the derivative is positive.
Between negative 2 and 2, let's put the number zero in, it's negative 12.
The derivative is negative between, which means the function itself is decreasing between negative 2 and 2.
Greater than 2, maybe pick the number positive 5.
It's positive, all we care about is the sign, and so that tells us that it is increasing over that range.
Now we know where the graph is increasing, decreasing, and then increasing again.
It's giving us a general idea of the shape of the graph.
But there's more to the graph than just whether it's increasing or decreasing.
It helps to know what direction or how it is curving.
When it goes up on this left part, is it curving up, or is it curving up?
Those are two very different curves in red there.
We need to know what type of curve it's doing as it's increasing.
And that leads us to our next topic, the next thing the derivatives tell us about the graph.
And this is what we call concavity.
Now concavity might be a new concept to us, so let's set it up first with a little bit of vocabulary.
The first word we need to know is what is concave up.
Concave up means the graph itself appears to be rotating counterclockwise.
And if you think about a general parabola, starting from the left you see it rotates counterclockwise as you draw the parabola.
You also could have something approaching an asymptote, kind of giving a counterclockwise rotation.
Or even if it was increasing, a counterclockwise rotation.
Going from left to right you're moving around the circle counterclockwise.
And that kind of makes sense counterclockwise if we think about our unit circle, which we're very familiar with.
We count unit circles counterclockwise.
So that's a positive concave up motion going counterclockwise.
Another way that I like to think about concave up is if I think about the parabola, it looks like the U of concave up.
And that reminds me that U up is concave up.
As you might expect, the next word is concave down.
And here we are rotating clockwise.
Or if you think about the unit circle in the negative direction, if you start from the left a negative parabola is concave down.
It's going clockwise around and you could also get things approaching asymptotes in much the similar way.
These all are concave down.
And as you might expect with calculus we're interested in when we switch between a concave up motion and a concave down motion.
Just like when we switch from increasing and decreasing we have critical points.
With concavity, when we switch between concave up and concave down, what we end up with are called inflection points.
And that is where the concavity changes.
For example, the graph could be first concave up and then it's going to switch to concave down.
Right in the center there you see the rotation direction changes.
It starts out going clockwise, or counterclockwise, then it changes to clockwise.
The classic X cubed also, let's see, this one starts out going counterclockwise and then turning it to clockwise.
You start concave up and then you change to concave down in the middle.
Those are inflection points where the concavity changes.
And just like a critical point is when the derivative is equal to zero, concavity can also be found.
The way we find those inflection points is we look at the second derivative, f prime prime of x, and see when it's zero or undefined.
Now concavity tells us a whole lot when it's combined with the first derivative test and whether the graph is increasing or decreasing.
Let's look at concavity and increasing, decreasing relationships.
And to set this up we're going to do a little tic-tac-toe board here.
And we're going to look at what happens if the graph is increasing and it's concave up.
If it's increasing and concave up, we have to rotate counterclockwise as we increase.
Contrast that with increasing and concave down.
Now as we are increasing we have to rotate clockwise which takes us off in the other direction.
Similarly we can compare what happens when we are decreasing.
If we are decreasing and we're concave up as we go down we have to rotate counterclockwise.
Versus if it's decreasing and concave down as we rotate it has to rotate downward clockwise.
So if we know both of these facts about the graph we will very quickly know the shape of the graph and what is going on at various points.
And we test for concavity very similar to how we test the first derivative test.
Except instead of finding critical points first we find inflection points.
And once we find those inflection points we can divide the second derivative f'' of x into subregions.
And again we will test each subregion.
So let's take a look at just doing that test for concavity and then we'll bring it together here in just a minute.
So number four going back to that same example we had before where f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x.
We already said the first derivative was 3x squared minus 12.
The second derivative then we can quickly calculate to be 6x.
And so we're going to divide the number line into subregions based on those inflection points based on when that second derivative equals zero.
We'll divide both sides by 6 and x equals zero is my inflection point.
And so right at zero is where we are going to split up the f'' to see what's happening.
Where is the second derivative positive and negative?
Going to y equals now I'm going to clear out the second derivative or the first derivative we'll put in the second derivative equation which is just 6x.
And then go to the table, delete out what I don't need.
And I might have been able to do this in my head, in fact I should be able to do this one in my head.
But just to show you for the more complex equations I'm going to test something to the left of zero, maybe negative five.
And I see the second derivative is negative.
Then we'll test something to the right of zero, maybe positive five, and we'll see the second derivative is positive.
So we've divided into subregions, we know where the second derivative is positive and negative.
Now we know if our function, the original function, x cubed minus 12 is concave up or concave down.
We see on the left it's negative so it is concave down to begin with, up until zero where it becomes concave up.
So we know on the left it's going to have some type of clockwise motion, on the right it's going to have some type of counterclockwise motion.
Kind of run out of space.
Now that we know how these tests all work, let's bring it all together.
The first derivative, which I'm going to always represent in blue here, is 3x squared minus 12.
And we know if we make that equal to zero, we found out earlier that gave us critical points at negative two and positive two.
The second derivative I'm going to represent now in green is going to be 6x, which when we made that equal to zero, that gave us inflection point at zero.
I strongly encourage you color code your critical points and your inflection points so you don't get them confused as you're breaking up into subregions here.
We've got critical points at negative two and two, so these guys are going to split up my F prime, my first derivative.
I've got an inflection point at zero, so that's how I'm going to split up the second derivative of F prime prime.
And ultimately we're interested in what's happening to our function F in each of these regions.
There's not actually a lot of space to the left, so I'm going to rewrite that.
Give myself a little more space. F, F prime, and F prime prime.
First in green to the left of zero, we found out the second derivative was negative.
So we know it's going to be concave down.
To the right of zero, we found out that the second derivative was positive.
And so we know there that the graph is concave up.
In blue, in the middle, the first derivative to the left of two, now we're looking at the blue lines, ignoring the green lines,
in the middle of two, we found out the second derivative was positive, which meant the graph is increasing.
Between negative two and positive two, we found out the second derivative was negative, which means the graph is decreasing between those points.
In negative two, we found out that the first derivative was positive, and so we know the graph is increasing.
So now at the very top in red, we should have an idea what the graph of F is doing.
Left of negative two, we see that we're concave down and increasing.
Concave down and increasing, the graph is going to curve clockwise while increasing.
Then, between negative two and zero, we see it's still concave down, but it's decreasing.
Decreasing in concave down is going to go clockwise and downward.
But after zero, we're still decreasing, but the graph is concave up, which means it's going to rotate its curve to be concave up as it's decreasing.
To the right of two, it is concave up and increasing, so we're rotating counterclockwise as we increase.
Now we have a lot better idea of what's happening with this graph.
Let's see if we can actually make our graph.
I'm not going to put anything on the white axis yet because we don't quite have those.
What we do know about the graph is, and I'm going to put a little dotted line,
just to kind of mark right there, now negative two is going to be some type of critical point,
so I should expect it to level off when it hits the blue line.
At two is another critical point, so I should expect it to level off when it hits that blue line.
Then at zero is going to be my inflection point where the rotation changes.
We know our graph increases and rotates clockwise up to a critical point.
Then it's going to decrease, continuing to rotate clockwise until it hits an inflection point where the rotation should change,
but it should still be decreasing until it hits a critical point.
Then we keep rotating counterclockwise as we increase, and I want to notice all the elements of our graph.
It starts out increasing, then it's decreasing, then it's increasing.
It starts out rotating clockwise until the inflection point when it rotates counterclockwise,
giving us the concave down on the left and concave up on the right.
This is how the derivatives can help us get a very good idea of the shape of the function.
Try a few of these on your own, come back to class ready to discuss them, and we will see you then.
Now that we've taken a look at concavity and increasing and decreasing functions,
we've just got a little bit to add to our conversation as we look at how do we graph functions with calculus.
The main missing piece we have right now is what happens with limits at infinity.
Basically what happens is we take the limit as x goes to infinity of our function f of x,
or what happens as the limit as x goes to negative infinity of our function f of x.
The big idea we look for here is we consider kind of a who takes over as x gets large.
For example, if I wanted to do the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x squared minus 7x plus 5 all over 5x cubed plus 2x squared minus 7,
who's going to take over in this case?
Well, in the numerator the 3x squared will take over because x squared is bigger than any x or any constant.
So when we square really big numbers it's going to become huge.
And in the denominator the x cubed is going to take over because it's got the highest exponent.
In fact, what we could also say is that the x cubed is going to get bigger faster than the numerator.
What we're really saying is the numerator is going to be whatever it becomes,
but the denominator is going to become the biggest part of this function.
That 5x cubed is just going to become huge faster than any other part of this function.
Well, if we take any old number and divide it by just a huge number as x gets close to infinity,
dividing by a huge number is going to basically leave nothing left.
And you can see that this limit as x goes to infinity is basically going to equal zero.
Similarly, if I wanted to look at the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x cubed minus 5x plus 1 over 1x cubed plus 6x minus 2,
similarly we can see in the numerator the 3x cubed begins to take over the numerator as it becomes huge.
And in the denominator the regular x cubed takes over.
But as we can see, neither one of those is going to get bigger faster,
so essentially they are going to get bigger at the same rate
because whatever we cube in the numerator we're also cubing in the denominator,
and essentially that part that's cubed will reduce or divide out.
The x cubes divide out leaving behind on the biggest part 3 over 1,
or in this case just the number 3.
Because the x cubes ultimately as they become huge divide out
and everything else is too small to worry about, we're just left with 3.
Compare that with the limit as x goes to, let's do negative infinity this time,
of 6x minus 2 over the square root of 4x squared plus 3x.
I'm going to scroll up a bit so we can see better.
The numerator we can see the 6x takes over.
That's 6 times some huge negative number,
which means that 6x becomes a large negative in the numerator.
In the denominator the 4x squared takes over,
but we're taking the square root of that, and so that becomes the square root of 4x squared taking over.
But notice that reduces to 2x.
And because we square the negative, the x squared, the negative squared becomes a positive,
so 2x is actually a large positive number.
And that again is because the x squared makes that part positive,
times a positive is positive and the square root is still positive.
So ultimately what we've ended up with is the x's, 6x over 2x,
where the x's can essentially divide out, but not the negative.
The negative is still there.
As x goes to negative infinity, the numerator is going to go to negative 6,
while the denominator goes to 2, giving us a final limit at infinity of negative 3.
And this is kind of the game we keep playing as we look at solving these limits at infinity.
We look at who's taking over, what's happening to x as it gets huge, whether positive or negative.
And we have to be very careful with what's happening with the signs.
Is it positive or negative?
So if I want the limit as x goes to infinity of x cubed minus 6x over x squared plus 5,
again in the numerator the x cubed is going to take over.
In the denominator the x squared is going to take over,
but what you see is they're not growing at the same rate.
This time the numerator grows faster.
Because cubed is going to get huge faster than squared will get huge.
And so similar to our first example, we're going to end up with a big number
divided by something that's much smaller that's not growing at the same rate.
So if I take a huge number and divide it by something small, I'm still going to be huge.
So in this case, this one's actually going to keep getting bigger up to infinity.
We need this concept of the limit as x goes to infinity to see what's happening with the in behavior,
or on the far left or the far right of the graph.
The first example we took a look at on the far edge of the graph to the right towards infinity,
this graph is approaching an asymptote at zero.
The second example at infinity is approaching an asymptote at three.
The third example at negative infinity is approaching an asymptote at negative three.
Well the fourth example is not approaching an asymptote at all,
it's just going off to infinity forever getting bigger.
So we're going to combine this concept of limits at infinity with all the other stuff
we've seen about graphing a function.
So first, our general strategy.
Let's get everything down in one place that we know about how to graph a function.
First, it's helpful to find the domain.
Where is the graph or the function undefined?
Do we have a whole?
Do we have a vertical asymptote?
What's going on with the domain?
The second thing that we found back in pre-calculus days was we found the x and y intercepts.
Then we're going to add what we talked about today,
which is finding the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x,
because that's going to tell us the end behavior or what's happening at the edge of the graph.
Does it approach an asymptote or does it go off to infinity?
Speaking of asymptotes, we can also find any vertical asymptotes.
Those are going to come from the domain, not the holes.
The holes and the vertical asymptotes come from the domain,
but specifically the vertical asymptotes will want to label if there are any.
Then, using, and I'm going to always do this one in blue,
using f prime of x, identify the critical points
and increasing, decreasing regions.
That's what we talked about in our previous video from section 4.5, the first derivative test.
Then, using, and I'll always do this in green,
prime prime of x or the second derivative,
identify inflection points and concavity.
Is it concave up or concave down?
When we put all this together, we should have a very good idea of what this graph looks like
before ever touching the graph button on our calculator.
Let's see if we can work through one example
and graph f of x equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2.
I'll work through all the pieces we just talked about.
First, the domain.
There's cubing, adding, subtracting, multiplying here, no restrictions on those.
The domain is all real numbers, so nothing fancy there.
To find x intercepts, we set the whole thing equal to 0.
I should do a different color here.
Let's say 0 equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2.
I'm going to use the rational root theorem in synthetic division to find these zeros.
The options are plus or minus 1 and plus or minus 2.
Let's try first x equals 1, 1, 0, negative 3, and 2.
Don't forget the 0 for the x squared.
Bring down the 1, bring down the 1.
1 times 1 is 1, negative 2.
Getting ahead of myself, negative 2 and 0.
That did work, so x equals 1 is a 0.
Now I have 1x squared plus 1x minus 2 equals 0,
which is x plus 2 times x minus 1.
Bring down the other factor that we got of x plus 1.
Oops, not x plus 1. We got to subtract 1 from both sides.
That's x minus 1.
Since we've got two matching guys, we're going to say that x plus 2 times x minus 1 squared equals 0.
So x is equal to negative 2 and positive 1.
Those are the x intercepts.
For the y intercepts, we only have to make the x's all equal to 0,
so we get 0 cubed minus 3 times 0 plus 2, which is 2.
So y equals 2 is our y intercept.
Part C is to look at the limit.
I'm going to scroll up to give us a little more room.
As x goes to infinity of our function x cubed minus 3x plus 2,
you see the x cubed takes over, so if we cube infinity,
what we end up with is just infinity.
We also need to consider the other limit as x goes to negative infinity
off the left of our graph of x cubed minus 3x plus 2.
Again, the x cubed takes over because it gets bigger faster than anything else,
but this time we're cubing a negative large number.
When we cube a negative large number, we'll get a negative larger number.
So this on the left side is going to go to negative infinity.
So we know from the left it's towards negative infinity,
and it's going to exit on the right towards positive infinity.
Vertical asymptotes come from when the denominator equals 0,
so we have no fraction here with this function, so there are none.
With fractions, you'll have to be careful of those.
E is our first derivative test, finding the critical points
and where it's increasing or decreasing.
So f of x again was x cubed minus 3x plus 2,
so our derivative is 3x squared minus 3.
And we find our critical points by making it equal to 0.
Factor out of 3, x squared minus 1, x plus 1, x minus 1,
so our critical points are negative 1 and positive 1.
We're going to combine that with the information from part f,
which is the second derivative.
The first derivative we already have,
so taking the second derivative there is 6x,
so that's equal to 0, and so x is equal to 0 becomes an inflection point.
Now for the sake of our graph, it's going to be helpful to know,
well actually let's, over here to the right first,
let's make our number line.
We're going to break it up with an inflection point at 0
and a critical point at negative 1 and positive 1.
So the critical point split it up into three regions.
The inflection point splits it into two regions,
so we can consider what's happening with f prime prime,
f prime, and ultimately learn about f.
Okay, on my calculator here, I'm going to hit y equals.
In y1, I'm going to type in the original function,
because it's going to give me some key points
that I'm going to want to actually know their exact coordinates.
So in y1, my first, the function is x cubed minus 3x plus 2.
My y2, this is the first derivative, 3x squared minus 3.
y3 is my second derivative of 6x.
Now I'm going to go second table,
delete out this information I don't want.
First thing I'm going to do is figure out the exact coordinates
of the critical points and the inflection points.
My critical points are at negative 1 and 1,
and the inflection point is at 0.
What's nice is that it gives me the coordinates
of negative 4, 1 and 1, 0 as my critical points.
So we have negative 1 comma 4,
and 1 comma 0 as my critical points.
We're going to need those in a minute.
And the other thing we pulled off the calculator
is that the inflection point 0 is at 0 comma 2.
We're going to need that inflection point here in just a minute.
Now let's see if we can learn what's happening
in each of the regions that we've mapped out here for our graph.
Actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to y equals,
and I'm going to highlight the equals on y1
because I don't care about f right now.
I just care about what's happening
with the first derivative and the second derivative.
So if I highlight the equals and hit enter,
you'll see it's no longer highlighted.
Now when I go to second table,
it's just going to tell me y2 and y3.
So first for the second derivative,
that's in the third column there,
the second derivative, we need something to the left of 0,
about negative 5.
To the left of 0, you see y3, the second derivative, is negative.
So my second derivative is negative,
it is concave down to begin with.
It's rotating clockwise to begin with.
To the right, maybe at positive 5,
you see the second derivative is y3.
It's positive, so it's positive on the right,
which means it's concave up.
Now let's go to the blue, the first derivative.
We want to know if it's positive or negative,
so we know if it's increasing or decreasing.
Y2 has my first derivative in it,
so I'm looking at this column.
First we need something to the left of negative 1.
We already have negative 5,
and notice it's a positive number,
so it starts out positive,
which means it is increasing initially.
Something between negative 1 and 1 would be 0.
Notice the derivative is negative,
so it's negative, which means it's decreasing
until the next critical point.
Something to the right of 1,
we could use the number 5 that we already have,
which is positive,
so we know it's increasing after that point.
Then we're going to put this all together
to decide with increasing, decreasing,
concave up and concave down,
what's the general shape in each of these four regions.
Starting out concave down, counterclockwise rotation,
but increasing, we know our graph starts going up
with a clockwise rotation.
Still concave down after the critical point,
but now decreasing, it's going to go down
with that concave down motion.
From the bottom of that, though, after 0,
after that inflection point,
it needs to be concave up, but still decreasing,
so you'll start to see the rotation go
counterclockwise after 0,
but then start increasing
after the critical point at 1, still concave up.
So we can kind of see the shape,
the direction it's going to go,
kind of like an upside down parabola,
it's going to turn to an upside up parabola.
Notice it exits at negative infinity on the left,
like we expect, it goes off to positive infinity
on the right, like we'd expect.
We're going to put all this information together
to make our final big graph.
Alright, first, let's go through our list
of things we discovered.
The domain's all real numbers,
but we have x-intercepts at negative 2 and 1.
I did those in purple.
We had x-intercepts at negative 2 and positive 1.
We also have a y-intercept at 2,
so at 2 there's a y-intercept.
We know on the left it's going off at negative infinity,
on the right it's going off at positive infinity.
We also know that there is a critical point,
and I'm going to do this in blue so I don't miss my colors,
critical points at negative 1, 4,
and a critical point at 1, 0,
which is also one of our intercepts.
We also know there's an inflection point at 0, 2,
which is also one of our intercepts,
but that is an inflection point where it's going to switch rotation
from a negative rotation to a positive rotation.
So we should see it comes in from the negative,
starts out increasing with a negative rotation,
a critical point, and now it's decreasing,
but once it hits that inflection point,
the rotation is going to change direction,
hits the critical point, and now it's increasing,
and now we've got our graph of our function.
Notice just like we expected,
the first derivative told us it starts increasing,
then decreasing, then increasing.
The second derivative says it's concave down or a negative rotation,
then concave up or a positive rotation,
switching at that inflection point,
and that is how we can graph our functions using calculus.
There's a lot of pieces, so you do need to practice this,
so take a look at the book, the assignment,
and we'll see you in class to discuss this further.
All this conversation around graphs, the shapes of graphs,
when the derivative equals zero to find key points,
has a very important application,
and that is in what we call the applied optimization problems.
So our question that we're going to attempt to answer
is how do we optimize
and the most efficient, the fastest, the biggest, the smallest?
How do we optimize a value of interest?
And ultimately what we're really asking is
when does the derivative equal zero?
Because that's the peak, or the valley,
that's the optimal point for the most efficient,
or most profit, or least expense, or shortest distance,
or shortest time that we're trying to get after.
So let's take a look at a few of these classic optimization problems,
and then from there you should be able to solve
lots of different types of optimization problems.
The first classic problem is what we call the rectangle problem,
where we're generally trying to either minimize the perimeter,
maximize the area, something related to that effect.
So let's say a farmer has 80 feet of fencing
to enclose a pasture along a rock wall.
What that means is he only has to actually fence three sides of the wall,
not all four sides of the wall.
So what dimensions would maximize the area?
So let's draw a picture to kind of see what's going on.
We've got this rock wall already,
and what this farmer's going to do is he's going to make a fence
that goes alongside that rock wall.
So he's really only fencing three sides.
And we need to give variables to the sides as we calculate the area,
because that's what we want to maximize.
So we'll say it's an x by y fence,
which means the other side's also x,
if we're thinking about perimeter.
And we know that the area of any rectangle
is equal to the length times the width.
Or in this case, x times the y.
But that gives us two variables.
So we need to constrain one of those variables
so that we can reduce it down to one variable.
And that's going to come from the limit we're given,
is that we have 80 feet of fencing available to us.
Well, if there's 80 feet available to us,
that means the total distance,
x plus y plus x, or 2x plus y,
that total distance has to equal the 80 feet of fencing.
Well, the easiest variable to solve for here would probably be y.
So we'll subtract 2x,
and we'll say that y is equal to 80 minus 2x,
and we'll replace the y in our area formula
to be 80 minus the 2x.
To make life easier, we'll go ahead and distribute.
So area is equal to 80x minus 2x squared.
And we want to maximize this area.
So if we think about maybe the graph of the area,
the area is going to increase to a certain point
and then come down after that point.
We're looking to find that maximum point,
and we know at that point the slope of the derivative is equal to 0.
So let's find the derivative of the area in terms of x.
The derivative of the area is equal to 80 minus 4x,
and we just need to make that equal to 0
to find the critical point where this fence area is optimized.
Add the 4x to both sides,
and 80 equals 4x.
Divide both sides by 4,
and x is equal to 20.
Now that we know where that maximum occurs,
we plug that in for x in the y equals equation.
y equals 80 minus 2 times 20,
or 80 minus 40, which is 40.
So for the farmer to maximize the area of his three-sided fence,
along the rock wall,
he should do a 20 foot by 40 foot fence.
I think fence actually has a C in it.
20 foot by 40 foot fence.
That's the idea of the rectangle problem.
Let's try another problem.
This is probably one of the most classic problems of all calculus.
What I'm going to call the run and swim problem.
And rather than write this all out,
I'm just going to kind of draw a picture
and narrate what I'm talking about.
We've got this river.
That's water.
Does that look like a river?
We've got this river,
and a person is on one side of the river,
and he wants maybe a pot of gold
that's on the other side of the river.
It is going to be 9 miles down the river,
is where that pot of gold is,
but the river is also 2 miles wide.
What this person can do
is he's going to run along the river a ways.
Then he's going to jump in the water
and swim diagonally across a ways.
What we want to know is how far should he run,
so we'll call the running x,
before he starts swimming,
in order to get to that pot of gold
in the most efficient, quickest way possible.
Well, we need to know a few things about this person.
Let's say the person runs 6 miles per hour
and swims 3 miles per hour.
So how far should the person run?
That's right at the question.
How far should the person run before swimming?
Well, let's see if we can get a little more information on this.
Swim distance, let's call that swim distance y,
so we've got it labeled.
Then we're going to have this gap here on this right triangle.
We already know the height of the triangles too,
but that gap, if the total distance
from the person to the pot of gold is 9,
and he runs or she runs x,
it's going to be 9 minus x
is what's going to be left horizontally.
Let's give ourselves a little bit more workspace.
Well, we should remember that the formula for distance
is equal to rate times time,
and we're trying to minimize the time,
so let's go ahead and solve this for time,
and we'll say time is equal to the total distance
divided by the rate.
And we know that the person is going to be running
at a rate of 6 miles per hour,
so the run time is going to be the distance,
we don't know x,
divided by the rate or 6 miles per hour.
While the swim time is going to be the distance
divided by the rate.
The swim time, the y, the diagonal, we don't know,
or the swim distance, the y, the diagonal, we don't know,
but we do know the rate at which the person swims
is 3 miles per hour.
So the total time is equal to the sum of these things,
x over 6 plus y over 3.
The other thing we're going to use to our advantage is
we have a right triangle formed on the edge of the river.
Pythagorean theorem tells us that 9 minus x squared
plus the height, which is 2 squared,
is equal to the swim distance, which is y squared.
Doing a little simplifying, squaring the 2 gives us 4,
but we want to get rid of the y squared,
so taking the square root of both sides,
we'll have 9 minus x squared plus 4
under the square root is equal to y.
So let's replace the y in our time equation
with that information.
Time is equal to x over 6
plus the square root of 9 minus x squared
plus 4 over 3.
This time is what we want to minimize.
In other words, the graph here is going to come down to some point
and we need to find out what point has a slope of 0
on its tangent line.
And the way we do that is we take the derivative
and set the derivative equal to 0.
Square roots are a little bit more work to take the derivative of,
so let's actually rewrite this with a one half power.
So we have x over 6 plus the 9 minus x squared
plus 4 to the one half power over 3
because that's going to be easier to take a derivative of.
So the derivative of the time,
the derivative of x over 6 is just 1 over 6
plus, let's make a big fraction and we'll do this piece by piece.
First the one thirds are constant, so that's going to be out front.
We can bring the exponent of one half out front
as we take the derivative,
which means we've got a 2 in the denominator
and a 1 in the numerator.
Then we reduce the exponent by 1,
which makes it to the negative one half power.
The negative one half power,
the negative exponent moves it down to the denominator.
So now we've got 9 minus x squared plus 4
to the one half but in the denominator
because of the negative exponent.
Then we have to multiply by the derivative of the inside
using our chain rule.
So we've got this little piece,
the 9 minus x squared,
that we can take the derivative of,
the 2 out front times the 9 minus x.
Reduce the exponent by 1, just leaves 9 minus x.
Then we have to multiply by the derivative of inside that
and the derivative of negative x is negative 1.
Let's see if we can clean that up a little bit.
What I notice is we've got 2's that divide out,
which is nice.
So let's take this negative
and do a positive times a negative is a negative.
So we've got 1 sixth minus,
we're left with the 9 minus x in the numerator.
Let's do this in brown actually,
it's a better color.
We've got 1 sixth minus,
9 minus x is left in the numerator
and that's it, so I don't really need the parentheses.
Over 3, and let's go ahead and take that one half
and make it back into a square root,
times 9 minus x squared plus 4.
We know when this derivative equals 0,
we've got our minimum time.
Switch over to purple,
we're going to add that first fraction to the other,
that second fraction to the other side,
giving us 1 sixth equals 9 minus x
over 3 square roots of 9 minus x squared plus 4.
We now have 2 equal fractions.
We can solve 2 equal fractions by multiplying the diagonals.
1 times 3 times the square root is 3 square roots
of 9 minus x squared plus 4 equals 6 times 9 minus x.
We'll go back to blue here as we solve.
Square root is going to be annoying,
so let's square both sides,
actually blue is a bad color,
let's do green to get a little more contrast.
Square both sides,
and we know when we square both sides
because it's all multiplying,
we square the pieces,
3 squared is 9,
squaring the square root gets rid of it,
so it's 9 times 9 minus x squared plus 4 equals 6 squared is 36
times 9 minus x squared.
Let's distribute the 9 on the both parts here.
We'll give us 9 times the 9 minus x squared
plus 9 times 4 is 36 equals 36 times 9 minus x squared.
And if we keep the 9 minus x squareds as a group,
we see we've got 36 of them on the right
and 9 of them on the left.
To make life easier,
let's subtract 9 of these 9 minus x squareds from both sides.
And that tells us that 36 equals 27 of these 9 minus x squareds.
Divide both sides by 27.
36 over 27 reduces to 4 thirds equals 9 minus x squared.
Get rid of the squared with the square root of both sides
and we get 2 over the square root of 3 equals 9 minus x.
I'm going to add x to both sides and subtract,
oops, it's plus or minus 2 root 3.
Sorry, that's important.
If we add x to both sides and add and subtract the 2 root 3 from both sides,
we get x is equal to 9 plus or minus 2 divided by the square root of 3.
Pulling up our calculator to take a look at this,
9 plus 2 divided by the square root of 3 is one answer.
But what you notice is that gives us 10.15.
Going back to the original, the whole distance was only 9.
If I go 10.15, I'm actually going past my pot of gold and having to go backwards.
That's not the best strategy to go about.
We probably don't want that solution.
Let's try again and we're going to do 9 minus 2 divided by the square root of 3.
We find out x, the distance we should run is about 7.85.
This person is a really good runner.
He's going to run 7.85 miles before the person jumps into the water
and either she or he will swim the rest of the way.
Now we know she or he's going to run 7.85 miles, jump in the water,
and swim the rest of the way to the pot of gold.
That'll be the quickest way to get to the pot of gold.
That's the run and swim problem.
Another classic problem is what I like to call the hallway problem.
The hallway problem is best illustrated with a picture.
The idea is you've got a hallway that goes around a corner,
but the width of the hallway is not the same on both sides.
Maybe on one side the hallway is 10 feet long,
and on the other side the hallway is 8 feet long.
The question becomes how long of a piece of furniture, maybe some long picture,
can you get around that corner in this hallway
as you move into the apartment around the corner?
Let's go ahead and write that out.
What is the longest piece of furniture to fit around the corner?
To set this up we need a little bit more information on here.
One thing we're going to be interested in is what is the angle theta
that we're going to be at in order to maximize our distance.
Now we know from geometry if I extend the wall from the top side across,
this vertical angle across from it is going to have the exact same measurement.
So we get a triangle to the left, and if I drop a line down we have a triangle to the right.
We actually have two similar triangles, but one has a height of 8 feet,
and the other one has a base of 10 feet.
Also we're interested in the pieces of this furniture length.
So we're going to label the left side x and the top right side y,
and we know that the total length of my furniture is equal to x plus y,
but we don't like having two variables.
So we have to try and use our relationships to reduce it down to one variable.
So we know for sure that one variable is going to be neither x or y.
It's going to be theta, the angle that connects them both.
With the 10 foot triangle, from the theta we have the adjacent side
and the hypotenuse that we're working with.
That means we're going to use the cosine over there.
We know that the cosine of theta is 10 over x.
And with the other theta on the y, we've got the opposite side and the hypotenuse.
It tells us that the sine of theta is equal to 8 over y.
Solving both these equations for x and y, we multiply by x and divide by the cosine,
x is equal to 10 over the cosine of theta, and y is equal to 8 over the sine of theta.
But rather than dealing with the reciprocals of cosine and sine,
let's just use the reciprocal trig functions and we'll say that x is equal to 10 secant of theta,
and y is equal to 8 cosecant of theta.
Now we can replace x and y with these pieces and we've been reduced down to one variable.
The length is equal to 10 secant of theta plus the y, which is 8 cosecant of theta.
Now we've got our function.
We're just looking for the spot that maximizes our distance or our size of our furniture where the slope is equal to zero.
So we'll take the derivative.
L' is equal to 10, the derivative of secant is secant tangent.
Theta tangent theta plus 8, the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent.
So instead of plus 8, let's say minus 8, cosecant cotangent theta.
And all we need to know is when this equation equals zero.
Well let's start by moving the negative part over to the right side.
So we've got 10 secant theta tangent theta equals 8 cosecant theta cotangent theta.
And probably the easiest way to solve this would be to change this all into sines and cosines since we're more familiar with sines and cosines
and seeing if we can establish what's happening here.
So we'll make a fraction, 10's in the numerator.
Secant is 1 over cosine, so it's 10 over, we've got a cosine theta.
Tangent is sine over cosine, so we've got a sine theta over cosine.
Cosine times cosine is cosine squared.
Equals, a fraction for the right side, 8 cosecant is 1 over sine, so that puts a sine theta in the denominator.
And cotangent is cosine over sine, so cosine theta over sine theta.
We already have a sine theta, so now it's sine theta or sine squared theta.
Let's clear out the fractions by doing the cross multiply trick we've done before.
So we've got 10 sine times sine squared is sine cubed theta equals 8 cosine cubed theta.
Let's move the numbers to one side and the variables to the other side.
We're more comfortable with tangent which is sine over cosine, so let's move the cosines to the right.
We're going to divide both sides by cosine cubed theta.
And we'll move the numbers to the right by dividing both sides by 10.
Sine cubed over cosine cubed is tangent cubed.
Cosine cubes are gone, 8 over 10 reduces to 4 fifths.
Get rid of the cube with the cube root of both sides.
And then tangent of theta, our angle, is the cubed root of 4 fifths.
So theta is equal to the tangent inverse of the cubed root of 4 fifths.
Or to make it easier on our, well, let's just type that in our calculator.
Let's find out what theta, our angle, is equal to.
We're going to do the tangent inverse of the cubed root which is conveniently under math.
Option number 4 is a cubed root of 4 fifths.
And the tangent inverse of the cubed root of 4 fifths is 0.7482.
0.7482.
But if you remember our picture, our picture wasn't interested in the angle.
0.7482 radians, that's what we just found is that angle.
We're interested in how long is the x and how long is the y.
Which means we have to come back to our x equals and our y equals equations in order to find those pieces.
So we have x is equal to 10 over the cosine of our angle, which is 0.7482.
And y is equal to 8 over the sine of our angle, which is 0.7482.
Fortunately our calculator can do that for us quite nicely.
So we've got 10 divided by the cosine of 0.7482.
And so that x distance is going to be 13.64.
For our y distance, 8 divided by the sine of 0.7482, that y distance is 11.76.
So for our final answer, the total length of my furniture that can fit around the corner,
the 13.64 plus 11.76 is going to be 25.4 feet.
I can fit anything that's 25.4 feet long around this corner.
If it's any longer, it won't fit. I can't take it into my new apartment.
And that's how we solve the hallway problem.
So these applied optimization problems can come in many different forms, but the philosophy is always the same.
Find out some relationship between the variables, take the derivative, and set that derivative equal to 0.
And we can optimize, either maximize or minimize, depending on the context, almost any situation.
Take a look at a few and try a few, and we will discuss it more in class.
Another application of the derivative is something that can help us solve limits that before were unsolvable.
The question we're going to answer is, how do we take a limit of an indeterminate form?
And the way we're going to do that is with what is called L'Hopital's rule.
Now L'Hopital was a French mathematician who published this idea in a French calculus text.
However, he's probably not the one who came up with it.
It was probably one of the Bernoulli mathematicians.
The Bernoulli's was a Swiss family that were some of the most amazing mathematicians ever, and they all were from the same family.
And there's some evidence that one of the Bernoulli's were the first to come up with it, while L'Hopital was the first to publish this rule,
or this trick to take the limit of an indeterminate form.
But first, before we can get into what the rule is, let's make sure we understand what the heck is an indeterminate form.
There's lots of indeterminate forms. These are things that are technically undefined,
but we know that limits often exist at points that are undefined.
And one of these, there's actually two really common ones that we're going to use,
is when the limit as x goes to some number, we'll call it a, it could also go to infinity, of f of x over g of x,
where we've got some fraction.
But when we normally do a fraction with a limit, we take the limit of the numerator and the limit of a denominator and simplify what that comes out to.
But when that reduces to zero divided by zero, we say that is an indeterminate form.
We don't determine anything. It doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist.
Zero divided by zero is indeterminate, so we need to do another strategy in order to solve.
The second indeterminate form, a really similar idea, is the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided by g of x.
Sometimes we'll equal infinity over infinity, and it could be either positive or negative over a positive or a negative infinity.
But this is also indeterminate because it turns out there are different sizes of infinity,
and we don't know if we're dividing by the same size or different size.
Is it zero? Is it infinity? Is it one? It could be lots of different things.
If our limit is one of these indeterminate forms, Lopital suggests the way we solve it using his rule.
If our limit is an indeterminate form,
it can be shown that the limit as x goes to a of that fraction, f of x over g of x,
is equal to the same limit as x goes to a, but this time of f prime of x over g prime of x.
And often this second limit is much easier to take.
In other words, if we do a division or a fraction with an indeterminate form,
we'll just take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator and calculate that limit.
So let's do some examples where we do just that.
First example, we're going to take the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x.
Now normally we'd plug zero into the numerator and the sine of zero is zero,
and we'd plug zero into the denominator and that becomes zero, so what we're really saying is zero over zero,
which is an indeterminate form, so what we will do is we will take the limit as x goes to zero
of the derivatives of the top and bottom, the numerator and denominator.
The derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of x is one.
So we're really saying let's plug zero into the cosine of x.
So we'd have the cosine of zero over the one is still one, and the cosine at zero is one.
So this limit as x approaches zero is actually approaching one, and that's Lopital's rule.
Take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator and take the limit.
Let's try another one. Let's do the limit as x goes to one of the sine of pi x over the natural log of x.
Well, if we plug one into both of these, we get one times pi or the sine of pi,
and the sine of pi, the y-coordinate there, is zero, and the natural log of one means e to the zero power is one,
so we've got zero over zero, we have an indeterminate form.
Because we have the indeterminate form, we can take the derivative of the top and bottom and find that same limit.
The derivative of sine pi x is cosine pi x times the derivative of the inside, which is pi,
over the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x.
Well, one over x that is dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal,
so I'm going to simplify this one step further and flip that fraction over, and we have x pi cosine pi x.
And now if we plug one in, we get one times pi times the cosine of pi times one, or one pi.
So we have one times pi, cosine of pi, the x-coordinate pi is negative one,
so we have one times pi times negative one, which is negative pi.
Our limit as x goes to one is negative pi.
This even works on problems with infinity that we've seen before.
Let's say, remember when we were doing limits at infinity, the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x squared plus 2x minus one,
over 5x squared minus x plus one.
And if you remember before when we were doing limits with infinity, we said, okay, the x squared is going to take over,
and so the x squared part gets huge, and then we end up dividing out the x squared, so we're left with three-fifths.
But let's solve this using another method, using L'Hopital's rule.
Because as x goes to infinity, the numerator becomes infinity squared times 3 plus 2 times infinity, it's going to infinity.
Same thing with the denominator, it's going to infinity.
We have infinity over infinity, which means we have an indeterminate form, and we can take the derivatives of the numerator and denominator.
That gives us 6x plus 2 over 5x minus one.
Nope, 10x minus one, sorry.
When we plug infinity in, we have 6 times infinity, which goes to infinity.
And then the denominator, we've got 10 times infinity, which goes to infinity, which means we still have an indeterminate form.
But there's no reason we can't use L'Hopital's rule twice.
So again, we'll take the derivative, the limit as x goes to infinity.
The derivative of the numerator is 6, over the derivative of the denominator is 10, and that's just a constant.
It doesn't matter what x is approaching, it's a constant, 6 tenths, which reduces to three-fifths.
We can even use L'Hopital's rule with a one-sided limit.
Let's say the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the natural log of x over the cotangent of x.
I might need a little bit more room here.
Now as x goes to zero from the right, the natural log goes to negative infinity.
And as cotangent goes to zero, remember cotangent is cosine over sine.
Cosine over sine is actually going to be an asymptote. That guy's going to infinity.
We have negative infinity over infinity.
We have another indeterminate form, so we'll take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator.
The derivative of the natural log is 1 over x.
The derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared x.
Let's actually simplify that.
It's negative 1 over x, sticks an x in the denominator.
And cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, so let's put the sine squared in the numerator.
Oops, I forgot the limit. That's important.
The limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine squared x, negative over x.
Now if we plug zero in, the sine of zero is zero, squared is zero.
And if we plug zero in, the denominator now goes to zero.
So all we've done is we've gone from indeterminate form infinity over infinity to another indeterminate form, zero over zero.
So Lopital says we do it again.
The limit as x goes to zero from the right of the derivative of negative sine, well, the negative stays there.
The derivative of sine squared is 2 sine x times the derivative of the inside, which is cosine x, over the derivative of x is 1.
Now we can plug zero in and we'll actually get a solution.
Now we have negative 2 sine of zero, cosine of zero, which is negative 2 times the sine of zero is zero, the cosine of zero is 1,
and it simplifies down to a limit of zero.
So this is the big idea of Lopital's rule.
If we have infinity over infinity or zero over zero, we'll take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator so that we can take the limit and plug it in.
We might have to do it several times, but eventually we can get down to a limit.
Those are the indeterminate forms that Lopital's rule allows us to work with.
But there are still other indeterminate forms that you could end up with.
The general strategy we're going to imply for these other indeterminate forms is that we need to make them either zero over zero or plus or minus infinity over plus or minus infinity.
We're going to massage them a little bit to try and make them into an indeterminate form.
One classic indeterminate form is zero times infinity form.
What's nice is the reciprocal of zero is infinity, so we're going to move that zero to the denominator and then we'll be in an indeterminate form.
Or the reciprocal of infinity is zero, so we could do the reciprocal and move it to the denominator because dividing by a reciprocal is the same as multiplying, and we'll end up with a form we can work with.
Here's what this looks like.
The limit as x goes to zero of x squared of the natural log of x.
Now x squared, that's going to zero.
But the natural log of zero, natural log is approaching negative infinity, so we've really got zero times negative infinity.
So we're going to rewrite this problem, moving one piece down to the denominator as a reciprocal.
So let's move the x squared down here.
So we'll have the limit as x goes to zero of the natural log of x over x to the negative two, or the reciprocal.
x to the negative two would move that exponent up, so you can see these are equivalent expressions, but now what we have is the natural log of x still approaching negative infinity,
and x to the negative two, or one over x squared, is approaching infinity.
The reason that's going to zero is we have one divided by a teeny tiny number, and when we divide by a teeny tiny number, we get a huge number as a result.
So now we have the correct indeterminate form, we're ready to use Lopital's rule.
And we have the limit as x goes to zero of the derivative of the numerator, which is one over x, over the derivative of the denominator, which is negative two, x to the negative three.
Cleaning that up a little bit.
The negative two is going to stay in the denominator, so the limit as x goes to zero.
We have the negative two in the denominator, but the x to the negative three moves up, and the one over x means it needs to move down.
And actually that can clean up a little bit.
We have the limit as x goes to zero of x squared over negative two.
So we're ready to plug zero in for the x.
When we plug zero in for the x, we get zero squared divided by negative two, which is just zero.
So how we handle that zero times infinity form is we move one piece to the denominator using its reciprocal.
It's still equivalent that way, and then we're in that indeterminate form that we can use Lopital's rule on.
Another indeterminate form is when we have infinity minus infinity.
If we have infinity minus infinity, we need to find a way to combine these to get a single fraction.
An example of this would be the limit as x goes to zero from the right of one over x squared minus one over sine of x.
If we were to plug zero in, we would have one over zero, which is infinity, and the sine of zero is zero, so we have one over zero, which is infinity.
And so we end up with infinity minus infinity, which is not necessarily zero because they might be different sizes of infinity.
So this is indeterminate form, so we need to combine them into a single fraction so that we can try and use Lopital's rule if we do, in fact, have an indeterminate form.
Common denominator would mean we multiply the first fraction by sine x over x, and the second fraction by x squared over x squared.
And that's going to give us sine x minus x squared. Oops, forgot the limit part. That's important.
The limit as x approaches zero from the right of sine x minus x squared over x squared times sine x.
Now you'll see if we plug zero into the numerator, the sine of zero is zero, minus zero squared is zero, and in the denominator we multiply zero times zero to get zero.
We have an indeterminate form which we can use.
So now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the derivative of sine is cosine x minus 2x over 2x times sine x, using our product rule,
plus x squared times negative cosine x, so I'll make it, oops, sorry, not negative cosine x.
The derivative of sine is positive cosine, so we have x squared times cosine x.
Now we have something that we can take the limit as x goes to zero on.
Let's break this down piece by piece so we can really see what's happening.
We plug zero into the cosine, cosine of zero is one, minus, let's just hit equals, cosine of zero is one, minus two times zero over two times zero, sine of zero minus zero squared times the cosine of zero.
Well, we still are ending up with zero in the denominator, or we're getting closer and closer to zero from the right, because we end up with zero minus zero in the denominator.
But as we get closer and closer to zero from the right, what that really means we're doing is we have left in the numerator is one, one minus zero, divided by something that is almost zero,
because we're getting closer to zero from the right, one divided by almost zero, or one divided by something really, really small.
When we divide by tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny things, we end up with huge answers, and so this limit as x goes to zero from the right is going to be a positive infinity.
Let's try another one.
Another indeterminate form is when we have infinity to the zero power.
It's not necessarily one, might be one, but not necessarily.
For these we're going to use logarithmic substitution to help us out to solve these problems.
If we have the limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x, you'll notice the exponent one over infinity is going to zero, and the base infinity is going to infinity.
We have infinity to the zero power, so we're going to rewrite it.
Using logarithmic substitution, we're going to let y equal the stuff we're taking the limit of, one over the x.
Natural log of both sides moves the exponent out front, and we're going to take the limit of what we ended up with,
and know we can undo that natural log by taking e to whatever power we end up with as our limit or our solution.
So we're going to take the limit as x goes to infinity of, and we're going to write it as a fraction, natural log of x over x,
because we know that natural log, as x goes to infinity, also goes to infinity.
And so we now have infinity over infinity, we can now use L'Hopital's rule.
The limit as x goes to infinity of one over x over one,
which, if we clean it up, is the limit as x goes to infinity, moving that x to the denominator of one over x,
which we know we're doing one divided by infinity, or one divided by a huge number,
and when we divide by a huge number, you're just left with zero.
But that is the limit of our natural log.
We have to undo the unnatural log by taking e to that power.
e to the natural log of y is y, so e to the zero, and I'll make a note here to undo the natural log that we did.
The opposite of taking a natural log is e to the exponent.
We take that solution we had as our exponent, and e to the zero is one.
So our limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x is equal to one.
Let's try another one where we use that strategy again, where we take the natural log of y in order to help us solve.
This one turns out to be in the zero to the zero form, which is also indeterminate
because a base of zero should have a zero for a solution, but an exponent of zero should have one for a solution.
So what is the solution? Well, it depends.
Let's take the limit as x goes to zero from the right of x to the sine of x power.
Again, you'll notice if we plug zero in to the sine of x, the sine of zero is zero,
and then we have a base of zero, so zero to the zero power is indeterminate.
So we let y equal x sine of x, and then we take the natural log of y, which moves the exponent out front.
So we have sine of x times the natural log of x.
Now again, we're going to get rid of that natural log by taking e to our exponent.
So we're going to actually calculate the limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine x times the natural log of x.
The problem is as sine goes to zero, I'm sorry, as x goes to zero, sine goes to zero,
and as natural log goes to zero, it goes to negative infinity.
We've got zero times negative infinity. We've done this form before.
This was number one where we said we're going to move a reciprocal down into the denominator.
So let's use that exact same strategy here.
We could move either one. There is one that actually turns out to be easier and better.
I'm going to come down on the next line to give me some space.
Let's move the sine of x into the denominator.
So the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the natural log of x over the sine, one over the sine of x.
It has to be the reciprocal when we move it down.
Actually what's nice is we know the reciprocal of the sine function is the cosecant.
So we're really doing the natural log of x over the cosecant of x,
which means now we've got the natural log.
As x goes to zero, the natural log goes to negative infinity,
and for the cosecant, as x goes to zero, cosecant goes to positive infinity.
We have an indeterminate form that we can finally use L'Hopital's rule on.
So now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the derivatives.
One over x over the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent.
And let's clean that up.
The limit as x goes to zero from the right.
The one over x moves the x down.
Cosecant and cotangent are both very familiar reciprocal functions,
which will move them up, which will be very nice.
Cosecant is the reciprocal of sine, so negative sine x.
And cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent, so negative sine x over x tangent of x.
Let's keep cleaning this up.
I want to break this up into two pieces.
Let's break this up into the limit as x goes to zero from the right
of the negative sine x over x times the tangent of x.
Because what's interesting there is we know we can use our limit properties
to break that up into the product.
The limit as x goes to zero from the right of negative sine x over x
times the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the tangent of x.
And why would that be better?
Well, if you remember at the very start of our discussion,
we solved the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x.
We know that's equal to one.
So coming down to our problem, we have that same limit.
We just have a negative sine, which can come out front.
So if sine x over x is one, negative sine x over x is negative one.
Times, plugging zero into tangent x, tangent to sine over cosine, sine of zero is zero.
So we have zero over one, which is zero, which means negative one times zero.
We've got our limit at zero.
So let's not get too excited because remember we did that natural log substitution.
So we have to undo that natural log substitution by just taking e raised to our solution.
Our solution was zero, e to the zero is one,
and so we ended up with one for our solution.
So that's L'Hopital's rule.
L'Hopital's rule says we can take the derivative of the numerator and denominator
if we have an indeterminate form like zero over zero or infinity over infinity at the limit.
However, if it's not in one of those indeterminate forms,
we're going to have to massage the problem a little bit to put it into a useful indeterminate form.
We might do that by moving a piece to the denominator.
We might do that by combining fractions into one.
Or we might do that with logarithmic substitution.
Take a look at these, give them a good practice, and we will discuss them more in class.
Today we're going to address another question in applied calculus with derivatives,
and that is how do I find the solution?
This might be a solution because sometimes there's more than one.
To f of x equals zero.
This question is going to give rise to what we call Newton's method.
This is very similar to what your calculator is going to do to find solutions to various equations.
We already know that if ax plus b equals zero,
all we have to do to solve for x is subtract b and divide by a and we get our solution.
We also know that if it's a quadratic ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero,
we also know we can solve for x using this simple quadratic equation of the opposite of b
plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a.
And we also actually have a similar formula for cubic functions.
Cubic's a lot more involved, but one certainly does exist.
But outside of that, we don't necessarily have a general solution method to solve for equations
that become more complex and more complicated.
And so what we do is we use Newton's method to kind of estimate the solution to any function.
To get an idea of what we're doing, we're first going to look graphically at what's happening.
Graphically, what we are doing looks like this.
Say there's some function here that comes down, up, and around.
And we want to know what is the zero, what is the solution to that function.
And it's not a real pretty number, so we're going to have to estimate it.
So what we will do then is we will guess as close as we can get, and we will call that our first guess.
We'll use x sub zero.
And then we'll take that to the line.
And yes, it's pretty close to our zero.
So to figure out what's happening around there is we will use the tangent line.
And the tangent line is going to give us our x1, which is our next guess.
And if we go to the line, that's closer.
So what we will do is we will find the tangent line, which gets us even closer.
And we call that x2.
And then we go to the line and do another tangent line.
And you see those tangent lines are going to keep getting closer and closer to our actual zero until we can actually estimate its exact point.
So graphically what we're doing is we're making a guess at x1.
Then we go to f of x1 and find the tangent line.
And then this gives a better guess.
And then we will call it x2.
So we find f of x2 and find the tangent line.
And you can see how we begin to repeat the process until we get close enough for our purposes.
So if that's graphically the process, let's look at the equation of the tangent line at x sub zero, or our starting guess.
Well we know that y equals f of x0, the y coordinate, plus the slope f prime at x0 times x minus the x0 is the equation of the tangent line.
Then we can find the point x1 on this line that hits zero.
Basically what we're saying is zero equals the f of x0 plus f prime of x0 times x1, our new guess, the new x coordinate, minus x0.
And then we will solve this equation for the x1.
As we solve the equation for the x1 you'll see that we'll first subtract off the f of x0.
Then we'll divide out the f prime of x0, and then we'll add the x sub zero, which leaves the x sub one.
All that to say, this formula tells us how to find the next point.
Or maybe we can say it more generally, x sub n is equal to the previous guess, x sub n minus one, minus f of the point, x sub n minus one,
divided by the derivative, x sub n minus one.
This is going to be the important equation we're going to use to make it all work.
Let's do an example.
We're going to do all the ugly work on our calculator, which is going to be really nice.
Our first example, f of x is equal to x cubed minus 5x plus two, and we want to know when that equals zero.
To help us, we'll do f prime of x, the derivative, which is 3x squared minus five.
To get an idea of the shape of the graph, let's go ahead and hit y equals, and I'm going to graph it.
We've got what?
x cubed minus 5x plus two.
When I graph it, you'll see the graph comes up down and back up, and we're going to be interested in seeing if we can figure out what is that value just to the right of the origin.
It looks like it's between zero and one, just to the right there.
What is that value?
Just to kind of sketch a graph, the graph comes up, down, and up, and we're trying to find this guy just to the right of the origin that is between zero and one.
I'm going to give you some calculator instructions that are going to save you a lot of work.
What you're going to start by doing is we're going to put f of x into y2, the second row.
Then we're going to put the derivative, f prime of x, into y3, and then in y1, we're going to put our formula, which is the x minus the y2 equation at x divided by the y3 equation.
At x, into y1.
You'll notice that is exactly the Newton's formula that we just found, where x is the n minus one, y2 is the function, y3 is the derivative of the function.
The way we grab the function is we type in vars, go over to yvars, and then we go over to function.
Let's take a look at what that means.
Y equals clear.
First I'm going to put f of x into y2.
So y2 is x cubed minus five x plus two.
Then I put the derivative into y3, three x squared minus five, enter.
Then I'll go up to y1, and for y1 we'll type in x minus, we need to grab the y2 equation.
Right next to the arrows is the vars button.
Scroll over to yvars, and select function, and we want the y2 function, which is the second one.
Then we'll open up a parenthesis and say we want to plug the x value into the y2, and we're going to divide by the y3 function at x.
So vars, over to yvars, function, y3 is the third option, and we want to plug x into there.
Now when I hit second table, let's delete out the points I don't want, in x I can put my first guess for the zero.
We said our zero was between, our solution was between zero and one.
So let's just guess maybe one for our first guess.
When we put one in for our first guess, Newton's method says the tangent line is going to take us over to zero.
So that zero becomes my next guess.
Put zero in for the next guess, and Newton's method says the tangent line pulls us over to 0.4.
That's a little closer.
So we'll type in 0.4 for our next guess.
Now we've got 0.41416 for our next guess, and that gets us a little closer.
So I'll type in 0.41421, and you notice when I type that in, I get the exact same thing for my solution.
That tells me I'm as close as I can get for my guess.
So I'm going to come back to my whiteboard here, and I'm going to summarize those results from the calculator.
Just to summarize, we started with x1, or x0.
Our first guess was at one.
That gave us our next guess, which was at zero.
Our next guess the calculator gave us was 0.4.
Our next guess the calculator gave us was 0.41416.
Our next guess the calculator gave us was 0.41421.
And then when we plug that in, we again got 0.41421.
And when we get the same thing on it, then we say that our solution is exactly that.
x equals 0.4141421 is the solution that exists between zero and one.
L'Hopital's rule is really nice though because it even works with non-polynomial functions,
some transcendental functions that are a lot harder to work with.
So let's try the second example here, where we say the secant of x minus x squared, we want to know when that equals five.
Well, Newton's method tells us when things are equal to zero.
So what can we do about the five?
We're going to subtract five from both sides to get the actual function we're going to use Newton's method with.
So we have the secant of x minus x squared minus five equals zero.
And we also need the derivative, which is secant x tangent x minus 2x,
and the derivative of the negative five is zero.
So we're ready to go to our calculator.
First, let's clear out all the old functions.
Probably could have kept y1, but it's good to practice typing it in over and over again so you know that formula.
So just to get an idea of where it's going, in y2 we're going to type in the function, the original function, which is secant x.
Now the calculator can't do secant x, but it can do one divided by the cosine of x, because secant is the reciprocal of cosine,
minus x squared minus five.
And when I graph this, we end up with this fancy graph.
And it's going to curve across the top to come down and curve across the top to come down.
But let's see if we can find the zero just to the right of the axis again.
It looks like it's between one and two.
So kind of our rough sketch so that we know what we're working with.
It came down, wiggled up, and went up, and then it came back down somehow.
We're going to be specifically interested in the first one that is between one and two.
So in our y equals, y2 is the derivative.
The derivative is secant x, which is one over the cosine of x, times the tangent of x, minus 2x.
Then again in y1, we're going to type in x minus the second function, yvars function 2, at our x-point,
divided by our derivative function, which is in the third function, vars, yvars function 3.
Second table to lead out all this other stuff.
And we said our first guess was between one and two, so I might try one.
You see one shoots us way out to 5.7.
That doesn't feel like it's getting closer.
In fact, if I do 5.7018, that's going to shoot me back to 2.7.
So 2.7228 shoots me down to a negative number, so I'm actually on the other side.
And if I do negative 0.0015, now we're at 26,000.
Boy, one's not getting me closer.
What that means is either I'm not close enough to my point, or the slope at my guess is too steep that it's throwing me way out of whack,
and I'm not getting anywhere.
So we said it's between one and two.
Let's try two.
Two shoots me all the way up to 11.
And you can already see kind of the same thing beginning to happen.
We type in the next point, which shoots me over to 9.7.
9.7617 shoots me over to 4.6673, shoots me to 4.5696, shoots me over to 4.0024.
Now I'm back at 1.69.
I'm all over the map.
So let's try a better strategy.
I'm not close enough to the point I want, but we know the point is between one and two.
So let's try right in the middle of one and two, 1.5.
Ah, look at that.
It keeps me close to 1.5.
We're at 1.46.
I feel better for that.
So let's try 1.4649, and that gives me 1.43.
Notice we're staying very close.
That's what we want.
1.429, 1.4283.
And notice that tangent line is going to be exactly the same.
We finally got close enough that we found our zero.
I do want to make sure I'm showing my work, so I'm going to list out my guesses.
My first guess, we started at 1.5.
My next guess shot us down to 1.4649.
My x2 gave me 1.438.
x3 gave me 1.429.
x4 gave me 1.4283.
x5 gave me 1.4283 again, which was the same.
So my solution that's between 1 and 2 is actually at 1.4283.
And that is how we do Newton's method.
Newton's method just is taking us graphically from a guess
to getting closer with the tangent line.
Then we use the tangent line to get closer
and the tangent line to get closer until we finally find the zero that we're looking for.
We're going to have the advantage of using a calculator to make that process easier,
but go ahead and practice a few.
Make sure you're comfortable with it.
We'll take a look at it in class, and we will see you then.
One last thing that I want to do before we wrap up derivatives
and begins to take a preview of what is coming in our second quarter of calculus
is looking at what is called the anti-derivative,
or really how we answer the question,
how do we find derivatives in reverse?
And that derivative in reverse is what we call the anti-derivative.
And we say that the anti-derivative of f of x, lowercase f of x,
is the function f of x, but notice it's capital f of x,
whose derivative is the lowercase f of x.
In other words, if capital f of x, the derivative of that is lowercase f of x,
then the capital f of x is the anti-derivative of the f of x.
Maybe it's better with an example.
We consider f of x equals 3x squared.
Now, based on our power rule,
which we know, but we're going to do it in reverse,
we can conclude that capital f of x, the anti-derivative, must be equal to x cubed,
because notice the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared.
So the anti-derivative of 3x squared is x cubed.
It's the process in reverse.
However, there's something we need to note.
What if capital f of x equaled not just x cubed, but x cubed minus one?
Or if capital f of x equaled maybe x cubed plus seven?
If we took the derivative of both of these,
the derivative of the x cubed is the 3x squared we want, and the derivative of the negative one is zero.
Similarly, with the other equation, with the plus seven,
the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared, and the derivative of the seven goes to zero.
So we actually ended up with three potential anti-derivatives of 3x squared.
We've got just x cubed, x cubed minus one, or x cubed plus seven.
And actually, you can see that we could extend that concept to basically say
we could add any constant number to the x cubed, and we would still have an anti-derivative.
Let's note that we can add any constant, and we'll call that constant c,
to any anti-derivative.
That means we're going to have to note that in our final solution.
So when we say the anti-derivative, actually let's write this down.
Different color.
So the anti-derivative of 3x squared is x cubed plus any constant.
So let's see if we can kind of use what we know about derivatives and apply those rules in reverse.
Let's see if we can do a few examples.
Let's say f of x equals 5x to the fourth.
Capital f of x, the anti-derivative then.
We know that with the power rule, the exponent moves out front and reduces by one.
So we can see the power of five moved out front, and then it shrunk one from five down to four.
So capital f of x, the anti-derivative, must be x to the fifth plus any constant.
Let's try another one.
Let's say f of x is equal to one over x.
Well, we recognize one over x as the derivative of one of our special functions.
One over x is the derivative of the natural log of x.
So the anti-derivative must be the natural log of x plus any constant.
What about trig? Let's do f of x equals sine of x.
What is the anti-derivative?
We're really asking whose derivative is the sine of x?
Well, we know the sine of x is the derivative of cosine of x, but there's that extra negative.
The derivative of cosine is negative sine.
So we might assume the derivative of negative cosine then must be the positive sine,
and of course it's going to be plus any constant.
What about f of x equals e to the x?
Well, this is our favorite function because the derivative is itself,
and so likewise the anti-derivative will be itself plus any constant.
So we've been kind of playing with this idea of an anti-derivative of just kind of thinking
the derivative of what should equal this, what do we know about derivatives,
what patterns can we notice to kind of come up with the solution.
But let's formalize what we're doing here with the formal notation for these anti-derivatives.
The formal notation is we'll use this little squiggly sign.
That squiggly sign we call the integral.
The integral of f of x, and then we'll put a dx.
So we know the variable we're taking the integral of with respect to x.
The integral of f of x dx is going to be equal to that capital f of x plus a constant.
That integral sign tells us find the anti-derivative.
And just like we have a bunch of derivative rules, like the derivative off to the side here,
like if we want the derivative of x squared, that's equal to 2x.
We've got those derivative rules. We also have integral rules as well.
And we have one for powers, the power rule.
The power rule says the integral of x to any exponent dx is equal to...
Let's see if we can piece this together.
The derivative makes the exponent shrink by one, so we need the exponent to go up by one.
Of course, the derivative says the exponent is multiplied out front, so we're going to divide by that new exponent.
And with integrals, there's always a plus c.
This is the power rule, a useful formula to be able to use quite quickly.
And just like we use the power rule with derivatives a lot,
we're going to use the power rule with integrals a lot.
There's actually a whole lot of integral rules.
Just to give you a taste here, this table is copied out of your textbook.
So I'll put a number 2 here, maybe c textbook for more integral rules.
And this table is in 4.10, and you can see this table,
and it kind of takes the differentiation formula, which we're familiar with,
and does it backwards with an integration formula.
The second one is the power rule that we just solved.
So there's lots of formulas in there, but we're going to focus mainly on the power rule.
Let's see if we can find the integral of 7x cubed minus 5x squared plus 2x minus 7 dx.
We'll take this one term at a time.
With the 7x cubed, we keep the 7, the constant out front, the x cubed goes up to 4,
and then we divide by that new exponent.
Then we have minus 5x squared.
Now it goes up, because we're doing the antiderivative, goes up to 3,
and we divide by that exponent.
So we have minus 2x, we increase the exponent by 1, so now it's squared,
and we divide by the exponent.
Minus 7, increase the exponent by 1, right now it was x to the 0, that's why it's not there.
Increase it by 1, we have x to the first, and we divide by 1.
I don't really need to say the divide by 1, but the 2 over 2 does reduce,
and so our final integral is 7x to the fourth over 4 minus 5x to the third over 3 plus x squared minus 7x,
and don't forget, we always need with integrals and antiderivatives a plus c.
We can use the power rule to even integrate some more interesting looking things,
like for instance the integral of x cubed minus 2 times the fourth root of x over x squared dx.
Now to help us out here, we're going to massage the function a little bit
to make it something we can use in our power rule.
One thing we can do because of the minus in there is we can distribute the divide by x squared onto both parts.
So we actually have the integral of x cubed over x squared minus 2,
and let's change that fourth root to an exponent, x to the one fourth over x squared dx.
Well we can continue to simplify.
By subtracting exponents, x cubed over x squared is just x minus 2x to the one fourth minus 2.
Well 2 is eight fourths, so one fourth minus eight fourths is negative seven fourths power dx.
Moving up to give us a little more room, let's take the derivative now, or the integral,
for the x, we raise the exponent by one to get x squared, and divide by two minus 2x,
and then we raise the exponent by one, or four fourths, to get negative three fourths,
and divide by the new exponent of negative three fourths.
Of course there's going to be a plus C at the end, never forget the plus C.
Cleaning up a little bit, we've got a negative negative that makes it positive.
Dividing by a fraction means multiplying by the reciprocal, so let's multiply by four thirds instead.
So we have x squared over two, plus two times four is eight, negative exponent moves it down,
x to the three fourths, plus a constant.
And so we have x squared over two, plus eight over three x to the three fourths, plus our constant.
Let's try one more.
Let's see if we can do a trig one. The integral of cosine of three x dx.
Now I know the antiderivative of cosine, or what's going to give me cosine when I take the derivative,
that's going to be the sine.
So I might think maybe sine three x plus C is my integral, and you'd be very close if you said that.
But remember the chain rule says if we take the derivative of sine of x,
the derivative of sine of three x would be cosine of three x times the derivative of the inside,
which would be times three.
So we have to undo that times three.
And the best way to undo times three is to divide by three.
So the integral or antiderivative of cosine three x is the sine of three x divided by three plus a constant.
Take a look at some of these in the assignment as you practice a few of these.
These antiderivatives or integrals are really about pattern recognition.
Trying something out and seeing that's close.
How can I adjust to get closer until you get something that is correct?
In Calc two, we'll talk about a lot of strategies to make some of this easier.
But for now, we want to kind of get some exposure and some experience with integrals and antiderivatives.
So take a few of these and we will see you in class to discuss them further.
