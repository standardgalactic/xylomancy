There's the gentleman, welcome back to the Uncensored CMO. Now my next guest I've been
trying to land for some time. Scott Galloway is famously controversial and perhaps the most
uncensored guest I've ever had on the show. There are so many things I wanted to ask
Scott and I know people listening have also sent in many questions to put to him as well.
He's famous for his controversial opinions on marketing, like he's brand dead for example,
also got lots of advice on life and business and success in general. He's also launching a new
book so I wanted to find out what that was all about and really get his tips for how to be
successful. This episode is raw, it's uncensored and it's full of real-life lessons. You're
really going to enjoy this one. Here it is. I've got the man himself, Prof G, on the show.
Thanks, brother. Good to be here.
Welcome. Good to have you.
Thanks, John.
I thought I'd start with something I read that you wrote, that it took you 25 years to have an
overnight success.
Well, sure. People come up to me now. I got two people stopping on the way over here. I walked
from my place and Kara Swisher, my podcast care host, is constantly saying, I made you famous.
I joke that it's really rewarding for me to have really rejuvenated her flailing career.
But I would say after working my ass off for 25, 30 years, I'm an overnight success. So it's
rewarding, but it should have happened earlier, boss.
Yeah, right.
I mean, most people focus on the success. It's easy to, isn't it? Of course, everyone's heard of you.
But what were the most challenging moments or the biggest failures that led up to that moment?
Because that's often what people don't talk about they should do.
We're going to need a bigger boat. I started investment banking. I didn't like it. I wasn't
good at it. I was living with my mother at the age of 25, didn't know what to do with my life.
A lot of my early, I started a lot of businesses, most have failed. I've had a company go chapter 11.
I've been divorced. I've had pretty big personal failings. I've been shot in the
fucking face a couple of times professionally and personally. I think my lowest or my most
terrifying moment was when my first kid came along. It was 2008. And I kept doubling down on
this company and I was always, I never really understood the power of diversification.
So I said, I'm smart. I'm good at what I do. I've always made a lot of money.
But I always kept doubling down on one company, usually my company. And this company in particular,
Red Envelope, I had borrowed money against my stock to buy more stock. A good company,
I thought it was going to be great. And then 2008 came along, great financial recession.
We had these weird things happen at the warehouse where we were sending
20,000 gifts for the holidays to the wrong addresses, which isn't good for business.
And then I basically went from like financial security to less than zero
in about three months. And then my kid had the poor judgment to come marching out of my girlfriend.
And I remember just thinking, I remember being in the delivery room and I felt so nauseous and
just so awful. And they said to me, just so you know, if you go down, we're not focused on you
right now. And I remember thinking, it's not childbirth that's making me so nauseous. It's that
I've like failed this kid on day one that I don't, if I just been a little smarter, if I just
put some money away and boring things, if I just been a little bit more disciplined,
if I hadn't tried to live so large and impress strange people, I could have just been so much
more mentally healthy and had such less anxiety. So that was a pretty big failure. I've had a lot of,
I've had a lot of mo, I mean, I just, I can't imagine anybody, anybody here not had a lot
of failure in their life and not tragedy. It's just, you know, you're going to, if you love
people, you're going to have grief. If you want to be really successful, you're going to have failure.
So yeah, I've had my fair share, but I don't, I don't think I've necessarily had more than most
people. But I think one of the keys to success is your ability to endure failure and rejection.
Nothing great, professionally or personally, is going to happen unless you take an uncomfortable
risk, unless you're willing to approach strangers, unless you're willing to be persistent, unless
you're willing to invest a lot in relationships, bring forgiveness, occasionally put your ego aside,
endure rejection, and unless you're willing to kind of, I call it the core, my core actually
is an entrepreneur is my willingness to get out of spoon in each shit. I'm not afraid to call
people. I'm not afraid to ask strangers for money. I'm not afraid to ask strangers to join
the company and work for me. I'm not afraid to ask clients to be client or strange companies
to be clients, but that's such humiliating because most people say no. And so your ability to mourn
and move on, you know, most people really aren't willing to endure the pain of rejection. So they
avoid big opportunities. You know, it's, it's embarrassing to ask strangers for money. It is.
It's embarrassing to call potential clients. It's embarrassing to approach a stranger and express
romantic interest. It's just all this stuff is easier to stay at home and,
you know, try and trade crypto and lose your money and go on Euphorne and pretend you have
friendships on Reddit. It just, you know, there's a reason romantic comedies are two hours, not
30 minutes, real victory is enduring challenges and rejections and enjoying yourself. And I worry
that it's a bit of a word salad, but I worry that young people at the hands of the most talented,
deep-pocketed organizations in the world are trying to convince them they can have a reasonable
facsimile of life without the risks of leaving their house or engaging with individuals. But
yeah, I've had a lot of, I've had a lot of low moments and the learning there is, you know,
you think you're never going to make money. Again, I've thought that you think that, okay,
I'm not going to be able to take care of my kids. I've thought that I've thought I'm never going
to have like a really wonderful relationship. I've thought that at the time it feels like you
know these things. Like it's just truth. And what you realize is if you keep going,
you know, all those things can and will happen. So I love the saying life isn't about what happens
to you. It's about how you respond to what happens to you. And my superpower is I can get pretty,
I can get punched in the face and I can get back up. That's always been my kind of core confidence.
That was insight and good to great. Well, great, great by choice, wasn't it? It was not that anyone
has more or less bad luck. It's entirely down to how you respond to the bad times, respond to
good times that dictate some performance. Yeah, luck is fairly, if you live long enough,
luck is pretty symmetric. And the flip side is true too. You're never more prone to a really big,
stupid mistake than after you've had a big win. When you pick NVIDIA and it goes up 12-fold and
you start actually believing you know how to pick stocks. So you double down and you get really
aggressive or you get promoted at work and you start thinking, I'm very good at this.
You know, a lot of your success is not your fault. And so to have some humility when things go
really well, but also to forgive yourself when things don't go well. You know, I think about
49% of what happens to you is your individual actions, but 51% is a function of the environment
and things that are out of your control. So have some humility, but also forgive yourself when
you screw up. I met the England rugby coach a few years ago and he had this fascinating mantra of
be tough in victory and be gentle in defeat. So it was very similar insight actually. He said,
when the team won, he said, that's when I told them what they did wrong. And when they lost,
I told them how good they were. I liked that. I think that's, I think that's a, yeah. Yes,
rugby, go rugby. So pivoting to the successes, because good to get onto that, and asking for
a friend on this one, but building your personal brand, you know, you've managed to build quite a
big business out of you, right? How do you scale yourself? You know, because you've only got 24
hours in the day. So have you turned to sort of Scott Galloway, prof G brand into, into a business?
Well, people spend a lot of time, especially in marketing, thinking about how to position their
company and what their company strengths are. And the people you oftentimes don't really lean
into, what is their point of differentiation? What is, you're going to be your strategy? What are
you good at? What is the market value that you're good at? And I figured out fairly early, it was
more genetic, something I inherited from my father. I'm a good storyteller. I have a good gift to
gab. I remember my father, you remember the first times you really registered emotion and
nuance as a kid? I remember my dad's a handsome man with a Scottish accent. And I remember
people just being so enraptured by him. And I remember thinking, but what he's saying makes
no sense. And it's not that interesting. And I recognize, oh, it's the accent and it's his charm
and it's his body language. But I figured out early on, it's something I got my father as I,
I'm a good storyteller. I communicate well, I can write well, I do good podcasts, speaking,
all that kind of stuff. So I leaned into that. I always knew I can make a good living doing this
kind of stuff, writing newsletters, that kind of stuff. But my superpower is my ability to attract
and retain good people. Because I could do one book every three or four years, make X dollars.
I do a book every 18 months and I make a lot of money. And it's because I have really outstanding
people who help scale what we do. And we have almost zero turnover at PropG. People think it's
me in the kitchen with a camcorder doodling and doing things and like, you must work eight hours
a week. I'm like, no, I work 30 to 40 hours a week. But I have 12 very smart people who are
really committed, who I treat really well. And but yeah, greatness is in the agency of others.
You can make a nice living doing something yourself. But if you want to make an exceptional
living, you have to figure out a way to attract and retain good people. That's kind of a whole
shooting match in terms of scale. I love that phrase, greatness is in the agency of others.
Expand that a little bit. What do you mean by that? And how do you achieve that?
I got six things today. I don't even know where I'm going. My chief of staff, Mary Jean is here.
I have two podcasts today. I have producers putting data in front of me. I've got a publicist
lining up all sorts of stuff for me. I've got lawyers reviewing my investment documents today.
I've got, you know, an editor who will a social media manager who will take clips from this and
other things and put it out there. Now, this is a position of privilege because I now have the
money to do these things. But good managers do a few things. One, they demonstrate excellence.
I'm good at what I do and I work pretty fairly hard. They hold people accountable. I have very
straightforward conversations with people and they're not doing well. And they also demonstrate
empathy. So what I found, one of the ways I matured as a manager was when I was younger,
I thought everyone just wanted what I wanted. I wanted to be rich and awesome. That's all I wanted,
right? I wanted a shit ton of money and for people to think I was awesome.
And so I assumed everybody else wanted the exact same thing. And what you find is
some people value, you know, people value different things. Some people really want to
manage other people. That's really important to them. They want to be a manager. Some people
want their name and lights. They want to be in the newspaper. They want fame. Some people are
totally focused. They're like, I'll work eight hours a week. I'll give up everything. I'll have no
relationships, shitty health. I just want to make a lot of money. Well, that's fine. But if you take
the time to sort of figure out what people really want, like what's really important to them,
and then they see you trying to deliver against that. Oh, we got a call from the New York Times
they want to quote. I'm going to let you take this because I know how meaningful it is for you to have
some of that public airtime. Oh, you want to manage people? Okay, I'm going to put you in
charge of this group. You just want money? Fine. I expect you to work your ass off and I'm going
to pay you a lot. And that's okay because everyone around you sees you working this hard. It's okay
to pay you more. But loyalty is a function of appreciation. And the fastest way to appreciate
somebody is to figure out what they want and try and show, you can't always deliver against it,
but try and show your cognizant of it. And then you're making an effort to deliver against it.
And I've tried to do that as a younger man. I don't think I was a good manager. I think I'm
getting better now. But trying to understand what does this guy really want? Like what's
important to him? And also creating a really nice collegial environment. The number one,
it's interesting, the number one factor for retention, people think it's money, it's not.
The greatest predictor of retention is whether the person has a friend at work.
And so we took, we were spending about a million bucks on an office space a year,
which made no sense. Ego, big fits, you know, this big office, check out what a baller I am.
And we gave it up in COVID. And now we don't spend all of that, but we spend most of it on,
we have a policy at our company. If any four of them are together at the same time,
they have my credit card. And that is either they're going to a Broadway show or Tulum,
which they've done. As long as there's more than four of them, it's on me. And they have fun.
And they like each other. Everybody interviews everybody. They generally seem to get along
and enjoy each other. That's not entirely possible when you get to hundreds of people.
But when you have a small company, you can have a group of people that really enjoy each other.
But I find that that's an incredible vehicle for retention. But I can do this. I can seem like
I work much harder because of the other people. Yeah. People always remember how they feel,
don't they? And experiences like that make people feel something, which brings me,
you talked about Daniel Kahneman in a recent episode I was listening to.
What impact has he had on you and how you think about how we behave?
He's had a lot of impact on me. That guy's, it's funny, I have Yodas. I didn't realize this when
I was younger. You don't need to sort through everything on your own. Find people you really
admire. Learn a lot about them and make them sort of an invisible board of directors. I have a
decent feel for what Muhammad Ali, I got really into Muhammad Ali. I have a decent feel for how
he would approach decisions. I have a decent feel like Madeleine Albright. I took an interest in
her. I have a decent feel for how she would approach decisions. And I got really into Kahneman
around economics and a few things. One, very tactical level. Daniel Kahneman has this thing
called risk aversion theory. And basically, people would rather endure a series of small,
definite guaranteed losses than the prospect of a big loss. And they overestimate the likelihood
of a big loss. That is the reason that the best business in the history of the West is insurance.
Because they know on average, they'll be, you know, that three of these million houses will
be wiped out by flood. So let's charge them enough that, you know, there's a one on a hundred chance.
It's a million dollars to rebuild the house. Let's not charge them 10,000. Let's charge
them 30,000. And the fear of that catastrophic event and wanting to avert the big pain results
in people willing to engage in one of the biggest ripoff in America. And that's insurance. So seven
years ago, this is strange, I canceled all my insurance, including my health insurance.
And you think, oh, you're a bad citizen, right? And let me be clear, I'm not suggesting anyone
cancel their health insurance because I'm privileged. I can afford any health scare.
So why would I have health insurance? And between property, flood, I mean, I used to
insure my vacations, health insurance, health insurance for my family, because I'm a narcissist
and I wanted the best insurance is about $55,000 a year for my company, which is my money because
I own the company. And we found, I found that about half the time we weren't getting reimbursed,
because we don't want to go on network. We want to go to the fancy doctors or whatever.
And so in seven years, $375,000 will buy a lot of healthcare. Now, there's a chance one of us
gets really sick and would cost a million or two million bucks. I can absorb that. So insurance
is yet another transfer of wealth from the port of the rich, because people who are wealthy can
afford to take these kinds of risks. But Kahneman just want, that's one example. Tactically, I
essentially canceled all my insurance. His other thing is the relationship between money and happiness.
And he's done a lot of work on it. And what he found is that there is a relationship. We tell
ourselves a myth that money can make you happy. That's bullshit. It can make you happy.
Middle income people are happier than lower income, higher income people are happier than
middle income people. That's the bad news. The good news is that it tops out. Once you can afford
housing, vacations, absorb a medical shock, take your appearance, you know, in New York,
that's probably about a million, million bucks a year. But supposedly it's about 90 or 100 grand
in most of America. Once you get to that point and you have a decent amount of savings,
the incremental money adds very little happiness. It does go up slightly, but the returns are
diminishing. And it's changed my policy on tax policy. I think, I don't see any reason why we
wouldn't tax, say, over 10 million in income, 70 or 80 percent, because the difference between
making 10 million a year and 20 million a year for people blessed like that, it's not going to get
you much. Whereas going from 40 to 60,000 through child tax credits or some sort of negative income
tax, that can create a lot of happiness. So it's changed my views on social policy. He's changed
my views on the way I approach risk. So he was a great mentor. I like wonky stuff. I like a Peter
Drucker for my own personal life around fear and shaming. I look at Sam Harris. I got off
of Twitter because I'm like, why am I on Twitter? And these people are so mean. There's people that
ruin my weekend on a regular basis. So why am I here? But yeah, economy influenced a lot of
the way. As you want to reread that, after he passed, sadly passed away, was that nothing is
as important as you think it is in the moment you're thinking about it. And that was so true,
isn't it? Is that you obsess about things, we get angry about things, and you don't realize they're
not as important as you thought. Well, slow and fast thinking. I've been thinking a lot about,
just because this is uncensored, so I like to go to the really sensitive stuff that gets people
angry. I've been thinking about what's happening at Columbia University and some of the protests on
campus. And his seminal book was thinking slow and fast. And the idea that we have really important
instincts to think fast. Alliance coming at you, you know, to run. Someone's threatening your family,
you turn to violence. You make snap decisions. And that was key for survival. So we have this
reptile brain that's just ready to defend, to strike. And there's two keys or two sensations
to the survival of the species. One is that we need to continue to really enjoy sex.
I think that's mostly taken care of. The second is that we need to be able to get
pleasure from binding together to fend off a perceived threat or attack. And I think a lot
of young people have a certain amount of rage and aren't having enough sex. And as a result,
try and find common enemies. They go on the hunt for fake, you know, for fake perpetrators or fake
evil. And I just can't, I wish these kids would find other means of finding dopa heads than thinking
some Jewish kid heading out of the library is really a threat to humanity. No, she's just
headed to a manicure boss. So try and figure out, slow your thinking, find other ways of getting a
dope ahead. And really trying to imagine, isn't this person most likely just like you trying to
get an education, had no choice in being born Jewish or not Jewish. And you're being so aggressive
and so hateful with your rhetoric and you're intimidating these people. And I can promise
as they get older, and their thinking slows down, they're just going to think kind of,
what the fuck was I thinking? Why would I be this hostile towards somebody? And so I think
young people deserve a really wide berth. I'm a big fan of free speech, but at a minimum, I might,
nothing says like you're wasting $120,000 of your parents' money, like showing up to a rally to
support our murderous autocracy. And two, I think your grandkids, should they ever see this shit?
And unfortunately, young people have a camera following them around, which I think is bad. I
think your grandkids are going to be really embarrassed that you were this unfeeling or weird
in seeing this .2% of the global population is a threat to your well-being. I just don't,
I know, I can't grasp how these kids are not slowing their thinking down and being a little
less hostile and being a little bit more graceful, so to speak.
So what role is social media playing? I know you got some strong points for you on that. How
is that fueling what we're seeing playing out at the moment?
Well, it speedballs it all because the worst thing that happened probably to society,
the last 20 years, is that Mark Andreessen unwittingly didn't build in micro payments
to the first Netscape Grouse. What do I mean by that? If you saw a cool article on the Washington
Post or a video clip on Fox, I'm trying to be balanced here that you like, you should be able
to really easily go, yeah, I'll pay three or five cents for that. Instead, they didn't have that
technology, so it all became ad supported. And since 1945 to about 1995, the general consensus
in the marketing community was that sex sells. I'll have someone hot and that'll get you to
want to buy a Buick or wear Nike's, right? And then we discovered something or the algorithms
discovered that there's something better than sex and it's rage. And if I go on Twitter and I say
mRNA vaccines all to your DNA, it's guaranteed that hundreds of comments are going to come in.
You're an idiot. You don't understand the biology. No, Scott is right. And by the way,
I don't believe that. There are a few things I love more than vaccines. Anyone here has a vaccine,
here's my fucking arm. I don't even need to know what it is. I love vaccines. I think they're a
gift to humanity. Anyway, but anything really hateful or coarse, the algorithms elevate because
people weigh in. And every additional engagement, every additional comment is another Nissan ad
and more shareholder value for the company. So our most talented people working in the most
well-resourced companies have a vested profit motive in enraging us, dividing us and making
our discourse more coarse. And what it has done is it's taken a population of people who are actually,
you know, America's bad, but it's the least bad place in the world. And it's given young people
reasons to be really angry and some of their reasons are justified. But 30% less people are
speaking to their neighbors. 52% of Democrats are worried, are worried their kids gonna marry a
Republican. Like when I was growing up and we were dating in our name, we didn't even know a
political part. You wouldn't even think about talking about this shit on a date or to your
neighbors or it was just, everything's become so coarse. And I think that if America were a horror
movie, I think the call is coming from inside of the house. We don't like each other. And so social
media has speedballed that. It has been a disaster for young people just as it's been really hard
on girls just as they're coming into their years where they're thinking about social capital
and wanting to be liked. We put them, we basically have the cafeteria following them around 24 by
seven. And we're afraid because of politically correct doctrine to have an honest conversation
around the difference between boys and girls. Because if you talk about the differences,
people assume that you're not sympathetic to non-binary kids. And that's not true.
You can have empathy for everyone. Civil rights didn't hurt white people, gay marriage didn't
hurt heteronormative marriage. But girls and boys, loosely speaking, are different and they're
predisposed to different types of behaviors. Reason I bring it up. Boys bully physically and verbally.
Girls bully relationally. They weight, they're calculating, they're smart, and then they strike.
And we've put their, we've put nuclear weapons in their hands in the form of smartphones.
And they find someone who's weak or someone who's pissed them off, they plan, they wait,
and then they go after them on social. And you have seen a dramatic uptick in self-harm and
suicide, especially among young girls. And when, and this happened, this is not an exaggeration,
and this has happened a lot. 14-year-old teenager, teenage girl in the UK, Molly Richards,
apparently even heard about this, is really down, really depressed, bullied at school, goes into a
room, you know, starts talking about being bullied. The algorithms pick up on it and she gets this
exact email. Molly, here are some images on suicide we thought you might find interesting.
And it's a picture of NUSIS, a picture of razors and a picture of pills. And you know how the story
ends, her parents go in the next morning and Molly's gone, right? Someone needs to go to
fucking jail. It's just, how does that, how did we attach a profit motive to depressing
and enraging young people? And I get depressed and upset with social sometimes, the algorithms that
give people incentive to go after each other and be really coarse and really mean.
How does a 14-year-old modulate? There's absolutely no reason to have anyone under
the age of 16 on social media. They have weaponized it, they have lied about it,
they've deployed really charming people, Cheryl Sandberg to pretend she gives a flying fuck about
young people and then depressed teen girls all over the world to have an individual named Mark
Zuckerberg who's done more damage to young people while making more money than anyone in the history
of the planet. And then we have a feckless and effective leadership, average age 63, that's
a cross between the walking dead and the golden girls, trying to regulate these technologies,
40 hearings on social media and impact on kids, zero legislation. Speaker Pelosi, when she had
her first child, Castro declared martial law in Cuba and two-thirds of households didn't have a color
TV, but she really understands an 18-year-old girl getting extreme dieting tips on Instagram
and what needs to be done. She really understands a 23-year-old male is getting addicted to gambling
apps. So, I think we have minority rule and I think we're very concerned with seniors and making
sure wealthy people stay wealthy, but I think we've totally abandoned young people and the fastest
way to build a trillion-dollar company is to find a flaw in the species. So, young men are more
risk aggressive, they like gambling. Oh, girls are very sensitive about their social capital,
so they become addicted to aesthetics and kind of their self-worth in the eyes of strangers.
Think about what a place of perversion, I mean, downright perversion Instagram begins with.
We're going to have algorithms that reward 15-year-old girls for posing in provocative,
sexualized imagery such that her peers and strange men all over the world can evaluate her.
I mean, doesn't that make the Catholic Church seem kind of upstanding? It's just like,
this shit is just so weird and so perverted and I think when we look back on this age,
we're going to regret the weaponization of our elections, the coarsening of our discourse,
the income inequality, but I think the thing we just won't believe and I think it will change
is we're going to ask ourselves, how do we let this happen to our kids? And I think a lot of it
is because our elected representatives don't understand these technologies. These companies
are very smart, they weaponize Washington. There's more lobbyists, full-time lobbyists
in Washington who work full-time for Amazon than there are sitting U.S. senators.
And they're very good at deploying these attract, it's already happening. Sam Altman,
God, he's dreamy and thoughtful, hushed tones. I'm worried about AI, John. We really need to be
thoughtful about this and I'll care like I give a flying fuck about anything but money and then
I'll deploy a series of lobbyists to kill any legislation. We're being sandburged again and
it's our fault. In America, to be rich is to be loved. So you can understand people making
incremental bad decisions or rationalizations so they can have billions of dollars and be superstars.
I'd like to be, you know, that would be amazing. But we don't vote in place people who protect our
children or have the skills to regulate these companies. There's more regulation in this mic
than there is in all of big tech. There's been no regulation in big tech, which is just strange
when you think about it. So I'm very worried about young people. I'm worried that we haven't
paid any attention to the externalities of social media. Fossil fuels are a great thing.
They produce carbon. We're concerned about it. Pesticides are a great thing. They produce
terrible emissions so we have an FDA to say you can't use these pesticides, right?
What regulation is there converting attention to money at the expense of mostly children in
mental health of America? So anyways, big tech has not been good. Big tech has speedballed a lot
of the negative aspects of our society. It's too embedded, isn't it, really? With too much vested
interest in the economy. I wanted to move on, if I can, to marketing and obviously your role
clinical professor of marketing at NYU Stern. I heard this story. I just want to check that it
was true. But did you kick out a student for being late and then your response to it went viral?
Yeah, that was my first brush with fame. Yeah, tell me about that. That sounds exciting.
What a reason to get famous. No, a kid walked into the class about 15 minutes in
and I said, I'm sorry, I don't allow people late in the class. And it was an uncomfortable moment
and then he walked out and then he wrote me a diatribe saying I was checking all the classes.
I was auditing the classes. I was going to be in your class for five minutes and go to another one.
And I said, okay, I get that, but I don't allow that. And I just wrote a response on my,
I xed out his name so people, and I said, this is in my next syllabus. I said, this is my late
policy. And it got picked up by the media. And, you know, I had to go back and read it and make
sure you see what I wrote. But yeah, that was my, you know, I say to young people, get the easy
stuff right. This is, I screwed up so much. I was late all the time, worked my ass off,
and then I'd be late to a meeting. I mean, you just get the easy stuff right. You know, show up,
dress well. Anyone can dress well. Get your sister a gay man. That's a hate crime. Now,
to say that the gay men have better tastes than straight men. They do get, get your mom.
Straight men have some, something is wrong in their brain around fashion.
Literally, they're like, oh, this Nick's tank top and a baseball cap on backwards. I'm killing it.
Right. Find somebody who has better taste than you to dress, especially when you're young,
show up on time. Don't speak your first six months of the job. Just listen, there's just basics.
You know, shower, like young men aren't showering. Right. Just some basics, right. Get the easy stuff
right. And I speak from experience. I used to work so hard and I would get the easy stuff wrong.
I wouldn't be kind sometimes, right? Say stupid shit or, you know, I just get the easy stuff
right. And I think there's some basic blocking and tackling the young, have manners, follow up,
you know, just basics. So many young people don't, don't make the mistake of thinking anyone
cares about your politics at work. That's the one I hate. You know, people will nod and call you a
leader for complaining and then memo to self next layoff. You're out of here. So, and get the basics,
get the simple stuff right. And you've taught a lot of marketing to MBAs. What would you say
is the most important skill for a marketer today that you might see lacking at the moment?
It's the most important. If I could give my kids any skill, we'd be storytelling. The ability to
take a concept, a narrative and communicate it in a compelling way across mediums. Learn how to
write, learn how to present, learn how to get up in front of it. I'm not suggesting you need to be
a great presenter. You got to be able to present. So it can be very uncomfortable for people to
modulate, try and get to average, learn how to write, learn how to, you know, text. Some people
give great text. You know, those people are like, they can just in eight words summarize the situation
and they're funny. Find the medium you are great at. It might be something on social. You might
find your grade on LinkedIn that you could post. I am really good in front of large crowds. I'm not
good one-on-one. If these people were here, you would find me intense yet aloof, right? Or insecure
yet aloof. So I very rarely go to meetings alone. I like to have a foil there. I'm not good on the
phone. So I don't do important stuff on the phone. So it's important to figure out where is your
strength. But storytelling is the key. The animals have instincts. They can communicate live, but
they're not able to communicate to broader parts of the species. So they haven't evolved nearly as
fast as us. We can write pictures on cave walls and say, this is when you plant the crops. I can
communicate to you around how to get somewhere more efficiently, more effectively. So storytelling
and an ability to communicate is something that's really valued in the species. That's why Mick
Jagger gets to hang out with a 30 year old ballerina because he is an outstanding storyteller. So
if you can communicate something in a compelling way to somebody, you can only make a good living.
You're going to have friends. You're going to have a broader selection set of mates than you
deserve. So I don't know if it's, I don't, you know, I remember 10 years ago, they were teaching
Mandarin in high school. I mean, anyone using the Mandarin lately? When I went to high, I took
computer science in college. I think one of the stupidest things we did was replace civics class
with computer science in high school. I don't know if we're going to use many programmers. We'll always
need storytellers. We'll always need people who really understand how to communicate across
different mediums. I think that's the key. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Now, I put out a few
questions to the audience to say, if you're asking Scott one question, there was one question that
overwhelmingly came back from everybody. So you're in Cannes in front of probably the world's,
you know, most celebrated brand builders. And you said the era of brand is dead.
Yeah. What's the thought behind that? Well, if you think about traditional brand building,
from 1945 to kind of 1995, till the introduction of Google, the primary algorithm for creating
shareholder value was have a mediocre product, a mediocre shoe, salty snack, car out of Detroit,
and then sugary drink, and then wrap it in these amazing brand codes, youth, European elegance,
American vigor, sex, paternal love, maternal love will take 20 cents a tooth of peanut butter
paste and turn it into $2 of maternal love because choosing moms choose Jeff. And then we had these
incredibly inexpensive vehicles of communication called broadcast medium where 60 to 80% of the
households every night were in one of three places, ABC, NBC or CBS. So take that shitty car,
convince it you're tough like a rock, and stuff the channel with it and print money, the Coca-Cola,
you can dance like Michael Jackson or was that Pepsi, you know, oh, I drink Budweiser because
aren't those frogs funny. And this was the primary means of creating irrational returns to shareholders.
And then the the ecosystem got so crowded with channels that the returns went way down. And
also your social graph and word of mouth and glass door said, okay, and I'll use Xemba hotels.
I travel a lot. I've spent probably 56% of my life on the road. And I always used to stay at the four
seasons or the Mandarin Oriental. Why? Because someone else was paying, and they always deliver
a seven or an eight. And when I'm in Istanbul, I don't know where to stay. But now with my social
graph and TripAdvisor and Google, I know that the solo house in Istanbul is the old American
embassy and it's great. Whereas the the Chilton Firehouse in London has the best room with a lot
of hot young people who I like to hang out with. So the brand used to be this weapon of diligence.
It was always a seven or an eight four seasons or the Mandarin Oriental. But now I can find the
nine for me with these new weapons of mass diligence called Google TripAdvisor. So quite frankly,
the brand has diminished in power and it sounds very passé, but product is the new black again.
If you have a truly better product, people will talk about it online and word will get out.
So a lot of the capital has been taken out of marketing and has been reinvested in things
like supply chain. Can I get you something within 48 hours for free? Can I produce programming for
less than money that's really good squid games, parasite, money heist and just, you know, what
are the companies that have added over a hundred billion dollars in value in the last decade
having common? They don't advertise. How much advertising does Netflix, Google, you know, open
AI? What about Amazon? Because I mean, you're Bezos quote of advertising as a tax on a poor
product. Yeah. And now Amazon are probably the one of the biggest advertisers in the world and one
of the most invested in storytelling actually about your storytelling point. I think they
take a lot more money in advertising than they put out. They're one of their biggest groups
as Amazon media group where they advertise on their site. I don't see them actually as a percentage
of their top line income. I can't think of the last Amazon commercial I saw. They buy a lot of
keywords, but I think that they, all the big players don't spend that much. I think advertising
kind of outs you is not getting it. And I think this is true of that. If you're having dinner
with strangers all the time, it means you're selling an undifferentiated product. I was in
the services business and my life, when I really distilled, how do I make a living? I started a
strategy firm when I was 26. I started an analytics business intelligence company when I was 40.
And I thought my life is renting my brain to old white guys. That's what I did. I developed these
proxy father-son relationships with the CMO of a big company. And I said, I'm smarter than you.
I'm going to wrench in my brain and I'm going to make you the CEO in three years or less. In
exchange for this, you're going to give me million to $2 million yearly consulting gigs so I can pay
all these other people and make a lot more money than if I was just selling my own time.
And I found it just exhausting. And what I say to people is if you're constantly having dinner
with strangers, it means you're selling an undifferentiated product. Google was a 10x better
product. Tesla is a better product, even though I'm not a big fan of the owner. So all this money
has been taken out of branding, traditional branding, gone into direct response, Facebook and Google,
and into the product itself. Nobody invested in supply chain. Amazon came along and said,
no, supply chain is the opportunity. And they made a staggering investment to get you anything you
want within 40 to 40 hours for free. No one was thinking that way. Everyone else was just trying
to lower the cost in supply chain. Netflix is supply chain, producing stuff in different markets.
Nvidia is supply chain. They said, we're going to design the chip, but we're not going to invest
in these factories. Xi'en, which is the fastest growing apparel company in the world, no stores,
no warehouses, no factories, no trucks, no stores, software using AI to look at the 50,000 to 500,000
people that are on the site at any given time, tracking very closely their patterns and movements.
And they go, okay, this top, we're going to need 1700 of them. And then the software goes,
what factory in the Philippines or in Vietnam can create 1700 most efficiently? The order
goes in, no humans. Order comes out, no humans. This is how we're getting it via air cargo,
to those addresses, no humans, all software, asset light, asset light supply chain model.
Anyways, it really is an era of product and innovation again. And so the CMOs and marketers,
we all love to be nostalgic and say, oh, advertising's coming back and we give each other
awards every day. There's less and less oxygen in the room. So if you're over the age of 40 and
you're traditional branding, write it out. If you're young and you can get out, get out. It's
an industry and structural decline. When I was young, I ran a brand strategy firm. The players were
IPG, Publixy, Omnicom, they were the masters of the world. Google and or Meta will lose the value
while three of those companies in any one trading day or loser gain it. So the sun has passed midday
on traditional brand. Don Trapper has been drawn and quartered. This notion you can have a mediocre
product and instill it with great emotion and just sell a lot of it. That's done. That's over.
So I wanted to come on to talk about your new book, which comes out tomorrow. So we're calling
this on Tuesday, it comes out tomorrow. I want to start with the Marcus Aurelius quote,
if I can, which I thought was fascinating. You have power over your mind, not events,
which I thought was a fascinating place to start. Yeah, life is about what happens to you.
No, sorry, life isn't about what happens to you. It's about how you respond to what happens to you.
That's it. It's the K, isn't it? Yeah. Well, not only that, it's, I struggle with anger and
depression that probably goes, is no surprise to any listeners or anyone who knows me.
And you're in the past. Depression is basically, depression for me is in the past.
I'll think about this pod and I'll think about the one or two places I screwed up and I'll get
angry and upset and I won't be able to let it go. I don't forgive myself. And the past is the most
immutable thing ever. There's literally nothing you can do about it. Literally, and I can prove
this. Nothing we can do about it. But if you're successful, and I'm also successful, you're
constantly in the future, right? You're thinking about, okay, I'm going on, I'm name dropping right
now because I'm desperate for your affirmation. I'm going on, I'm going on Bill Mar on Friday
and the shit going on at Columbia. I know he's going to want to talk about it. So already tonight,
I'm like, I'm going to text Jonathan Greenblatt, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, and I'm going to ask for
their thoughts on it so I can parrot it and sound smarter than I am. I'm already really thinking,
I'm mostly here because I like you, and I like your hair, but I'm mostly here, but I'm in the
future. And that's the fear. The fear is that you get to the end of your life. And if you're an
atheist like I am, and I think that at some point I'll look into my son's eyes and know our life,
you know, our relationships coming to an end, I believe that. You're like, okay, I was so much in
the past, not forgiving myself. I was so much in the future because I wanted to be successful,
but I was really never there. Like, did your life really happen? That's the fear, right? Were you
never really there? So, you know, life, if I could give myself anything or give young people
something, it's like, okay, forgive yourself when things aren't going well, recognize your life is
how you respond to shit. When you're really upset, it's usually not about what happened to you. It's
about whatever chemicals are running through your brain at that point. And just to ease up on yourself,
forgive yourself, be nice, be good to yourself. And also, occasionally, try and just slow down.
I think that's really the gift of kids is they force you to be in the moment because they can be
so disagreeable. But what is it that can put you in the moment? Like, what can like, just slow you
down? I wish like presence, which is sort of, I think, and just recognizing you can control your
emotions, you can't control what happens to you. There's just so much of this is just so random.
Yeah. That's huge, isn't it? The, another thing that struck me in the book actually was the
impacts of compounding, which I mean, I've learned doing this podcast, it's been insane,
like the, you know, when you repeat something, you learn from it and repeat it again.
And keep at it over time. What you achieved this year compared to five years ago is just
astonishingly different. Yeah, look, the power of compound interest, if people had,
if you had decided to get a shitty Android phone, which I realize is not appealing, right?
Having an Android phone is sort of saying to the world, your life really hasn't panned out the way
you'd hoped. But if you had taken all the money we spend on iPhones, I bought every iPhone.
I buy every iPhone, automatic on the list. It costs, I think the first one was 1500 bucks,
last one was 2400. Someone did an analysis and said, if you got in a free phone, you can get
a free phone. If you got in a free phone and you take all the money you had invested in Apple
phones and you bought Apple stock, you'd have $3 million right now. Wow. Because obviously,
Apple's gone insane, right? But what you don't realize as a young person is, how old are you,
young man? 26. Okay, when I was his age, I could not imagine the flaw. One of the flaws in our
species is that because we haven't lived beyond 35 for 90% of our time on this planet, we can't
calibrate time. So you're going to be around probably, actually, you're probably going to be
around another 80 years, which means if you save $100 a month, or let's call it $300 a month,
which is boring, right? Because you're expecting to be a baller and have them promote you and
sell podcasts for a lot of money. But just in case you don't, if you manage to get $300 a month
into SPY, low-cost index funds, and you didn't look at it for 50 years, not in 50 years, 30 years,
you're going to have millions dollars. And hope this shit goes big, right? Hope you are a great
DJ. Hope you sell the next big great novel. But just in case, if you can figure out a way to
automatically save the $300, so you never see it a month at the age of 26, I can guarantee you by
the time you're my age, I think I'm older than you, you'll be a millionaire. So just in case shit
doesn't work out, and I didn't have that maturity, I remember telling my friend when I was 24,
he was putting $2,000 in this stupid lame thing called an IRA Roth. I'm like, if $2,000 means
anything to me when I'm older, shoot me. And he's never, he's made a fraction of the money I've made,
but he's a multimillionaire because he was that lame guy putting away money every
month. It is amazing. 11% a year, which is what the S&P has done since 2008, sounds really uninspiring.
11% a year, it's nothing. Big deal. That means every 21 years, your investment's going up eight
fold. So as I say in the book, the good news is I know how to get you rich. The bad news is the
answer is slowly, but you want to lean into your advantage. Your advantage is time. So if you just
have a little bit of discipline, one less Starbucks a day, round up on acorns, get away to have
four savings so it comes out of your check and you never see it. Go into low-cost index funds,
don't believe anyone on CNBC, alternative investments, hedge funds, people who claim they
know more. No one knows. My summary of the entire financial services community haven't been in
economics. I'm around the brightest people in finance. No one has any fucking idea.
That's the bad news. The good news is the markets in America over the long term are up into the
right. So you don't need to be a hero. Just save a little bit of money, play into your strength.
You're going to have a lot of time on this planet. A little bit of discipline, a tiny bit of sacrifice.
Always save. Never look at it. Don't think about it. Don't day trade. Don't get near crypto. Jesus
Christ. And try and live a little bit like a stoic. Recognize that people aren't as concerned with
your shit as you are. Get a Hyundai. If you ever want to get a car, before you own a home,
live in a very small, clean place near work, double down on work. Be the guy that doesn't
stay at the club and doesn't feel a need to signal with a bottle of gray goose, go home,
have a plan. By the way, that's really attractive to women, actually having a plan.
And you're going to end up at a stage in your life where flexibility and economic importance
are really important. And also that notion of compound interest, it goes for relationships too.
Most people when asked what the single relationship in their life is, they almost say,
always it's their mother. Even if you don't like your mom, even if you don't get along with her,
it's usually the singular relationship in your life if you have to identify one.
And it's because of compound interest. Every day she'd made dozens of these little investments.
My mom used to wake me up with a soft voice like Scott, totally concerned with my well-being,
teaching me how to drive, all this shit. My dad wasn't around. She wakes up 30,
40 years later and that relationship is singular. She's a millionaire in my eyes. She's been gone
for a while. The wealth she accreted making tiny investments every day. And so when you're young,
and I didn't do this, a little act of kindness, checking in on people, texting people,
you hear about a job opportunity and you think of a friend and you reach out to them,
you tell people, someone you admire them, you hear they're down, whatever it is,
just tiny little investments when you're young. I made some of those and now those friendships
are just so big, right? So I think compound interest, most people acknowledge it in finance,
but they don't appreciate is how much little investments and relationships can pay off
as you get older. I mean, the friends I had in college where we made little investments with
each other are just these wonderful relationships now because of that compounding of little things
we did for each other. Yeah. And so about the compound relationship point, that's really true
because I think I found as my network has grown, good things just come, doesn't it? Because you
multiply the number of people you reach and opportunities get created and knowledge gets
shared. It's very impressive. It's a great point because, and this is in the book, the difference
between being economically secure and the people who are really wealthy is there's a myth and the
myth is kind of the Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren trope that rich people, billionaires,
crawled over other people to get wealthy. And what I found in the research is that actually
wealthy people are generally speaking really good people because what you want is you want to be
put in a room of opportunities without being in that room. And in order to be really wealthy,
you have to collect allies along the way. You have to have people that think of you
with opportunities, give you the benefit of the doubt. You also, wealth is a kind of what I call
a full person project. And that is the fastest way to steal or to grasp or snatch financial
insecurity from financial security is personal failings. The lack of character, a divorce,
which I've been through, I lost 60% of my net worth overnight. You split your assets and then
you lose another 10% because there's 42 households and you become a four seller of assets, which is
never a good idea. And also it showed me a smaller and medium sized company that's doing really well
and that all of a sudden kind of folds. I'll show you people at the top who are professionally
divorcing. They're not getting along. So unless you're willing to bring generosity, forgiveness,
empathy to your personal and your professional relationships, I don't think you're ever going
to be that wealthy. I mean, some people are so fucking talented. Kanye can do whatever he wants.
He's going to be fine. Assume you are not Kanye. You want to bring, generally speaking,
the millionaire next door is someone who values his personal relationships or her personal relationships
is a good person and people want this person to win. So character is an, character really is,
you know, the most important part of being wealthy are things you can't control,
when and where you're born. Being born in the sixties, sixties California, white heterosexual
male gave me unfair advantage. But the things you can control, saving, compounding, focusing on your
talent and being a high character person, being a generous person, if you don't bring generosity
forgiveness to relationships, I think it's going to be very difficult to be wealthy because you're
going to end up with personal and professional divorce from key relationships. Thank you.
What I'd love to do actually is bring some questions in at this point. So I think we're
getting to the our point. Shall I start?
you
you
just keeps going because they're not changing their approach in this come to Jesus moment
that I hope to God is going to happen. How do we manage the fact that really this
tech and social money took over from, you know, the kind of dying off of industrialization in
America? We need the money. The tech people are the people who are supporting the people running
for office. That's why nothing ever happens. Like what has to break for us to get there?
So first off, I think big tech and their leadership are culpable,
but the culprits are Congress and Senate and to a greater extent us.
If we don't elect people that hold these companies accountable, we've had 40 hearings on social media
and danger to kids. We've passed zero legislation, right? So a snap got grief for their solar system
where basically you got to see where you were in importance to a friend and it ended up really
upsetting kids. Like, wait, this person doesn't care about me. I'm not even in their inner orbit.
And I would imagine that people at snap didn't see that happening. But when it happened,
you canceled it. Most social media CEOs do not do that. They're like, unless it's outlawed,
why would I put myself and my shareholders at a disadvantage when it's not law? So here's the
bottom line. I generally believe nothing gets better until someone does a perp walk
because we can't come up with fines big enough. They have so many lawyers,
they have an ability to reduce these fines. Facebook is violating a consent decree lying
to Congress to find $5 billion, $5 billion. It's nine weeks of cash flow. So if I put
a parking meter in front of your house that costs $100 every 15 minutes, but the ticket
was $100, I'm sorry, but the ticket was 25, the meter costs $100 every 15 minutes,
but the ticket was 25 cents, you'd break the law. You would just break the law.
And the incentives, there's no algebra of deterrence. Then no one goes to jail.
They thine serve. It's like a nat hitting a windshield. They make so much money.
So until everyone has to be off their phone under the age of 16, until every social media
company is subject to liability, and someone can go to jail if they send out suicidal ideation
emails, until everyone is subject to these penalties, to wait for their better angels to show up,
just don't hold your breath, folks. America becomes more like itself every day.
To be rich in America is to be loved, to be able to take care of your kids, your parents,
to have a broader selection set of mates. That is really appealing. So you will make incremental
decisions that might have a really negative impact on the Commonwealth unless you are regulated.
Ford would still be pouring mercury into the river if it wasn't outlawed, because if they
weren't pouring mercury into the river, General Motors and Chrysler would have a cost advantage
when they continued to do it. So the people really failing are us, until we hold these
companies accountable, until we pass laws that say, you realize, news core, Fox, they get
fined $800 million for distributing and spreading false information about Dominion voting machines.
That was a dumpster fire compared to the nuclear mushroom cloud of misinformation on Dominion
that happened on META. But META passed this legislation that inoculates them from any
liability. That makes no sense. So remove 230 elect people who are going to pass laws to hold
these companies to the same level of accountability. We hold any other industry. So I think it's up to
voters and our leadership to do what we've done in every industry and say, okay, if you knew that
not putting airbags in this car and a steering shaft that doesn't collapse and windshields that
are not shatterproof and people start dying everywhere, they get to sue you. You can't even
do that with social media. They can't be sued. They have liability shields. They literally can't.
There's almost nothing you can do to them. So I see us as at fault. I think we've got to put in
place people who understand these technologies, can regulate them, and I think we need to restore
the algebra deterrence. Thank you for the question. Hello. Hi, Rob. What does the agency of the future
look like? If someone is young and creative and would normally go into advertising, marketing,
whatever, what would they go into in the future? If that's not necessarily what you see is going
to be the case? I think there's going to be a lot of services needed. I'd see agencies evolving to
more, for lack of a better term, supply chain and innovation and storytelling across new mediums,
really helping companies work through issues around AI. I think there's going to be a ton of help,
a ton of demand for smart people who offer outsourced service. The great thing I used to pitch
consulting, right? I was in your business. I started running started firms. I'm like,
you can fire me more easily than you can fire an employee. And you're not sure of this brand
then you buy into it or not, but give it a test, hire us for a year, ring fence your investment
to half a million bucks. And if it doesn't work, you don't have an entire department to laugh,
right? Companies trying to figure out AI, companies trying to figure out storytelling on
all these new mediums. And I would imagine there's a lot of niche opportunities. It's just that
a great business model was to come in with really attractive, compelling people to tell a story
and then convince you to spend more and more on broadcast so they could take 8 to 12%.
That was a really compelling business model. And I feel like a lot of the industry world is still
clinging to that model. And I don't think it works. I think I would, a business model, I would
suggest retainers. We're smart people. We'll answer your two or three biggest problems around
brand or media and you're going to pay us 50, 100, 200 grand a month. And we're just going to be
your department, but you're not going to have to pass health care. We're easy to fire. You can swap
us out in two years when we run out of ideas. We're not politically weaponized. We don't know
what the pet projects are here. And I think that a lot of companies are going to want to outsource
a lot of this. But I think there's so much insecurity around there, around branding,
storytelling, innovation, AI, supply chain, that I think it's going to be a great time to be in
the services business. And then also people who are great, higher young people are great athletes.
Great thing about the services business is it's incredibly,
it's an incredible training. You have to be a great athlete. You have to be good with clients.
You have to know how to manage your business. You have to be able to attract and retain people.
The bad news is I've always thought of it, unless you absolutely love it,
it's a young person's game. It took a huge toll on me. I was roaming the planet. It took a huge,
oh, you know, Samsung call. The CMO wants you at the board meeting and it's sold tomorrow. Can
you be there? Sure I can. I mean, just ting, ting, ting. Being in the services business,
I think it's a great training. I think it's a difficult way to have sustainable relationships.
I don't know if you found that. You don't need to tell me, but, but I think it's a great time
to be in the services business. I just think it's going to be a difficult time if you're
banking on traditional media and also just very crudely. As far as media,
your return on your human and financial capital will be inversely correlated to the screen
that you're servicing. So you want to be in the business of creating media for a 50 meter screen
called a movie theater. You better have rich parents. It's that business. All this majestic
nostalgia around movies are back in Barbenheimer. Movie receipts are off 20% from 2019 this year.
They were up 20% this year. They're down 20% from 2019. I mean, I go to the movies because
I have kids, but I used to go to the movies twice a week. I used to see movies four and five times
when I was a kid. I saw the empire strikes back seven times and that was normal behavior.
That is no longer the way the content in your home is so amazing now. Next smaller screen,
your TV, big business growing a little bit on the whole, but tough, getting tougher. This thing,
you can tell stories on this thing, champagne and cocaine. So whenever I hear a kid talking
about creative or media, I'm like, what size screen are you producing content for? And if you
want to be in the movie business, oh my gosh, that is a tough, tough business. When I meet movie
producers, I'm like, oh, your spouse is rich, right? It's true. Or they're like amazingly talented,
like crazy freakishly talented, right? And when I tell young people is surf for the waves are easy.
Go to an industry that has an employment rate of more than 90%. I wanted to be an athlete and I
quickly, when you went to UCLA, I realized I was not in the 0.1%. So it was a blessing to be living
with exceptional athletes and realize that I was mediocre at it. But here's the thing, in brand
strategy, consulting or analytics, you just need to be good, not even great, just be good and you
can make a great living. So going in and doing industry that I also think another, another graph
I have this last in my class at Stern, I have a graph, the correlation between the return on
your investment in your career is in, it's inversely correlated to how sexy the industry is.
You want to open a member's only club for artists and fashion industry? Oh my god, that sounds awesome.
Expect to lose a lot of money. You want to be in food, fashion, the arts, anything that sounds
remotely cool. It's overinvested, which drives down returns. You want to build a software scheduling
platform for healthcare maintenance workers? Jesus Christ, that sounds awful. Ka-ching.
Ka-ching. The most boring, non-romantic businesses offer the greatest return on
invested capital. So if you want to go into a sexy industry, just be clear, you better be in
the top 1%, SAG-AFTRA. It's not easy to get a SAG-AFTRA card. This is the Union for Actors
and Actresses, I guess they call them all Actors now. 180,000 of the most talented people in the
world. Hard to get that card. 87% will qualify for health insurance because they make less than
$23,000 a year. You really want to be in that industry? You really want to be in that industry?
I went to UCLA with the best athletes in the world, went to the Olympics, played professional
baseball, professional basketball. Reggie Miller and Troy Aikman made a shit ton of money. Those
were my classmates. I'm aging myself. Everyone else was calling me at 27 looking for a job. They
went to the Olympics. They got a bronze medal. Great. Great experience. No money in it.
The sexier an industry and buy something super sexy on a big screen, you're fucked.
So ROI inversely correlated to the size of the screen and how sexy an industry is. So if you're
going to be an advertising your own agency, service the just worst sounding industries in the world.
Be like the agency for plumbing supplies or something.
Hi, Jasmine Ferrera, JP Morgan, which I'm laughing as I say if you're a financial
comments, but totally agree. Right now, I'm going back to the social media thing because it's just
with the listeners, it's just such a hot topic. We know it's not right today, but what can we as
marketers do today to get it right without the regulation in place?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure.
Try and reward platforms to be hit, but it's so hard because
you're a marketer. I can't stand meta. I advertise on meta. I have an online education company.
I choose me over, I mean, it's very hard. You'd be doing your clients a disservice if you decided,
Alphabet radicalizes young men or meta is depressing young teens. So we don't advertise for our
clients. You'd be doing our clients a disservice because these are monopolies and they kind of
control the ecosystem. So I don't know. I think I was asked this question. I presented to
Elliot a few days ago, which is one of the largest hedge funds. The only people who pay my speaking
fees now are these large hedge funds. By the way, I speak at JP Morgan all the time.
Look, I think the best thing a JP Morgan can do or a big successful financial services firm is
to stop what I'll call certification based hiring. What do I mean by that?
Try and allocate 10, 20, 30% of the professional track positions in your department
to kids who you develop a what I'll call a skills based assessment as opposed to a
certification based assessment. And that is we fetishize kids from elite universities.
And at Morgan Stanley, and I imagine JP Morgan, it's very hard to get past security unless you
went to an elite college for a professional track job. And the problem is when you decide you're
only going to hire people from elite universities, you're never going to hire a single mother.
You're going to hire very few Latinas. And there's some really good kids out there that just aren't
cut out for college. Only one third of kids get a traditional college degree. So I'm wearing
with a hedge fund right now to come up with a skills based assessment. And they just hired their
first non, they've hired a woman who was a high school dropout that's like a math wiss.
And they gave her a test and she has great critical thinking, you know, took the GSE,
whatever you call it, she dropped out of high school. She had an addiction problem.
But she's very, very smart and they think it's going to work out. So 10, 20, 30, 50% of jobs try
and go through the effort of saying finding someone who maybe doesn't have an elite college degree
who could potentially be successful. Because I worry that me and my colleagues are
creating a new caste system where the small number of people who graduate from elite colleges
who are one or two things, they either have rich parents or they're freakishly remarkable at the age
of 17. I mean, I don't know about any of you. I was not freakishly remarkable at 17. But UCLA had a
76% admissions rate. This year it's going to be nine. And so in the tale that wags the dog for
colleges is recruiters. So I think that JPM Oregon, a company that's as powerful as JPM Oregon,
if they decide, they say we're moving to a skills-based assessments as opposed to a
certification-based assessment. And we're going to try to make sure we hire from a lot of what
I'll call the non-name brand schools and figure out a way to identify the best kids at those schools.
I think that's the best way for an organization like JPM Oregon, much less the marketing department,
to kind of move society forward. Me and my colleagues, every morning we wake up and we
look in the mirror and we ask ourselves the same question. How do I increase my compensation?
While reducing my accountability. And the way we have figured out how we can do that is by
LVMHing colleges. Harvard has grown its endowment 5,000% in the last 40 years. It's increased
its freshman class 4%. So we have these incendiary arguments over how many non-whites we let in or
how many gay kids we let in. It's a total misdirect. It's not who we let in. The question should be
how many, right? We should be letting in more trans kids, more non-white kids, more white kids
from Appalachia, more conservative kids. We just need more. But until we get to that point,
I think the big corporations that are amazing platforms, like someone gets a job at JPM Oregon.
I have this conversation all the time. They come into my office and they'll say,
I got a job at JPM Oregon, but I really want to start my own company. I'm like,
don't be fucking stupid. Go to JPM Oregon. These big companies, the American Corporation,
is the greatest wealth builder in the history of mankind. They're huge platforms. They'll
have that mole removed. They'll figure out for you, wait to save money. They'll care about you.
You can totally fuck up and they'll forgive you. They will invest for you. They are just amazing.
You got to put up a lot of bullshit, right? People less smart than you will get promoted.
You'll get an email from, someone will tell you there's a new policy and you won't even know
why or who decided and you have to comply with it. But if you can put up with that and you're
patient, you can get wealthy slowly. They'll invest in you. They're nice people. They try to
be civic minded. They try to comply with the law and they try not to discriminate. They will give
you, what's maternity leave at JPM Oregon? For example, in the UK, you can get up to six months
now. Okay. Dudes get six months paternity leave. Do you know what paternity leave was when I was
at Morgan Stanley? It was, oh, you're not committed. Take the afternoon. That was paternity
leave. Take the afternoon. That was literally, my mom was a secretary. They didn't have maternity
leave. I mean, they had unpaid, but they didn't have maternity leave. So big corporations have
come really far. I think that we romanticize entrepreneurship and we don't give big corporations
the power or the prestige they deserve. The key is how do big corporations start hiring people
who haven't been fortunate enough to go to elite universities? That was a word solid.
I would say just make it your own personal in the department in JPM Oregon. I've talked to Jamie
about this. You got to hire more unremarkable kids. And when I say unremarkable, I mean,
they didn't go to elite universities. Their parents aren't rich. Are they good kids? Are
they smart? Do they test well? Whatever it might be. I'd like to see corporate American universities
be like the Navy SEALs. Anyone can go try out for the Navy SEALs. Anyone can show up day one
for the Navy SEALs. Not everyone makes it, but everyone gets to show up. I think that's what
college should be like. I mean, you're always going to have elite colleges, but 76% when I apply
to now it's nine. Just weird. Anyways, we're out of time, Scott, but thank you so much. Thank you.
Really appreciate it. Big round of applause.
