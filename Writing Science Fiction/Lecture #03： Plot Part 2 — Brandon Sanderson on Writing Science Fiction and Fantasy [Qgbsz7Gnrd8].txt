Alright guys, let's do class. Yay! Oh boy, class! So the way I'm going to format the
class this year is we will do our second week on plot this week and then next week I'm
going to dedicate to going through your questions that you've written on your little slips about
plot or whatever it is. I'll do last weeks and this weeks. So if there are things that
I don't answer about plot or things that are confusing or what not or you want me to dig
in deeper to, put them on your sheets and those will come to you next week and we'll
do a Q&A episode. The week after that I believe Isaac can confirm will be the week that Mary
Robinette will be here. Whatever the week of the 18th is, the week that Mary Robinette
will be here and she is going to talk to you about short stories I think is what we decide
it. So something she's much better at than I am. So let's talk more about plot. So last week we
dug into this kind of my philosophy about promises, progress and payoffs, right? It was kind of high
level conceptual stuff. Today I want to dig into a little bit more of the nitty gritty. How do you
actually construct a plot? What are the pieces that go together to make a plot work? How do you make
an outline? Now the caveat to this is not everybody uses an outline. An outline is not
necessary to write a story, even a very complex one. Generally as we talked about in the first week
people do kind of fall in the spectrum between how much upfront work they want to do and how
much back end work they want to do. That's really the discussion you're having when you're deciding
if you're more of a discovery writer or more of an outline writer, how much up front work, how much
back end work. Both have to do some up front work and both have to do some back end work. Discovery
writer is generally offloading a lot of stuff that the outline writer does to the end to do more
revisions to try and fix things that are broken, whereas the outline writer tends to front load
it and try to get it a cleaner first draft. If you are a discovery writer by nature and you think
why are we focused, can I go to sleep for this entire thing? Well, I was a student, so yes if
you need to go to sleep go ahead. These are comfy chairs, much more comfy than most classrooms,
but most of the time the discovery writers I know they like knowing this stuff because this is the
sort of thing you do in drafting as you look for what is the structure of my plot, what are my
promises, what are my payoffs, how am I making this work. In fact a lot of my friends who are
discovery writers it's like their first draft is kind of like a really good outline and their
second draft then becomes the equivalent of the outline writer's first draft. In fact I have
a good friend who writes every book twice from scratch, writes the book all the way through,
puts it aside, now that's her outline and she starts on page one and writes every word again
using that as an outline. I think that would be miserable, right? That's why it's good that there
are different writers and there is no one way to do this because for me doing upfront work and
creating an outline helps me a great deal. Why do I like this? Well I've talked to you guys a little
bit about how as a writer, as you progress as a writer you learn to do some things by instinct
and you then can focus on other things in your actual writing hour by hour day by day and get
better at those things. An outline works a little bit like that for me in that I can offload some
of the work that I would have to be doing while I'm sitting and writing to a planning session
before I start the book which means that when I sit down to write the chapter there are fewer
things I have to keep in my brain because the chapter outline has provided some of the high
level stuff that I need to accomplish and I can focus on just making this chapter exciting,
making it interesting, making sure it's active rather than passive, making sure that instead of
infodumps we're focusing on what the character's motivations are and how they see the world and
I do this we're going to talk about my method of outlining right now first. This is just one
that works very well for me. Now when I was in high school or junior high or whatever and they
talked about outlines they talked about an outline having you know a number one and then an A and
then you know I and then II and that was what your outline looked like and so when I got into
writing I assumed that's what an outline was. An outline is not necessarily that. In fact if an
editor asks you to send them an outline for your story that is just shorthand for about a three page
document telling them your story. It does not indicate they don't want us heading one subheading
B and they say send me three sample chapters in an outline. It can be longer than three pages,
three to five pages is what I would recommend, nothing longer than ten. Ten is getting into like
if you are writing an epic fantasy and you are working with the editor and they've already bought
the book and they want the outline then you know they can get longer but if they up front are just
asking what they want is a summary. Outline means summary to editors. Now for me that's not what
my outline looks like either it is not a summary. In writing my books and if I get on the ball we
will post for you guys one of my outlines because I can give you the one for Steelheart or for Skyward
because those ones are a little bit easier to understand than Stormlight Outlines. This is in
part because so many things in the Stormlight Outline are actually referencing to my wiki,
my internal wiki which is all my world building and things like that and so most of my outlines
will look like this. They will start with a heading for character then they will have a heading for
setting and then they will have a heading for plot and these will each be I will use Microsoft
Words document map and I'll make these top level of an outline in this case it is building an
outline so I can easily get through the document and click to things that I want and then underneath
character there will be the names of each of the characters right so you know Cal,
Ladin, Shalon, Dalinar, Zeph. So you know like for the main characters and then there will be let
me erase underneath and just kind of go a little bit more so I will give each main character
their own heading and then I will have a separate heading for side characters underneath it and
then there will be some bullet points underneath that are a different outline level. So the character
one is I start out saying what is the characters arc and under each of these characters like if
you went to the Caledon one this by the way I am explaining it to look way prettier than it
actually does in the original way of Kings Outline. In Skyward it actually kind of looks like you
might be able to understand so I will try to get you that one or Steelheart but it will say you
know under this I will have a paragraph that explains who they are right and then I will have
another one that is kind of like this is intro and then this is arc right and that will be like arc
one arc two and things like that and this will be for every character will be like this is where
they're starting this is where they're going I'll get into how I build those arcs in a minute
alright I'm just kind of giving you what it looks like and the side characters might only have like
one little paragraph about each of them. Under setting I will have large headings that will
talk about things like the magic or the tech the world building like the physical setting and the
cultural setting. Don't stress too much about this because we will have two entire weeks talking
about setting and we'll have two entire weeks talking about character I'm just giving you the
format of what this looks like for me and under there that's gonna read more like an
encyclopedia entry this is me defining terms for each of these they'll be subheadings if it's
getting very long and I usually do split between physical setting and cultural setting and we'll
do a day on each of those during world building we'll talk about kind of the differences and
why I group them that way but ignoring all of that for now let's look at plot because today is our
plot day so when I am building my plot in my outline for a book I am looking for a couple of
things one of the main things I'm looking for are my promises my progress and my payoff and the
most important thing generally for me to determine is the progress part because once I understand the
progress part in my outline I can figure out the correct promises and how to make good on that and
when I'm doing that I am usually looking for some sort of plot archetype that I can use by my
definitions today a plot archetype is different from a plot structure plot structure which we'll
talk about a little bit later is something like three act format or the hero's journey a plot
archetype is a style of plot what we're trying to achieve to explain this I'll talk about I'll use
Mistborn right when I was building Mistborn there were a couple things that made me excited to
write the book the first was that it was going to be a heist this was one of my primary plot
archetypes heist is a type of story it is a story that you can go find other heist type stories and
learn what they did you can research them you can figure them out and you can start using them I
also knew in my outlining that there was going to be a master apprentice plot right that there was
going to be this story about then learning to become a Mistborn this is the my fair lady side of it
right then trains underkels here to learn to move among the nobility and also to learn how to use
alamance right and then I also knew there was going to be what I'll call an information plot
info this is a plot it's a mystery right there are certain things we don't know about the history
of the Lord ruler that are going to be teased as clues so I look at these three things and I say
how do I build a story around these ideas oh there's there's also one more there is the relationship
right there's a there's a relationship a Vin and Ellen romance subplot I think I got all the
main ones looking at that someone asked when I was scanning the the questions which will start
digging into next week when they said do you use only one sort of progress and one sort of payoff
for a book or do you use more which is an excellent question there's your answer Mistborn has four
major ones that I was juggling this is appropriate for an epic fantasy novel right the thing is one
does kind of have to be more important than the others and as I worked on this this book I really
kind of moved the heist kind of almost being secondary and it was the master apprentice
plot that became the actual main like if you're reading the book most of the sense of progress
you're getting is then becoming Mistborn and that is the core most of the time you're spending
with her is her going to the balls fighting the people learning the magic all of these things and
so it's actually really a master apprentice story that has a B plot or a sub mode that is a heist
that also has these kind of minor other secondary plots now building one of these I'm going to
focus a little bit on the heist because I want to talk to you about what I did to to build the
heist even though I've just told you it became the secondary plot what I find very useful is to
see what other people have done you can create something whole cloth well some people will say
you can't but you don't have to use one of these plot structures or even these plot archetypes but
man it can be handy to look and see what other people have done to try and become a chef in the
way that I told you on the first week instead of just following a recipe I want you to start
looking at recipes and things people have created and try to pull out what works what I did is I went
to a bunch of my favorite heist stories and I'm going to use films of examples because they are
a little easier to to break down the structure because they tend to be more focused than the
novel does by the nature of their medium so I'm going to use I watched a bunch of heists I read a
bunch of heists I mentioned a bunch of those in a previous week and I settled on there kind of
being two main archetypes for a heist I realized there was what I'm going to call the Ocean's 11
and what I'm going to call the Italian job both of these have had very prominent remakes around the
time when I was when I was working on these books and so what happened with these I looked at them
I'm like what makes them interesting why do they work well the Ocean's 11 type plot goes like this
you gather a team you usually have one newbie to explain things to so you gather a team you
grab your newbie you then have a explain the plot explain the problem and Ocean's 11 of the
remake they have this thing where like it's it's Brad Pitt that's there right and they're saying
we have to do this and he's like which we can't ever do it might be George Clooney saying it but
it's basically they present the problem with a cool sort of cinematic methodology to them it's
like here is the bank we're the casino we're going to rob they have this thing that we'll have to
beat which we can't beat because it's impossible and they have this thing we have to be which we
can't beat because it's impossible and we have this thing and they lay out basically here are all
here's the big problem of what we're going to do and then they start talking about breaking it to
little pieces and you follow the newbie usually along going to get all the little parts that are
going to come together for your big solution but the one of the key attributes of this heist was
at the end there's a piece missing that the newbie often is like but what about this they're like
oh we'll figure that out you don't have to worry about that there's a big piece missing and you
get to follow along these little pieces as you see how they're going to solve each of the problems
that they had and they explain the problem plot but you still got this lingering what's going to
happen with the piece that's missing everything's going we're going to go wrong it creates the sense
of doom and dread and inevitability until you get to the end and then the twist is they all knew
how they're going to solve that problem anyway they just didn't tell the newbie so they could
surprise us right and so at the ending you think everything went wrong but then they take off their
masks and lo and behold they were the SWAT team all along or something like that and boom we actually
all went according to plan you just didn't know it this is different from the italian job plot
which has kind of some similar attributes the gatherer team explain problem
but this style of heist did something really interesting that I found they introduced problem
number a problem number b or letter problems a b c and d right and they said we're going to solve
them with solutions one two three and four and you follow the plot kind of the same way except
at the end they get to the ending and they find out that instead of problems a b c and d they have
problems e f g and h you've probably seen heists like this they do all their planning they do all
their preparation they're ready to go and then like they move the target it goes to another country
or something like that and suddenly all this preparation is out the window we talked about
this a little bit last week and they pull the rug out from underneath the the no it wasn't to you guys
it was someone else never mind I talked told someone they asked me what do I do if I want to
pull the rug out from underneath people this is a great way to do that because the way that they
solve this do you guys know you've you guys seen this movie what do they do they don't exactly they
take solution one and they say wow if we if we jury rig this thing we can solve problem f with that
and number four like the person we recruited specifically to crack the safe can actually
break into this car that we can use and suddenly we'll use two for e and three for for h and what
happens is you get a jumbling up of all the preparations solving the problems in different
and unexpected ways why this works so well is oftentimes if you want to have a cool twist in
your story and you pull the rug out from underneath people it's a little bit like I said last week
promising someone a car and giving them something else completely different that they're not expecting
in addition in your storytelling your reader will invest time in the middle in your progress
they'll spend most of the time in the book focusing on the things the characters are doing to
progress the story and so if you built a heist where you made one two three and four completely
irrelevant now that is 80 percent of the reader's experience in the story getting thrown out the
window and they will feel annoyed at you all right they will be frustrated because you promised
them something you were also probably probably promising them a twist if you're doing a heist
because heists are kind of about twists but you have also upended them how do you solve this you
make sure that the time they spent on one two three and four is still very relevant by applying it
on the fly to solve new problems which suddenly becomes very satisfying because you both get a
twist plus you feel like your expertise the amount of time you as a reader spent experience in the
story came together at the ending um and so breaking this down let me ask you guys thinking
about as a chef why is a heist satisfying why do people want to watch a heist why do they enjoy
a heist it doesn't have to even do with the things i mentioned up here because there are pieces i
haven't even mentioned that are relevant what to you what what makes it work yeah the thrill of
getting away with it the thrill of getting away with it exactly yeah there's for a lot of great
even uh heists were the good guys you know the the heroes are are actually on the side of law
there's a sense of we actually got away with it you know we robbed hitler or something like that
right um yeah yeah there's definitely a sense of that yeah hyper competent characters uh we
will speak in the character week about how competence is something really attractive to readers
the puzzle is figuring out how they do it yeah the puzzle both of these leave you with a puzzle
right one of them leaves you with the we have to improvise um which tends to work better if you
have a lot of viewpoint characters in charge because you don't have to hide things from them
you can cheat and hide things from from people because i used more of an oceans 11 style for
miss born if you were following these things um i put a little bit of an italian job twist at the
end but mostly it was calcier is hiding things from everybody and these viewpoint character you
you have to cheat a little bit to do that um go ahead the feeling of rebellion
exactly you're getting away with something you're doing something cool that's outside the the rules
yeah even again if it's the hero the protagonists are heroes it's like the mission impossible team
no one else could do this because these people can break the rules and go outside what everyone
else expects and pull off something incredible we do we really do this is why there's that scene
right with george cloney and brad pit being like we have to do this which is impossible and this
which we'll never be able to do because it sets this expectation this promise to you and that is
this is going to be cool to see them pull this off because it's going to be hard but they're
going to do it and that scene is a promise it's a really cool promise um right yeah
because stealing something from the dragon again is some ontologically very there at least we get
the same feelings from that as we you know our lives are part heist movie yeah like everything
this this whole plot line is about how we have to confront problems in the real world with the
tools that we have available we don't know how we're going to make it out when we're going to
be unknown it's just something that's it's very meaningful and important because it's real right
so my recommendation to you is when you're doing this when you're breaking down a plot one of the
things I would recommend you do is ask yourself these questions why do people love this why do I
love this why do I really like taking one of these plots um and watching them or playing with them
uh what are the elements I have to make sure I don't get rid of right hyper competence
you could make a heist without hyper competence it would be a different type of story but if
what you love about them is that hyper competence lean into that and make sure you're making use of
that um in order to tell your story uh one of the cool things about starting to look at plots
like this is also you can strip a plot down to its archetype and you can apply then genre trappings
to it um it's really interesting I I've done all this and then I had a chance to talk with uh Joe
Russo who was one of the the filmmakers one of the directors who made uh infinity war and I asked him
I said um Joe what did you like how did you build the plot of infinity war and he said oh it's really
cool not a lot of people understand how to do this but we just took a heist for them it was a
bash and grab which is actually a third archetype I didn't put up put up on here and we said we're
going to do a superhero movie that's a heist and we're going to plot it like this and apply it to
superhero science fiction and people will love it because they love a heist but they also won't
look at it and see a heist because they'll see a superhero story um and I'm like that's really
interesting um tell me more about how you did that because it looked really like what I'd like to do
and indeed it is I don't think that uncommon for storytellers to say let's take what works really
well in this genre and let's apply other trappings to it um so that I have a familiar framework
I've talked a lot about the uh the underdog sports story as an archetype right because the
underdog sports story um is a fun one to point out that um that Hoosiers Enders game and the way
of kings all use the underdog sports story plot archetype as a major um section of their story
but these are three really different stories aren't they right remember the titans versus
enders game you'd be like oh completely different genres but they have the same plot archetype
which is the underdog sports story um being able to look at these and strip them down also helps
you understand your progress right this is where you can go wrong sometimes if you think like if
you're writing a fantasy novel and you're like well fantasy novels are travel logs let's say
you've only read some quest fantasies that you really like you're like it has to be a travel
log so I'm going to make my sense of progress going from city to city to city but really what you
want to tell is a romance between two characters and that's the bulk of the time you're going to spend
on your pages focusing on this relationship and the relationship is not making any progress
it doesn't matter where you're going your reader's going to feel bored they're going to feel like
nothing's happening because the bulk of what you're giving them is a romance plot with or a
relationship plot without progress what you want to be able to identify is how what are your steps
now a heist is kind of interesting in this way because your steps are generally you have to
explain the problem it actually gives the reader an outline like here is the outline of what our
story is going to be we have these 12 problems and we're going to attack them one at a time
and then your sense of progress is as you go to piece by piece by piece and see them accomplishing
or failing and having to go do something new because one of their pieces didn't work it has a
pretty easy straightforward structure of if you're checking things off that list and coming closer
and closer to being able to pull off the heist the reader's anticipation for that heist will grow
they will know something's got to go wrong because it always does you will probably
put seeds in by either saying well there's this one thing we haven't figured out yet
or by saying everything's great we're ready to go tomorrow oh no they moved the target
um you will be able to build this tension through progress progress progress progress
and once you identify that it makes your promise scene much easier to write
your promise scene in a heist is this one right here right you do not have to do it
exactly as they did in fact i recommend that you don't but you see how that promise works
really well and then your payoff at the end is them pulling off the heist despite the problems
that came along the way um very simple very straightforward it is harder to do than say
so let's look at some other styles of plots um and some of the progress we can have in those
and how those payoffs can match their promises at the beginning and let's start with a mystery
so get a classic detective mystery who done it murder mystery why do we enjoy murder mysteries
anyone who does right go ahead they're clever okay there's an implicit promise that the detective
is going to be smarter than the villain right that's what we're looking at yeah puzzle aspect again
we want to figure out we yeah we just want to figure out what happened we want to know what
happened we want to know how they did it unless the reversal is they show you how they did it
and then you're gonna see like was that colombo right where they reversed they inverted the trope
yeah sometimes it's a muscle for you the challenge of can i figure this out for sure
log holmes does yep that i think is a major draw of mysteries can i figure it out um let me
highlight that one for a minute because mysteries if you cheat and the reader couldn't have figured it
out a lot of times that will feel very unsatisfying for this reason right um people are not understand
writers are not understanding that part of the promise of a mystery is you will be able to
figure this out if you are laying the clues it's not going to be so out there and if you've read
or watched a mystery that was really unsatisfying to you at the ending it might have been because
they promised who with these clues of information you could solve this crime and then there was no
way for you to come anywhere close you feel cheated at the end yeah i like the possibility of having
a very witty characters with really great dialogues bounce off each other as the investigator tries
to decipher right that tends to be a hallmark of the detective driven uh murder mystery is
you're gonna like the detective and it might be because they're witty right it might just be because
they're foxy and uh you know uh they're they're more agatha christie you're just gonna enjoy not
agatha christie uh angela landsbury they're gonna be angela landsbury you're just gonna enjoy
watching her solve a mystery because she's just so likable but there's gonna be a connection
to um the uh to the detective and in agatha christie it often was about how clever the detective was
um so go ahead yeah i think one of the things that i like about mystery is like some misdirection
so like that you don't because you can still figure it out right you don't go from point a all the way
like all the way for like okay okay i think this part is going and suddenly like i don't like to see that but now i can see where that's coming
right a mystery um um implies that there is going to be some difficulty to this and there are going
to be new revelations um i identify a mystery as an information plot right a mystery is characters don't
have all the information and the progress is watching the characters get that information
as you try to put together what that information means um spoiler and Mistborn it is the uh
the true history of the lord ruler i won't say what it is but the true history of the lord ruler um
the book lies to you at the beginning and then indicates that the that the story is a lie that
you've been told gives you clues along the way and then the mystery comes together at the end of
understanding it now what is really fun to do is um in Mistborn the missing piece is not something
kelsier knows a hundred percent it is the information plot right if we can put together
the information plot we can solve the missing piece of the heist that uh kelsier is confident he can do
but doesn't quite have all the pieces yet um and so i was able to slot that information plot into this
kind of big problem in the plan as presented um but relationships why do we like by the way
usually a buddy cop movie and a jane austin novel follow about the same plot plot archetype right um
right just with some different trappings um and subplots like a lot of classic romances and classic
buddy cop movies are just relationship um plots it's whether it's a bromance or a romance uh it
tends to follow the same plot beats so why what's exciting for us about a romance why are we reading
romance why do writers put them in almost every story
wish fulfillment
yes wish fulfillment um do not discount the power of wish fulfillment right um in all
kinds of plots um so what else right absolutely i think you nailed it like it is one of these
plots that you can put into the most fantastical and strange of stories to give it a really powerful
human element i think it shares something with mysteries and that you know the mystery is going
to be solved you know the two people are going to get together but can you figure it out
right um it is there generally going to get together but how the how is really exciting
and interesting to us uh we have two romance writers right over here do you guys have anything to add
nice to remember how it used to feel no that is that is also pretty awesome um we're going to have
these two ladies talk to us one of the weeks about indie publishing because both of them
have indie published a number of books uh so look forward to that um on how we're going to do that so
i don't want to spend a ton of time on this uh sometimes we get up on the board and we start
breaking these all down and we spend a long time on it i think i did it in the previous previous
lecture series so you can watch that on youtube um but i think you guys get the idea identifying
the why why we like this and then figuring out how you can quantify that how you can break it down
into small steps is how you build um a lot of outlines not the only way but how it works really
well and this is where we get to how does brandon make an outline when i make an outline my outline
looks like this um it starts with at the top what i want to have happen uh relationship
character a and b uh are a couple at the end right and i'll define what that is based on the
story that might just be they have gotten over their their issues of hating each other and are
now willing to work together um whatever it is i've identified what i want to happen i outline
backward i start with my goal because once i've identified what makes something satisfying i come
up with you know what what progress makes it satisfying i'm like what is the best ending for
this story with that plot archetype what is going to work what is going to be exciting
then i'm going to add underneath this bullet points of all the steps that will take them
from the beginning of that to the end um generally they'll be like a paragraph at the
top the relationship it's like here's what i want to achieve these two characters start here
they get here and here are all the things i need to include to make sure that happens um you know
it would generally be depending on the plot that i'm doing like bullet point one would be all right
seem showing how this character one is really competent in one area and is living their life
but has a need has something that they are missing then character two will show how they're
capable in their life in some areas but they are missing something different and the astute reader
will notice hey what this person is good at is where this person's hole is and where this person's
hole is this person has some strength right and then you will want to introduce why they don't just
immediately propose to one another the first time they meet right what is going to be the conflict
that is uh pulling them apart well one's uh one's a montague and one's uh cat yeah that um right
what what is going to be uh pulling them apart and then i'm going to create uh you know i'm not
going to actually create this thing i'm going to say seeing where they are working together and um
dav when he taught this class talked about relationship plots as braiding roses right
because everybody has thorns and at the start of the story you your thorns just smash into each
other right um and so your relationship plot could go with the first time they meet it's a
disaster for this reason second time they meet it's a disaster for this reason but then you have a
scene where you realize that what character a does character b means and another scene where
character b realizes wow what character a is doing here is something that i admire and you slowly as
dav put put it you braid those roses so that by the end of the story instead of the thorns
pointing at each other they're pointing outward toward anyone who could come in and try to destroy
the relationship right which is a really great metaphor uh which is why it stuck with me for
20 years um braid those roses so you would come up with all of these things and they're just bullet
points they're not scenes yet they are character a sees character b with his little sister and
realizes that there's a deep uh caring for other people that he doesn't often express because of
whatever and you're like wow that's an admirable attribute about him um i am interested right um
i don't know what that interaction with the sister is going to be i just know the sister
is relevant i have all of these bullet points and then i jump over to the other the next one
right it's like now we're going to do our mystery and i'm going to say all right underneath here i
guess i didn't circle it before i put underneath here i'm like discover x and explain why discovering
x is going to be awesome i want that end scene to be really really cool when ray oden puts it
together why the magic is broken x happens right uh which is a very dramatic and powerful scene
because uh because uh because ray oden's plot is half mystery uh in a launchers and that's kind of
the the plot structure i was using though i didn't know how to do all of this back then i just kind
of went uh with my gut so discover x and this is the scene that's going to happen this is how
i do it and then how do i earn that scene well here instead of all the other things these are going
to be clues that are going to be discovered that are going to interlock with the other clues or
sometimes be red herrings that you later on discovered weren't doing what you thought they
would do um and this is how i develop my sense of progress bullet point to bullet point to bullet
point um slow and steady quantified i'll do this for every plot cycle in the book and generally
for every kind of character arc once i've determined the character arcs what they're gonna be so my
outline is generally at this point not in order it is an order by section right um then as i start
writing i start grabbing bullet points from different headings and saying chapter one is going
to be this bullet point and this bullet point chapter two is from a different plot archetype
bullet point and this one and i start organizing those bullet points and this is where when we
give you the skyward outline you'll be like um you go to the end you'll probably will see
that a lot of these bullet points have been moved into order into a whole sequence of arcs and plots
that i am doing while i'm writing i am changing um this i've got the bullet points all done i
usually start writing and then i'm building a full outline of the bullet points in order
chronologically not just by plot archetype but together and i'm building scenes out of them
as i imagine where they're going to be but if the end or at the beginning of a day when i sit down
to write oftentimes it's like you need to write a scene that achieves a b and c which is way easier
for me than trying to keep a whole plot in my head and try to write so that that plot works and
studying be like oh today i just have to do this today i have to write a nivani scene where she
does x y um and then encounters z right um i can do that now let's focus on making that scene active
interesting taking place in an interesting setting um having some good dynamic conflict to the scene
i can use those bullet points to launch me into a great chapter um and this works for me because
again it lets me offload a bunch of stuff to the beginning any questions about that go ahead um so
do you necessarily have to have multiple like plot architects that you're intertwining with one
another or is that mostly just for epic fantasy is one simple excellent question so you have to
have multiple plot archetypes that you're intertwining together um or is that just something for epic
fantasy the answer is the shorter the piece you're writing the fewer of these you're usually going
to have and the longer the piece you're writing the more of them you're going to have it is not a
one-to-one correlation there are some very long stories that are plotted more as a series of
explosions that the character is dealing with and the book ends just when there's not another
explosion uh nothing goes wrong this time uh feels more discovery written that way it
works really well we'll talk about it under discovery plotting but most of the time for a
novel you're generally going to want at least one plot archetype at least one character arc
and at least one sort of sub plot archetype either a relationship or a master apprentice or
something like that i would say that's what you're looking at most of the time right for skyward
which is much less complex for skyward i was using the uh boy and boy finds a dragon age plot archetype
it's not if like i don't know if you could find that one in books on plots but it's one i noticed
um i i read a lot of great books i'm like i'm gonna use a boy and his dragon egg except it's
going to be a girl finds a spaceship right um and so the archetype is uh kid finds you know some
cool thing keeps it secret works on it um and that was like the main plot that i was doing
but i had a secondary relationship plot going on and i had a tertiary i had a character arc
for her if you haven't read the book spence has got this kind of these ideals about what a hero
should be and then actually goes to war and has to deal with her idealized picture of heroism
not meshing very well with uh how it is to actually be fighting and that's her character arc and so
those are the three ones there's a couple minor things but i would say that's the
that's the three there is a relationship with the ship she finds but that's kind of built in
to the uh uh kid and the dragon egg story so you can see that one is simpler than way of kings
which has a ton of these things like if the way of kings plots don't fit in a file because i have
all this world building and things they are crazy so uh one thing i do like to do with way of kings
though is make sure that every book has one very relatable plot archetype because the other plots
are generally not following one right this is why having call it and have the underdog sports
story is so important to the way of kings because it could feel like a jumble of a whole bunch of
different things going on because down in our plot is not as simple and as clear cut
an archetypal plot um and shillons is a little bit more um but there's so much going on that if
you don't have that one sturdy central plot to hold on to um then it makes the book feel it would
make it feel just crazy that's why our way of kings the first version i wrote in 2002 went wrong
is it didn't have this it had one section of a bunch of different plots but didn't finish any of
them so anyway there's a question back here yeah go ahead yeah so quick question how do we keep this
fresh especially like i know that good writing will make anything interesting right maybe when
you're pitching it to someone how do you make this fresh um adding the caveat that you know
that good writing will make anything interesting but how do you keep it fresh when you're pitching it
so um this is where the uh the the strange attractor i talked about comes in really handy
when you can pitch um when you can say it's the story of a boy and his dragon except it's a girl
and a spaceship uh suddenly it adds you're you're you're telling people what the new fresh take on
it is and that's actually a very small part of what makes skyward work right what makes skyward
work i hope is a really great execution of this plot with a character um arc that feels really
personal and poignant um that's what's going to make any book work but what hooks people is saying
oh yeah um the hero who has prophesied to save the world failed and now a bunch of people are
going to rob him um and they're like ooh tell me more right this is where pitching becomes
an art of its own right um because really the pitch is a way to get people to read the book
and see that it works and is good but it has to usually want to pitch with one idea and we'll talk
more about pitching as the uh as the the semester progresses but yeah uh focus on one really distinctive
thing um in your pitching and that's like simply doing another heist but adding on an interesting
magic you've come up come up with and a character's interesting generally going to be great right
like i often say plot and character it's a little harder to be really different because
actually it's really easy to be really different it's just unsatisfying right there's a reason that
certain plots are done there's reason that certain characters are done and that is you know you can
look at like the modernist literary movement and uh and anti heroes like in the classical sense like
like madame bovary and things like this and be um trying to write these anti heroes that are just
miserable to read about but there's a reason why you know popular fiction in particular
tends to go back to the same sort of stories so they work real well it's the distinctive flair you
put on it that's going to make it work and setting is where you can go just crazy as long as your
character's relatable and it doesn't matter um you see that in modern animation like if you think
about it trying to tell stories about the like you know what is it Pixar that famous Pixar thing
they're like we're gonna start and we're gonna make it be like bugs have feelings and then we're
gonna make toys have feelings and now feelings have feelings right like um but because you can make
relatable characters you can have a story take place inside a tween girl's mind with personifications
of her emotional states and and have it work because setting is way easier to go crazy on
than plot and character so all right oh wait there was a yeah go ahead
same can you do same plot duplicated in the same story yes you can i would have them play out in
slightly different ways like you can have two relationships and use the way that one is going
sour as a crunch contrast the way that one is going well pride and prejudice folks um right um
and do the reversal where you think the one that is going well because turns out really terribly
and they think the one's going poorly turns out really well and that is the reversal that makes
pride and prejudice so cool right and it's the same two plots just an a plot and a b plot right
right i guess i asked in terms of like you say that if you're gonna have length you need to have
more more of these plot lines and so you could have more of the same ones you could have more of
the same ones to make a story longer if you want to make a story longer more steps is also a way
if you want to make a heist longer what you do is you'd be like we're gonna have to break this up
into three mini heists which is very common for these and this whole section is on stealing this
one thing that'll let us later on steal this other thing and then you do three mini heists
followed by a big heist at the end using the pieces that you've stolen and you just make sure each of
those mini heists has a different flair a different feeling um this is kind of um you you see this a
bit like an inception right um which is doing mini heists leading to a big heist at the end um that
goes crazy um other questions yes all right if you're doing a whole bunch of different things
how do you make sure one doesn't drop out and just vanish and we come back to it they're no
longer interested in it and or have forgotten about it this gets more and more difficult
the longer your story is and the more of these you're juggling um and you're gonna have to come
to some your own decisions on what you want to do here there is the what I'll fondly call the Robert
Jordan the Robert Jordan method is to basically break your be your plot into sections and then
you will get like you'll be like all right there's kind of a mini climax here we're gonna do these
parts of the relationship and then we're going to skip a book um and then you'll come back to it
and I'm gonna try to get you to a part where this is satisfying enough for now or if it's a big
cliffhanger you only have to remember one thing right because we're gonna jump a big time gap before
we get back to it and um this is uh where epic fantasy often has to go um but there is also kind
of the the method of do them one at a time um be like all right opening part of this big long book
we are going to focus on the relationship but then the characters are going to be split apart
and pining for each other for the next part where they're split apart because they've only just had
their relationship start to work and now they get ripped apart um and then that you only have to
keep in your mind one thing um if you are most of the time I have found that you can interweave these
and not have to do this too much um a lot of what I do in the storm light is a kind of a hybrid of
these two is um like Way of Kings is a good example I take Shalon's plot to a stopping point
and then I skip a part and we do Dalinar's plot for a while and then I skip back and I try to make
sure you're getting conclusions to both of them the same book and that Calladin in that first
back book acts as a through line and to make sure their Dalinar and Shalon's plots are short enough
that you can do them in half of a book instead of a whole book um and then I try to weave them
together like that it is a real difficulty it takes practice um this is why um doing a little
work ahead of time and realizing oh man I'm going to have this huge gap where the characters aren't
together maybe I should have the big moment in their relationship happen up here where they break up
because they're going to be away for apart from one another rather than having it be in the middle
of their story all right we'll do one last one and then we'll move on yeah
um what is your plot brainstorming session kind of look like do you just look for these
like and write them all down yeah they're the question is uh what is my plot brainstorming
look like do I just look for a lot of things and then write them all down um kind of like a lot of
times these are simmering for a long time I'm going to the gym I'm working out and I'm imagining
what that last scene is right like the last scenes that of a given plot are what is going through my
head many times before I even sit down to make this thing um but when I'm making this thing I am
generally just kind of saying all right here is the plot archetype that I'm using here are
important elements to it which of those do I want to use that's an important thing that let that'll
segue us into um the next thing I want to talk about is some of these plot structures now I'm
only going to pick a couple of them and talk about how you would apply them because there are a ton
of these helps out there and they all can be really helpful or they can just be useless to you it
depends on if they work for you um but you can buy books you can buy save the cat which is a screen
writing um book that's talking a lot about establishing rooting interest and how to how to plot a story
you can read um many different books there's a nine-point story structure there's a seven-point
story structure uh Dan really likes one of those two I can't remember which one it is um but he's
got a great youtube video on it is it seven it's seven isn't it yeah he has a great youtube video
on seven-point story structure uh Dan Wells um writer everybody uses different things there are
a couple of classics and one of them is in science fiction fantasy the hero's journey right we'll go
through it very shortly right uh you guys probably all know this um if you don't a brief history of
it is that uh guy named uh James Campbell uh was a researcher and ethnographer and a folklorist
and was researching different stories that different people told themselves he wasn't the first to come
up with this but he kind of popularized the idea that a lot of different cultures across cultural
barriers language barriers whatever we're telling the same sorts of stories he called this the monomyth
the story that all he says like all stories are lined with this no they don't but a lot of stories
do um because it's got a very vague structure that has a lot of cool elements to it and the
monomyth is you have a character at home um who doesn't want to go on an adventure they get called
on an adventure um they refuse the call and then they are forced to go out and cross the threshold
into the world all right um what's that to the unknown yeah to the unknown um out to the unknown
um unknown to the character right uh the classic example this is star wars because uh lucas
really liked the monomyth he liked it a little likes a little too much sometimes but he really
likes he has actually some really good um they were pbs specials about the monomyth uh that i think
george lucas himself did um that uh but yes so lucas at home you see the call he looks up in the
sky but then when the call you know you see he wants to go but then when the call actually comes
and everyone says you must learn the ways of the jedi right and uh what does he do it's like no i
gotta go back home and deal with power converters and stuff um no i can't i can't i can't and then he
goes home and what happens there is no home anymore um you know uh only stormtroopers are so precise
or whatever um yeah uh so he's forced to go out into the unknown world right um and so then they
have the trials right this is the the the road of tribulation or whatever it's called
jeb basically problems are popping up um and the character is learning to overcome them usually
there's a mentor uh and then there's not a mentor uh whoop whoop um uh um no um usually you get some
buddies um who will suspiciously not be around anymore by the time you get to the bottom of this
which is the descent in the underworld uh which is where the character either metaphorically or
literally dies um and it's sent to the underworld uh metaphorically they're kind of at their lowest
point everything's going terribly but then they come out of it they have the uh they have the
what's it called um there's the moment of apotheosis um and redemption they call it something else
cambell calls it something else what's that there's rebirth definitely um atonement that's what it is
basically the character's going to change in some way make some decision learn some new skill
make atonement they're going to get rewarded with the elixir um and then they're going to go home with
it um and take the elixir back right there's generally an apathy apotheosis here where it's
like a meeting with divinity or with one's father figure um and kind of you know accepting and
dealing with that taking the elixir and heading home changed bringing the elixir back to the people
at home um but having been changed so much that the uh that the hero is no longer the person who
can stay home and often there's an epilogue where they just wander off uh fallout right um was that
fallout one it was fallout one wasn't it yeah um so is this useful yes it is it's really useful
for envisioning a character arc in an interesting way it's really handy i would recommend reading
about the hero's journey where can it go wrong well there are a lot of things in the hero's
journey that don't match every story for instance uh cambell identified that the hero in the ancient
myths was almost always the result of a divine birth or a virgin birth right um whether you
go great myths zeus was doing something um there there was a really pretty swan or whatever um and
you know um and whatever there is often this child of divinity or child um that was that was
born of mysterious circumstances so what did he add into episode one
where did dirth dar theater come from he was a virgin birth born of the of the of the force
and every single person in that movie theater when i was there was like what like this is cool
this light but what um and this is if i'm going to criticize one of the greatest and most successful
story makers of all time in george lucas which he really is um that is what i consider one of the
dangers of being too slavish to a formula or um a plot structure this is where it gets different
from an archetype the plot archetypes are like i want to achieve this emotion in my uh readers
and here are some steps to get that emotional structure is all right here's how i actually
structure my story and if these are too rigid you will end up putting things into your story
that just don't feel like they fit they generally will not ruin your story but once in a while
people can be too slavish i feel to following one of these plot structures so how would you
use the hero's journey well looking at this and asking yourself as a chef why do we enjoy this
story well there can be lots of answers and we're we're down to 10 minutes so i'm not going to go
to questions on this one but we can talk about the idea that all human beings kind of have to go
through this right it's the story of being a teenager in a lot of ways um and and arriving at
adulthood um hopefully without the literal death um you know in rebirth but it is this thing where we
are going to go through all of our lives we have to i have i have a 12 year old i'm like
you're going to go to college not too much further by adult times you know six years or so and he's
like i can't do that i cannot move out i'm like you don't have to you're 12 12 years don't move out
but to him this is the most terrifying thing that he ever learned is that he is going to be someday
expected to leave the house and live on his own um that is really scary to a lot of people we go
through this right uh why else is it is it cool well it's really satisfying like this moment it's
full of satisfying moments right so this moment is satisfying because you can usually see the hero
wants to go on the adventure but and then they're forced to that moment is kind of cool um the moment
where they go into the underworld where they're at their darkest point and they pull out of it in
any way is really satisfying the apotheosis and atonement we're kind of coming to face one's um
one's destiny one's parental figures to make amends for the things that they've done and then returning
home a better person having brought something that helps you know everyone else whether it's
having destroyed a death star or not coming home having victorious is really satisfying um so this
explains just a lot of really satisfying small steps you can take and that makes progress really
exciting when the small steps of progress on their own give people cold chills then you're doing the
right thing then your book is coming together and the hero's journey is just all about those
moments those triumphant moments or those moments that are really relatable and it's why it makes
such a good plot structure um another one that you guys may have run across is three act format
which is kind of just a remix on the same ideas as most plot archetypes are uh three act format
imagines a a story um as three acts with two major division points the first one being generally
where the character becomes proactive um now you can find a lot on three act format i'll just say
if i'm not writing the one you know that's okay um there are lots of different ways but one is the
change from proactive from inactive to proactive this is the moment where you go from act one to
act two where the character says you know i will go do this and everybody argues on where the different
act breaks are which is how you can tell this is a little more squishy than people pretend like
everyone again usually uses star wars is a perfect example of this but they will disagree on whether
act one ends when luke decides to go with obi one because he has no other choice or when they get off
of catewen or when they get uh on the death star decide to go save the princess all our legitimate
arguments for what the end of act one um you usually have a transition between act two and act
three where you're at the low point right where all the things you have tried thus far have just
dug in dug you deeper and the way you do the the middle is you have generally there's a midpoint
twist where some the stakes change in some dramatic way usually an expansion of the stakes or the
villain has achieved something and generally through here you have this kind of rising action
where you increase stakes increase tension and the character tries things and oftentimes fails
spectacularly right this is what we call a try fail cycle is how dav like to put it the character
has come up with a way solution to their problem they try it they fail and it gets worse they try
it again they fail and it gets worse they try it again they fail and it gets worse and now we're
at our low point because we've tried everything um oh no what are we going to do uh Frodo has
decided to keep the ring right uh like uh spoilers right yeah 70 years old is it now
since spoiler 60 years old um but yeah you know we are at a moment of of utter crisis
and then the ending happens and very soon after whoo end and then danawa um so this can be really
handy again to structure your story if you know you need to have a moment where your character
takes initiative you need to have something right about the middle point of your story where the
stakes change in a dramatic and different way and that needs to lead into a low point where
everything has been tried but there is still one chance if luke trusts in the force he can fire
the torpedoes even though the last one's missed because he has the force um and you can bring in
you know when it works really well your overlapping um different plots for instance star wars has
hawn's mini plot of an arc of will hawn be a good guy or not is he is he going to learn to want
something more than money and lo and behold what happens is you overlap the lowest moment
luke deciding to finally trust the force obiwan speaking and hawn returning all at once and it
becomes this really beautiful moment where all of your different plots intersect uh that's what
i really love is when you can take multiple plots like a character arc where the character
makes that last big decision or understands at last the thing that they've been missing about their
life overlapping with a big surprise overlapping with the climax of the story uh that's where a
story can really get me if they can do that so brandon what about discovery plotting um i don't
have a ton to say on this because i don't do it i would recommend going to other people who do
discovery right reading what steven king talks about with discovery writing reading what georgia
martin says about gardening um i will tell you one thing you can try and we'll end here
mary robinette which if she goes to a q and a when she's here you can ask her about it
taught me a discovery writing method that works pretty well and it is called yes but no and
yes but no and focuses on taking a character throwing them into some sort of terrible situation
at the very start and then just asking yourself all right what's the most uh intelligent reason
or reasonable thing they could do right now to get out of this problem have them do that
and then ask yourself does it work and if you say yes you add a but something else has gone wrong
or you say no and you escalate that problem to a bigger problem so what this does is it creates
this sort of sense of motion where something is always going wrong for the character which can
be really handy to keep your stakes up and to discover written story afterward after you've
written the book you can go back and say okay can i move all of these things into being pieces of a
larger plot can i somehow tweak this so this one is foreshadowing for this one but as you're writing
you can just remember everything needs to be getting worse a lot of the time and yes but no and
is a method of doing that you can find a lot of them online i would recommend you know listening
to what other writers say you've heard a lot today about my method go research other methods
try out a lot of different things see what works for you and i'll do q and a next week on anything
about plotting you guys want to know and that's it
