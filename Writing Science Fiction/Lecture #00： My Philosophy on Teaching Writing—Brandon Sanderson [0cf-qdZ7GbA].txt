Let's talk about my philosophy on teaching writing. All right? So, here's the thing.
I can't teach you how to be a writer. I just can't. Writing is a skill that you have to
practice on your own. And I can generally give you some nudges, some tips, some hints,
and some tools. And that is my focus in this class. It's a focus on giving you as many
tools as you can possibly hold as many as I can give you, so that when you are doing your own
writing, you have them in hand and can try different things out. The longer I've been a
professional novelist, the more I've realized that these sorts of tools are really handy
for troubleshooting, even for me and my career right now. If I have a problem in a book,
I go back to these sorts of fundamentals that I talk about in the class. And I try to say,
okay, people are having this reaction to my book. My editor and my alpha readers are
feeling lost at this point. What's the problem? Can I diagnose it using these kind of basic
structural tools that we'll talk about in the plotting lectures? These are not things that I
do often anymore when I'm sitting down and actually writing. They're kind of in the back of my head,
but I use them a lot in outlining and I use them a lot in diagnosing. Early in my career,
these sorts of tools were really handy to just try a tool out to see how it worked for me.
I'll explain what I mean by tools a little bit later in this lecture, but for right now,
the main thing I want you to take away is you will probably get almost nothing from this class
unless you are currently working on your writing.
