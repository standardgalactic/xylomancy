I want to start with a quote to get things moving from from Mr. Voltaire, and I'm curious
your perception of it. I feel like you'll probably have some thoughts.
A quote that I find interesting is, if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent
him. So I think it's interesting that Voltaire chooses him. I think that's worth discussing
as well, and also the necessity to invent said God. If it, she, him did not exist in
some absolute manner. What do you think about all that?
I mean, I understand the impetus behind the quote in the sense that one of the things
I think we're seeing more easily right now is we had a moment where we, some people,
at least some people thought that we could just be rational and scientific and we could
just get rid of all these superstitions, then we would, we'd be good, we'd be fine, you
know. And what we're noticing is that that's not what's happening. People are becoming
nihilistic, you know, they're moving into despair. We're noticing we don't have much
to hold us together in terms of societies. We don't have things that bind us anymore
as we get rid of, as we get rid of religion, as we get rid of God. And so I think that
that's probably what Voltaire was perceiving was the notion that we need something above
us, something transcendent to unify us or else we tend to fragment and to scatter. So
I think that the intuition behind, behind Voltaire is right. And you see a lot of people
that say today, taking that very cynically in the sense that they realize we need something
to bind us together. So it could be anything we could just put something up there. And we
just need, we need it or else we need to celebrate something together or else why are we something,
why are we a country? Why are we a nation? Why are we a family? Why are we a group rather
than just a bunch of individuals slamming against each other?
I reflect on that quite regularly. Internally at a deeper level, I have a sensation of like,
I can have a sensation of like, aimlessness. And a part of that I have these various, like
what I would concede to be like illusions of perceived progress. And that's something
that I ask a lot. I feel like most people can kind of collectively agree of like, yeah,
like progress, like, let's, let's do progress. And then that presents the question of like,
okay, perfect. I love, love that love the morale, but like progress towards what? Like,
what is our ultimate end goal here? What are we progressing toward?
No, I totally agree that that's definitely a problem, especially in terms of modern kind
of atheist, progressive narrative, which is that, what are we aiming at? Because in order
to progress, you need an aim, you need to be moving in a direction or else you're just aimlessly
wandering. And so the question is, what is it that's happening? It's easier. I think one of
the mistakes that we've seen in the end with the enlightenment and it's, and what came after is we
had this idea that if we progress in terms of technical knowledge, that is, if we accumulate
technical knowledge, then that's similar to the manner in which we're going to progress morally as
a nation as nations as people. But those are not, they're not the same, the accumulation of
technical knowledge. It's not the same as morality or, or understanding what it is that makes a life
worth living. These are not the same thing. And I don't think that we have progressed in that at
all. I think on the contrary, I think that we have traded one for the other. We've traded a kind of
comfort, a technical comfort and material comfort. We've traded that for purpose. And we've traded
that for virtue and for a sense that we are moving towards something valuable. And because of it,
people are, people are lost. Well, not everybody, but there's definitely a sense around us. When I
look at young people, especially, you know, the despair is palpable.
Yeah.
Yeah. So you, so you asked before, we press record, like, why, like, why the heck do you have me here?
I'm like a theologian icon, iconographer, philosopher, like, what does this have to do with
like, this is supposed to be like a health thing or something. One, there's like, I had John
Revekey on recently, and I know that you guys are close. And one of the things that came up with
that was like the, the meaning crisis, like we're going through like a, like a meaning crisis of,
is there some kind of ground to stand on? Are we just on this kind of slippery, illusory, hollow,
sensation of progress towards some technological financial gain, like towards what? And I think
it's interesting that within like disease or disease, you know, probably 100% of diseases,
or there's some root of, of stress involved in that somewhere in the system. And we can address
that topically or allopathically and say, aha, here, here is the tumor, but then you can wind it
back. And, you know, at some point, there's, there's something to cause friction in the system to
eventually manifest as some type of, you know, physical expression of disease. And so when the
majority of people that are visiting a hospital are there for something that's stress related or
something that's like psychosomatic, mental, emotional, you know, lifestyle related, or
something that would just pass on its own, but we're seeking out for this pill or solution.
At the root there, I feel like we can start to address some of our medical experiences through
like these, this internal lens, you know, and through starting to establish, you know, maybe
starting to address that like, that, that meeting crisis that, that I personally experience, you
know, I feel like many other people can probably resonate with that. So what do you, what do you
think about that? Like that, that, that internal experience, eventually expressing out into,
you know, a physical manifestation and some path maybe towards like finding relationship or balance
or homeostasis between the two, the internal and the external, I guess, is maybe like why I was,
I wanted to have this conversation with you. Yeah, I think you're right. I think that you
definitely, the idea that there is a relationship between, let's say our own inner direction and
exterior manifestations in the body is definitely something which happens. I think the mistake
that we make, especially us today, is that we, we look for, we think that we're going to find that
in some kind of like comfort, like we think we're going to find that in some kind of,
you know, if I could just be relaxed enough, if I could just rest enough, if I could just,
you know, let's say serve myself enough, like if I could take care of my needs, you know, I need to,
I need some me time, like that's the, that's the, the modern way of looking at it. That actually
accentuates the problem. And I think that the, the more ancient solution would have been something
like give yourself. If you give yourself, then a lot of those other things, they tend to diminish.
Not that you won't be sick. Maybe you will, but it won't matter so much because you'll be living,
you'll be living a purposeful life and you'll be living towards, towards, because what do you,
what do you want? You just want to live until you're 99 years old and be miserable, you know,
and internally and be physically, you could be physically fit and kind of looking to be relaxed
and to live as long as possible. Or it seems like the, the more ancient vision is something like
give yourself. If you give yourself, then you actually might have a very short life. You might
have a very short and painful life, but that short and painful life will be bright. It'll be
shining. And look at the people that we admire. Like we, we don't admire, we admire people that
have done that, right? Those are the people that shine to us like, like stars, people who, who
give themselves for a cause, who give themselves to others, you know, they become something else.
And so the image that we have, for example, in Christianity is actually the opposite of,
it's, it really is the image of someone who's willing to die for his friends, who's willing
to die for others. That is actually what brings the real balance. But I, but I do feel like right
now we have a kind of weird twisted version of that, which is trying to heal my own, all my own
issues, like heal my stuff. And then, then I'll find homeostasis. But yeah, there's a book I've
mentioned here a bunch of times called Whatever You Think Think the Opposite by Paul Arden.
I think that's, comes up in what you're saying now. I think it's like, you would, I would think
that by focusing on the individual, the individual will start to get, you know, become more and more
robust and, and you know, like well-developed and complex and content, you know, and all of those
things. But in fact, it takes like relinquishing the attachment to the self in order to come back
around and heal the self and like grow the self. So it's like in the forgetting of the self, the
self is actually has the spaciousness to, to grow and heal and do all the things. But whereas,
when there's excessive focus on the self and losing that connection outward, then it's like,
I feel like the self suffocates on itself. Yeah, but there is like, there is a possibility of
practicing, of practicing, doing certain practices, you know, on yourself, with yourself, like meditation
prayer, some kind of a schesis, you know, when you, and I think people who also do physical
activity have a different version of that, which is that you feel your limit, you know, you feel
your limit constantly and you're trying to push further than your limit. Those are, those are
practices that can actually help you understand how it works. Like it's not about, it's not,
it's not comfort doesn't give meaning at all. Like, you know, feeling good about yourself is not,
is not the way to go. People are going to hate hearing that. But actually trying to,
anything that makes you transcend yourself is going to start with pain. It's going to start with
a sense of disease, exactly a disease in general. Like I am, I'm not where I should be. I need,
I need, I need to, to, to kind of move in the right direction. Of course, we can beat ourselves up
too. And that's not helpful. Usually beating ourselves up for not being where we want to be
is another kind of weird self centered thing. Like it's a weird kind of, kind of moving it back,
moving into your experience and just feeling sorry for yourself or feeling guilty all the time.
That's probably not, that's not the right way to go about it either. But you do need to feel
some pain in order to move towards meaning. Yeah, they're so back to Viveki, something that I learned
from him as the, the origin of the word religion is religio or something of the sort. And it,
it means to bind or to bring together. It's like to unite, which is also the origin of the word
yoga, yoke union connection. It's like, it like spans across so many different ideologies,
this idea of like connection. And so I feel like the word religion, the word God, the word spirit,
spirituality, all of those have so many meanings and kind of like these crusty old barnacles
attached to them. Yeah. And so that like at the, at the, at the root of most of those words is like,
Oh, it's pretty good. It's valuable. But then the outside, there's just a lot of, of, of flaky.
Yeah, a lot of, a lot of flakes. And now it's now there's a confusion for the flake for the actual
like the root. No, you're right. And it's, and it's actually the fault. A lot of it is the fault
of the religious people where they started, I think there was a lot of forgetting, like just a
forgetting of what all this stuff is about. And it becoming more and more arbitrary in the modern
world. As people became materialists, it's as if a lot of this stuff became arbitrary. So it was
like, you're a Christian. So you believe that some guy died on a cross and now you're going to go to
heaven. If you believe that, that's, that's what, that's what a Christian is really. Like, that's
it. That's pathetic. That's really lame. If that's what it is. But it's really, it's really cute.
It's like childish. Right. It's like, like really beautiful, actually. It's like, wow, like you are
a 50 year old woman or man. And this is like a Disney, which, you know, I think there's a lot
of meaning in, in fictional novels and tales and all that stuff. And they're, they're relating back
to that core root truth, typically. But it's, I mean, I think it's, I think I, not, not having like
a pessimistic view of like, oh my God, I can't believe it. It's also kind of like, wow. That's
amazing. Like I find that beautiful. Well, I mean, I think that for, for a lot of people having that,
maybe that simple faith could probably be totally fine. But it also, there also needs to be,
there needs to be an intellectual version of that. And it, it has always existed. It was always
there. If you read the early church fathers, you read the mystics, like it's all there. It's just
that a lot of it has been forgotten. And it's interesting because right now there's an interesting
moment, like people like John Revecki are part of that, where because of the space, because of the
space where cognitive science is now introducing itself into the discourse, and we realize that
we can't escape perception, like we can't escape this experience of the world, and that we can't
pretend like it's not there and just talk about science as if it's outside of that.
So coming back to this experience and this experience of quality or this experience of,
you know, of patterns and of embodiment, then we can start to realize what religion is. Again,
we can start to understand it, that we can, we can see that the world presents itself as so
multifaceted, that unless we have things which bind phenomena together, then everything scatters,
especially at the human level. If we don't have ritualization, we don't have story, we don't have
orders, which bind even yourself, like your own personal self and your family, and then you scale
that up, you know, cosmically, then the world doesn't exist. And then you realize, oh, well,
that's what religion is. It's the, it's the man in which things bind together that ends up looking
like ritual, it ends up looking like story, it ends up looking like all the things what people
think are silly and superstitious, but actually without them, reality scatters, and you can,
you can apply to your life, you realize actually that most of the things you do are ritualized,
and there's nothing superstitious about them. Like brushing your teeth is a ritualized act
towards a purpose, but you have ritualized acts towards purposes that are higher than just
getting your teeth clean, that are about how can we bind together as a group? How can we recognize
what it is that we have in common? And then it looks like processions, it looks like circumambulation,
it looks like singing together, it looks like all these things which, which the modern person
found silly, they kind of flow back in. I feel like there can be, like, I mean, like you're saying,
like you can't escape religion, you can't escape dogma, well, you didn't say you can't,
you can't even say exactly, but I imagine you're probably aligned with that to some degree,
or maybe not. But so today, you can see Christianity seems, at least in my bubble
of a world that I exist in, seems to be waning popularity of it. There's a lot more like spirituality
in quotations. There's like, we're certainly worshiping, you know, we worship our cell phones,
we worship our notifications, we worship our financial status, we worship our socioeconomic
status where we're at on the ladder, you know, so we're like, we're worshiping a lot, a lot,
maybe more than ever, really. As far as like compulsive worship, we might be at the highest,
you know, not that it's a competition, but we may be at like the highest state of worship ever,
at least from a lens of like compulsive worship. Yeah, but there's also, there's also prescribed,
there's also like prescribed worship, which is actually pretty strong right now. People
don't really realize it, but you know, it's just because people have separated the notion of religion
from other ritualized aspects of their life. But if, for example, you realize, you could say that
recycling is a form of worship, you know, because you are ritually acting in a way which is prescribed
to you from above in order to participate in a story and a purpose together. And so we all, you
know, on one, this day a week, we all put out our separated materials or whatever. And so
there is a ritualized procession about that, which is similar to a religious procession,
it's just that it's ordered towards something else. And you can say what's different because
that's really valuable, like saving the environment is really valuable. And I would say, yeah,
you're right, saving the environment is really valuable. But us binding together, let's say,
under the transcendent source of love is probably pretty valuable too, right? It probably has a
value that is powerful as well. So I think we can re-understand a lot of the practices of our
ancestors, even if we're able to notice, like you said, that we worship. And the problem is exactly
what you said is that addiction is a form of worship, especially addiction. It's one of the
most easy, if you want to understand worship, like addiction is one of the best ways because
it's a ritualized cycle of attention, you know, and you get possessed by it. And it actually ends up,
let's say reorganizing your life around its attention, right, around its existence. And so
it actually uses you as a body in order to make sure that you are sacrificing and propitiating to
this God. But you can see how it's like a demon, right? It's like a parasitic God, you could say.
It's a God that actually ultimately wants to destroy you. But it can help you understand
what worship is, which is that when we would do that, like if a person would go through the beads
of their prayer rope or whatever, that's similar in terms of this binded attention,
which is ritualized in order to get you somewhere. Yeah, there's a quote from Alan Watts. I mean,
I think it's from Alan Watts. I've heard it from Alan Watts. They said that we're confusing the
menus for the meal. And so we're eating, you know, the words duck confit, you know, like chewing on
the paper duck confit. But there's no like fat, you know, at omega threes and like there's just
not there's no calories there. Yeah. And so that's the reason that that that quote's coming to mind
is like, I wonder if there is some hierarchy of worship. I think often as we can romanticize
the ancients, you know, and romanticize hunter gatherers and like everything we're doing now is
wrong. Yeah, everything that happened yesterday was the way. It's like, what is like, is there like
some ultimate absolute better, you know, or is there like, how do we parse apart like where is
the menu? Where is the meal? Does it matter in the first place? Are we all just going to end up in
the same place anyway? Yeah, well, I think there is. I think there's an objective, I think there's
an objective hierarchy of worship for sure. And you can actually see it kind of playing itself out
in the story of religion or the man in which religion developed through the centuries. And it
does have to do with understanding where the good lies, you could say, what is it, the good that
binds us? What is it? You know, and I would say that it moves towards something like love towards
something like compassion, self giving or self sacrifice. And I think that you can find that,
you know, of course in Christianity, but I think you see some of that in Buddhism, although it's
not personalized so much in Buddhism. But you do find this idea that the highest, let's say the
highest value, the thing that should bind us together is actually paradoxically a giving
away, like it's a self emptying. And this self emptying becomes the thing which makes it possible
for us to exist as more than just these selfish little beings. And so I think that that is a
true hierarchy of being. And so you can imagine local gods, for example, in the time of hunter
gatherers that had some function and some power over the group and would bind them together,
would give them a totem, would give them some type of identity and characteristics that they could,
that they could celebrate and participate in. But ultimately, that leads to constant war,
like it just leads to nonstop war. Because these gods are fighting in the heavens, right?
These different totems and gods are fighting amongst each other. As the tribes fight and are
constantly at war, we always forget that the Greeks, even though they saw themselves as being
one people, they were always fighting nonstop. Every year, people would go to war.
So the idea of binding towards higher goods, I think is something which happened for a reason.
As far as like making this conversation actionable towards some, you know, directionality in one's
life, something that I think I could use more of, and me being like a product of the culture that
I've been grown in. I've heard you mention before, and then it caused me to look it up,
the Plato's transcendental, so the three transcendental, so it's beauty, goodness,
and truth, is what I've read on the internet. And that, I think, is something that is kind of,
can easily be forgotten in the modern era, to pick on the modern era. And that's like,
I just got back from Greece, thankfully, it was really like an exceptional experience.
And we went to various different islands there and learned about the god Escapius,
the god of medicine, and the way that they approached medicine. And the way that they
approached medicine, one theaters were built beside or very close to hospitals, which I
thought was very interesting. So that concept of theater was like an entrenched within medicine.
And when you enter into the hospital, it was really beautiful. And there was art,
and you'd get into a body of water, and cold plunge, and hot tub. And the way that the tour
guides described to me was through art, that the emotive power of art, and also senses,
like Tantra, in a way, you could say maybe, that kind of softens up and opens up some space within
like the tour guide said, like the soul. So whatever word you want to put that deeper part.
And I feel like in the modern era, there's a bit of a jump to just what is the physical
expression. Now, let's attack that physical expression, as opposed to allowing spaciousness
and using some of these softer tactics to kind of go through and open up some space to be able to
get into like what lies beneath that outer physical expression. So that's something,
I think that was very wordy. But essentially, the question of curiosity is, from your perception,
what do you see that the value in Plato's three transcendentals, beauty, goodness, and truth,
in supporting us as modern people, at least from like a medical perspective?
I think you're definitely on to something. And you understand, it's a good way to understand
the moment in which we are now, that is, right now, we have exactly this idea that if we're
treating the body, like if someone's sick, we're just going to treat the body. So we bring someone
to a horrendous place, like a horrendous place of fluorescent lights, and green plastic things,
and metal bars, metal beds that look like prison bars. And that's where we bring people to heal,
because we think that it's like, well, it's just a car, right? We're just fixing a car.
So we're going to bring someone, we're going to put them in rooms with several people, and we're
going to embarrass them, have them wear these horrible nightgowns or whatever. Like everything
about it is this reduction of the human person to a machine. And that's exactly the problem,
that's exactly the problem that we mentioned a little earlier, which is that with the return
of something like cognitive science, we're realizing that no, you can't pretend like
there is no experience of the world, and that that experience of the world doesn't participate
in the medical, in your healing. Like, for example, the placebo effect is a great example,
right? So we believe, every medical doctor believes that there's a placebo effect to medicine,
but they try to reduce that effect as much as possible, because they want to reduce you to
a machine. And if you could prove that augmenting the placebo effect could actually help you heal
faster, they don't care, because they don't like that idea. They don't like the idea that
mind, that experience participates in your experience. So when they look at ancient medicine,
and they see the ritualization, they see the drama, like you said, in relationship to the
medical practice, they think it's all hocus pocus nonsense. But they still believe that there's
that there's a placebo effect. It's hilarious. It's like, why wouldn't you, why couldn't you
use the best of medicine, and then create a ritualized drama of practice in which you would
enter into the medical relationship as, you know, as it, like you said, like as a being and counting
beauty. It's not possible. Like our world is too gone, at least for now, it's too gone for that.
So we're stuck with these horrible cement parking garages that are called hospitals.
Yeah, I wonder anytime someone uses the term they, I always, my mind always jumps to like,
who is they? And then also want is another curiosity. Like, I don't know that I'd love
it for you to define they, in relation to that statement, and then also drawing back on want.
So they want to reduce us to a machine. It feels to me kind of just like it is reducing
itself to a machine. So what is the it now in this way? It would be the zeitgeist,
like the totality of culture moving together. And then we have these individual nodes that
pop up and they're wearing, you know, a lab coat and their names, Dr. Sanders or whatever.
All right, so let's let's let's frame it this way. So the movement, the same movement which
moved against religio and described religio as being hocus pocus magic and, and superstition
and ridiculous things people did, or things people did that were imposed by power and
patriarchy or whatever, however you want to describe it, this the same, let's say narrative,
you could call it like the worst of the Enlightenment narrative, the worst of the,
of the materialist scientific narrative, that narrative leads at the same time to parking
garage hospitals, you know, because, because there's a coherence in the reduction of everything to
its material causes that brings about, you know, the medical establishment that we're that we're
dealing with. And so it's, of course, it's a side effect. Like I don't think that
Locke and Hobbes thought that we would get to where we are. I don't think that they would,
that they, that they could have predicted that their ideas about, about rationality and Occam's
razor and, you know, there's these scientific revolutions that we went through would lead
us to a kind of dehumanized machine body. But that is what happened in the, in those causes.
But like I said, I do think so it's, you're right, when I say they, I don't mean, I can't,
I can't, it's not the doctors, it's not their fault. It's not, it's not the, it's not even
the medical establishment's fault at this point. But it is a movement, like it is a,
it is a, a line that you can draw from certain changes which happened in history,
which brought us to this point. But at the same time, I do think that seeing that now,
there are possibilities of, of alternatives. It's harder in the medical world, but there
are other places where you can, where you can, where someone can do that. For example,
the same thing with schools, like schools are basically, you know, they're factories for children,
like they're, they're just factories pumping out children into the world. Now that, there's a place
where you can, where someone can find better alternatives, you know, homeschool, private
schools, whatever, schools that are more integrative and integrate storytelling and culture and ritual
and practice into, into a child's life rather than just have them go through the system.
But medical stuff is, is harder because it's so, so big and there's such a,
yeah. And there's also cranks, like that are real cranks that exist in that, in that world of healing
too. It feels to me when I say like the they and like, you know, the it and all that as opposed to,
to personalizing an individual, having any type of intention, which that's a question
I have as, as well as like how much sovereignty do we have in our choices?
And how much are we just a part of this collective consciousness? And we're just,
you know, a barrel of water just sloshing about, you know, within that, if we are just this
sloshing, sloshing barrel of water really works as an analogy, but I'll try to force it.
No, but I said, I said what you mean, like we're just in the current, like we're just
going downstream and there's not much we can do. We can notice that this isn't pleasant, but it's
not easy to understand how to go, how to go upstream. Like it's just not that simple.
Yeah. And so it feels to me like perhaps since the, at one point there was more,
you know, nature worship and animism and, and, you know, probably more like matriarchal societies
were more common and things of the sort. And then there was a shift. So the metaphoric
water sloshing about going to one side. And then I feel like, you know, I'll say like maybe
Cartesian times or Newtonian times and kind of entering into like, aha, no, like scientism.
This is the solution, you know, and pragmatism and everything needs to be
rationalized and I need to be able to hold it and measure it. And that is truth.
I don't know that culture as a whole is like, aha, like, yes, I think it's, it feels to me kind
of like it's just like a pendulum swinging. And right now we're kind of, I don't know where we're
at. If it is a pendulum swinging, I don't know where on the swing we are, but we're certainly in some
pragmatic reductionist rational swing phase. And it feels like there's a yearning to kind of
find some center or maybe wildly swing back to the other side.
Yeah. Well, there's, I think you could see the extremes at the same time. So I think
that's probably the best way to understand, especially the modern, like the modern world,
is to understand it as extremes, manifesting themselves. There is a bit of a pendulum,
but you can also see it happening at the same time. So if you look at the, in the rationalism,
right after the rational, like the hyper-rationalist phase was romanticism and symbolism and the
kind of degenerate symbolic thinking that we saw, you know, in the 18th, 19th century,
which was about fantastical imagination, all that stuff, you know, and the occultism that came
with that type of thinking as well. So if you look at the modern world is both the rationalism,
hyper-rationalism and all that stuff, but it's also like weird occultism and, you know,
Crowley and the return of witchcraft and Lovatsky and Theosophy and all that kind of,
that other side of modernity, which happens at the same time. So right now we can see that
the internet is a great example. The internet is a mix of hyper-rationality and control and,
you know, like furry avatars in the metaverse, which is like complete explosion of rationality
into idiosyncrasy in ways that you could never ever imagine in the past. Like you can be anything
that you can possibly imagine in the metaverse, but that's also, that's happening at the same time
as this is hyper-rational kind of strange control. And so, so I think that's probably the best way
because it's hard to, it would be hard to understand our moment if we didn't see those two things
happening at the same time. And I'd like to at some point probably try to draw back to some kind
of like ashmole, what can we do type, type scenario, but something that I was listening to your
podcast with Makayla Peterson in preparation to this one. And one of the things that I heard her
saying throughout that seemed like she was kind of like at least acknowledging with herself
historically speaking, and seems like a little bit present as well, leaning towards like rationality
and logic and pragmatism as like a safe haven. And I think that that's very common. Like I can,
I can notice that with myself. And I think many, many people we can oftentimes not projecting
any of this one, hers is something I noticed now, like just back to speaking about me. I think I
can lean on pragmatism as a way, because I feel like there's almost like a fear of chaos.
And, and that that deeper underpart, you know, like there's a quote that I
from Marianne Williamson, who I've also had on here. So our deepest fear is not
that we are inadequate, our deepest fears that we are powerful beyond measure.
And I feel like that, that undercurrent that underpart that sometimes I think in this, in
this modern era, that's kind of it can be like masked by rationale and science and logic and
imperial research. And it's not a thing until it's been studied and all the peers have reviewed it.
And then we can start to like, actually have a conversation. But there's also this welling,
this well beneath that it's like, oh, like, perhaps access to, you know, all the power and
answers to, you know, every, everything you could possibly imagine. But I feel like there's a little
bit almost like of a, for me, I can notice like, like almost like a fear or resistance around that
part. And so I'll just lean on science and lean on rationality and lean on, you know, because I
don't want to kind of touch the chaos of what's inside. Yeah, but I also think that it's important,
this is something that is difficult, because unions are popular right now, I guess, in part because
of Jordan Peterson. But there's a tendency to confuse two things, like there's, there's a
trans rational space. And there's a pre rational space or, you know, there's something like this
subconscious, you could say, there's something like super consciousness and those,
they can look the same to people that are just trapped in consciousness. But if you read any
traditional texts from any religion, they clearly demarcate those as not being the same. And so the
kind of chaos, the dream kind of chaos that that kind of emotional, romantic feeling that you get
is not the same as the sense that things culminate into a unity, which is beyond the
particulars, right, that there's this drive up towards something which is pulling me beyond
the world. Now, I understand why it can seem like sometimes it's the same in your experience, but
there's a, you could understand the rationality or the rational world is, is this like buffered
space that exists between those two poles, something which is pulling you up towards,
you could say the way to understand it would be that
as an individual, for example, right, if you give yourself to a higher cause,
right, that higher cause is not in the individual. It's not, it's not there. So if you take the,
the world of the individual and you analyze it, every single aspect of it, you're never going to
get the highest cause to which you're willing to sacrifice yourself for. Does that make sense? And
so now think of that for everything. Like there's a world of structured causality, but that world
of structured causality gives itself up towards higher participations, you could say. And then
there's also a way in which it dissolves into nothingness. So you as an individual, let's say,
the manner in which you could dissolve into all kinds of idiosyncratic, bad habits or passions,
or the way you could become obsessed with things and kind of devolve into something which is not
rational at all, right? It's like, there's nothing, if you, once, once, if you analyze you becoming
addicted to things, you realize this is not rational, like this is, this is, this is breaking me
apart. It's fragmenting me completely. But that is different from this giving up, you could say,
the way in which you participate. I don't know if that makes sense. It's important, I think,
because people are right now are so confused. They think that spirituality is sometimes they
think that spirituality is this lower stuff down here. Like it's about feeling and about, you know,
how I, you know, how I, how I feel about myself or how I feel about others or these like these
kind of vague intuitions that you get about, about, about things. But the world, the higher world or
the world of spiritual participation is in some ways, it's trans-rational. But once you grasp it,
it's super clear. Like it's, right, it's like the clearest thing you'll ever see. It appears as a,
as a beacon of light that's kind of guiding you beyond your limited world.
Yeah. The only issue I have with the idea of like higher and lower and placing a hierarchy on
states of consciousness and like aspects of, I don't know, existence life is, I think there can
be a fragmentation or divorcing or a separation within self through that separation and the idea
that something is higher than something else. I understand why you say that, but it's also because
this is the issue, the problem of equalizing everything is that hierarchies don't compete with
their levels. That is that if you are a healthy individual and all your thoughts and your passions
are joined together, then you will actually become the best part of a higher participation.
So you will actually be a better member of your family if you are united in that, in the individual
part. And so it doesn't compete. That's what cults do. Cults, if you want to know the difference
between a real religion and a cult, a cult will try to compete with lower levels of participation.
Like a cult will say, you have to deny your family. You have to deny all these lower
participation. And so it's the same with like, it's the same with any hierarchy of anything,
right? So if you, if you understand, for example, that love is the highest virtue,
right? And so you can also understand that being good at something at a lower scale,
it doesn't compete with that. So you could be good at your job, but that if you're good at
your job, I don't know, like if you're good at making shoes, it's like that good can embed
itself in love because you can do it in a way that serves your community or you could do it in
a way that selfish and is just to fill your pockets. But there's a manner in which those
goods that scale up, they actually don't compete with each other. They fit into each other like
of this beautiful fractal dance, right? Everything kind of embeds itself into, into the rest.
There's probably some way to literally define the experience of love being like a higher
vibratory state. And then within that, it's like, maybe, maybe you could relate it to like
spectrums of light. And there's been kind of a war against blue light recently. I don't know if
you, if you pay attention to things of this sort, like we're, yeah, exactly, exactly. Like where
your blue blockers, you know, like the blue light, it's bad, you know, and it's like, no, no, no,
it's not bad. It's just one frequency that serves a purpose. It's just serves a purpose at specific
time for specific functions, you know, and so low, low frequency light and the, you know,
infrareds and reds and oranges and all that stuff incredibly valuable, really high frequency
light, you know, the blues and all that, like that's like really valuable. And when, if we're
playing the game where like, oh, I'm, I'm tribe blue light and like, no, no, no, I'm tribe orange
light or red light, you know, this is better. It's more healthy. It's like, well, the, the,
going back to like the original derivative of health, health comes back to wholeness.
And so again, like all of this comes back to like, okay, how do we get if, if what one's intention
is a sensation, probably of, I don't know, like cellular function, you know, and, and
satisfaction, probably the conjoining of all of the tribes and being able to actually be able to
see that there really is value in, in all of it and not kind of casting any of it out, but actually
coming through, I'm kind of going out into the weeds here, but I think, I think there's the
availability to perceive everything through that lens of, of love and acceptance, but not necessarily
swallow the pill entirely and say, okay, I'm going to see this
state or frequency or whatever through love and acceptance. So I'm just going to become that. And
that is all of me. Like I'm able to actually absorb and be with all things, but not get trapped
in the, the kind of the tribalistic thing that tends to happen where we start to create more
segregation, more isolation. And then oftentimes it's in the guise of some higher power.
The idea, so in Dante, for example, you see the way that he presents things is perfect. He says that
all, let's say all sin is something like misplaced love or too much love or too little love or not,
or love that is kind of twisted. And so the idea is that all things are good if they're
properly aligned, like nothing is bad in itself. That's ridiculous. Like it's not a,
that's definitely not a Christian way of seeing the world. All things are good.
And that they just have to be in their proper place. So the analogy of light is a good example.
Like, well, obviously, blue light isn't bad. It's, it's just that it has to,
it has to be in the proper proportion for what a human being is. And you could, you could say
that about things that are maybe, maybe more human, for example. So you could imagine something like
entertainment is, is entertainment good or is entertainment bad? And you could say, well,
entertainment is good if it's in the proper proportion to other things in your life that are,
that are aimed towards, towards bringing all things together in the good. But if you live a
life of just entertainment, right, it's like saying is eating dessert bad? It's not bad if,
if it's properly ordered, but if you just eat dessert nonstop, then you're going to get sick,
like it's actually going to affect you. And if you just spend your whole day watching movies and
playing video games, then it's actually going to, it's actually going to affect you. But the other
one is true as well, right? If you spend your whole day working, if you spend your whole day
doing whatever it is that you do without giving room for the things that are, that are also good,
then you will, then you, you'll have the same problem from the other side. Well, you're,
you're going to become like someone who's super strict with themselves that doesn't leave any
room for some play, let's say in terms of personal discipline, is going to crack. Like they're just,
at some point they crack and they, they, they kind of collapse. Yeah, there's another, I'll be less
quotacious after this, I think, but there's another quote from Victor Frankel. He said,
something like paraphrase, some long lines of, of those who lack purpose will seek
pleasure instead as like a replacement. And I think that kind of turns into like this,
this like hungry ghost type sensation, this ongoing reaching out for those little hits.
Yeah. Now, because there's that, that lack of foundation of like,
actually feeling held and supported in a part of a fabric of something bigger than just this self.
Yeah. Well, you could say that that's the, so the drug epidemic in the, in the North America is,
seems to be really a product of the meaning crisis, like a product of people not having
direction and purpose. And so kind of spiraling into exactly what you said into, into this,
this more and more extreme desire to, to, to feel something, you know.
Yeah, we just want to feel. Yeah.
How do you, how are you with feeling? Do you feel like, where are you with all these
conversations? Like, do you, do you have like a, like any type of, of like unquenched yearning
sensations that, that I experienced, for example? Oh, of course. I think that's really part of
being human, you know? I mean, it's just, of course that happens. And, and I think that it's also,
if you're conscious about it and you're aware of it, then you can also realize what it is that,
what that's for. Now, I think especially sexual desire, the thing that, once we, you know,
one of the things that happened, right, in the sixties and then ongoing from there, but
there were ways of that before and kind of decadent end of century times is that we had this sense
that if we could just satisfy our sexual desires and proclivities, then, you know, everybody would
get along and we'd all be happy. But it turns out that if you focus on that, then it's in an
unlimited source of frustration because your desires just get more and more idiosyncratic
and bigger and bigger and more and more, you know, you need more in order to feel, it's almost
like it's the same as drugs. Like it's like you need more in order to feel taken further, you could
say. The hedonic, hedonic treadmill. Exactly. And so if, what, but if you realize that, then you're
like, okay, well, you know, how am I going to deal with this? Right? So this, so for example,
marriage is a good way to do it because it's hard to do it on your own. It's really hard
because it's like, but if you're married to someone that you love, that person will act as both a,
that's a place for your sexual desire, but also a limit to your sexual desire,
because it's one person and it's like, that person has a limit. Like they have a sexual,
especially, especially for men, like if you're married to a woman, like that woman has a certain
limit at some point, it's going to start manifesting itself. And so then you were like, okay,
so that feeling, then you feel it, right? Then you feel that, you feel that longing or you feel that
lack or that whole that it's causing in you. And then you can realize too, but you can realize
that actually the problem is that the sex doesn't fill that hole. It's fine. There's nothing wrong
with sex. Like it's sex is great, but it's never going to fill that hole completely because that
hole keeps getting bigger for some reason. It just keeps getting or more weird and more, you know,
idiosyncratic. And so that's, I think that's the real idea of sublimation, you could say,
where it's like, you realize, wait a minute, that suffering and that longing is energy.
It's actual, it's actual fuel. And if, and I can redirect that fuel towards other things,
and you don't even realize that you, that that exists until you feel it, right? If you're just
always kind of somewhat satisfied, you're not going to realize that this longing, this longing
that you have can be redirected and it can be redirected towards projects. It can be redirected
towards, you know, accomplishing some great task. It can be redirected towards prayer. It can be
redirected in all kinds of directions. And then you, then you can see almost what that longing is
for actually. So definitely, of course, I have, I have that. And I hope that I'm
doing as much as possible to make it, to make it fruitful, to make that longing fruitful.
How often do you misdirect that energy into like self-destruction and burning yourself up?
Yeah, probably all the time, in little ways. I mean, like little moments, it's not, it's not
like big things, but like little moments where you, you have a frustration or you have a sense that,
you know, you're not getting what you should in terms of care. I mean, it's not just sex, but it's
like, in terms of love, in terms of attention, in terms of this, like you can feel that every day,
if you're, if you're careful to how you, especially when you're in a family and you,
you have all these dynamics. So I would say it happens quite a bit. But, but it's, it's like
these little moments where you kind of have to, you have to wake up, you know, and then until
you wake up, then you end up in these spirals of frustration. But yeah, definitely. I mean, I'm,
I'm a human being, so it happens quite a bit. The sex one, I think, is especially interesting
because it seems clear that from an evolutionary perspective, it would make sense for humans
to yearn to have sex with more than one person. Like, you know, spread the seeds, spread the
species, spread the genetics. What else, you know, what else are we going to do? Yeah. You know,
and, and, you know, build shelter, you know, weather the storm, spread your genes, hunt,
do it over again. Yeah. And then there's like this, you know, this kind of new world that we
exist in and nuclear families and the social contracts and, you know, agreements that kind
of in a way sits on top, but also we're working on integrating the two to make it be whole, make
it like be health, make it be, you know, religious, you know, all of that. But it feels almost like
there's two intersecting tracks in that, like your, your, your primal carnal urges to spread the genes.
Yep. And then, you know, it's like from a, from an evolutionary perspective, males would be
sexually selected based off of those that like the Genghis Khan's of the world would be more
spread. But it's your, your insight is great. It's great, but it's important to understand it,
that, that it's important to understand it in terms of these higher goods that we talk about.
Right. And so sexuality is probably the easiest way or the best way to understand it,
which is that at some point we understand that we have to give up that, some of that,
for something which binds us at a higher level. And actually that would be necessary at any,
at any scale, like it would be necessary if you just had one male, like in the human species,
if you just had one male that was mating with all the women and there, and the other males had no
access to women, you would have carnage. He would just have fighting all the time. And, and,
and the truth is that like people idealize hunter gatherer societies, but you can imagine that people
were fighting all the time. And I've been in contact with, with groups that aren't necessarily
hunter gatherers, but have more of that kind of ancient pagan way of being. And that's what
happens. People fight over girls nonstop. They fight over women all the time. And people will kill
for women, you know. And so this is something which is, and so there's a sense in which
you can understand that giving up some of that desire towards higher participation
in a society, you can understand that that's fractal, that that's also what you do in you,
which is that you realize, oh, if I just focus on pleasure, then I'm not going to be able to
accomplish my goals. And so I have to sacrifice some of that. And I have to redirect it towards
something higher, which I perceive as higher, as a, as a higher good. It doesn't mean that
those desires are bad or that pleasure is bad. None of that is bad. But I do have to concentrate it
and re, reorient it. And then I realized, wait a minute, actually what I get from
above, when I, what I get from that is really valuable. And the kind of pleasure that I get,
let's say, the pleasure of accomplishing something or the pleasure of, of intellectual,
intellectual understanding, it's a, it's subtle. It's more subtle than an orgasm.
But it calls you like it, it calls you and it has a, it has a force that I think that,
especially as you get older, like if when you're like 17, it's hard to argue with that with someone
who's like just exploding with, with testosterone. But like, as you kind of get into your thirties and
you, you kind of get older, you start to see how actually giving up towards these higher
participations, they offer you a type of pleasure, which is very different, but is,
but is maybe even more valuable. Yeah.
My buddy I've had on here called Chris Williamson. I feel like you guys have maybe,
have you done the modern wisdom podcast Chris Williamson? I don't think so.
Anyways, he's a term that I got from him is, is post nut clarity.
But everything you're saying is true. Yeah. Post ejaculation.
But to be able to like sacrifice that like the before, I feel like this kind of comes into,
comes back to like, you know, probably a lot of religious philosophies or, or religions or
ideologies, but like, like the value of sacrifice, you know, and God sacrificing his only son,
you know, on the cross to save us all from his sins. And like, yeah, like the, the ethics within
that, like they, they, they're, they've been around for a while. And it seems like, so that's
kind of at a more macro, you know, like cook at God level. And then individually, I think we can
experience that as well. And then I think that's where there is value. But let me give you just
an example based on what you just said, which is that think about, like when I say giving yourself
to a higher good. So think about you're in a situation and you could sleep with your friend's
girlfriend, like she's up for it. But you know the consequence of that, right? You know what that's
going to cost you. And so you decide that actually the friendship I have, my friend,
is more valuable than the immediate pleasure. And so you sacrifice that moment, that possibility
in order to be bound to a relationship, right? So you can imagine that at multiple levels,
like that kind of decision, that's the kind of decision that I'm talking about, which is that
you're, you're, you're actually, you're sacrificing immediate, I mean, it's just like delayed satisfaction.
But I mean, you can think of it even at a higher level, which is not just that you delay it for
later, you're giving it up towards something higher, something more that is less, less bodily
pleasure, but it is a more kind of spiritual pleasure, you could say. Yeah. So we don't,
we're not going to have enough time to actually go into the like the Bible and religion, the way
that I would, I would like to, because I was raised very Christian doing Bible study, hanging out with
my bros, talking about Jesus, sharing, you know, scriptures and such, then got into like psychedelics
and, you know, kind of Buddhism and like other versions of isms and that kind of the concept of
like hell seems quite unreasonable. So I wonder your perspective on the, how literal could one take
the Bible from your perspective? Like, is it meant to be symbolism, metaphor, allegory? Is it meant
to be total 100% literal? How does one define how literal the Bible is? So or the Quran or
meaning like the literal thing, I hate that word. Like the, first of all, the word, the word literal
means according to the text, like that's what the word literal means. People think that the world,
the word literal means that what is described is a description of events in the way that I think
events should be described. And I sometimes I'm not even sure what that is. It's like the way that
you would describe events to a police officer, maybe like if it was a scene of a crime, some kind
of forensic like encyclopedic description of an event, like that's what it should be. And so we
think that when we say the Bible is literal, then that's what that's what we're describing. And I
think that that's just that's not just not what's going on there. The Bible is a discreet is definitely
a description of events, but it's not trying to describe those events in a way that would satisfy
a modern rationalist in any way. Like it is a description of events which
compresses elements together in order to make them meaningful over a very long span of time.
And so because of that, they, they, they have a certain form and a certain trope,
which is necessary. Because if you don't do that, if you don't compress elements of a story
into something like universal imagery, then it's going to, no one's going to understand it. So think
about, so think about like if someone watched someone from the 15th century, watched Pulp Fiction,
like they would have no idea what they're watching. Like what am I watching? What are these things
people have in their hands and what are these things that people are drawing, like putting up
their nose or like what are they, what is this? Like this doesn't mean anything because it's so
idiosyncratic. In the Bible, what you have is you have stories that have been compressed and
condensed and are telling the events in a way that that's just what it is. And so the idea that
the first chapter of Genesis is like some is, could be seen as a scientific description is
absolute nonsense. Like it's complete nonsense. And so I'm sorry to all the creationists who
think that that's what's going on there. It's just not, it's just not. And but the problem is that
it doesn't have to be. The idea that that's what's valuable, the idea that a scientific
description of an event is what is supremely valuable and everything should conform to that
standard is pure nonsense. And so the description of let's say the creation in the first chapter of
Genesis is in my, I think is the most powerful and accurate description of the manner in which the
world exists. But it is not doing it in a way that like I said, it's not a biologist description.
It's the description of a hierarchy of meaning, a hierarchy of participation. You know, I said
the centrality of consciousness, the centrality of recognizing the good in the world. These things
have nothing to do with what they have very little to do with the way that that that a kind of
forensic description would be. So I think that all the stories in scripture have to be taken very
seriously. Now that you've taken seriously out of description of events, but we don't have to
figure out what the mechanical causes are behind some of the things that are there.
So people are like reading. So like, I don't know, you read in the book of Joshua that the sun
stopped, you know, for 24 hours and people are like, well, how is that possible? Trying to
figure out like how the earth could move and what this could happen? How could I describe the
mechanical causation of that? It's like, dude, stop it. What are you doing? Who cares? There's
a reason why things are described that way. The reason have to do with their meaning. And so you
don't have to understand what it is that if you had a video camera, you would be filming and you
could you could capture on a video camera. But it also doesn't mean that what it's saying is just
something someone made up. It's a description of something in a way that emphasizes its meaning.
And it's a kind of mythological language. But in the Bible, at least, they're describing
some kind of event, maybe from a distance, maybe from several generations after, maybe from that
type of memory. But it is a memory of something. Yeah. An analogy, and it's too bad we only have
a little bit of time left because I feel like this would be unpacking something that would be
probably several hours of conversation. So, you know, maybe we can come back another time or
something. But an example, it's customized like last night, I've been writing my dreams down.
Last night, I had a dream where I was like, in this German war zone scenario, and I was like,
on my hands and knees and crawling around through puddles and hiding behind car tire things. And
I had a gun, and I like lost the gun, and I was trying to find the gun. And then I had to report
back. It was all this stuff. And within that, I think if I were to like retrace and be like,
okay, I need to understand this dream. So I'm going to go to Germany. I'm going to try to find this
place. I'm going to try to like, in account of this guy's like, no, no, no, no, it was like,
identify the gun. There was truth within the dream. It just wasn't exactly as, you know,
literal as like your waking consciousness may want to define it as this kind of what I'm maybe
perhaps gathering. And that might be a little bit of a stretch. But even like your waking
consciousness now, so think about how right now, let's say around you, there, there's millions
of things happening at the same time. There's like billions and billions of things happening
simultaneously around you. And so in order for you to make sense of that, you have to draw phenomena
into coherent through a coherent line. So even if it's just your day, like you went through your
day, you get home, like there are millions of things that happen to you that day, like millions
and millions and millions. And so but then you tell the story of your day, what you're doing,
what you're going to do is you're going to compress, you're going to take the elements
that are meaningful, and you're going to compress them together in a manner in which
you are going to show the line that connects these elements together. Okay, so that's how we do it.
Now think of that now, over 1000 years, instead of over one day. Think of how I can do that
in a manner in which I would have to tell the story of my day to someone in 1000 years.
And so there's a kind of compression that happens. And that compression doesn't mean that it's like
I said, it doesn't mean that you didn't have a day or that, but it means that there are so many
examples that I could give you. But like, let's say a simple example would be, let's say in that
story of the German story, your dream, you're trying to tell that to someone, you're trying to
tell that to someone who lives, who's a Maasai in Kenya, right, from 500 years ago. And so are you
going to say you had a gun? No, you're going to say I had a weapon, right? You're going to say
something like I had a weapon in my hands. But that Maasai, they only understand a weapon to be
something like a lance. But they might have the same dream or a totally different dream with the
same like undercurrent of truth. They'll have a lance in their hand instead of a gun. Yeah.
And so that's the type of contraction that I'm saying. It's like, if I say a sword, that has way
more power than if I say a Glock, because a Glock is like a super reduced version. And even if I say
a gun is better than if I named like the brand of the thing. It's like this compression of elements
that is what ancient storytelling was doing and what you find in scripture. So some of them reach
levels that are so high, like a serpent, you know, like a tree, like a
garden. These elements are now universal and so compressed.
I'm going to ask about something just to generally like put it into the ether to reflect upon.
I'm curious your perception of things like the ancient fertility cults, like the sacred
mushroom and the cross book, the John Allegro book and Ellucinian mysteries and, you know,
all of like the mystery cults of Greece, etc. And the potential of, you know, Ergot or LSD being
used to as like these like death, death and rebirth ceremonies and a lot of what we gather
from the Bible, in fact, has influenced from the psychedelic experience and conflation of these
different like ancient practices and to what we now call, you know, Bible and God and death and
rebirth and. Well, let me say this. I think that it is. In 60 seconds. What do you think about that?
No, but what I do think is that it is exactly an image of the reductionism at which we've arrived
in terms of modern scientism, which is that we want to find the substance. What's the chemical?
Like what's the chemical? What's the what's the binding thing? You know, what's the
what's the medicine? And that's what we think is happening. So the whole psychedelic Ellucinian
Ministries things is hilarious. I find it just hilarious, which is that the Ellucinian ministries
lasted what three days, four days of nonstop like rituals, all like that would take you through
an entire process that was extremely complex and that no one knows about because everybody has
kept it a secret. And then you get to the end of it. And then you have a final revelation. Now,
whether or not that revelation might have been supplemented by some chemical is possible.
But the idea that that's what it is is absolutely ridiculous. It's completely
ridiculous. And even people who talk about the psychedelics, it's like, how about if we talk
about, let's at least talk about the vision instead of talking about the stupid mushroom.
Like it's like they just people get obsessed with the stupid mushroom. Like let's at least talk about
the vision and see the coherence of the vision across the different traditions. Let's at least
talk about that. But the idea that so for example, like the only thing that's closest to the so-called
mystery cults right now in the world is the Christian liturgy. That's the closest thing
that you can have because it is it is a death and rebirth ritual through baptism. It is a movement
into a scandalous mystery, which is the Eucharist revelation at the end of participation and eating
the body of a God. Like that is that's what Christianity is. But the idea that if we could
just have psychedelics, like, well, no, no, no, no, that's, that's more just, that's more just
like an interesting kind of thing to hang to like a handle to grab on toes. Like, oh, interesting.
I think that there's like ordeal poisoning, you know, like the form of like fasting and,
you know, there's, there's like the Sundance, Native American Sundance thing, or you're fast
and for several days and you're dancing around a tree and then you're hung from the tree and you're
going through this like death and rebirth, like losing of the body. You're finally coming to a
point where your body is so drained, you think you're on the edge of transitioning out of the body
and suddenly there's this like, oh, okay, I'm rebirthed again. You know, I'm born again. Like
that, I think that happens many in many different scenarios, like a rite of passage in culture is
very common. But it's something that, you know, I don't know that there's a definitive rite of
passage in Western culture for the most part, but it doesn't need to be psychedelics per se,
just something. Well, we have something called baptism, which is, which is, which is that and
it is, it is definitely a death and rebirth. There's also the, so the idea of reaching these
states through fasting is probably much better because the problem with the psychedelics, and I
can see it is that at least my, my encounter with people that have just done psychedelics is that
I don't think they come back with, not sure they come back with much. Like I'm not that
impressed with, with the things that I've heard people come back with. Some of it seems really
confused. Like some of it seems because it's like you rip the veil off and then you enter into a world
of, of encounters with, let's say transpersonal beings, but it's like they're all kinds of
transpersonal beings. Like it's not as if everything that exists in the, in the invisible
is there to help you and is good. Like that's not true. And so I, I feel like there's a lot of,
and so I'm not, I'm not totally discounting it. It's like, I'm not saying that it's evil or whatever.
I'm just, I just am not super impressed. And like I, I'm not impressed at what psychedelics did
to, in the sixties to our culture. And I am very wary about them coming back right now, because
we were in a worse place than we were in the sixties. Like we are, we are in a, a more disjointed,
broken narcissistic space than people were in the sixties. So imagining that coming back, I don't
know, man. I mean, it'd be tough. I mean, now it's becoming like more of like a passionate
conversation. And now we're going to, we're going to close it. But I mean, it's tough to say that
anything as an absolute, like you could, like there's suggestions that Francis Crick,
part of his discovery of the triple helix model was a product of him using, I think it was LSD,
and taking this huge, you know, massive information that he's been aggregating.
And then through that psychedelic experience or, you know, whatever you work on psychedelics,
another one of those words kind of like spirit of God, whatever, it's got a lot of, a lot of
flakes on it. Those seemingly like disparate connections that he was, he was in these different
tunnels, suddenly like fused for a moment. And then he comes out of that experience because
he's done so much work in his like, his other world. Yeah. So you could understand it. You
could understand that that's probably what something that the Ellucian myth mysteries
were offering. They would create a massive ritual that lasted several days. And then in the last
moment, there would be some, they would use some supplement and that that would, so you can imagine
like, there's a little residue, a little residue of that in Christian communion, especially in the
monastic sphere where someone would be fasting for, would be fasting probably for a whole day,
or at least maybe more before they would take communion. And then there would be a little
bit of that with in terms of obviously it's not psychedelic, but a little bit of, let's say,
a little help to kind of break down some things with taking wine after having fasted for a few
days. Yeah. And I think the confusion as well could make sense, the sensation of like, oh,
like what you're saying doesn't feel so cogent. And perhaps within some of those, I don't know,
like super conscious states for lack of better words, maybe a person kind of stumbles in territory
that's not as affable as like what they would read or, you know, or agurgitate out of a book.
And it's kind of like- Yeah, well, they don't, people rarely talk about the bad trip. People
don't talk about the bad trip for some reason, because I mean, I have witnessed people, like I
have witnessed people in my, in my surrounding kind of just go down that route. And I mean,
I don't know if it's because they were already psychologically fragile, but like I watched
them break apart, like I've watched them go into a psychotic state as soon as really hard
things started to present themselves to them. So yeah, so I think that I do worry about
this cold resurgence of psychedelics right now. I definitely, I worry about it because I'm afraid
people are going to see it as an easy way in. It's like, well, just take this pill, you know,
you want to know what spirituality is? Just take this pill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot to say
there. Well, at least for some people, it seems to be that like,
certainly, you can, I think a person can develop a dependence on, you know, a clergy person can
develop a dependence on the idea of God, you know, and then wearing that as a mask and putting on
the robe and putting on the cross. And there's that, that exists, a spiritual person can do that
with the beads, you know, like there's a lot of different versions of that. And someone could
wear an ayahuasca root around their neck and like, that's their thing. And they go back and they
do their own psychedelic baptism every six months, but they don't actually resource themselves in
their waking life to be able to fulfill some of the, the, the lessons that were that they, they
garnered during that experience. So they just go back to their previous momentum. And that's when
it becomes kind of bullshitty, where it's like, no, no, like, like the window gets opened in
various different ways, you can have a near death experience, you could fall in love,
you could eat way too many mushrooms, you know, or whatever, you know, wow, like I,
like the window is out, the veil is, the veil has been thinned. And now the window closes,
now what do you do with it? And I think that's the difference between someone that's like a
Michael Pollan, for example, where people seem to like respect his perspective. And like the
rainbow gathering person that still doesn't have a job and, you know, still isn't really like
that effective in society, which effective, I don't really like, you know, it's a dumb,
it's a dumb thing to say, but you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. So that's, there's nuance to
everything, including religion, including the psychedelic experience, including, you know,
everything. Yeah, well, I've never done psychedelic. So, so I'm definitely not,
I don't, I want to be careful that I'm not, that I'm not being too harsh, but I, but I do see
like, I don't know, I do see that it's the fact that it's so public and everybody's talking about
it so publicly, I think it worries me, you know, for good reason. Even at the time of the, if,
if there was part of something like the Ellucinian Mysteries, and if it was part of,
of, of some of the rituals that existed in the past, and it would always have been like secret,
it would always have been something that was kept. Yeah. Because it's also very dangerous.
So, and it doesn't get conflated into like an egoic badge of honor, which then it's kind of
tripping back into that previous momentum of, you know, egotism or whatever. Now suddenly,
you're like, you're, the ego is so strong that you had so much momentum in that now you're taking
this divine quotations, or maybe not in quotations experience, and you're actually leveraging the
divine to bolster the ego. And that's like, oh, like, all right, what do we do with that?
You know, and then, you know, that's a whole other conversation.
Thanks, man. I hope I'm going to, yeah, I need to go now, but it was good to,
it's good to meet you. It took me in surprising places.
Good times. Is there a place that people ought to be directed to go from here if they want to
go deeper into your, your stuff, your podcasts and YouTube and people can check out the symbolic
world.com. That's my website. And that's where you'll find most of the, like, I have a presence on
YouTube and there's a podcast version of what I'm doing. And there's a group, like a kind of community
of people around that are writing articles about this kind of symbolic thinking, a symbolic vision
of the world. So yeah, people can check that out. Great. Thank you, man. At some point,
I would love to run it back and maybe start with the... Start with the Bible stuff.
Start with the Bible stuff.
All right. That is it. That is all. Thank you all for tuning in. And I'll see you all soon.
