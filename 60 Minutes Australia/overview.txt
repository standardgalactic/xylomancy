Checking 60 Minutes Australia/No teachers, no rules： The schooling trend where kids do whatever they want ｜ 60 Minutes Australia.txt
60 Minutes Australia features a story about families who have chosen unschooling, an educational approach where children learn through their own interests and experiences rather than in a traditional classroom setting. Carlene and her family provide an example, with some of her sons—two aged 11 and 12, another aged 14, and her eldest son Liam, who is 19—having struggled with reading and literacy in school. Despite these challenges, Liam has found success as a farrier, and his older brother Dion didn't learn to write until his 20s, illustrating that some children may find ways to navigate life without mastering conventional academic skills early on.

Joel and his wife, Nicky, have chosen to unschool their four children, citing the success of this approach for Joel and his brothers. They argue that unschooling allows children to follow their interests, which can lead to a more fulfilling and personalized education experience. This approach seems to be working well for them, as their children are showing an interest in reading and other learning activities without the pressure of a formal school environment.

The Clarks, another unschooling family from Toowoomba, share that their children—Jemima, Millie, and William—are all thriving in literacy and learning through everyday experiences. They emphasize that unschooling does not mean neglecting parental responsibilities; it's a demanding role that requires parents to be actively involved in their child's education every day, without the structure of school holidays or breaks.

The segment concludes with a reflection from Liz Hayes on the challenges and rewards of unschooling versus traditional schooling, highlighting the importance of finding an educational approach that works for each individual child. She encourages viewers to consider alternative methods if the conventional system is not effective for their children. The piece underscores the diversity of learning styles and the necessity for parents to advocate for their children's education in a way that suits them best.
