Checking COIF/Alastair McIntosh - Discernment - An All Consuming Fire (Universal Hall, Findhorn 11th Sept 2023).txt
 Alistair McLeod, a poet with Scottish Presbyterian and Welsh roots, shares his experience with language, particularly the Welsh language, which he acknowledges he struggles with due to a psychological issue common among people of his generation raised in certain regions. He expresses that the embarrassment associated with not speaking the language is more about the ego than the authentic self. McLeod then reads a poem titled "The Moon in Slain" by Alistair Thomas, reflecting on the end of religion and the search for meaning beyond traditional religious structures. The poem contemplates the transition from light to dark, the silence of old choirs, and the waiting for what will emerge from the body of the new moonâ€”no one can see. It emphasizes the idea that even as the moon moves for the earth's shadow, prayer also has its phases, suggesting a cycle of change and renewal. McLeod concludes by thanking the audience for their attention.
