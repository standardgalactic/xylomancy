And a very warm welcome to everybody from a really barmy evening here in southwest France
to a very interesting talk by Trevor Griffiths, who's got an extremely interesting background
because he studied medicine neuroscience and immunology and then was in medicine for a long time
and he then developed this emotional literacy and emotional logic and so he's become a coach full
time and we're going to find out more about that this evening and you'll see that he's using some
of the David Bohm terminology, implicate order, whole hollow movement at the end of human heart
and I'm really looking forward to finding out what that means and also his key question,
do brains filter out our connection into life? I think that's a very very interesting
question as well coming from a sort of neuro-psychological point of view and while you're
on I will put a link to a spectator article on consciousness by Kit Wilson
this week which is extremely interesting because it finishes up questioning materialism which is
almost unheard of in a kind of mainstream publication so maybe we're making some progress
after all. So Trevor it's a great pleasure to have you with us this evening and we're looking
forward to what you have to share with us. Thank you very much, thank you very much for the
welcome for the invitation, it's great to spend a bit of time with you and I'd like to
be sharing a range of thoughts that have developed, have I frozen by the way or not?
No, maybe not. Just on mine it seems to have done. Anyway so I've got a power point to share,
I'll take you through so if I can share screens on this now
and how does that look? Is that coming through for everybody? Yep that's good.
Thank you so the theme between the seconds of your mind and this is as you mentioned thanks
David, the base of David Bohm's concept of the intricate order behind the explicate order that
we live amongst where he is describing it all being hollow movement, that there's movement
and this talk as you see from the title is about how we perhaps connect into that through our inner
hearts. So my main focus in this talk is around the human mind, we sit in the middle of two enormous
scales, the telescopic of the universe and the microscopic scale and these both meet in the way
our minds work and one of the things that really struck me as I looked at both of these scales
with interest as a scientist is how everything rotates or vibrates, everything's in movement
and as I through my studies got more involved in the way the brain works I came to realise that
there is a particular feature of the way our brains help us get organised in space and in
time and in the sense of substance that we're part of that actually screens out
some of the awareness of our relatedness in life and converts it into static objects
and that's going to be the main theme of this talk is what is going on that our brains construct
certain ideas that where everything is moving everything's in turmoil somehow we've developed
through our brains the idea that there is static matter. Now I went to Oxford to study medicine
I was a bit of an unusual student in that I didn't have the traditional push by to get around I had
a motorbike I quite enjoyed sort of driving it around a bit faster times and so on but I had a
wide range of interests there not just medicine but immunology, macromolecular studies of the cell
membranes and so on but also I was what I call a seeker after truth I'd had a number of religious
experiences things that didn't quite make sense I had explored churches but couldn't quite get on
with traditional religion that explored through Zen of course originally starting with that iconic
book Zen in the Arts and Motorcycle Maintenance of course but taking it a little bit from there
and into eaching and the idea of divination and but then realising one of two unique sticks or
stones to engage with this world through divination if actually our inner hearts are connected
in there as well if we are connected in there as well so I moved on from that into
more an intuitive sort of prayerful search but without any formal structure to that
and in the midst of this search I was also writing with a poetry you know as students do
and one day in this frame out came this particular poem which I'd like to read to you and tell you
a bit of a story behind this Angle's Turn and Lines Forgive Chris Crossing of the Mind
for here in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind
so that poem came out when I was there I wrote it down and I suddenly got this feeling
that I needed to get on my motorbike and drive and then I was going to have to give that poem to
somebody so just intuitively I just did that I put it's a bit cool at the time so I put a
jumper on a jacket and put the poem on the inside pocket and then put my outer jacket on to go on
the bike and set off and drove out from the centre of Oxford got out to a semi-industrial
area on the edge and then suddenly thought that's it I've arrived so I pulled off the road got off
the bike and I was expecting somebody to come by and that I'd know they ought to give this poem to
them and nobody came so I started exploring around reached inside couldn't find the poem
searched everywhere went back to the the flat couldn't find the poem anyway it had disappeared
and because of the sort of experiences that I've been having having I was just going to say right
well that's a mystery you know of course I could have just dropped it somewhere of course
but actually it was very securely wrapped up under two secure levels of clothing on the way out and
and I just was willing to hold that I think as your seeds would go along this poem actually becomes
quite relevant so that was what I would call a sigh event but then something more significant
happened now while there I had a dream one night and it was a dream that foretold the future so
accurately that it saved my life I dreamt I saw my death on the motorbike I won't go to the details
of the dream but there were two sages to it one of which alerted me to the next scene in which I
was knocked off sideways and and so I started driving a bit more sensibly and carefully
but it was a month or so went by and nothing happened and of course I went back to my old ways
which were you know a little bit get in and out around the cars and enjoy what you're doing and so
on but a situation arose then where something really strange started to happen and I thought
this is it and at that moment I was about to do something I'll come back and tell a bit more
about this later I chose to do the exact opposite of my natural thing which would have been to
accelerate and overtake three cars at the same time and instead I jammed on the brakes pulled
back behind the last car and something remarkable happened the car at the front the first one did
a most unusual maneuver spun 180 degrees in the middle of the road and zoomed off in the
opposite direction and it undoubtedly would have knocked me off and killed me so I was alerted
to a situation by that dream and as far as I'm concerned because I am sort of a scientist in my
way of approaching things that was a dream that broke the traditional scientific laws of time
the science is based in the view of the arrow of time from past to the future causal effects
causal chains and this was something that broke that causal chain so to be honest every day that
I live I'm this this event is still as fresh in my mind as ever I'm alive because of an event
that broke these the rules of space and time and that set me off on a search saying science is
definitely delving into something but it's not the whole story there's a lot more that we need to explore
so I I was a part of neuroscience studies studying the cat's sort of visual cortex and
taking part in experiments with you know single nerve microelectrope recordings and so on so I'm
quite used to the idea of the brain working with patterns of activity but the problem was that I
felt sorry for the cat um so I'm not I just thought I wasn't really a lab researcher and
eventually left a PhD and go back into medical studies again because I wanted to be a researcher in
life and I was keen on immunology and the immune diseases and so on and realized that both neuroscience
and immunology they're both pattern recognizing systems that we as an organism are detecting
patterns with distant senses in the neuroscience and the immunologies with chemical patterns
with recognizing what's self and what's other and that is all part of our identity as a person
it's at a physical level and at a social and wider environmental level but in all of that
that I was studying I knew something was missing from science and it was to do with relatedness
to do with relationship I was looking at communication patterns between cell populations
and health and disease but decided to leave in the end to go into medicine but I had I took
a particular interest in family medicine and systemic work because the patterns of communication
amongst people I found were reflected in the patterns that the brain was detecting in the
environment and the understanding how the immune system worked on pattern recognition
responsiveness the same thing was going on in families and in communities neighborhoods
workplaces so I was forming this idea of identical principles of organization
principles of organization that's a core thing that I'm going to be talking with you
about because it's about this area that I believe I'll be able to give an explanation
of these two side events that broke the rules of space and time
we're getting into the level of communication patterns and relational patterns
now I also put the picture here of shredding his cat and what I just like to say is that this
thought experiment about the quantum level of life I believe is completely fallacious
the reason is that it's not the cat or any of the things here it's in a box
and the thought experiment relies on that box being screened off until somebody opens the
lid and looks at it and then that is the input of energy into this closed system that determines
what happens the problem is that science has recently shown that the universe is not a closed
system which is the picture that what I call enlightenment science for the last 300 years
has all been based on the idea that the universe is a closed system bounded by space and time
and the matter moves with momentum and bounces around inside this box
and so on but in 2011 three physicists and primitive Schmidt and Rice got the Nobel prize
for physics for proving that the universe is not only still expanding but the rate of expansion
is accelerating right so we are part of a universe that is expanding at an ever increasing rate
but that means the universe of which we belong is an open system it has to be an open system
and I'm sorry to disappoint people but all the rules of thermodynamics to do with entropy and
energy preservation and so on are all framed within the concepts of closed systems they do
apply in closed systems but at a universal scale in which we human beings are embedded
it's an open system and those rules may not apply and that's what I'm going to be saying to
they actually do not apply at the level of the human heart Karen Barrett of course has done a lot of
work on the concept of intraaction we human beings are interactive in this universal scale
also in local systems and it's up to us by our choice of action whether we create closed systems
and believe in them or whether we live as if we are part of an open system
so I came up with this thing there's a lot of neuroscientists are keen on the idea that the
brain is actually a social brain it isn't there just to give us a sense of who we are and for us
to generate feelings internally it's not an individualistic thing the brain is there to map
our relatedness and to map our relationships and I found from my developing interest in
christian in Celtic Christianity because it's very earth it's very rooted in the community in
the community in hospitality in the rhythms of nature to me that that's this is where the life
of things are generated and the Celts had already had this image called a triquetra
three corners a shape that is three points but not a triangle or a tri-creature three corners
and it's an icon of never-ending movement of continuous dynamic if you follow the lines along
you know it just goes round and round and when you fit two together you just the relatedness goes
backwards and forwards between them and this is eternal movement and this is how I'm going to be
displaying what I believe is David Bones concept of hollow movement now these two icons of movement
the triquetra are icons that can be scaled to lots of different levels it's a prince the
principles of organization of movement movement is the changing relatedness of forms changing
relatedness of forms so this could represent two adults talking together a conversation
it could be in Celtic Christianity god and humanity in a conversation it could be a mother
and child but also I'm going to be putting to you that this could be an icon that represents
quantal change this could be the gardener in the earth that you know you can have a relationship
with your garden to cultivate and bring full fruitfulness from the land and the idea of having
two of the self-organizing elements that meet together into a conversational relationship
is that one becomes an ecology for the other this is an ecological picture of the human being
an ecological picture in which the environment scale from the quantal to the universal
and to the social and the inner world and in this I'm going to introduce the word information
and the core thing in this is because I'm proposing that everything is in movement
information is a verb it's not a noun it is the forming and following this along
the change that's going on in this in this person here is transferred relatedness over to here to
it transforms the other person and this is information it's a dynamic it's not a noun
and this is and what I'm proposing is that this type of iconic relationship or relatedness
is synergy this is a vibration one movement happening here induces movement here and that
deflates back and here we have synergic movement backwards and forwards this is an image an icon
of relatedness so there's mutual repatterning which is synergy now this is actually the core
slide the talk and I'm going to come back to this slide right at the end of it just to to
pull it all together at the end and now in that a mutuality of repatterning there is bi-directional
informational flow and a lot of science is based in a linear concept of energy transfer or
information transfer from a transmitter to a receiver we're coming back to that a little bit
later but in systemic family therapy the the network of relationships and the communications
that go back and forth a group of people form a state of action going on within the family
and that state can either bring on helpful behavior or it can become chaotic or turbulent
that's where the social brain is connecting with it and the core principles of organization I believe
are shaping what goes on in the brain to engage with this conversational reality and that is what's
called the explicate order this is the the level we live in in our social setting setting environments
and that picture on the right of the lady looking at that artwork on a piece of on a UK post box
it just shows the explicate order can get into a bit of a knot and get all tied up
when when things get a bit stressed but underneath that David Bowman is saying that there is an
implicated order of wholeness a whole movement and I believe that the inner human heart
connects into that at an informational level where one is transforming the other through
this synergic connection and that this synergic connection lies behind what we describe as energy
matter in the explicate order right so movement emerges from the implicated order out into an
explicate order where our brains organize it into a concept so when I was studying neuroscience
this is absolutely basic neuroscience you know well established that there are what are called
sensory association areas in the brain where particularly the distance senses are all brought
together to to to construct certain impressions I'm not going to go into this in any detail at
the moment but I just want to say that it is well known that this parietal cortex area here
generates a concept of space and if there are lesions or illnesses that affect this area it'll
be affecting our spatial awareness this area of the frontal lobe underneath and in the middle
is involved in sensing time and this is the one that I really want to draw your attention to
this temporal lobe sensory association area living together you know your visual balance
auditory touch sensations body or a body images on all integrate here they pull together memories
as well and so we get meaningful association with our ongoing sensory experience is generated in
these three different areas now the point about the temporal lobe one is this is where there are some
unusual effects that come from epilepsy affecting this area or any other the illnesses
and they can make life seem unreal what is what's going on here is something called
object recognition which is easiest described by for example talking about a bicycle the bicycle
looked at from different angles looks totally different and yet we somehow develop an idea
that this is a bicycle there's something solid there called a bike and it looks like this from
different angles right and that is what's being pulled together in this area of the brain
so it gives a sense of real present object recognition now when I started to apply the
triquetral image of what's happening here these change and form and relatedness are features of
our sensory input which are coming into this dynamic where the brain is constructing an organized
sense of the world out of chaotic neural experience of sensors coming in from all angles
and memories coming in together and it's happening here and these three areas these three points
coordinate by pairing their inputs in these different areas so if we if we were just to
look a little bit more at forms you know shapes of things and the relationship of forms if those
two things come together it creates a sense of space and if forms are changing a pendulum swinging
gives you a sense that there is time on the move and this is the one that I want to
draw your attention if this theory is true and this is a hypothesis I'm putting it to you as a
hypothesis that could be tested then if these three sensory inputs can be integrated in these
sensory association areas to generate a sense of space and of time and of real presence then
the other pairing is that the change of relatedness and what I mean by that is let's imagine you're
walking along suddenly you bang your hand against the edge of the table you haven't particularly
noticed right you will think there's a solid table there right but actually what's happened is that
your hand has had a change of relatedness and that that has got converted through your object
recognition temporal sensory association area into the center there's a solid optic there
if you if somebody walks into a room if there's a change of relatedness you might get the sense
that there's a real presence of someone in the room so out of changes of relatedness we develop
a concept of substance there's a substantial person come in if someone says feel the quality
of this cloth you don't just put a fingertip against it and say you're feeling the quality
you move your hand over it and you get a pat changing array of sensory input that
you associate with your memories and gives you a sense of the substance of this material
that you're touching so this is object recognition any sense of objects that we have around us is
actually constructed from a whole history memorized of our changing relatedness with
their environment from the time when we were babies gumming things that we put in our mouths
and so on right the way through we're accumulating a sense of textures and qualities
that we change our relatedness with and we shape this idea that things are real objects
so this is a fairly complicated idea but I just want to put it to you as a theory I'm
put this icon up here the core icon just to emphasize that this process going on in the brain
is part of the social brain all of these three are inputs from our environment that the brain is
organizing in order to make a response and these three are project forward to the motor areas here
that's what's going on in this central space and it's in the motor areas where we prepare our
responses that these three sense of space time and objects of substance become properly integrated
into a sense of me myself in this environment so I spend a bit of time explaining that but
you know this is a core to it so this is just sort of resating what I said David Bohm's
implicate order of movement is the changing relatedness of pattern forms the changing
relatedness of pattern forms and that sense of space and time and of substantial reality
around us is what we mean by the explicate order that is it we have what I call an orientation
horizon a lot of our experience are placed in this sense of orientation in space and time and
substance but if you think about it there's an awful lot of our experience which is below
the orientation horizon which is not orientated and the simplest most obvious one to say is the
sense of smell it that activates you that alerts you but it actually alerts you to search with
your distant senses for what the source of that smell is yeah so the sense of smell is not actually
orientated right but it it drives us to seek orientation to bring in this explicate order
to a set of experiences that are below that orientation horizon and this is what I'd like
to be proposing to you that this is what I mean by the inner human heart it's a whole range of
awareness and sensitivities that is below the orientation horizon and a lot of it is to do
with emotion with emotion a lot of it the emotion comes from our values and how we interact with
the world around our values emotion is energy in motion and emotion is values in from energy
entering our awareness this is where I'm proposing to you that our inner human hearts
are actually connected into an implicate order way beyond what we are aware of in our
conscious minds as being above the orientation horizon as an explicate order
now these informational movements that are shown in the double tri-creature can scale up
and I'm not going to spend too long on this but when they connect together what was
the synergic vibration just between two of them can start to become a progressive wave of movement
through networks of movement changes remember all of these tri-creature are not solid objects
they are icons of movement the changing relatedness of patterned forms and here we're beginning to see
patterned forms so the I'll just take that back oh sorry and here we go this is going to be a bit
unusual now anyway so just sorry about the interaction there but the point I wanted to
make from that previous slide is that the synergic movement can translate into progressive
movements through that implicate order which I'll come back to in a moment but this is what science
measures science is measuring the movements through the linear movements through what I'm
going to be describing is what I believe is the implicate order and describing it in terms of
these networks of tri-creature tri-creature movement now this this lovely sculpture here is just
just a beautiful picture of the types of conversational orientation that I'd like to
sort of capture for you the the the iconic representations can be true in networks of
people or at the level in the implicate order even of quantum gravity it's the same principles
of movement that are on the go now in quantum theory there's something called um you know
quantum field theory which is running through problems because it's based on particles and it
says that around particles there's a quantum field of energetic activity and it's running
through one or two problems and I want to mention at this stage because what I'm proposing about
tri-creature implicate order is that it's actually much more pervasive than related to the particles
the particles emerge out of it and I'm also going to be proposing that waves in fact emerge
out of this implicate order so the idea of quantum fields around particles is approaching it in the
wrong direction now I believe that looking at this level of an extensive implicate order
out of which emerge particles and waves and eventually emerge all of the dynamics that we
call explicit order which our brains have evolved to detect to engage with to construct an impression
of this world so that we can talk to each other sensibly and cooperate to to to manage life and
manage our environments together and all of that going on over incredibly long time frames and so on
but I believe that this implicate order relatedness can provide a cosmological explanation for the
disappearing poem and for the dream that broke linear time and that's where we're going to be going
with all of this and I'd like to be proposing that the concept of infirm energy in this
implicate order that the movements that are set up through it there are harmonics that are running
through it I believe the vibrations extend into sort of a harmonic whole and but it gets diversity
is inherent to the way these tri-creature connect together we'll be looking at that a little bit
more and because there is diversity within this implicate order there is information one part
informs the other of the movements that are going on within this implicate order and that emerges
into our experience of life we're connected into it but we try to make sense of it in our
explicate order but our brains unfortunately have a weak spot in that what is relatedness
at the level of the implicate order and change of relatedness in unusual patterns there our brains
convert into the idea of solid objects so of course my motorbike existed of course the car
existed of course the poem existed it was a solid object wasn't it but actually what might be happening
in the implicate order at that level is that there were much more pervasive dynamics on move
which we could not be aware of because we were insensitive to them and that's the relationship
between the implicates and the explicate that we as part of life so the ecological systemic
view of the social person is in the explicate order and an informational view of energy and matter
is in the implicate order now just going back to this sculpture of the three women
this is a conversation but the three people can you see the expressions on their faces they each
have different angles on this conversation one blade is pouring out a heart about the story
the one on the right is taking it all in and just absorb with it I don't know about you but the one
in the middle looks to me just a little bit skeptical saying yeah maybe so maybe so you
know but it's a little bit sitting back and you know so they've got three different minds
that are forming different concepts of one dynamic that's going on between them
what I'd like to point out to you I don't know whether you've noticed it yourself
but have a look at their bodies and their legs they're touching there's a lot of contact going
on between them there's a lot of very subtle communication going on between them at a different
level to what's going on in their minds yeah that is a picture to me of the implicate order
out of which emerges our own individual perceptions of the explicate order we then
converse to try and team up and make sense and see it from your angle and see it from mine
and we very quickly forget they were all part of something bigger and we're all connected already
in it but so this is a picture of three analytical perspectives that people can construct
on a single dynamic amongst them all and that these analytic perspectives like the one in the
middle can make somebody take a metal step back from involvement in the conversation
just to try and analyze hey what's going on here actually do I really believe this you know rather
than being absorbed in it as the two ladies on the outside are absorbed in the exchange of information
between them so to me this is a lovely picture of of of conversations
now I'm going to say just a little bit more about the the actual event of the dream
so I mentioned before that there was pulling up some traffic lights I didn't say that but
three cars were stopped and the traffic lights were red but then as I approached from behind
they changed the red amber which in England means hey get ready we're going to be going
soon and on a motorbike that's an absolute gift you just you know accelerate away take over take
all three cars at the same time and zoom on ahead of the lot saying hey this is you know great life
and so but actually alerted by the dream I had just about to start accelerating and I know I stood
on that brake and and pulled back behind the last car and then that front car did a spin in the road
roared off in the opposite direction and what I didn't say before is that the car had black
tinted windows it was covered in dust it just looked nasty it wasn't a standard make of car
it had been worked on it looked dangerous and it looked evil there was intentional movement
about it that's the key term there was intentional movement and it was evil
now that's what I've reflected on for years and years and years and this I would like to say is
very significant in why I moved from exploring wider spiritualities to feeling really comfortable
with a Celtic approach to Christianity not to the other formalized religions which I believe
have pushed things off to an extreme but this earthed area of hospitality of community of
relatedness now that's where the true spirituality lies but the point about that encounter on the
road right was that there were two personalities there and the movements the action that happened
arose out of our personal values my value was to take note of that dream my value
was to enhance life my values to explore what was going on I don't know exactly what the values
were the driver of that car had but they were not life enhancing there was there was it was
something that I would say is an attitude of deafness about it and I think this is what convinced me
that when we're looking at the implicate order and relatedness that goes beyond space and time as
our explicate order brains construct and can emerge as a dream one month in advance of that
that alerts me in two stages of the dream to the fact that something dangerous is going to happen
in that implicate order there are human values there the human values are embedded and this is
the point I really want to be making to you that I'm not convinced that the best way of
thinking about this implicate order is to try and call it consciousness or order the I think
once we understand that human values are based in our hearts and move direct our movements direct
our thoughts direct the quality of our relationships and our reactions to each other we're beginning
to get ourselves earthed in the implicate order not the explicate order that's pre-orientation
and our hearts a month before that were somehow discerning something that there's a direction
that my life was going in and this event could have ruined it and whoever was driving that car
was sensitive to the opposite move so I have to say that this this sense of personal value
in the implicate order brings a life for me the conversational nature of reality
and we can we hide it we lose it because of the way our brains orientate us in an explicate order
of matter and substance so hollow movement is the emerging as systemic personal identity
with it now I just to say I'm very fortunate that John Hunt publishers have recently agreed
to publish a book on this subject so what I'm going to be going into explain how I believe
space and time can be conceived in a new way coming out of this implicate order is much
explaining much more detail in this book the title is clearing away unveiling the mental
tricks that hide reality now I'm going to be giving you a very quick overview of what's in
that book but really there would be too much information here for you to try and take it
in and really work on it so I'm going to ask you just to sit back and take it a little bit
like going to the cinema where you're just sort of watching the story unfold and then maybe at the
end of it you try and tie it all together and be critical do I mean this is this is as I say it's
hypothesis it's exploring what could be now I've got a colour coding in the next set of slides
that are coming up the black headings are when I'm talking about tri-critical cosmology itself
into the diversifying unity of life that we're part of that dynamic the red headings are about
the concept of time and there are three perspectives like those three women three perspectives can be
constructed on timing the on time that construct an idea of timing the blue headings go into
the idea of space and substance as tri-critical hollow movement so that's the structure of what's
coming up and it's all about synergy as conversational orientation when we enter into this
communications feedback at whatever level we want to consider things synergic life starts to move
within us so there is too much for you to take on board here so I really ask you not to try and
take it on too much but the point is that here I've shown the standard tri-critra of you know of
what's how the brain gets organised and here it is in this analytical direction when somebody
takes a mental step back from the conversation to think about the forms and objects something
strange happens inside the brain the way things are orientated and I go into this in much greater
detail in the book to explain how it all happens in neurological terms as well for those who are
interested but space and time become projected out of the observer identity people become an
observer of life when they look at the forms and objects and the forms and objects take out
with them the space and time leaving inside the sense of personal identity my thought experience
and so an observer of life considers themselves to be a presence of mind I am a presence of mind
observing reality and I retain within me how I change my relatedness to that external reality
which is the origin of the empirical frame of mind the scientific empiricism I can act on
this objective world in any way I choose to without any sense of moral obligation as being part of it
because I'm acting on it now part of what comes with this is that the time frame here is an arrow
of time as I previously said a linear cause effect sequence of causality things move from
the past to the future in the arrow of time and so eternity in this view seems like an endless
string of pictures like an old cinema reel and the present moment is one of these pictures in
the middle and it's slowly moving along this line and spatial dimensions become the real
context for life not a product of life so this is turned inside out what is really the
conversational experience that the movement of relatedness generates space and time and a sense
of reality but when you take an analytical step back from the conversation it looks as if I'm a book
are you hearing what I'm hearing it's a very pleasant music in the background
so so that's the one particular analytical perspective and it works linear time time
sequence becomes formed this is what I call the structuralist perspective when pushed to an extreme
it's the materialist perspective this becomes material but it doesn't have to be pushed to that
extreme but the structuralist perspective will tend to say that the dimensions of space and time
are part of the objective reality now if you take a mental step back to look at the conversation
looking at the changes that are going on there the changes can be projected out
is to my perceived reality and that becomes like a whole chaos of processes and living
souls are making different choices and I really don't know what's going on but in here the human
identity the personal identity becomes my own space my personal bubble in my personal space I create
information that I can push out into this chaos to bring order and this what I'm calling an
informationist view of life and in the last 50 years with information technology this has become
like the dominant way of looking at the world that information is more important than matter
but it can be pushed to an extreme where the information is given an objectivity
which it doesn't belong the information if you see it as a verb is a dynamic that's going on
between two things so people in this view believe they have to construct information as a noun
that they transmit into the chaos to all to the movement that's going on there now in this one
time seems like a time frame it's the story what's that you could go have a beginning and a middle
and an end and I put stuff in that changes the story or makes the story and so that's a totally
different way but it is still measurable just like linear time is measurable but these are actually
different features in terms of the way the brain can construct a sense of time not spending too
long on this now but the third view if one takes a mental step back from a conversation to start
looking at the qualities of relatedness that are going on in this conversation something totally
different happens in the brain and if relatedness in an extreme can get pushed out to become an
objective reality itself as a life force a vitalist force a spirit a town and that the common thing
about all concepts of life forces from any culture around the world is that they all course through
space and they are like a higher power they're in a presence of a higher power to which individual
people feel they must submit in order to come into a harmony with it for their health and their
longevity or or whatever now what I want to say here is that what is retained in the sense of
personal identity looking on this is that I become a participator in a life that is beyond me
yeah and there's a lot in this this is a vitally important analytical perspective
and I need to say very clearly at this point by identifying these three perspectives
I'm not saying any of them is right or wrong they are all equally justifiable in logical terms
but the difficulty is if they get pushed to an extreme extreme there are logical deductions that
don't are not compatible with each other and the one here is that because the personal identity
has changed of form retained as part of its identity this is this concept of my own time
and I can return to eternity and come back again in a changed form and this is logically consistent
with this particular view on life this perspective on life so reincarnation is logical
in this perspective but in the materialist perspective it's totally illogical and in
the individualist perspective the informationist it's an interesting idea but it's neither here
nor there whether whether it happens or not so these perspectives give very different pictures
of what's going on in life and I'm going to say this again in any one of these analytical perspectives
you can get a view into the whole of life and see the whole of life in that perspective
and make sense of it as far as it'll go but as soon as you try to integrate it with the way
that it looks from another perspective you're going into problems and people then sadly end up
criticizing each other and blaming each other and and running each other down saying you're wrong
rather than you've got an interesting perspective can we compare those and see if we can match them
to find common ground and that is what this triquetful model is all about it's about being
able to recognize the different analytical perspectives but then to bring them together
to explore how to integrate them into a way that we can delve into the implicate order of life
to understand it better to really connect better into it so please I want to emphasize I'm not saying
that any one of these is wrong they're all equally justifiable but they each can only be right as far
as they go they can't be the whole truth without trying to match metric with the other maximum with
the others and here we sit on the red heading and I just like to for a moment ask you to think back
again to that incident with the driver in the car and myself on the motorbike
just think about the dream and the event I just described three different approaches to time
one is the eternal now throughout life and that we can move from eternity into the now
and and get a very big picture of who I am in the whole picture the other is of time frames
there's a story going on here how extensive is that time frame how extensive is the story
and then there's time sequence was there a time sequence yes there certainly was
there were time sequences going on through that story all three of them are relevant as we reflect
on that unusual event so a triquetful relational balance can avoid dualisms because all those
three perspectives construct a sort of a dualism and avoiding dualisms can be found by reflecting
in what I call a gap in time between the seconds of your mind we're now connecting with that poem
between the seconds of the mind there is beauty such as always found
it in the world it can be beautiful but also personal values can create chaos or turmoil
that can actually create danger difficulty and the implicate order is basically a life
enhancing order that generates life and can bring healing and restoration
even when people's values cause destruction and brokenness
so this is the last slide on time and timing so we talked about three different perspectives
the timing of decisions some of you may know the zen art and arrow paradox
that the art and the arrow are all one concept if you now think about the three analyses
this is how we get into interaction the aiming of that why is somebody tensioning if they have
a purpose in mind the tension is both in the person and in the bow the release of that arrow
is a decision in linear time that the time is right there's a story about the whole context in
which this action is being tensioned and aligned this is Karen Barad's interaction
and in this tri-creatural concept of movement if you're in a what's called a positivist view
that there are little bits of matter like atoms and so on that actually has their own reality
that's the positive view of the world people talk about well what sets these things in movement
and this movement of what these bits exist but what brings the movement but on a tri-creatural
cosmology is turning that upside down and saying that what the things matter emerges
out of movement it's emergent order from implicate order and this is process philosophy
it's the emergence and dispersal of pattern forms among infamy energy movement
reshaping and releasing continuously as that arch and arrow is doing which means that when we start
looking at quantum uh quantum physics or mechanics or whatever you want to call it um we're not looking
at quantum a quantum of energy as if energy is something that is pre-existent we're looking
at quantum change a small package of change right which can scale up by further entanglements
to create movement out of which particles and waves emerge and the whole explicate order eventually
emerges in which we are intraactive so there's a few slides now looking at what is the concept of
space and of substance into which this movement is uh in which we're in which we're part of the
movement now the tri-creature actually has two forms there are two in knot theory shows that it has a
a left spin in the right spin clockwise or anti-clockwise and here you can see the one
the here this line comes down in front of that one and here it comes down behind it this is knot
theory and they have different dynamics now they're each equal in terms of movement but there's a
different structure to us so um just moving on there when they pair up this is again the core
icon is a double tri-creature this is where a single tri-creature actually gains existence a
single quantum change has no existence on its own um but when that change starts to communicate with
another in a conversational reality it becomes a vibration one becomes an ecology for the other
this is the core element of existence now when i started making 3d printed models of these i
discovered the most remarkable thing that's the um left uh and the levone dextro l and d
resonant quanta when they when diverse quanta uh quanta fit together the four liggins that remain
on the outside of it lie in a horizontal two-dimensional plane but if you get an ll and a dd so this
this here is an l form that one is going behind that one and that one is an l form that one's
going behind that one so this is l l and this one the ligand has to twist in order to allow
bi-directional informational flow which means that the four liggins that come off from it
orientate in different directions and here i'm going to make the bold claim we are seeing the
origin of the three dimensions of space it is the movement of these entanglements that has to twist
in order to preserve a harmonic vibration if that could not twist there would be no harmonic
it would stop vibrating if triquetal change would separate and break up and disperse process
philosophy but as it is when there is harmonic it becomes some the score of existence now in
quantum computing they need three core states called plus minus and zero and i would without
going into this i'd like to propose that these three core double triquetra are probably what these
core quantum states are called qubits um qubits of information so i actually call them informational
qubits to try and emphasize that its movement and not a substance and not an object in itself
they're synergic resonant movements vibrations at the plank length that really small length of
quantum change now here we are not going to spend long on this but when these scale up further and
entangle into long strings we end up with three different types of wave you can you see the side
liggins from this um are all of these are blue i'm really have no time to explain this but the
book will in greater detail all i can say is that these waves can develop a fourth dimension
movement along the way backwards and forwards like a slinky going a long way and that fourth
dimension movement can add time into the three dimensions of space and in fact there can be
lots more spins and twists and curls and so on of these sort of things which add extra dimensions
of movement and i would like to be proposing to you that the various dimensions of m theory
and string theory are actually different types of movement at different scales scaling up in a
spin foam of these waves that are connecting with each other i'm not going to go into the details
here but when you get the ld diverse stable qubits they make a horizontal flat plane and it turns
into a hexagon i've got i've made models of these a flat hexagon and these waves of gravity
and light and heat are running through this as a standing wave rather than progressing from it
i'm going to have to move on but here this picture shows how you can get a progressive wave of any
sort and stable domains can come off the edge of it and i'd like to propose to you that these
stable domains as i call them are the seeds of particles we'll go on to the next slide to see
that but a single stable domain can have several different waves coming off it and the waves can
crisscross with each other making a spin foam and all of this is movement all of this is movement
informational movements making a spin foam of the implicate order out of which one area becomes
diverse from another so you get informational transfer between them but one area knows what's
going on somewhere else in a synergic network informational quantum movement because of the
utter interrelated interrelatedness of implicate order behind patterned matter that is in constant
change it's the bi-directionality of movement now the single hexagon can extend into a high cone
of stable domains all mixing together and the standing waves of heat and light and gravity
can move through this this is the closest picture that i can get to of the implicate order but
it gets more complex than this now imagine that this is a flat thing i've made a model of this
but this extended stable domain there's absolutely no reason why it shouldn't curl topologically
in on itself in which case you can get these waves that might span internally within that
topological pattern and those become the internal forces of a particle or and whatever
scale of particle you want to come to so those waves those three basic tri-quifal waves can
either become progressive waves spanning the whole cosmos in terms of light waves and gravity
or they can become the internal strong forces and weak forces that that make particles and
matter hold together but then also if these stable domain extended stable domains are
curling around to make particles some of them will be very stable and some could be unstable
and that is what i believe are particles are emerging out of this implicate order
and scaling up into atoms scaling up into molecules scaling up into macromolecules
which form into cell membranes and these components of cells which form the microtubules
which help to move the amoeba to move through the environment and respond to its environment
more widely which which help mitochondria bacteria to find a home inside cells and generate energy
that all of this is going on in a cell which scales up into a higher order organism
which then to relate and they breed and create more and create families that communicate
all around identical principles of movement movement is the changing relatedness
of patterned forms at every level emergent from the implicate order
now in current quantum theory i don't think there's any theory around that actually adequately
explains how gravity and light can interact but this particular model shows that this is
quite a complicated one to understand by ran pipe cleaners through this this model of two waves
interacting the orange one is a gravitational wave the green one is a light wave and both of
them share a relatedness ligand now this looks as if one wave is passing through another but
that's the wrong picture of the implicate order the implicate order is a harmonic it's a spin
from network in which the there's or i would actually claim synchronicity between two ends
of a wave what becomes linear time is the movement of the fourth dimensional wave along these
triquetra waves as i call them the triquetra waves are forming a spin from network the implicate order
and through that implicate order can move linear waves and those are what science measures
science can compare one fourth dimension wave with another but it has no way of delving into
the true nature of the implicate order we can only discern this by scaling our human experience of
being together in groups in conversations where there's informational transfer in a brain that is
designed to interpret it using these three principles that's what i'm proposing so this is an
informational model of movement in quantum gravity it's happening in every cell and every cell membrane
of your body including every nerve cell every synapse in your brain is moving according to these
principles the microtubules also move brain neurotransmitters to the synapse and release them
at the synapse it's the same chemistry that moves an amoeba and that is moving atoms and molecules
that are on movement everywhere above absolute zero is in movement so this universe is a cosmos
because it births life in its diverse ecologies and we belong in this concept of ecology with others
we are not here on our own the the conversational nature of life is something that we really need to
appreciate that when you look at an object you are seeing a brain construct of changing
relatedness a whole history of changing relatedness that we're interpreting as an object so we can
talk about it and manipulate it but actually it's evidence of the fact that we belong in this cosmos
we're in it we're interactive within it try to reach for quantum cosmology the inner human
heart is deeply synergic with life's movements and a much wider concept than our explicate
order brains can take in the conscious mental experience of orientation adds dimensional
space and time right but we have a meaningful engagement with relational life beyond space
and time that's the implicated order in our inner hearts infamy energy is life moving in the
background that we connect into and we try to make sense of it like those three women in the
conversation try to make sense of it from our different perspectives but there is life on the
go and and we we need the conversations to try and really grasp what is actually going on
now the final thing before I just close is that that image that I gave you of the intricate order
I haven't gone into this the book will go into this in much greater detail so to properly explain
it um but imagine a group of people imagine that those three women talking but imagine you're in a
group of people having a conversation about the day's events or planning where you want to go on
holiday and so on and the exchanges that are going on between you there's a whole raft of
communications at an implicates a pre-orientation level below the orientation horizons hold all
those communications are going on passing things back and forward about our values and we then
construct this impression of trying to make sense of what's going on now I'm not going to spend
gravitational waves gravity holds together diverse places of the universe there's an
enduring connection between every mass in the universe now that to me is in human experience
could emerge as the equivalent of love love is enduring connection between people an enduring
ability to be responsive to each other even though there might be fairly traumatic changes going on
or fairly disturbing changes or maybe anticipating very pleasant changes but that enduring sense of
connection could be an equivalent of gravitational attraction the warmth the thermodynamics of
responsiveness the warmth could be the equivalent of human kindness that as we respond to each other
as we're in this group together we maybe discern our differences but there can still be a warmth
of responsiveness of kindness that says well I can respond to you and you know keep this connection
warm and alive but also the there is the sense of presence we we can be present for each other or
you know when somebody's distracted and isn't really involved in the conversation you know it
and people sometimes take themselves away they hide themselves away they don't allow themselves
to be a presence in a social network and this is rather equivalent to the electromagnetic type
waves where where the electromagnetic magnetism causes two polarities I haven't been able to go
into that at all I'm afraid in this talk but the D and the L waves can run through this network
parallel to each other and will have opposite effects so you can have attraction or repulsion
between positive and negative charges and magnetism north and south poles and so on but
why why should all that matter be dualistic separated from our hearts from our inner hearts
we're embedded in it we're intuiting it we're communicating about it we're trying to understand
it by talking with people who see it differently and trying to edge towards a better understanding
of it and we need to be the presence of loving kindness for each other and that is a substantial
reality of a human being in this world that is the core substantial reality of a human being in
this world to be the presence of loving kindness for others in social settings or with the earth or
with god or whatever the spirituality is that is alive for you at that time and of course the love
of unfortunately does not always feel like that comfortable warm cuddly joy of love when
things are going together love also is made known as grief where there's brokenness where there's
separation where there's misunderstanding or doubt or there's been offense taken or hurt
that love turns into a grief mode which you know we teach about in other areas that it actually
has a positive purpose a constructive purpose to help people to explore how to reconnect
into that enduring connection when change has pushed people out of a comfort zone but nevertheless
that that grief can move people to explore and if we have the warmth of kindness and we recognize
someone is grieving and we can be present for them then we can contribute to the healing of this
world the expert order can get tied up in knots and we can help to untangle that we can be the
presence of loving kindness and we will be connecting into this implicated order discerning
intuitively what the movements of that order are what the values are that we need to bring alive
in our relationships now so this is the conclusion of what the the the tri-creatural cosmology brings
us to a concept that the human heart is much more formative of our lives than our conscious minds
which we need to connect with others in conversations in order to discern and delve deeper
into what's happening in our human hearts in terms of values and interactions
so i've just come back to that original slide the iconic slide of tri-creatural cosmology
two self-organizing units that are in communication with each other there is a mutual
transformation that is synergic that is life emerging and that synergy can we become an ecology
for each other and that can bring forth fruitfulness in life after that so this i believe i'm going
to come back now to the final slide is the implicate order within which mysterious things can happen
things beyond space and time things in which substance disappears but i'd like to say to you
that that inspiration that i had to write that poem and just think this is now 50 years ago
angles turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind i hadn't even didn't know about
tri-creatural but i wrote that angles turn and lines forgive criss-crossing of the mind for here
in the world there is beauty such as always found between the seconds of your mind
so thank you that's what i'd like to be sharing with you very much indeed trevor that was fascinating
and and i think it'll take us a little bit of time to get our heads around your new
concepts but i find them very very beautiful and especially as they relate to uh to david
bow and i just a two couple of remarks before um you know we have a five minute break and then
we'll come back to questions announcements and questions um one form of pattern recognition
that i would associate with david bow would be meaning and and maybe we can come back to that
in the in the thought because he was meaning and being who talked about and he he didn't like the
mind matter idea he he put everything into into into a different form so that was one
observation and the second the second the other two observations related to ian the gilchrist
and because i think the brain that makes matter in substance is affected by left hemisphere left
hemisphere cognition and the right hemisphere is what enables us to understand betweenness
yes betweenness is is crucial to your model it's also crucial to his
and i'd just like you to tell us i'll clarify for us how exactly you would define the inner
human heart i didn't quite get that clear you used the term a lot yes but is it in is it the
intuition is it the what what is it exactly how do you have a definition for it well i i think it
is going to need clarification in a fairly extended way but the one way is to to distinguish
what in our human experience is not actually orientated in space and time so below the orientation
horizon if you think how much for you imagine you are embedded in this explicate order world
right around you that's above the orientation horizon but there's a lot of experience to do
with intuition sensing that is is not framed in that way
yeah it's very subtle it's very subtle yeah it's nuance it's dynamic and it's movement and and it
is exactly as they were saying it's about meaning it's i'm aware that there's some dynamic going
on inside me but i cannot believe that i am isolated in this this world this cosmos right
what is this mentor of connection where do i belong in it because what i see with my senses
what is constructed into the simplified order is not the whole story you know in not very much
ian's perspective as well that yeah you have to think that we emerge from within something
and we're not apart from it absolutely and that and that's that in his whole his whole
chapter on the sense of the sacred makes this point anyway i'm i'm we're going to have a break
now so back at 50 and then we'll have some brief announcements and then i'm sure there'll be a
lot of questions thank you
um i think what what popped in my mind when when i was really a lot of you know the the what if
questions it certainly is true that i believe the explicate order that our brains construct
everybody knows about the blind spot you know how our brain sort of fills in consciously
where there is no sensory input to the retina and we have all sorts of anticipations in life
that make us focus our attention in various ways and screen out other things and that's
more the way i look on this informational processing is because of our focus of attention
we screen certain things out and i believe that the whole brain works on feedback loops
and we can we end up a little bit like that film the matrix you know making our own reality
in a way so so that's what those three analytical perspectives are
that the more you push yourself down that line of maintaining your focus on certain areas of life
the more you become separated from the ongoing
implicate order conversational reality yeah you go off into your own mental world
and you can talk with talk with like-minded people and it'll sound as if everything's
sensible and you're seeing it all together but there will always be a limit to that one
perspective just as the Galileo project is saying there's a definite limit to materialism
but what what can we explore alternatively that's the same is true if you if you if you
take the vitalist view to an extreme i'm afraid to say while i am a great believer in that
participatory view of life i'm i'm you know i don't believe i can just think it all into
existence i'm not sure that you know i think there is a material reality out there that that
implicate order actually is making particles and waves and the particles scale up into things
that do behave deterministically now we can work with that at different levels but the idea that
just with our conscious minds we can sort of dissolve it i just feel that's maybe going to
a step too far there's sort of a middle ground of paradox that we need to be living in
where we're that's why we need the conversations to explore that middle ground very good i mean
what what you're saying also whether in a bergson because the bergson said the brain is the organ
of attention to life and and part of part of that attention is exclusion yes and and if we if we
took in all the information that that we potentially could we'd be completely overloaded and we're
already overloaded and but we'd be completely swamped absolutely absolutely and and thank you
so what i'd like to do if i could just sort of build on this point a bit more i said the brain
works on feedback loops now i personally believe that and you're asking for my concept of the inner
human heart i think many people are aware that decisions choices are made emotionally yeah
they're made through the limbic brain and the core brain which is pulling together all sorts of
associations and sales psychology of course is expert at this they know how to influence the
emotions to yeah decision yeah right yes thank you um and and so the decisions are formed by
feedback loops between the core brain and the limbic brain and the cerebral cortex but also
coming into the core brain is all of our sensory input and there are filters in the core brain
that filter the sensory input on its way up and the outgoing motor in outputs
feed those filters they put a priority and that's part of the attention focusing mechanism
yeah which of course um a neuro neuro linguistic program is very strong on all of that sort of
filtering of information now that's what i believe the values are they're actually the priming of
filters in the core brain and the limbic brain that allow through certain things that we're
anticipating or magnify things that don't fit with it mismatches so that our attention focuses
on what is not going right so we can target our activity towards that purpose the purpose that
we have in mind the problem is the purpose we have in mind is our purpose not the bigger
purpose of the universe yes well there may be some sort of alignment there but we can't tell
yeah absolutely let's move on to the next question it's Julie Henshelwood does the
implicate order imply potential this is 2105 that's both your question i think an absolutely
core thing that's going on for me is that discover all the the the Nobel Prize in 2011
which they had proved that the universe is still expanding at an ever-increasing rate
the universe is an open system and again in the book i would go into how i believe the open the
the triquetal model allows the open generation of of new areas new new substance even um you know
that my experience of life and i have had these personal experiences um is that substance can
transform miraculously i simply have to say that is my experience um that does not fit with
the laws of science and the laws of thermodynamics um and so there is something about open system
thinking which as Julie is saying is all about growth and opportunity and potential
and the potential can grow but through conversational interaction it can stabilize
those stable domains are absolutely the core of what makes life sustainable right they
so there's a constant movement but and those stable domains can form and they can disrupt and
they can split but nevertheless the fact that they stabilize movement and change
and that that can scale up to a level of predictability and determinism
you know also allows because it's rooted in movement it allows the miraculous and unusual
transformation of those stability i think that's the key point really and when i said we're
with david bowham you're starting from um the the dynamic hollow movement and i was just bowled
bowled over when i read the implicate order in about 1983 um he spoke at the mystics and
scientists conference that year in fact right now and i'm i'm i'm also thinking that the the closed
lit a closed system is associated with linear thinking and a linear idea of time
so i think this is this is as it were systemic if i'm understanding you
yes hopefully because once you've got an open system you're also open
and you're well we are consciousness is there is our access means for the whole of what we're
talking about and but but once you're open you're open outwards and inwards if one can even make
that distinction and i'm just totally with that um but it all depends on our sensitivities and
our willingness to create gaps in time so that we can just step back from all of our constructs
and and just engage with with new sensitivities uh but then we need to affirm that through
conversations with others who see life differently because otherwise we just go off into our own
you know our own imaginary worlds if we do that we we we need this conversational interaction
to find our own stabilities um then we are coming on to peter from scotland where it's
still light it's totally sharp yes indeed it's light um but i'd like some light cast on my problems
i might um i'm going to uh i can't formulate it properly for you so i ask you to be very tolerant
of what i'm saying because i haven't come to the uh a full understanding of what we're doing
a number of us in vassilios uh is one of them are looking at random number generators
and we're looking at the way they go out of randomness now what is interesting about this is
that we're looking at it what happens when people die and we have reason to think that this will be
a point at which the random numbers will go out uh of randomness and also and this is much more
interesting much more important is that you link random number generators to specific people and
specific events by forming a relationship with them and the event uh so that's three three events
is a generator that's the event and there is uh you who is doing it and it seems to me that uh there
is going to as as time moves on the relationship between the random number generators and uh people
and events they're going to increase enormously you'll have one in your pocket and you will to
some extent see the intensity of what somebody is thinking also time is a material and space is a
material now with that rather poorly formulated question can you can you help i'm i'm really
not sure what a random number generator physically is it's a presumably a mini computer correct and
what is the actual product but you know what and what form does the number remember so my model
about hollow movement at the implement order is that it's the changing relatedness of formed patterns
but the formed patterns um it are of movement there there are cyclical synergic you know spins
or vibrations or progressions of energy uh through this spin foam so what does the
random number generator do it produces streams of noughts and ones and noughts and ones
and these are either totally random as the pattern you get or in fact they're less random
they have structure in them and the structure it seems to be given a remotely uh and there is a
space is is not carted and uh um okay the thing the thing so as you were telling you know your
story describing the situation what popped into my mind was the time when i was using the yicheng
and thinking about divination and there are the settings and religious settings in which people
tried to divine um what is the dynamic that's going on in hollow movement uh or in the implicate order
and i came to think that there really there's no need to use sticks and stones to do that um
you know if our hearts are open to a relationship with the implicate order we should be able to
increase our sensitivities enough to be able to discern intuitively you know wise courses of action
now i'm just wondering whether you're describing the opposite you know which is that if i have
made a relationship with uh an electronic random number generator right that that relationship
with it actually brings my heart level values and here i would say rather my thoughts i'm
repeatedly going to come back to my values we would bring my values into a dynamic relationship
with whatever the um the quantum level substance of your random number generator is i can't really
be more precise i wonder whether there's a form there's a form of entangled one going on here yes
thank you that's probably a helpful word there yeah um yes because in other words you you become
somehow related to the dynamics of the system which you aren't initially um but you've become so
through interacting yes it's a little bit like the biotech system but if you if you have a belief
that this random number generator is something you can have a relationship with then perhaps you can
that i think is an interesting premise because and in fact so i think i think i'm right in saying
peter that the the skeptics trying to do this often have um negative correlations
yes there we go we create our own realities yeah you see that's really interesting okay peter thanks
so much let's go on to actually before i go on to bernard that's one more question from craig
about um the comparison of your triquetras with trefoil knots yes and and he did a bit about that
so maybe you could just say a little bit about that yes we looked at that the first um computer
assisted design um models that we were making uh the guy who was doing it uh it assumed that i
was talking about a trefoil and the the mathematics of a trefoil has been extremely well worked out
they know all the formula of the different curves um obvious and so he thought well this is simple
we just string trefoils together and it just didn't work at all but the reason being that a
trefoil the what is a point on a triquetra is an angle that turns internally or becomes a ligand
that extends into the neighboring uh triquetra right it's a movement that either angles in on
itself and reflects internally or it becomes part of a synergy with an entangled one now trefoil
that angle is actually a curve now it's more like a ribbon that called curves around and
goes back in and it definitely is the same sort of eternal movement there's no question of that
you know that they're both describing eternal movement but the trefoil doesn't include within
it a model by which it can entangle and we proved that because we tried and found good
okay i think we'll just leave it at that because we're going to have 10 minutes or so and there's
still people in the queue thank you and it's our president bernard car next all right hello bernard
hello trevor uh trevor thank you i enjoyed your talk very much um but there was quite a lot to
take in and i don't understand all of it so um but and so i was particularly interested of course in
the emphasis you put on the triquetra and all these beautiful diagrams um i really of course i'm
aware of triquetra in as a sort of Celtic symbol but i hadn't seen it applied in all these ways and
i really like the way you're applying it in all these different contexts both in as a representation
of particle physics the representation of the brain a representation of relationships it's also
reminded me a bit of dna and i was wondering why if you could apply it to life in some sense you
know but that's that could be a big question but the more specific question was being a physicist
of course i was particularly interested in what you said in terms of its relationship to string
theory really and quantum gravity and you made references to spin foam but i couldn't quite
work out to what extent you've really worked this out as a physical theory um and to what
it says it's just sort of um a qualitative discussion have you have you had any feedback
from string theorists on this sort of a right no you've put your finger on the issue here
because uh remember i'm starting from a neurophysiological angle yeah i'm starting from the
level of human dynamics of systems of people and the way they communicate and how they get into
habits and routines and so on how you can break those habits and i've described in that
principles of organization that's the key term and then realize that those principles scale up
and scale down and of course my studies have taken me scaling down into cellular chemistry
macromolecular chemistry atomic and quantum i am new to everybody's new to it really aren't we
were all guessing our way through it but what i'm saying my theory or my hypothesis is that these
principles of organization the brain has evolved to engage with so that we can have
consistent social relationships yeah that's the theory that same set of principles can scale
right down into an implicate order with entanglements that is a an order of movement
which comes below the level of any it's itty bitty you know building block yeah that it is
the movement this primary that as those entangle because of the sine wave ligands that form between
them it generates the three dimensions of space yeah it actually generates those but then where
you get it stringing out into a long what i call a triquetral wave just like a slinky you can get a
fourth dimension wave moving along it yeah that's the that's so if the stable domain curls into a
particle which is held together by internal waves you can get a vibration of that particle that's a
fifth dimension you can get vibrations between particles that's a sixth dimension any ligand
can spin that's a seventh dimension i don't know no here i'm guessing so you're absolutely right
this is a qualitative model at the moment and my i set off once i was working on it i set off on a
search to find a quantum physicist who would help me to apply their mathematics to this model to see
that if it if it does match experimental findings uh and so we can then modify it according to
experimental findings and i will simply say over a year's search i have not found a single
uh quantum physicist who's willing to talk to me so maybe you've got celios we'll talk to you
well yeah i love to i i want to search for one uh but but it needs to you know this is very much
angular um angular mechanics and so on it's the whole lot is curving all the time yeah well of
course i'm very fascinated also with with what you just said about the link with dimensions and
indeed the links with hard dimensions which is one of my own interests i just one little point you
may the beginning which i sort of disagree with which i'll just say very quickly um when you talked
about the link between open systems and the acceleration of the universe i wasn't really
convinced by that because it is true of course that the universe is accelerating but i mean even
if the universe wasn't accelerating um you still have this concept that you can violate the second
law of thermodynamics because of you know chaos theory and things nonlinear effects because you
can you can locally form ever-increasing levels of complexity simply because you're not violating the
second law of thermodynamics globally because you know it's just a small fraction of the universe
involved in these this increasing structure so i wasn't really convinced by that argument in
other words even if the universe hadn't been accelerating i reckon your your your argument
would still go through well that's helpful thank you bernard because that would fit with the way
um i again we're not going to have time to go into this now but again in the book i do but uh
but it's i actually believe that an extending tripery for a wave moving into nothingness can
actually induce movement in nothingness right and we can actually and we actually could look at
the process of continuous creation uh through that sort of dynamic that's changing never mind
the details of that becomes back down to another couple of zen paradoxes in the way that that all
works um but what you're saying is that yes at any locality yeah at at any locality that same dynamic
could be happening and that is why the universe would be expanding at an ever-increasing rate
because it is also happening in micro-localities yeah that's that's how the expansion is happening
at an increasing rate because it's happening everywhere so i totally in agreement with you
that yes that the the chaos the complexity principles um can scale up in in any locality
and the problem is when mentally we make closed systems and believe we can experiment on it
right and that that experiment tells us the truth it doesn't it tells us what goes on
in the closed system that we've created yes i i think we've we've only got five minutes left
i think that it would be well worth trying to develop this in within the context of a working
group within the Galileo Commission and Vasilio can be in touch about this because i think there's
there's a lot of very interesting detail to be worked out here and which really needs a much
more extended conversation than than we're able to have in in this context of some kind of questions
and answers well David thank you very much yes yeah so i mean Jerome sent a message to me saying
does it need a um a special interest group but i think it's probably more within the Galileo
Commission and and so i'll put you and Vasilio in touch um to talk about that Bernard thank you
very much indeed yes thank you Bernard uh Trevor thank you very much it's been incredibly rich
evening and also from the the questions um a couple of points one i'm i'm put in mind of
Gregory Bateson pattern that connects oh yes yes i mean his it's always worth going back to
Gregory Bateson because his he has actually incredibly fertile so amazing absolutely and
so i'm sure you'll find new new connections there and then the other the other observation is
is the relationship between the implicate and the implicit and and the tacit
sorry Sheila we we haven't got time for any further questions and the the as as with David
Boehm the the implicate or the implicit is what's unfolded or tacit and i'm using tacit in the sense
of the Michael Polanyi's know the tacit dimension the tacit and the explicit and and so when we
David Boehm talks about this when we explain something we unfold it into the explicate order
because to explain literally means to unfold explicary and and i i i think this whole metaphor
of implicit explicit implicate explicate is extraordinarily fruitful and what you've done
is to multiply its dimensions and put it into a variety of contexts which i think is extremely
fertile and and what i also very much like which is something we all need to do and again Ian
McGilchrist does this in his new book primacy of process primacy of relationship primacy of
betweenness and we got so used to our sort of subject predicate and their distinction our
dualistic in a in a mind matter and that way even our language and logic is structured and so that
you've got subject and predicate and Boehm kept on saying what about the verb the verb the
dynamism of the verb is in fact the most important element in a defining relationship between the
subject and the predicate and Rick Tarnas is very good on explaining the origins of this it is
book they they make the passion the western mind their background arestiful and arestiful codified
greek logics absolutely fascinating i haven't read it for years but it just sort of came to mind
and so as i say i think let's let's get a group going within the Galileo commission
i think you've sent some resources i know there are some people who will very much want to be
in touch with you personally and and we'll take it forward from there so thank you very much again
thank you all for coming thank you for the questions thank you Jerome for the backup and
all that goes on behind the scenes to make these webinars possible and thank you again
