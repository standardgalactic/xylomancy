I've seen a hundred grand in cash I've took the trip to hell and back
I've been around every time nothing like you And I've seen lights up in the sky
And I've seen ghosts alone at night I've seen some things but they were nothing like
Till I walk through walls Till I walk through walls
I wanna be with you, cause I'm me with you
I've seen things I swear to God that I still can't explain
I've been way too drunk and way too happy Dancing in the rain
I've seen butterflies and babies crying Still until this day
Ain't see nothing it's quite like you Till I'm a ghost
I'm a ghost I'll give all my life to you
And when I'm a ghost I will always be your ghost
I've seen the country far and wide I meet my heroes all the time
I've been around every time nothing like you And I've held diamonds in my hands
I've got a couple million fans I met some folks but they were nothing like
Till I walk through walls Till I walk through walls
I wanna be with you, cause I'm me with you
I've seen things I swear to God that I still can't believe
I've seen shooting stars and crystal balls And magic in the breeze
I've seen Paris, I've seen London I have been weak in the knees
Ain't see nothing it's quite like you Till I'm a ghost
I'll give all my life to you And when I'm a ghost
I will always be your ghost
Till it burns down till the world ends Till it's all gone till my last breath
Till I leave town till there's nothing left Till I'm in the ground
Till I'm a ghost I'll give all my life to you
And when I'm a ghost I will always be your ghost
Till I'm a ghost I'll give all my life to you
And when I'm a ghost I will always be your ghost
I'll give all my life to you
