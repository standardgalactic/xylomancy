You know, Silicon Valley has these boom and bust cycles.
And but now everyone's coming back.
And it turns out that this area in Hayes Valley,
which is just sort of in the center of the San Francisco area,
is being a magnet for all this AI activity.
It feels like people are talking again,
they're meeting again, they're having parties again.
It's happening in person.
And that really changes things for people
in terms of how fast they think,
how they learn about KPIs,
and that sort of old magic that we had
before seems to be coming back.
We have about 100 people out here today after hours,
after work hours.
It's meeting up at Salesforce Park here,
talking about the Chad GPT-4 usage
that's not accessible for the Chad GPT-plus subscription
and some implications with the research.
It's a San Francisco party.
New Texas drops and we go for it.
Right now in the last six months
while we've been watching this is
the founders have jumped on this new powerful engine.
It's like someone gave them an internal combustion engine
and they thought, now what can I do with this?
And they've thought of cars,
they've thought of buses, they've thought of trucks.
But everybody's thought of cars and buses.
Everyone's come up with the same ideas
looking at these LLMs.
Every month we get these things together
because we want you guys to become friends.
And you're all here in the middle of it.
So it's your time to focus on your business ideas
and to move as fast as you can and not to let up.
People ask me how big is this?
And the context I like to look at it in
is that between 94 and 2020,
we went through what we're calling the connecting
where we got the world connected up
on the internet, mobile phones,
all these devices everywhere.
And so now we've got four billion people connected
and eventually it'll be everybody on the planet.
But that main 20 year, 25 year period
was when we connected the world and we were here for that.
And now we're entering the phase.
What we're thinking of is the transition
where we're gonna be adding sort of silicon-based life
to this planet.
So we're carbon-based life
and this stuff is gonna be thinking in,
I don't know, 80 years, 100 years.
But this is the beginning of that phase
where we actually see software and silicon
starting to do a lot of the cognitive work
that humans have done in the past.
And that's now beginning, we can see it.
We've been talking about it for 80 years,
but we can now see it.
And this is when it just started.
So it's a big deal, we're here for it.
And now it's up to us to be the first people
who start to get to build things with it.
How's it going?
Hi.
Hey, hey.
How's it going?
Good, how are you?
Good.
How are you?
And vision a world where people could just build shit
and not have to worry about anything else.
And hackathons give that to you for a weekend
and it's like, it's so good, but it's just a weekend
and then it's over.
And so I was constantly,
I was always in the middle of the day,
and I was like, oh, I'm gonna get this.
I'm gonna get this.
It's like, oh, I'm gonna get this.
I'm gonna get this.
It's a weekend and then it's over.
And so I was constantly trying to find
the next hackathon, the next hackathon, the next.
And there weren't that many back then.
I started going to hackathons in like 2011.
The vision that whole time was like,
this world where you can just build
and not have to worry about anything else.
And that was the birth of H.O. Zero.
So the idea is that we create something
where people never actually have to leave
or think about anything else.
But when people are in this container
and they're surrounded by other people
who are pushing the limits of how fast you can move
and what's possible to build,
like we just see founders move at a pace
that I've never seen before.
Two, or there are three floors here across the basement.
We have like 16 founders here,
and then we also have three guest rooms.
We call them visiting hackers.
So they come for three nights.
They're typically also founders building in the AI space
or anything else.
But the setup is just like a bunch of trailing ones
and a bunch of, hello.
But yeah, now I don't know what's popular.
We both have a background in productizing,
cutting edge papers and tech.
So if you ask us this question in a month or so,
we might give you a slightly different answer.
But right now, a drip is a pipeline
that allows you to generate stylized videos
just from your phone.
So with a few taps and a prompt input,
you can make yourself a pirate or recast your room
as an outer space, things like that.
You can see the majority of the innovation
happening on the image space
are actually happening all over the place.
Sure, Google might publish a paper opening.
I might have a model, but everyone else can do that too.
There's stuff coming out of Berkeley, Stanford,
all the time.
You know, I thought that a lot of things were gonna take years.
Like I thought multimodal input that GPT-4 just showed off
would maybe be another year out.
But so I, maybe I just shouldn't make these predictions.
All right, and now I think they're recording.
There are people that worry that's gonna take their jobs.
I don't think it's gonna take people's jobs
for a long, long time.
I don't know how many decades,
but all it's gonna do right now is augment our jobs.
There's just gonna be more and better of everything,
more and better art, more and better text,
more and better analysis.
And it's just gonna accelerate the pace of everything.
It's gonna be a companion to us
in our scientific research in 10 or 15 or 20 years.
It's gonna allow science to move forward faster,
to have scientists to do more and expand into more areas.
So I would just drop everything and focus
on what you can do newly with generative AI.
We are, we've created our hack week
and everyone in our company is tasked
with bringing AI into their job.
And you should do that with your company
and whatever company you've got going
or you're thinking of building,
have that mindset because now's the time,
you only get this every 14 years, take advantage of it.
In the 1987 book from Apple,
they say when you're doing an interface,
you should make it such that it's like people can play with it.
It's a playful interface.
Because the way users learn how to use your product,
it's the same way we all learn to do anything.
Yeah, maybe I can do it from here.
The thing that we do love is like what?
We are heavy users of this amazing technology.
It helps us be way more productive, especially at 3 a.m.
I think that one of the main things
that are going to change with generative AI
is the way how we interact with technology.
And the interactions are going to become way deeper.
And they are going to resemble more how we interact with the human
than how we interact with an object.
In our case, since we are interested in creativity
and we are building a creative tool,
I've got an analogy to look at this.
In 87, Photoshop started to appear too
and at that moment we created like a certain
interface to paint with pixels.
We have like some sort of digital paper.
How do we paint here?
What is it going to be the interface?
That UX didn't change in 30 or 40 years.
If you look at the evolution of Photoshop,
it's kind of the same thing.
So we kind of found the UX for painting with a digital brush.
So that is kind of our vision to find the right UX
for creative people to interact with AI effectively.
This is the first product that we were talking about before.
It's a Prom Search engine.
All of these images that you see here
have been generated with AI.
But as we got into HFZ, we started to realize
that was not the way to create a startup.
Because for a startup, you need to have a user.
You need to have a customer.
You need to think about the problem that you are solving
and someone needs to pay you.
So what we found out is that this thing that we had,
it was like extremely powerful,
but just for like a extremely small group of people
that were super interested in this technology.
That's how the first product came.
The new thing is the CREA canvas,
which is the product that we've been working on
for the past four months.
It's a collaborative whiteboard
that is focused on using artificial intelligence
for prototyping visual ideas.
I'm working with both like Erwan and Diego.
Are you stealing whiteboards?
And maybe.
Are you stealing whiteboards?
All of these are different artificial intelligence models.
Each one is focused on a specific style.
It makes it really easy to create mood boards.
Yeah, with the images that you generate.
Chat GPD was not like any crazy breakthrough.
It was just like a chat bot,
something that everybody knows how to use.
You use WhatsApp, you use Telegram.
Instead of talking with another human,
you're talking with an AI.
Even my mom can access the state of the art
of artificial intelligence in 2023.
Really shows how important it is
to make these tools accessible
because they can do amazing things,
but people need to have tools to use them.
It was like canvas, get active object,
and then for each object, clone it.
And then I can do like object that clone this thing,
grab the clone, and then it's like,
okay, what do you want to do with the clone?
There you go.
I now spend my time thinking instead of typing.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Come in.
Great, thank you.
Yeah, so right now we are launching this,
the new product with GenerATBI
to help brands create like marketing images
with just simple descriptions and simple scene builders.
Me and my co-founder were both from Ukraine.
The team was distributed after the COVID hit.
We started hiring remotely.
Because before that, we had all the team in Kiev.
Everybody got distributed.
I moved here, so that is very exciting.
Right now, with the new GenerATBI,
a lot of the output and the quality of generated image
actually lies on the user,
on the quality of what they write there.
And so we were testing a lot of hypotheses
on how we can explain to user what to do,
how we can give this perfect instruction,
how we can help brands tell their stories,
how we can help brands tell their stories,
better with EI.
EI is the new electricity,
because it will power everything,
business processes, data.
It requires some effort to keep up with the space,
which is challenging,
but also focus on your users
and not get distracted by the noise.
What eventually what matters is
if you build the product that people want or not.
And that requires some concentration
and calm mind and just focus on your customers.
It's a little bit of a challenge to move to a new country,
but San Francisco is very welcoming
to people from different backgrounds,
so I don't feel, I feel very included here.
It takes some time to build a network for sure.
It was a little bit of a challenge,
but right now we have like 10 events per week.
Everybody's excited and everybody's very open.
What if you decided that you have
400,000 data analysts in a warehouse,
air-conditioned warehouse,
ready to do work for you right now?
How would things change?
How would that be different?
What would be possible?
This will be the greatest technology
humanity has yet developed.
The world is new again
for the first time in 14 years,
and there's so much opportunities.
You have to be able to throw out what was old,
and you have to be able to think big,
and you have to realize that
there's going to be different mental patterns
and feel comfortable with those different mental patterns,
and that's where you're going to get your visionary founders.
It has come out of decades of research
into the algorithms to manage data,
but now we've just reached a point
where the processing storage
and the processing speed and all that
has allowed us to put these large language models together
to do things that are really amazing
in the same way that the smartphone was amazing,
in the same way that the internet itself was amazing,
and it's just going to touch every industry.
