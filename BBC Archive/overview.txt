Checking BBC Archive/1977： Original STAR WARS Review ｜ Film 77 ｜ Classic Movie Review ｜ BBC Archive.txt
 The passage discusses the anticipation and excitement surrounding the release of "Star Wars" in London, particularly as a family entertainment spectacle that surpassed all expectations, becoming the biggest box-office hit in cinema history within just a few months of its American release. The film's success is attributed to its ability to blend various classic themes of adventure and romance, from Arabian Nights to Westerns, and from knightly tales to science fiction and space fantasy.

Alec Guinness plays a significant role as an elderly wise man in the space age, while Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher's daughter, Carrie Fisher, are among the juvenile leads. However, the real stars of the film are the two droids, C3PO and R2D2. Despite its overwhelming success, "Star Wars" was initially rejected by two studios before being produced by 20th Century Fox with modest funding. The film's production, particularly the special effects, relied heavily on British technicians at Elstree Studios.

The passage notes the irony that while the film's success could have benefited the UK's film industry, none of the monstrous profits will likely support it. It also mentions the anticipation for the subsequent wave of commercial spin-offs, including toys, clothing, and other merchandise inspired by the film's characters and themes.

George Lucas, the writer and director of "Star Wars," spent years perfecting the script, which captures a sense of nostalgia for classic Saturday morning matinees. Lucas is recognized for his previous work, "American Graffiti," but "Star Wars" has significantly elevated his status and wealth. The passage concludes with a mix of admiration and playful envy for Lucas's success, highlighting his talent as a director.

In summary, "Star Wars" is celebrated for its groundbreaking blend of genres and themes, its impressive box-office performance, and the contribution of George Lucas as both writer and director. The anticipation for its release in London is high, with expectations for it to be a landmark event in family entertainment.
