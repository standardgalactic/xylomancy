You
Have a bell sweet silver bells all seem to say throw cares away Christmas is here bringing a cheer to young and old me
Can the bold ding-dong-dong that is our song with joyful ring all caroling one seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere
Fill in the air. Oh, how's it pound raising the sound of
Songs of good cheer this missus here
I am a
Wayfaring stranger
While traveling through
This world of war
Yet, there's no
Sickness or danger
In that bright
Which I
We
See my mother she said she'd meet me when I come
I'm just a goal
When over Jordan I'm just a goal
When over
I'm just to go in
Oh
In the church
In
My great
To sing His praise forevermore
I'm just a going over Jordan
I'm just a going over
I'm just a going over home
To every home
Over home
I'm just a going over home
To every home
Hear the melody that's playing
There's no time to waste
There's so much to celebrate
