 It appears that you've provided a series of identical sentences intended to introduce the beginning of a video or presentation. The common phrase "So, let's get started" is repeated multiple times, likely as a placeholder or by mistake. The underlying message is a cue to the audience that the presenter is ready to begin the content proper and that the audience can expect to engage with the material in the upcoming segment of the video. If this is meant to be a script for an actual video, the appropriate summary would be:

The speaker introduces the end of a preceding segment and transitions into the main content of the video by inviting the viewer to begin the journey or exploration together with a repeated prompt to "get started." This is done multiple times, possibly as a deliberate stylistic choice or due to technical reasons. The speaker then proceeds to the actual content of the video after these introductory statements.
