I'm talking today about phenomenology. Now, today in my professional life, I spend a lot
of time doing formal ontology, which is very closely related to a non-phenomenological kind
of philosophy called the analytic philosophy, logical philosophy. For a long time in my
life, I worth one phenomenology. And this is what this is about. And so it has a kind of,
I wouldn't say oldy, worldly flavor, although it does go back 50 years. But it does deal with some
of the reasons why my life progressed phenomenologically as it did. So it started with the very first
philosophy book that I had in my hands in school, which was Wittgenstein's Traptators. I was about
to go to university to study mathematics. Wittgenstein's Traptators convinced me that I should
study mathematics and philosophy. And I did this in Oxford for three years. So I was at Jesus
College, which is somewhere at the back there. I was there for three years as an undergraduate. And
the one person who really influenced me was Michael Dumit, who is a specialist on Frege and on a
view of analytic philosophy as rooted not just in Frege's ideas, but in the idea that studying
language could be the key tool to unlock philosophical problems. And during my stay in Oxford, I had
dreams of writing a PhD. My goal was to write a PhD on the aesthetics of mathematics. So the idea
would be that mathematical theorems or chess games or musical works can have aesthetic properties.
I did end up writing a PhD thesis, but it was about something quite different. And my change
came about by accident. Roman Ingaarden was the key. And this book changed my plans.
All right, then I moved to the University of Manchester, which is where I lived,
and which was the only place in England at that time where you could study phenomenology.
I was a student working, well, on my thesis, which is called, I used a typewriter. If I made any
mistakes, I had to write out top copy and the carbon copy. It's 600 and something pages long.
I didn't know what hellish waste of time I was going through because we didn't have computers in
those days. And it's about Hossel, Frege, Dumit and Mino. But it's about ontology in the classical
philosophical sense. It's about how these people study beings, entities formally. And during that
time, I met two philosophers, philosophy students, who were also doing a PhD in Manchester at the
same time. Peter Simons became quite famous in various universities. He finished in Trinity College,
Dublin. And Kevin finished and hasn't quite finished yet in the University of Geneva. So
all right, this is Manchester. After my PhD, I moved to a postdoc in another Northern English
University. And then I moved back to Manchester as a faculty member. I inherited the position of my
PhD supervisor who retired. So I was responsible for phenomenology in the philosophy department
in Manchester, which is very much dominated by what we might call Americans. Americans are of
two types. On the one hand, there are Americans who do American philosophy. And then on the other
hand, there are English people who do American philosophy. I was the only person doing philosophy
in a European sense. So Peter and Kevin and I published a lot together. We worked a lot together.
We organized many meetings together and we changed the world. This was one of the papers,
which was quite successful and still successful. There's a whole industry of truth making,
which we more or less initiated in 1984. And on my door in the philosophy department in Manchester,
I had this sign to indicate that you were now going into the world of European philosophy.
This comes from the Berlin Wall. I guess you all know what the Berlin Wall is.
Checkpoint, Charlie, and all that. The centre of all of this work with Peter and Kevin was not
Ingaarden, but Ingaarden's teacher, Khosa, who was the founder of phenomenology,
and who was born in Austria, Hungary. And a lot of the work I did subsequently between 1990 and
2000 or 1918, 2000, was it about Austro-Hungarian philosophy, including Khosa. Normally counted
as a German philosophy, because he spent his mature life in Germany, but he was born in Austria,
Hungary, and like many of the other people I'm going to talk about, even the Poles I'm going
to talk about, they were born in Austria too. And they were certainly not part of Poland because
Poland didn't exist. All right, so formal ontology. The term comes from Hussar's logical
investigations, and both Peter and Kevin and I thought that Hussar's logical investigations
and specifically the logical investigation number three on the theory of holes and parts
was the key to doing good philosophy. So we thought that many of the targets of analytic
philosophy were important to work on, but the proper method was to be found in Hussar. So this
is the first formal theory of Mariology, theory of parts and parts. And more generally, it presents
something called formal ontology, which is the theory of ontological structures,
which are formal in the sense that they are domain neutral, not material in the sense of being
related to matter, but material in the sense of being domain, non-neutral, domain specific.
And relations like part whole, instance of, and so forth, are formal relations.
All right, so these are the main parts of Hussar's formal ontology. He was very keen on the idea of
a theory of dependence relations and theories of boundaries and continuities, topology,
and then theories of instantiation of species and lowest specific differences and so forth.
So this is pretty old fashioned in the sense that most of it is found in some form in an Aristotle,
but Hussar saw, and Hussar was originally a mathematician, saw that you could treat these
kinds of issues in a formal way in the sense of that mathematics also is formed. So formal logic,
formal ontology, and formal axiology, which also dealt with the role very much related to mathematics.
Thirty years later, probably in Italy, but that's neither here nor there,
I created something called basic formal ontology. And this has become very important. This is what
I work on all the time now. And this includes all of the things that Hussar thought were important
parts of formal ontology, together with a much more specific treatment of spacetime of processes
and of what we call realizable entities, which means dispositions, powers, functions, roles,
and so forth. So basic formal ontology is very much rooted in Hussar's logical investigations.
And it adds these particular ingredients. The idea is to create a top level ontology, which
will not merely be domain neutral, but will be domain all encompassing. In other words, every
formal ontological need of any ontology will be met by BFO. I don't claim that is the case yet,
but it will be the case maybe in 50 years. So it's hard work. All right, so we have formal ontology,
which deals with the interconnections of things. And we have formal logic, which deals with the
interconnections of truths. And that too corresponds broadly with Hussar's account of the relation.
He was not always clear when he was using the word formal to distinguish formal ontology and
formal logic. But this corresponds to the view, the general view, who is presenting in the logical
investigations. And so these are ontological structures. So that's John and that's Mary,
and they are independent entities. So they're not dependent on anything else in the sense of
dependent, which Hussar was talking about. But they are in love with each other. And so there is a
relational quality of love, which is symmetric, which is one sidedly dependent on John and
one sidedly dependent on Mary. And we represent that in this way. So dependent entities have dotted
lines and independent entities have solid lines and relations are captured, representationally
by using single lines connecting boxes. And here we see two kinds of relations.
Dependence relations are what we can think of as thin relations. And love and hate and
marriage and magnetic attraction are thick relations. They have empirical properties of
various sorts. And there is a third kind of relation, which are comparative, such as being
taller than. But in any case, there's more than one kind of relation. In predicate logic, of course,
people don't realize that. And so one of the activities that we engaged in during this period
was attacking analytic philosophers because they thought that predicate logic gave you a key
to creating a mirror of the universe. And they got it wrong. Hussar and Aristotle came closer
to getting it wrong. All right, so that's a relation. And then we can have also two sided
mutual dependence. And well, we'll give some examples of this later on. But you can see how
these kinds of diagrams can grow to deal with more complicated entities. Maybe this is the
marriage bond between John and Mary. And then Mary has a claim on John and John has an obligation
to marry that kind of thing. Then the claim and the obligation will be mutually dependent.
We'll come back to these things later on. And then we can illustrate part whole relations.
So love may include going on holiday. You go on holiday together. And that would be a part of
the general relation of love in this particular case. Although that example is not a very good one.
All right, so now we get to the structure of the universe. So Hussar's idea is that there are
relations which we find in the universe, which are essential relations. Now again, Aristotle saw
this story. This is not really anything new. But dependence relations are essential relations
in this sense. And there are laws of essence, which capture these necessary relations and
dependence between the love of John for Mary and John is an essential relation. A love cannot exist
without a lover, a subject. That's an essential relation called necessitation. If love exists,
then there is some lover, not necessarily to, but in the happy instances that it will go in both
ways. To say that love is compatible with kindness is to express an essential relation. To say that
love is incompatible with plotting to murder is another example, maybe one of these essential
relations. And similar, that means that love excludes plotting to murder. So we have here
some, again, not very good examples of laws of essence. And this is going to play an important
role in the whole of the phenomenon. And Kit Van, who is the world's greatest living metaphysician.
All right. So all of this is being represented, practiced, formulated in German. And so we have
a very important word, Wesenstesamann, which means something like essential structure or essential
configuration. And Wesenstes Gazette, which means essential law, that we are interested in the
Wesenstesamann-Hinger, the essential structures. And we don't call them essential structures.
When I say, we know, I need your slant paper myself, we're working on mathematics and physics
ontology. There are essential structures in those domains. But the word, if the phrase essential
structure doesn't work quite so well, as Wesenstesamann, particularly if you're German.
All right. Now, so we have formal ontological relations like dependence. And we also have
formal ontological categories, which correspond to material ontological categories or domain
specific categories such as rabbit or mammal or cell. But they're all formal. And these are the
main examples mentioned by Husser, object state of affairs and so on. And you can put these together
in law governed ways. For instance, you can create object aggregates, or you can create
state of affairs by taking an object in the property. You say the property of this object,
or this object has this property, that is a state of affairs.
So now, formal ontology is like formal logic. Once we've grasped a formal structure,
in one instance, we have grasped it for every instance. That's why logic is so powerful. That's
why mathematics is so powerful. Formal ontology is similarly powerful. That's why BFO is so powerful.
And we've, we ain't seen nothing yet. All right. Now, compare it as the epic. And this is a phrase
from Husser, if the relevant formal ontology has been worked out, an old deductive theoretical
work in the building up of all actual theories in the same form has been done. So I've said that.
And we've said that. And we've said that. And now we can, we come to definitions. Now,
Husser, Aristotle had an idea of definitions. And we have to remember that all sciences,
including the science of definitions are perfect to the extent that Aristotle treated
of them. So here Bonaventure is just explicating what Aristotle would have said. If we want a
definition, we want to explicate the meanings of terms. And we succeed when the intellect can use
the definition to grasp, comprehend what a thing is. In other words, what type of thing a thing is.
But definitions are constructed by use, using more universal terms. So a cat is an object,
which is a mammal, which is, I don't wish me out. I don't know. A human is a substance,
which is an animal and is ration. We always go to a higher level to form, make a definition.
This was the rule for making definitions in terms of the, including genus, plus the specific
difference, which makes the term you're defining refer to those things which fall under the
species term rather than the genus term. So what makes a human different from an animal is that
the human has a specific difference in being rationed, according to Aristotle, in some places.
In other places, he has a different stroke. So, but definitions are constructed by using
more universal terms. And these are defined by still more universal terms until we come to the
highest and most universal. And we can't define them because we're already at the top. And this
is where this is where the top was for Aristotle. And this is where the top and basic formal ontology
is named after this passage in the third logical investigation, where Hilsa was the first person
ever to use the phrase formal ontology. So this is where the top ends, really. This is Aristotle
plus some more things. This is one quarter of BFO minus all the relations. All right. And this is
the ISO standard. Aristotle didn't get to the point where he had an ISO standard. All right.
These are now some of the examples of some 400 or so domain ontologies, which are defined into
domain specific ontologies defined in the Saint Bonaventure Aristotelian way on the basis of BFO.
And mental functioning ontology takes BFO and then adds more terms in roughly this kind of way.
And the emotional ontology takes the mental functioning ontology and adds yet more terms
to create an ontology of the different aspects of emotions, not kinds, but aspects, because
every emotion involves a physiological response. Every emotion involves an emotional action tendency
and so on. And these are some examples of these aspects of emotions in the emotional ontology.
So muscles becoming tense or feeling weak and sweating. All right. Now, so we've had this.
All of this was happening in Germany to some degree in Austria, as we will see later. Some
degree even in Poland during the 1900s to 1930, but already much earlier, parallel
things were going on in Austria. And I wrote a book about some of these things
in the realm of economics. And there are quite close relations between Austrian philosophy on
the one hand and Austrian economics, partly because some of them lived in the same building
or had cousins who were married to each other. All right. No, the cousins were not married.
All right. So Karl Manger was the founder of a school called the Austrian School of Economics,
which still exists today. There are still whole sections of economics departments, for instance,
in New York University, which are devoted to this school. It's meant to be a counter to the
Keynesian classical or neoclassical schools of economics. And the original versions of
Austrian economics were about laws of essence or Wesen's Gazette in the realm of economics.
And this is an example. A good exists only if simultaneously we have a need, a causal connection
to the satisfaction of this need, a knowledge of this causal connection, and a command over
the theme sufficient to direct it to satisfy the need. And Manger wrote whole books based upon
this kind of essential analysis, which is an analysis of part whole relations about as well
as dependence relations. So it's very much in the spirit of Hossel. So the goal of research
in economics can only be the determination of the general essence and the general connection
of economic phenomena. And these essences are things like buying, selling, ordering, contracting,
and so forth. And in the 20th century, Ludwig von Mises became even more famous than Manger.
He thought that all of economics could be captured in one single axiom, which is the axiom of man
acts. And if you know what acting is, then you know everything about preferences and so forth.
And I don't think that Mises was quite right. But I think that the a prioristic view of economics
has a lot to be said in its favor. And I tried to express these things in this paper.
Murray Rothbard was a famous third generation member of this school. And he actually wrote a
very kind and friendly review of the book on Austrian philosophy, which I showed you.
And, and then there is Herman Hoppe, who is a very interesting, strange case.
I don't think I'm going to tell any jokes about Herman Hoppe. Although he's not I like him,
he's a nice man, but there are too many things you can make jokes about. So one of his books is
a defensive monarchy. She is, of course, correct, but you shouldn't say that. All right, now,
what we're really interested in is something which I call the Munich Göttingen-Krakow school.
And it's sometimes just called the Munich school. If you're being really clever, it's called the
Munich Göttingen school. But I call it Munich Göttingen-Krakow school or Krakow. And the
Munich school began in Munich. And some of the leading members of the Munich school are listed
here. There are there are several others of equal importance, but I'm going to be focusing on these
people. And then we move into Poland. So Herman Ingarn was a member of the Munich school who then
reconstituted it in Poland. And Karol Wojtyła is a, so in German, you can put the end of the sentence,
you can't do that here. Karol Wojtyła was a friend of Roman Ingarn and also a philosopher,
also very closely connected to Max Schäger, who's another member of the Munich school,
but we'll come back to him in a minute. All right, so they extended Hossal's formal ontology
to create material ontologies, just like all of these people are doing BFO.
So they worked on, usually on quite philosophical topics, but Reiner, for instance, worked on law.
Enid Stein worked on the state. Ingarn worked on art and many other things. And Wojtyła worked
on things like freedom and conscience and religion, I'm told. All right, so
and Hossal hated it. So he said it was picture book phenomenology. This is not real philosophy.
Who cares about whether it's real philosophy? Nowadays, it's being shown to be quite practically
important. So he was a real admirer of Reiner, for instance, but he didn't like the Munich idea
that you can take a discipline and then subject it to essential analysis. So this is the Goettingen
score of the four important bits of it. Ingarn was in Goettingen, Enid Stein was in Goettingen,
serving as the slave of Hossal and Reiner. It makes him look a lot older, but he never became a lot
older. And then Krakow, we have this gentleman. And two of these people became saints.
Now, that's amazing. You have a rather small school of philosophy. And two of his members
became saints. And anyway, we'll come back to it. So these were very close friends, Ingarn and
Edith Stein were very close friends. There were other female members of the Munich school.
I'm not going to talk about them because there isn't time, but on many occasions during the
rest of these slides, and there are only about 300 of them, I'm going to use him.
And many of the slides were put together some years ago when we could say him. And many of
the people I'm citing also said him. But in many cases, I mean her or him.
So forgive me for the him, the repetitious use of the word him in what follows.
All right, so this is Edith Stein, otherwise known as Saint Therese, Benedicta Acroce.
She, she merited the recognition of her sainthood because of what she did in Auschwitz,
because she was a Jew. She had a rather bad time because she was female. This was a time when
females were not taken seriously in universities. But she was brilliant. And she wrote major parts
of some of herself major works. So she was his not slave is a bit unfair. But she never made
her his assistant in the way he would have made a male is assistant. And so there is a book
called walls are crumbling, which is about seven modern modern Jewish philosophical thinkers who
have turned to the Catholic faith. Now, in order to become a saint, you have to become Catholic.
That's taken for granted. We're going to be talking about four of these. And I own a copy of this
book, but I couldn't find it in time to work out what he says about hustle. But I do remember
what he says about Reiner. And I'm not sure if it's true. This picture was available on the web.
It's a picture of hustle, I think on his death bed. So Good Friday, what a wonderful day where
some of who sells last words. Yes, Christ has forgiven us everything. Now, I'm not sure that
that's true. I think that as right here, exaggerate. And you can make up for yourself,
make up your own mind. So this man was described by hustle as the phenomenologists, phenomenologists,
because he was a very good teacher, who knew hustle's ideas probably better than hustle himself.
And so people like Edith Stein and Inga became phenomenologists because of Reiner's fantastic
teaching capability. And he was a nice man, and part of a nice family. But then he was called up
to be a member of the German army in the First World War. So he died at the age of 34.
He published one major book before he died, and several very important essays. We've managed
to collect other writings and publish them. I was, well, we'll see
what I did in that regard in a minute. In this book, World's a Crumbling,
so his sister became a nun when Reiner died in the trench. He'd been communicating with his sister
with letters and his letters survived about faith and Christianity and so on. Reiner never became
a Catholic through proper process of conversion, but he was certainly a Christian. He was certainly
not a Jew. He was born a Jew. And so his sister became a nun. And you have to be a Catholic to
become a nun. And she was, I don't know the technical terms here, but she was admitted
into the convent by the Abbas with the following words. The Abbas knew Adolf.
Today, we shall receive unto our number someone who, even according to the flesh,
is a sister of our Lord. Now, this is like comparing Reiner to God. And maybe it happened,
but Erzach had said that. Now, Reiner was a proponent of phenomenological realism. And Reiner
has been taken more seriously in the French and Italian speaking world than in the English
speaking world, but we're catching up. And this is a book of Reiner's papers about
phenomenological realism. Now, you have to realize that to be an ontologist in the sense of
immunity school or in the sense of BFO, you have to be a realist. That is to say, you have to believe
you're describing the world and representing the essences or universals or kinds in the world.
And so the many phenomenologists were all realists. In around 1910, people say, Hossal fell on his head
and this damaged relevant brain circuits. And so from that point, they say he was an idealist.
He didn't believe in the real world anymore. Neither did his major followers. He became
a famous representative of the German tradition of transcendental philosophy. So he was like Hegel
or Kant and so forth. He picks it himself now as a great man in German philosophy,
which he was able to do even though he was Jewish at that time because people didn't care.
They did later. And so he really was treated as a great German philosopher by the German
philosophers at the time and by the realist philosophers at the time. But they
argued with each other. And so there was a kind of interchange, a dialectic between the realists,
particularly Inga who wrote several major works on this topic and Hossal who tried to fight back.
In a way, the realists lost in the sense that they never convinced Hossal to go back to being
a realist. But they won in the sense that they created a lot of very good ontology,
which we will talk about in a minute. Reine's principle,
in the sense of most well-recognized contribution was to invent or formulate for the first time
in an extended way the theory of speech acts. So normally people think of that theory as having
been invented by Austen and Searle. The first hints of theory along these lines can be found
much earlier. In Thomas Reid, for instance, there are several passages which describe what later
became speech acts. Reiner has a whole monograph devoted to the topic. And it's a monograph which
is about what he calls the a priori foundations of the civil law. The a priori foundations of the
civil law are to be found in something like an analysis of the act of promising. And the act of
promising is the principle example in many of the papers in the Austen-Searle tradition about speech
acts. And so I, along with a German colleague of mine, a brilliant man who died, also died much
too young, edited the complete text critical edition of Reiner's works. It's 848 pages,
and it's the most honest thing I ever did in my life. So it really is a very, very scholarly piece
of work. We have a whole volume just to show all the changes, including misprints in different
editions and so forth. Because that's what the scholarly edition has to do. And if you don't do
that, someone else will have to do it later. So I spent some years devoting my life to Reiner.
I was one of the few people who were attempting to show to the world that Reiner had interesting
things to say, and that the whole tradition of analytic philosophy should be viewed in a new
light. So I asked Chat GPT about this content, whether we were successful. Is there a contemporary
reception of Reiner's philosophy? And so I asked this question twice. This is the first
answer, at least twice. Some notable philosophers who have engaged with Reiner's ontology of social
entities include John Searle. And then it says, Searle has been a prominent advocate for Reiner's
ontology of social entity. Now, I've talked to Searle on multiple occasions. If I even come
close to mentioning the name Reiner, he gets angry. He hates the idea that Reiner would even exist,
because his wife also used to get angry. That would diminish the greatness of Searle. I like
Searle. I think it's fantastic. But this is a blatant lie. Similarly, Raimo Tuonella, who also
works on social ontology, he says, has also been influenced by Reiner's ontology of social entities.
That's just not true. Then it says Barry Smith, well, this is in bigger type here. Barry Smith
has been a critic of Reiner's ontology of social entities. That's disgustingly not true. And then
it says something rather bland about Kevin. Kevin has also engaged with Reiner's ontology. That's
true. But it's weak. Typically, chat GP team is weak when it says something which is true,
which isn't always the case. Then I asked it again. It says, again, it gives the absurd thesis
about Searle. Right, Searle was a very strong admirer of Reiner. I don't think he was heavily
influenced by Reiner. He was an admirer of Reiner, because Reiner was heavily influenced by him.
Shayla knew about Reiner. They were both members of the Meany School. I think this is just about
true. Searle, we dealt with. Charles Taylor has no idea who Reiner is. Rudolph Kana has absolutely
no idea of Reiner and wouldn't care. Then I try again. Now he mentions Ingaon, which is good,
but he mentions Daxun Falastal, who was quite an important analytic philosopher who wrote
a piece about Husser earlier on. But he never knew anything about Reiner. This is just typical
chat GPT lying. Then we asked it for a fourth time, and it gave this list. I mean, including
Emmanuel Levina. I don't even know who Giorgio Agamben is, but he sounds French.
I mean, French in the sense of bad French philosophy, not French in the sense of not being
Italian. Somebody called Jacques. This is a real mystery. None of these. Most of the people on
this list didn't know who Reiner was. Most of them would have hated the idea of Reiner's philosophy.
Why does chat GPT think that all, I don't know, 17 of these people have engaged with Reiner's
ontology of social entities? Well, I think the problem is Kevin. Kevin wrote a piece on, well,
Searle, Derrida and the ends of phenomenology, attacking many of the names on this list.
Chat GPT has this piece in its training material. Reiner, Derrida, same page. That means Derrida
must have influenced Reiner for something. Reiner was very clever. He knew how to read philosophy,
and he read Hume's treatise, and he realized that there was a mistake being made and still
being made today on part of people who are fans of Hume's philosophy. The one person who doesn't
make this mistake is George Davie, who I believe is now no longer alive, but he was a Scottish
philosopher. Hume was Scottish, but he was also interested in Hossal and Reiner. He wrote this
piece in which he explained that even Hume distinguished between the analytic and the
materially necessary. So in Reiner's terms, the relations between red and orange and red and
yellow. So red and orange are more closely resembling each other than red and yellow.
That is a material necessity. It's not the formal necessity, so it's not analytic.
It's a material necessity. Most people will tell you that there are no material necessities in Hume's
philosophy, but Reiner found passages in which Hume appeals to material necessities,
particularly passages where he's talking about sense-date. So if you're interested,
you can look at this piece by Davie, and that's Kant. That's Kant from a different angle.
And this is a very nice paper on this whole Munich phenomenology, and this is a passage
from this piece. So this man, Fréchette, who is French, but in a good way,
he has a very nice account of the essential structures, the work of the Munich phenomenologists,
and he points out that Kit Fein has rediscovered some of the
theses relating to essential structures and modality which were worked out by the
Munich phenomenologists 100 years earlier. All right, so just so that we all have the
same terminology, to say that something is a lack of analytic means that it's a truth of logic or
of mathematics, and it's a tautology. It doesn't add anything to what you said. Synthetic is a
truth with content, which means it's not reducible to any logical truth. A priori is a matter of
knowledge. To say that something is a priori is to say that it's known independently of experience,
and to say that it's a posteriori, a priori is to say that it's known by experience and had to
be known by experience. You couldn't know it by logic. And Hume is commonly held to believe that
everything a priori is also analytic. And the Munich philosophers like me and like many other
people hold that there are synthetic a priori truths. And the example of red is closer to
orange than it is to yellow is an example of one such truth, and we'll see many more
true window. And law is full of such truths. So for Kant, however, the synthetic a priori
truths can recognize synthetic a priori truths. He thought Hume made a mistake by not recognizing
them. And commonly, people do hold that Hume made that mistake. Even Hume probably thought he made
that mistake, although he didn't think it was a mistake. But he didn't make it. That's what he
didn't know. So Kant thought that the only a priori synthetic truths are truths of Euclidean
geometry and Newtonian physics. That's about it. Causality, space, and time.
For the Munich picture book philosophers, however, there are synthetic a priori truths
everywhere in every aspect of the album. And so this is just a few examples.
Just to start with, then this is more. And we'll see many more. These are just the first
set. All of these were dealt with by the Munich phenomenologists one way or another.
There's even an a priori theory of chemistry that was worked out by one of the female members
of the Munich school. All right, now what that's I've said, Reinhardt is important primarily for
his theory of speech acts. But I think he's even more important for a concomitant discovery,
which changes our whole view of the history of philosophy, I believe. And the it's a view about
how entities exist in time. So for Plato, everything which exists is unchanging. We can only have
knowledge about unchanging truths about the heavens, for instance, the geometry of the
stars, because of course they never change. Anything on earth, we can only have a beliefs about.
These beliefs will be guess it, because things are changing on the earth, so we can't really know
about them. We can only know about the ideal entities, such as numbers, values and so forth.
Now, another sort of history, and this was the typical American 20th century account, says that
every sort of history is about things which are always changing, things which are part of the
world of what happens and is the case, things which are subject to causality. They're changing
all the time, you're changing all the time, even this changing, even this table is changing.
Even a slump of granite is changing all the time, because it's losing atoms, very slowly, but still.
So this is the standard 20th century view. It's the standard view often ascribed to Hume.
And what Reinhacht did, and this is Aristotle's view. Aristotle thought that
there are empirical things, so he was an improvement on Plato. Plato thought everything was unchanging.
Aristotle recognized that they were changing things, like organisms, which were at the heart of his
philosophy. Reinhacht recognized that there are ideal entities, or entities which have the feature
of ideal entities, that they're not affected by causality and by causal change, but which are
rooted in history because they are made by humans. So there are three sorts of history.
There is the Platonic history of things like numbers, there is the empirical history of things
like people, and then there is the a priori history of things like claims and debts and property rights
and many, many other things that we'll talk about in due course. Architectural plans would be an
example, chemical sequences would be an example, gene sequences maybe would be an example. These
are all entities which exist in history from a certain point, but which do not change.
And until they cease to exist, so you pay off your debt, the debt ceases to exceed, for instance,
or you synthesize a molecule, but it's so difficult to keep the molecule in existence that after a
while you stop synthesizing it, but that molecular pattern did exist for a certain period of time
in the world of reality, not just in the world of patterns.
All right, so Anita Stein had a similar view about the state. Now,
states change, but there is something which she discusses in her big book about the state,
which is unchanging about the state, and it's in the same ballpark as things like debts and
claims. It's things like authority. All right, now, so Reinhardt was the principal advocate
of this view. He was, the view is extended even further in very interesting ways, as we will see
by Ingaarden, his pupil and friend, and by Edith Stein and by some of the other
phenomenologists, but it was him who showed how we can make progress in developing an ontology
of these entities of the third kind, which arise particularly in the realm of social ontology.
And so there are various different kinds of social acts. The word social act was used also
by Thomas Reid when he was talking about what we nowadays call speech acts, but not all social
acts are speech acts. Many social acts are document acts. And in November, we're going to have a
visiting speaker or a visiting zoomer who is going to be talking about not speech acts and not
document acts, but device acts. An example of a device act would be a clock. And anyway,
there are many other more interesting examples of device acts, but he is really keen on clock.
All right, you can see some of the details of what we'll be doing in November. In November,
the sixth, I think it is, on the wiki page. But that's a work in progress, that particular
entry in the program is a work in progress, as indeed are most of the entry,
depending on how well I do in finishing this today. All right, so social acts are informing,
questioning, requesting, commanding, promising. Rainer worked out some of all of those things,
and they each have an experience which underlies them. So if you make a command,
then you have to have a volition, a will that the command be executed. That's an essential
law. It's a necessitation. And now, of course, there are some lazy generals who just, it looks
as if they're issuing commands, but they don't care. They're just reading what their
adjutant has given them, but they're not commanding, according to Ryan. Just as if you
tell a lie when you say, I'll give you $100 tomorrow, you're not making a problem.
Now, clearly, we see how Rainer deals with those kinds of cases in a little bit. So enactments
are what lawmakers do when they enact a law. For instance, when the mother decides what time
the children have to be at home at night. And then there is an outcome, which might be a state,
a state of affairs, or something like that. So the state, which is the outcome of informing,
is that the informee now knows the thing which the informer was informing her about.
And asking a question similarly. And there is another beauty phenomenologist, which I'm not
going to talk about, a man called Daubert, who did a great deal of work, very interesting work,
on these kinds of questions, including on the question of questions. And I, along with the
co-auth editor of Rainer's works, whose name is Carl Schumann, I wrote a paper about this man.
And he's called Johannes Daubert, and he's interesting because he never published a word in
his life. He was probably the most important figure in the Munich School. He was the one
figure in the Munich School who was allowed to criticize Husser to his face. But he was a farmer.
He didn't need a degree. He came into the university, discussed, and wrote notes. And he
wrote thousand pages of notes. And like Husser, he used a secret shorthand. And my colleague now,
unfortunately, not here, was the first person to decide for the secret shorthand. And so we were
able to publish some of his unpublished shorthand notes. And a lot of them were about questions.
So we would publish a paper about questions based on Daubert. And at that point, there was practically
nothing published about Daubert. Nobody knew the name. The A-U-B-E-R-T. So we start the paper by
saying, as is well known, Johannes Daubert has, I can't exactly how it goes on. All right, this is
in garden. And he's at age about 36 here. And so he's part of the Munich School, along with Schäler,
who we will meet a little bit later, and Reiner. And along with the early Husser, who was himself
engaged in just the same sort of work, but at the formal level, rather than at the domain
specific level. This is the old Bodleian Library in Oxford. And in 1971, this is the op. I wasn't
in there. I was in the new Bodleian Library, which is much more boring. But by accident,
I found a copy of this book. And it changed my life. I opened it and I saw tables of different
kinds of modes of being, and then also tables of how these different kinds of modes of being
represent themselves in the past or present or the future, or in speculation, hypothesis, fiction,
and so forth. And until that point, I had wanted to, as I said, I wanted to write a PhD on
aesthetics and mathematics. I already knew the name in garden. And I knew that he was known for
his writings on aesthetics, which is why I picked up the book. But when I saw what he was doing with
ontology, which was for him more important than aesthetics, just he wrote about ontology primarily
in Polish, which was a kind of hurdle. So I immediately saw that I was going to write a PhD
on ontology. And I spent the rest of my life working on ontology. This was the even more
important in Wittgenstein's tractators. This is the most important book in my life. And we'll see
where it comes from in a minute. Since Ingard never wrote a book called Time and Modes of Beak,
in any language. All right, what he did was write a book called Controversy Over the Existence of
the World, which was published as part of Ingard's contribution to the Polish war effort. He was a
bit late, but still. So he'd written everything before then in German, because that's the language
of science. It was then anyway. And so that was the language of phenomenology. He was studying
in Goettingen and collaborating with phenomenologies most of whom were German. So it was published
in two volumes, the second of which in some versions has two parts, so three volumes. And then
in, at a later stage, he wrote a third volume, so one, two, one, two, two, and then three.
And the third volume was published in German in 1974. The whole first two volumes were published
in English only recently. However, I can read German, so I knew the German edition of this big
book already quite well. And above all, I knew about Ingard's book on the literary work of art
very well. So that was probably the third most important book in my philosophical career. It's
an amazing book because it's not technical, but it contains a whole amount of new information about
what literature involves. And it's information which is new, but information which you
can't help but realize is being true. In other words, it's not surprising, but it's not boring
either. And you see, it's an investigation on the borderlines of ontology, logic, and theory of
language. So his job here was an ontological job. He realized this ontological job by writing about
literature, and I will explain how that works in a minute. And then in another book, which again was
published only recently in English, but which this one was published first in 1931 in German,
and the other one too was published in 1931. There are many other writings of Ingard, and these are
just the important ones for our purposes. Most of them were published, first of all, in German.
So this is the big book, Volume I, Controversy over the Existence of the World.
And in this book, he distinguishes four kinds of dependence. Now, he's coming
from the logical investigations where relations of dependence are very important,
but he's looking at varieties of relations of dependence. So one variety is the dependence
of a fictional character on its author. And then everything about the fictional character
is determined by the author. Without the author, there would be no physical character. And there is
no truth about the fictional character, which was not determined by the author. That's called
heteronymous dependence or just heteronomy. Derivation is a matter of coming into existence. So
a baby is dependent on a mother and a father too, for coming into existence, but not for
continually existence. And then an entity is dependent on another entity in the non-self-sufficient
input sense. If the one entity needs to coexist in a single hole with the second entity,
an example of this would be color and extension. You can't have color without having some extended
thing or extended space. And then just plain vanilla dependence is depending on another
entity in order to remain in existence. So John's love for Mary goes out of existence if John dies.
So John's love for Mary is dependent in this plain vanilla sense
because it depends on remaining in existence upon John. So this is the same story, but with
examples. So derived entities are entities which are dependent on something for beginning to exist.
There's only one really good example of a non-derived entity, and that's God.
Everything else had to come from somewhere else, except whatever happened just before the Big
Bank. I don't know, but I'm sure that was something else just before the Big Bank. And so even what
was there just before the Big Bank was derived from something for I. And then a non-self-sufficient
would be a color, and self-sufficient would be an apple or a person or a planet. And then dependent
in the plain vanilla sense would be a mammal is dependent upon oxygen or its remaining in existence,
but otherwise it's independent. It's not dependent upon anything. All right, so these are the four
existential moments of dependence and independence. And entities can have various combinations of these
three kinds of dependence. So God is not dependent on anything foreign. He's an absolute. His mode of
existence is absolute. Nearly everything else is very dependent. Fictional characters are very
dependent. And in order to understand dependence, In-Garden started to work on the structure of
military work. What are fictional characters? So there is this paper by a poll called Hood's
Simskey, who hangs around in Austria these days, which summarizes all of what I just said. The
gray is the non-realizable. So I don't think I'm going to go into details, but you trust me that
this is a pretty good account of what is possible given In-Garden's approach. And this is only one
part of the approach. That's why he needs such a big book in four parts, because he wants to solve
the problem of the existence of the work. He wants to show herself who died before it was finished,
that realism was correct. And this diagram here yields eight possible modes of being. And so the
real world has to be one of these eight, because these are the only options. And God is the first
one, A1. And we can look at the others in a minute. So I don't need to go into this detail.
So this is a picture now of all the different categories. There are ideal entities, which
are not actual. They can't move. They can't do anything. There's one absolute being, which is
God, which is actual. And God is original and autonomous. And then everything else is derivative
of our heteronomy. So derivative are present continuance, like people and planets. And a slightly
weaker form, which In-Garden calls post-actual, are past continuance, which are things like
Julius Caesar and President True. And you see, as we go from God to the present God,
to the present events, and then to the past events, and then to the future events, which are only
possible. They're not actual in any sense. We're getting weaker and weaker until we get to the
non-actual, which are what In-Garden calls purely intentional objects, which are heteronymous
and therefore derivative, because they depend upon something else, which is true. And so we have
something like a great chain of being from absolute being to shell opponent. And so these
are the eight possible modes of being. So we have God and the time entities. And then we have ideal
entities like debt, claim, mortgage, and so on. Then we have present continuance, present processes,
present events, purely intentional entities, and purely intentional entities of a weaker kind.
And so In-Garden wrote the literary work of art in order to show why idealism is wrong. Idealism
would say that the real world does not go here. Present continuance, which is where we would
want it to go. So idealism says the real world does not go under present continuance.
So how is he going to show that the real world does not go under present continuance? Well,
the only alternative option is that the real world is, and this is the idealist view,
the real world is a purely intentional object. Purely intentional object is dependent upon,
in all respects, for all its qualities, on some author, some creator, some origin. And
every creator of every literary work has only a finite amount of time and therefore only a
finite amount of text to determine all the qualities of its fictional character. Therefore,
qualities of fictional characters are always spotting. They have loci of indeterminacy in
In-Garden's terms. No real entity has loci of indeterminacy, because for every real entity,
if we have a question about any quality, we can always answer that question by measuring
or by investigating more closely. We can't find out how tall Hamlet was by measuring.
And the same applies to Sherlock Holmes, unless Conan Doyle tells us that he was exactly 5 feet
11. But then Watson, we still wouldn't know how tall he was. And we wouldn't know many other things
about Sherlock Holmes and Watson and their dog and the kind of whiskey they drank and so on.
So, this is the argument. This is why the book on literature was a
contribution to the resolution of the controversy over the existence of the world,
which In-Garden and Hustle have been fighting for the whole of their lives. So, this is a picture
of a literary work. The basis of the literary work, this is, these are strata that you work. And
certainly, you've written a literary work, you've created all the literature. So, you have word
sound, because when you read a novel or a poem, you hear the words, even if you're going to hear
them with your ears, you hear them with your mind. And you probably hear Shakespeare wrong,
because Shakespeare's plays were written at a time when English people spoke the
combination dialect of Yorkshire and Danish, which doesn't sound at all like English,
but still, we hear sound when we read Shakespeare. When people perform Shakespeare,
they typically perform it in a non-Yorkshire, Danish dialect. Then we have meaning units,
because we understand the meanings of the sentence, and higher order meaning structure,
which are what enable us to visualize the places and the events and so forth. Then we have what
we call schematized aspects, including quasi-century aspect, which are things like the color of
Juliet's hair and so on, which are spotty. Then we have the objects, events, and safety affairs,
and adult, which all of these graphic support. So, Juliet, and Hamlet, and Romeo, and so on,
and Sherlock Holmes are all here, as is Baker Street and Florence, and Moscow. So, Moscow
is not present in war and peace. It's not about Moscow. It's about a Moscow here.
And it would still be about Moscow here. There was no Moscow in Russia.
All right, and then we have at the very top, and these are not necessary,
value qualities, metaphysical qualities, and other features of a literary work,
which exist from a certain point in time, if you're dealing with a work which has
a certain value. All right, now, if you look at a musical work, you only have two straws.
If you're lucky, you only have two straws. Typically, you only have one, namely the
bangs and whistles, which make up the musical work. But sometimes you have value qualities,
but it's a great musical work. But you don't have any of the rest. It is an opera,
and you have even more of it. And Inga deals with four different kinds of works about art.
In this book. So, an architectural work is not identical to the building,
because the architectural work can be spoil, change, destroy, even, and the building may be
the same. For instance, if you build a sequence of really ugly towers around the work and put
Mickey Mouse features on the top of the tower, then you've spoiled the architectural work,
but the work itself hasn't changed. So, that's Inga then. So,
the scientific work doesn't have any of the metaphysical qualities, and it doesn't have
any word sounds. The sounds do not play a role in that scientific work. And journalists, he has
paper on what he calls borderline cases of literary works, which deals with things like
journalism, etc. The difference is that a literary work represents represented objects. So,
they are heteronomous. They're purely intentional. Whereas scientific work, if you're lucky,
represents objects and events and states of affairs in the world.
That's why there is no corresponding strut in inside the work, because the strut in
outside the work. And then we have intentionality going from the representations in texts and
symbols to the objects in the world. All right, now this summarizes what I said earlier. So,
we will pause here, and if there are any questions, yes.
Yes, so he thinks that the past is such that I have to be very careful here.
The past doesn't exist now. It's not actual, but it was once actual, and that's a pretty strong
kind of being. The future is not even future actual, because it may never happen. So, the
future is always somehow probabilistic. And I think that's as far as he goes. He doesn't have
a sophisticated theory of time, to my knowledge. I'm sure he has lots of things to say about time,
but not in regard to the ontology. He talks about why he has this particular treatment of
past, present, and future. And that's part of the time. So, Time and Modes of Being, the book
that I mentioned, is in fact an English translation of parts of Volume 1 of The Controversy.
And well, yeah. I just want to go back, I guess, a fair bit to when you're talking about
change versus unchanging and debt. Is that an example? How does that fit into dependency?
And why is debt unchanging? Yes. So, I lend you $5. You have to give me $5 within the week.
That debt just comes into existence. And then if you get back the $5, then it's easy to do.
It doesn't change. It doesn't become more intense, or less intense. It's just a debt to share.
And there are many other things which are just there. For instance, if I was King of England,
I would have won. I could make you a knight. You don't become Britisher. But your knighthood
would exist. It wouldn't change at all. And there are many, many others.
Where would that go into dependency? So, the debt is dependent upon the debtor and the debtee.
And there are different things to be said, depending on whether it's a debt which is captured
in some kind of document or not. And it could be that the debt is captured in a document.
And that document serves, then, as the basis for other debts or other claims and so forth.
But in the simple case, it's just a simple relation between human beings. And it's a thick
relation. Everything I just said, I think it's a priori. In other words, you understood what I said
and you nodded your head. So, that's all you need. Yeah?
The huge schema with all those categories, that's in the 1960s.
That is present already in the Polish book, which was published in 1947.
That is, like, dealing with so many things that happened in English, speaking throughout the
martial arts. Yeah, of course. These were really good philosophers.
And you can read it in English now. That's the easy bit. Yeah, the young problem is that each
column is one hundred something dollars. Well, you can borrow, you can share, I don't know.
The library. Yeah. If it's not in the UB Library, then tell me and I will tell them to order.
You said that in the whole schema of God is absolute. Is that a term you use?
That's his term. Okay. I just realized that the final book written by David Stein is called
Absolute in the United Kingdom. Finite. Yes. So, there is a book of letters between
Ingarden and Lieberstein and so they were communicating with each other constantly.
I think, I don't know when the communication stopped for a long time and so they were,
I'm sure, exchanging ideas about philosophy as well. But I wouldn't want to say who was the
the more creative of the two. I would, I think I could say that Ingarden was the more
formalistic. Do you like lists and things? I like lists. I like pictures.
When I'm working on a new topic, the first thing I do is put the name of the topic in Google and
then ask for all the images. So, the bluntness of, or the lusciousness of, or the right shininess
of the object. So, it occurs to me that we should send this around.
Your name is already there. Otherwise, put the name on there.
I'm not going to do anything with that sheet. I just want to know who's here. Yes.
So, back to his idea of time. What existed on the moments of dependence? How much weight should
we take for the moments in the, in the, I'm thinking, he kind of sounded like a grown block
theorist. So, would it be something like the particular time slice that I think of it that way?
No, the moments are that they derive from the dependence theoretic approach to sense data that
Pussel developed. Here, he took this from Stumpf, who was earlier, who specialized in tone
psychology, but psychology of music, basically. So, if you have a musical tone, you have a pitch,
you have a timbre, and you have a loudness. They are moments of the pitch. And similarly,
Ingang said, modes of being have moments, and you have to have one or other. You have to have
one of each moment, but the moments might be high or low, or high, still present. And so,
he worked out the moments of being, and then had a way of combining the moments to create modes of
being. And then he could use that to solve the problem of idealism, and really. So, Ingang did
not say that the strata of the literary work are dependent on the author. They are dependent
for their origin on the author. But in order to be maintained in existence, they need readers.
And a different population of readers will be responsible for maintaining the literary work
in existence. And so, literary works do indeed change. They're not like debts or dollars, or
they change. That's why I put this curve here. They could even die if no one reads them anymore,
or if all copies are destroyed. But they still have some of the characteristics, so they don't
change for causal reasons. They change because the readership has different tastes, reads new
nuances which may or may not have been there on the part of the author, sees a political meaning
that may or may not have been there on the part of the author. So, Shakespeare's plays have already
changed in a big way on the sound level. And they're trying to change them these days also on
various political and avant-garde interpretation levels. So, literary works are still examples of
ideal entities of the third kind, but they change because they are dependent upon things like audiences,
critics, editions, editors, and so forth. So, under this theory, are literary works fully determined,
but under-determined by the author? Like the full determination of the audience engagement?
Yeah, so that's a very good question.
Ingaarden was a fan of a very realistic late-19th century novel, if that helps you.
Yeah. And his proof, he says that in conclusion, idealism is false. Can it also just be saying
idealism is fiction?
Well, no, because if we go back to the scientific work, so a scientific work is
meaning to be about the world. And the philosopher idealists who developed these theories did indeed
believe that the world is just a fiction. They thought that it was a fact that the world is a fiction.
Where a fictional author doesn't hold that the world he's describing is a fact.
Yeah.
How determinist are some of you who translate the book?
Oh, so yes, so the life of a literary work may bifurcate or multi-furcate. If you get many
translations and each translation, you may even get multiple translations.
And different cultures then would have a different reading of the work. And so the work itself has
a life which involves multiple personalities. And I once gave a talk at a German conference
about Heidegger. Actually, no, it was about translation. And my talk was, had the title,
Heidegger in German, Heidegger's work is untranslatable. And there were lots of
Heideggerians in the room, many, particularly Japanese Heideggerians on the front row.
And the chair of the meeting was Japanese. And before I could even start the first word,
the Japanese all stood up in unison in the Japanese way and they all shouted,
of course, Heidegger can be translated. There are nine different translations of Heidegger
into Japanese. So in other words, I couldn't get my talk, it's the only time in my life I've been
prevented this movement. All right, so works of art can have complicated lives, that's the
important thing, the life of the literary work. All right, now, I have a lot about Heidegger,
in Garden's theory of systems, but I'm not going to go through that. I will. Actually,
I may be able to go through it quickly. So in volume three of the controversy over the existence
of the world, which is called the causal structure of the real world, and which is extracted in
short form in an English text in a book called Man and Value. And the idea here is the idea of
relatively isolated systems. So I am a relatively isolated system, I'm a system, but I'm relatively
isolated because I have a skin which isolates me relatively from the outside world. The outside
world can still penetrate and I can still penetrate from within into the outside world by speaking
or sweating or throwing or vomiting. But there is the skin and all animals have a hide or a skin
or some kind of closing closure, which creates this relative isolation, which is a permeable
membrane, which allows us also to expel waste. And so there is one relatively isolated system
and the other relatively isolated systems, we talk to each other, we ask things to each other.
This is supposed to be a mind. So the mind is permeated by the external world in that we see
the external world, we move around within it and touch it. And anyway, if you're interested,
there is this paper called Ingardens Systems Theoretical Philosophical Anthropology.
So you can have tribes which are relatively isolated systems, countries. And I have a whole
talk and a whole video on this, which you can dig around and find. Probably, yeah.
So the world consists of, and this is why I want to include this just briefly. So I have lots of
blood cells in my body, which are moving around independently. They are the only parts of my
body which are not connected by me to some kind of tube or pipe to other parts of my body. So
my lungs are connected to other things which are connected again to other things.
But blood cells are not tied to anything else. But all those linkages are relatively tiny.
In other words, they are tubes which fit into a large thing like the kidney or the heart.
And allow transmission of fluids and gases. Rather like wires in the good old days allow
transmission of most code messages. So this is a picture of some of these tubes.
And it's important that there is one rather interesting tube here,
connecting the mother to the placenta. And then there's something else which goes here.
It's not so relevant. Actually, it is relevant. It's what I'm talking about now. So
there is a school of thought. It's not Irish. I think it's Dutch. It's in Europe anyway.
Which says that the embryo or the fetus is a part of the mother.
And the argument is that it's connected and it's inside the mother. But if it's connected
by means of a tube, then that doesn't mean that it's a part of the mother. I could be
connected by means of wires to my headquarters. And the wires could be continuous. My job is to
transmit most code messages to headquarters. That doesn't mean I'm a part of the person who's
answering my most code messages. And similarly, the fact that there is a connection, which is
going to be disconnected very beautifully and smoothly when the time comes, doesn't mean that
the thing which it's connected to is a part of the connecting system. So this is one system.
And in this paper called 16 Days, which is about the ontology of the embryo, embryo ontology.
So this is the discipline of the gerontology. We argue that the embryo is, well, we don't
need to argue this. In those days, it was obvious to everybody. Now it's obvious to everybody except
these four or five Dutch and European ladies to work on, the metaphysics of pregnancy.
And their main thesis is that the fetus, once it's become attached to the mother,
is a part of the mother. And that's why the mother can abort the fetus any time she likes,
because it's a part of it. So it's like having your fingernails cut. Anyway, we argue that the
embryo sees it, let me get this right, that the organism, which is the eventual baby,
begins to exist at the latest 16 days after fertilization. And in it, we say that the embryo
is, I say this is what my line is. I don't know. There's no response for this line. We say that the
relation between the fetus and the mother is rather like the relationship between a tub of
yogurt and a refrigerator. That's what we say. And so in all their papers, these
metaphysicians of pregnancy, they quote that line. They don't quote the arguments,
because they quote that line and they say, obviously, Smith is wrong. Therefore, the baby is a part
of the mother. But I say quite explicitly that you can be an object and still be connected by a
pipe or a conduit or some kind of wire. And that's what happens with the baby, that it's connected
by a conduit. And the actual surface area of the baby is much bigger than the thickness of the
conduit. And the same applies to lungs and kidneys and livers and so forth. They are objects too.
And they are part of the mother, because they have the same genetics. They don't, they have the
same source of food and oxygen and so forth as the mother. The baby doesn't have the same genetics
as the mother. So that's one of many reasons why the baby is not a part of the mother. So the baby
is a system, which is inside another system, but not as part, and not as a subsystem, therefore,
because the subsystem is always a part, but rather as an independent system, which is connected by
means of the tube. So here ends the first lesson. Let me get back to the main track.
We'll come back to most of that later on. This is Yorbsland Faber who taught me a lot about systems.
That's the book where we express this complicated theory of systems, complex system. Now let's talk
about Max Shaler. Max Shaler was a very interesting character. So he was the Catholic Nietzsche,
they say. That was how he was described. In other words, he was, he was very, what's the word,
conspicuous. He was, he wasn't a dedicated follower of fashion. He was a creator of fashion.
So during the First World War, he was the leading spokesman for the anti-British
campaign, because the British are just grossers. So we can't take them seriously. They have no
spirit, no geist. And so it's okay to beat them in a war. And he was, he was a Catholic at various
points in his life. But then when he unconverted himself and then reconverted himself. And some
of the times when he was unconverted, he was also professor of Catholic theology in the University
of Cologne. He was, his sex life was very complicated. I can't remember the
I can't remember the whole story, but the one story which I do remember is that on the morning of
one of his marriages, he wrote, sent a telegram to another woman, explained that she was the only
woman that he ever loved in his life. She's also not true. I mean, that she was the only woman.
Anyway, so it's very, there is a very nice biography by a man called Shtoud S-T-A-U-D-D
on Shayla's life, which I recommend. And, but his philosophy is, it's all over the place.
He hasn't been popular in the analytic world as much as he should have been given the good
stuff in Shayla, because there is a lot of embarrassing stuff in Shayla. And I'm trying,
going to try and communicate some of the good stuff. So, and I have Voitywa in yellow here,
that's because some of the good stuff is manifest in Voitywa, who wrote his habitation on
Shayla. All right. Now, Shayla's idea, one of Shayla's main ideas is his theory of feelings
and emotions and values. Now, it's clear that feelings can be of positive or negative value.
So a pain is of negative value or negative valence, we can say. And a feeling of joy is
positive value. But Shayla made a very elaborate technology of values and emotions out of these
associations between certain kinds of feelings and certain kinds of values. He said the only way
we can experience a value is via feeling. So we don't have intellectual knowledge of values.
We have, let's say, value of instances. We know when there is a value there,
if we have a corresponding feeling about what we see or hear. And so if you see somebody
torturing a helpless infant and you don't feel badness, then that's because you are value blind.
And I think there's some truth in this. Some people are value blind. Pathology is a kind
of value blind. Psycho, psychopathology. The psychopath is somebody who is value blind
with regard to social values of various sorts. All right, so Shayla's idea is that the way we
access values is through emotions. And that means that we, sorry, the way we access
values is through emotions. And that means that we can categorize values by looking at the kinds
of feelings that they incite. And so sensible feelings like itches and smells and so forth,
they relate to rather short lived values, which are easy to fix, easy to change. So if you have
a toothache, then if you take an aspirin, then you may, if you're lucky, be able to change it. So
you can, there's a mechanical means to change these things. And this means that they are very
low in the value of value. Then we have what he calls vital feelings, which are bigger and
stronger on the positive side and tiredness and weakness. So you can see nature coming in here
on the negative side. Then we have psychic feeling states, such as euphoria and happiness
and sympathy and sorrow and anger and jealousy. And these come forth in all kinds of interesting
psychosocial phenomena like love and hate and empathy and so forth. And we can alter them
through acts of free will and through positive social interactions, he said. And then at the
very top, we have spiritual feelings, which are somehow absolute. They don't belong to the ego
anymore. And the example, the examples he likes are all religious ones, bliss or wonder catharsis
on the positive side and then shame, despair, remorse, anxiety, conscious, conscience and grief
on the negative side. And these we can't usually manipulate. If we have a feeling of bliss, then
that's by the grace of God, it's not anything that we can engineer. And we can't will ourselves
to be in a state of awe. Either it happens or it doesn't. And so from this, we get hierarchy
of values. So with we start at the bottom, there are utility values, which of course,
don't matter to us just for the British. Then there are sensual, sensual feelings,
which meant to things being agreeable or disagreeable. And then we have feeling states of the
lived body, which are correspond to mental values and vital values that I told earlier.
And then psychic feeling states correspond to mental values. And spiritual feeling states
correspond to the values of the holy and the unholy. And this gives you a hierarchy.
So we have sacred at the top and wisdom, then virtue and then utility.
All right, so so much for this is Shayla's big book, 600 pages or so. The idea is that
formalism in ethics is the kind of ethics which can be captured in axioms like the
categorical imperative of Kant, which Shayla hated. So he thought that that's much too formalistic,
much too intellectualistic values have to do with and therefore ethics have to do with feelings.
Feelings are the basis of ethics. And the get out then is precisely that some people suffer
from volume blind. So the usual argument against the view that feelings that feelings are the
basis of ethics is that some people don't have the right feelings. And there is a very nice.
So there's a very nice treatment of Fender's theory of the human world,
which I've linked to the wiki page. So Fender was another member of the Unix school.
In the book on AI, we have a section on Shayla's theory of the will. But since we wrote the book,
I found this paper and it is in fact, a better account of the Munich understanding of will,
and therefore also of emotions. All right, so this is Shayla's account, not Fender's account
of will. So a man, I could have been a woman, but a man sees a drowning child and experiences
a feeling. It has to be a feeling of moral obligation to save the child and wills himself
to save the child and jumps in. And then Shayla says that we have overlapping stages.
And we need to understand the will by looking at these overlapping stages.
We get the same change stages wherever action occurs, in other words, because action always
occurs on the basis of some act of will. So these are the stages and Fender's theory is more
detailed than this. And I think better also, but this won't do for here. So there is a presence
to the acting person of the object, the baby falling in the lake, a presence in the mind
of the acting person, we could see a safe guys, of the content to be realized, and of the sending
value feelings, value feelings. So he feels that he has to jump in. And then there is a decision,
and the decision that the act of deciding has three parts. There's forming intentions,
and liberating how to affect the rescue. So once you decide you're going to rescue the baby,
then you need to decide how you do that, and whether you'll call the police first.
And then the third part is the most important part, that's when you resolve. That's a mental
act of resolving. But that takes place at the same time as molecular signaling events in your brain.
And Shayla is, for this reason, asked for many others to be taken seriously, even today,
because he was never a Cartesian Jewelist. He always believed in the mind body as being one
thing rather than two things. So these two things are both happening simultaneously,
and they are in some sense, they're two sides of the same coin. And that is why the will actually
exists, where you have a connection between the relevant parts of the decision and the
actual triggering of the event. And it would look like this, or so this is stage three C up here.
And that's stage four, but they're connected by nerves. And there's nothing here that we can
predict. So one of the reasons why we can have no AI will, which Jupps and I have argued at
length now, is because we'd have to predict that there would be this simultaneous decision, and
in the case of the AI, there's going to be a mechanical effect. And we can't do that in the
way which corresponds to what we understand as will, when we are human beings willing.
And Turing, so in other words, we can have no mathematical model of this. And Turing says
that we can only model what we can describe mathematically. Now the reason why will is so
important for AI is the same as the reason why we still after 50 years have no working chat box.
AI can't do ordinary everyday conversation. And the reason why it can't do ordinary everyday
conversations, because ordinary everyday conversation is soaked through with acts of will.
We engage in conversation because we want something. Immediately that we engage and we
want something else because of the response. And the will ties what ties the conversation together.
And that's why you hate calling your bank on the phone, because there's no will. It's a tie you
together. All right, now, so the life world, I will talk about this at some other stage.
I don't think we need to go into this really. Yeah, so we'll do this one. So
both Hussal and Shayla were, even though they were interested in the real world,
even Hussal was interested in the real world in his early writings,
were not really interested in physics or in chemistry or in the sciences of the real world.
So, Hussal, sorry, Shayla used the term milieu to refer to the life world that we are living in,
which is a kind of simplified chamber, which extends as far as we can see and as far as we
can influence, but it's not the real world because it has rules of its own. So he says,
the sun of the media of human beings is not the sun of astronomy, the meat that is stolen, bought
or what have you is not the sum of cells and tissues with the chemical physical processes
which take place within them. Now, of course, he's just wrong that that meat contains molecules.
If somebody asks you to give you a drink that doesn't contain any chemicals,
then you know that they are wrong because every drink to contains nothing but chemical.
All right, so now this is another piece of history. So when I first arrived in Buffalo,
the chair was a close friend of the previous chair of Martin's father who was one of the
leading phenomenologists in the United States. And he wrote a book on Hussal, he hired phenomenologists
and the man who started this Marvin father lectures, I think I was the only person who
gave him a lecture. He wanted me to talk about European philosophy, he had lectures, so I agreed.
And so we started with Brentano, who was the teacher of Hussal and responsible also for Polish
philosophy and for your start psychology and many other things. That's where we start
and the influence of Brentano on the Vienna circle. And then Wittgenstein and the poets,
I've forgotten what I had to say in that particular lecture, but I do have the tapes
somewhere. And then Kafka and the philosophers, I've written about Kafka and Brentano.
Kafka attended lectures in philosophy and was known to philosophers, he was known to them,
they were known to him, although they didn't know about his novels because they were written later.
And then I have a chapter on Wojtyła. Kazimierz Falowski was Brentano's
leading light in Poland. And then we have Hussal Heidegger and the Crisis of European Sciences.
I missed some out. So this is a shortened version of a longer list. Then there's an
lecture on the ink garden. Then it begins to become even more controversial.
From Jürgen Hallermas to the Bardemainhof gang. And then the final lecture was called
Daring Down the Suicide of Philosophical Reason. And the short form is writing to death.
And so the reason why I bring this up is because during this period, I was actually
working on the philosophy of Karol Wojtyła. And this fits because it draws exactly on the
theory of the will of Sheila. So Wojtyła wrote a book. The title is Person and Act. But an English
translation was created, which is somewhat controversial because the translation involved
parts which were not written by Wojtyła. They were written by the translator who claimed in a
very famous series of journalistic excitement events a few years ago that she was in love with
Wojtyła. And there was something going on between the two of them, but I'm sure it was not anything.
It could probably be called love, at least not in his direction. Anyway, so there is now
a new version of this book. I don't know whether it's in English, but there is a new version in.
Well, actually, this looks as if it is in English. This is part of the English
critical edition of the works in Karol Wojtyła volume one, in fact, so Person and Act. So Wojtyła
was a philosophy student and a philosophy professor, actually, as well as being a priest.
And in order to become a professor in most countries in Europe, you have to do two
dissertations. One is the doctrine and the other is called the habitation. It's just a thick
doctrine. And in France, thick means a thousand pages. And the story I like to tell is that every
German philosophy professor has to write at least two books. One is on Hegel and the other is on
Hegel. And well, the main topic of Wojtyła was habitation, but Aquinas is playing a role also
because Wojtyła was a priest. And so philosophy for priests is Aquinas and commentary is on Aquinas.
So it's a study of the human person. Now, Ingaardin talked about Strafer of the literary work
and Ingaardin and Wojtyła were friends. So I'm sure that there was some interaction between them
in the English translation of the acting person, the original one. I haven't read the new one.
The word structure is used, but many of the passages suggest that stratum would be more
appropriate, as we will see. So there are strata of the human person, which are common to all persons
and to all human action. And his book is about the stratum. Jesus Christ is not mentioned anywhere
in the book. Theology is not mentioned anywhere in the book. Truth is mentioned. And you know what
he means when he talks about truth, but he's not talking about what he means.
And so Reinhardt has an important distinction in his theory of speech acts.
So there are two kinds of speech acts. One kind of speech act.
Well, sorry, there are two kinds of uses of language. One kind of use of language. You're just
speaking. You're not trying to act in such a way that the person you're speaking to will be
changed. So if someone says, what time is it? You say four o'clock, then that's not really a speech act.
So the difference has to do with what Reinhardt calls the spontaneous doings of a person.
So like kissing or kicking or choosing and deciding, these are internal doings. And speech acts are
both internal and external. They're internal because they involve you willing to act in a certain way,
but they're external because you act by speaking. And that you're speaking to someone else who wants
to change that other person. So this distinction between what merely happens in person and what
is a spontaneous doing of that person is the core of pointy words, account of the human person.
So the strata are what he calls enduring dynamic centers. So we're constantly acting,
but on different levels. And we're constantly having things go on inside our body on different
levels, including physical things like blood flow and so forth, breathing. And the trick is to try
and unify all of these dynamic strata. And of course, sometimes you fail. And in working to
unify all your dynamic strata, you create yourself. And so acting, he says, is the first of many
dynamisms. It's conscious. And but conscious consciousness too is a dynamism. So already
action involves another strata, which is a conscious strata. You could be conscious without
acting. And when you act, you are conscious that you're acting, but the action belongs to a different
dynamism from the consciousness. And then they both depend upon various bodily dynamisms.
And then the question is, how do you how do you unify all of these
dynamisms? And these are fine. So when we act, we experience our action as a doing of which we
are the entity, because we were acting, we're causally responsible. We are aware that it reflects
certain conscious processes called desires, typically, that sometimes it's a bearer of a moral
value or disarm you. And then he says that a drama of good and evil within ourselves,
which is another kind of dynamism. And it reflects also.
So I'm not sure what it means. These things I think are his words. So I think it means that
it reflects your consciousness of other actions that you've been taking. And then it reflects and
is entwined with the external reality in which the action takes place, including the external
reality of the other person that you are acting in relation to, and of all their dynamisms.
And then the problem that there is this dynamism of feelings and emotions. You see,
see how Shayla is playing a role here. I'm not going to go through this.
The problem is that the harmony sometimes break. So you may have an over-emotionalized consciousness.
And then there's a struggle, struggle between the intense emotions,
which affect your consciousness and your consciousness itself. And that's where, if you're
lucky, conscience will kick in. But sometimes consciousness will kick in.
And then you, the person as unity disintegrates and says, and freedom, you can't be free when
your personality is disintegrated. That's what he says here. Freedom presupposes self-punishment.
And freedom therefore presupposes a reference to truth. And then there's a long passage here about
conscience. So consciousness is another dynamism, which serves to control over the goodness of the
badness of our actions. So now this, the one interesting aspect is that he thinks that this
creates a solution to the mind-body problem. And so the mental and bodily dynamisms are brought
to a unity on a higher level constituted by the dynamisms of human action. So human action brings
the two together. And I'm quoting him now when he says, all men, he means all human beings. In German,
the word mensch, they mean mensch, but that means human being. But it's often translated as
men, as we will see. All right. So now we have the, we dealt with the Schäler School. I still
have a lot to say, but I'll do it quickly. So the Louvain School, that this priest rescued
Husserl's archives from the Nazis, took them to Belgium and hid them away and created the Husserl
archive, which still exists. And there are 40-something volumes in the collected works,
which is nothing compared to Heidegger. Then there is the Liechtenstein School. And I,
this is going very quick. So Liechtenstein is here. It's 62 square miles, and it has its own
prince, who is the sovereign, and he's a real prince. And Buffalo has 52 square miles. I lived
in Liechtenstein for four years. I was a professor of philosophy. This is the Royal Family of Liechtenstein.
This is the Royal Castle of Liechtenstein. This is the International Academy of Philosophy. It's
now called the University of Liechtenstein, but then it was a very small-scale thing. It didn't
even occupy this much of the building. And I wasn't a professor anymore when they moved
into this building, which is very hard to reach. I could tell you stories about this building,
but I won't. Now, why was I in Liechtenstein? Well, on June 14, 1975, I gave my first ever
talk to an international meeting in Krakow. In 1975, Krakow was a communist country.
I had already visited many communist countries, but it was not, by any means, trivial for an
Englishman to visit communist countries. It was a bit like traveling to Europe when COVID was
raining. I managed to do it, but it was not trivial. Now, so I go to this meeting and I give a talk on
Roman ingarden in the aesthetics of mathematical objects and see that's my dissertation.
And I can't remember what I said, but all of the three international speakers of this
meeting were invited to the Cardinals' Palace in Krakow, which is this. And so the Cardinal was
Wojtyła, so I had dinner with Wojtyła. Now, this man was the creator of the International
Academy of Philosophy. He knew that I had dinner with Wojtyła, but more importantly,
it's important because Liechtenstein is a very Catholic country. This is a very Catholic person.
He was the head of it. The Academy was devoted to the philosophy of Wojtyła and to the Polish
and Munich. He was part of the Munich School, a very late part. So the Munich
Polish precursors of Wojtyła's philosophy, and he knew that I was the world's expert
on Reinhacht and Ingarden, so he made me a professor. And so I moved to Liechtenstein,
and Liechtenstein is a very beautiful country, 2% taxes, and it's in the mountains and in the
middle of everywhere. Anyway, so there is this Liechtenstein branch of philosophy. Dietrich von
Hildebrandt was indeed a member of the original Munich School, and Seifert was his student. I'm
not going to talk about Seifert's philosophy. You can read about it if you wish. I thought I would
do another chat E.P.T. trip. So Seifert wrote a book on the philosophy of chess, which I think is
his greatest work. It's quite short. And this is how it's described in his German wiki page.
For some reason he doesn't have an English wiki page. The German wiki page is very long and
very serious, so I think there's been a misprint somewhere, a misconnection. So this is just the
paragraph about his chess philosophy. So I tried in Google Translate, and it doesn't get everything
right. So it says, goes in the direction of an objective priori of the nominal essential law
than empirically given ones. Necessary circumstances can be exceeded. So about here,
Google Translate just gave up and generated nonsense. Probably that's where they kick in
chat E.P.T. Deep L, which is a German translation engine, better than Google, does better. I'm not
going to read this, but it's clearly much too long a sentence. So no good English translation
would ever have a sentence which is this long. So I did a translation. This is the relevant
passage in the Deep L, but I improved it. So I cut most of it. He shows also the cast conception
of a general a priori. I can be improved by distinguishing an objective a priori. I have
essential rules from empirically given necessary states of affairs about chess and things like
them. So now finally, Heidegger. He really is a funny man. So in being in time, Heidegger, according
to this, the Stanford and psychopedic philosophy, Heidegger rejects the Hosellian, and that means
the Munich notion of formal ontology, transforming it into a fundamental ontology,
which is a neo Aristotelian serve for what it is that unites and makes possible our varied
and diverse senses of what it is to be. I think the English of this is quite good.
I'm not sure anyone can understand it for that English is quite good. And it shows that there
was a kind of break, even early Heidegger was still enthused by Sheller things. There's a lot of
the tone of voice of Sheller in the early Heidegger. And Hosell himself in his copy of Heidegger's
Being in Time says that his formal ontology is shifted into the anthropological, all
problematical, shifting over corresponding to the ego, which is the formal this thing.
There is Dasein, and no one knows what that is. In the way that everything becomes
ponderously unclear and philosophically loses its value. And then Galen. So Galen, he's a follower
of Sheller. The Second World War got in the way of him being counted as a member of the,
it got in the way of a lot of them. But he wrote a book called, which in the English
translation is called Man. But in the German, it's just der Mensch. So he was writing about
human beings, which until a few years ago, everyone would assume as a matter of course.
So der Mensch, his nature. How would you say that in the human being? You can't say its nature.
And it's placed in the world. And chapter, sorry, the third part ends with a section
on the Geist problem that we talked about last week, or two weeks ago. All right,
so the background of Galen's work, it's a really big and very interesting work around
book around lots of things. And there is a copy of both the German and the English
translation of the university library, which is a very good sign of how good the library is here.
That's not just my do. There's always good library. Marvin Farber, I think, was responsible for the
quality of the university collection. All right, so three aspects to his work,
Sheller, primatism and philosophical anthropology. And so his first idea is that humans are what in
German is called Mängelwesen, which means deficient entities. So cats and dogs and pigs,
they are not deficient entities. They have a wonderful life in their ancestral environment.
They never have to worry. And that's because they have very, very powerful instincts. They
don't have to think at all. They just behave instinctively. Humans have very weak instincts.
We've lost most of our instincts. So we have to make up for this loss. And what this means
is that we have to use our weak sensory and motor abilities to change the environment to suit our
needs. And that means we can live in many different kinds of environments. We are, as Galen says,
and this is a term that Sheller also uses, we have world openness. So we can plan how we're
going to behave. We can plan what kind of environment we behave in. We can build a new
environment. We can invent new kinds of environments and so forth. So playing games
are new kinds of environments. We have these devices called chessboards and so forth,
new kinds of tourism, new kinds of travel spaceships, astrobiology, we can live in a world
which includes also possible bacteria in distant galaxies. And we do all of these things.
So a rat wouldn't do any of that. He could do the same thing every day.
We have an excess drive. We always want to, we go to philosophy lectures.
We read Arnold Galen. We do all kinds of things. We do always new things. And there's no
equilibrium. We never are settled. We die eventually. But while we're alive, it's always
something new. And that's why we need institutions. This is going to be the last slide.
So we need institutions which are cultural, not natural, because if we don't have institutions,
then we're lost because we have such weak instincts. So we have institutions to create
things like roads and electricity, electricity supply and so on, all those services, maybe even
tree services. But that means that we are by nature cultural being. That is the deep thought.
I mean, if you're teaching the course on nature and culture, that is the deep thought.
And part of Galen's argument for this thought is that we don't know of any human beings who did not
have cultural attainments. The very earliest societies are precisely societies with institutions
and buildings and so on. And no matter how primitive we find them, they are still these
institutions or cultural attainments. They are still so fundamental that human existence would be
unthinkable without them. All right, let's see.
Good.
