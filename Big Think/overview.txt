Checking Big Think/Genius Is Not about Excelling at Something—It's about Doing Things Differently ｜ Eric Weinstein.txt
 The passage reflects on the value of excellence and consensus in society, noting that while these are generally seen as positive goals, they involve trade-offs. Excellence, associated with quality control and repeatability, is indeed teachable and can be cultivated through practice and dedication, which is why it's valued in professions like surgery or classical music performance. However, the speaker argues that this focus on excellence has led to the marginalization of individuals who think differently—those who are high-variance innovators with different cognitive patterns, often labeled as "learning disabled" within the current education system.

These individuals, who are frequently dyslexic or diagnosed with ADHD, are often the ones who push boundaries, create new forms of art and science, and drive societal progress. The education system, however, tends to punish rather than nurture these differences, trying to force these unique thinkers into a mold designed for those who excel within conventional parameters.

The speaker suggests that society has become too obsessed with excellence, to the point where it overlooks and even stigmatizes alternative ways of thinking and being that are crucial for innovation and progress. The speaker advocates for recognizing and valuing these different modes of thought as essential for the advancement of a society, especially in areas where breakthroughs are needed, like curing cancers or creating new industries.

In essence, the speaker is calling for a more nuanced understanding of human potential that goes beyond the pursuit of excellence, one that acknowledges the importance of different types of thinkers and the roles they play in driving societal evolution and innovation. The speaker also hints at the power law distribution of achievements in society, suggesting that a small number of individuals are responsible for the majority of significant advancements, and these are often the "geniuses" who take risks and act on unconventional ideas.

Checking Big Think/Social media addiction - how it changes your brain ｜ Luke Burgis ｜ Big Think.txt
 The advent of social media has fundamentally changed the way we interact with individuals, including those like the President of the United States, who might seem omnipresent and within our reach. This digital era has introduced us to an overwhelming array of "memetic models" — ideas or behaviors that spread from person to person within a culture or population— which can influence our desires and aspirations.

Memetic desire refers to adopting another person's wishes or goals as our own, often unconsciously. Social media platforms provide us with an unprecedented number of these models to contend with, and society is still grappling with the implications for mental and emotional health. There are two main types of memetic models:

1. **External mediators of desire**: These are influencers, celebrities, or even fictional characters who exist outside our direct social sphere and have no direct competition with us. While they can inspire positive change, their influence is often limitless and can lead to an unquenchable thirst for more, as there's always another model to aspire to.

2. **Internal mediators of desire**: These are people from our own lives—family, friends, colleagues—with whom we have direct contact. Comparison with these individuals is more immediate and can lead to envy or rivalry.

The danger with external models is that the pursuit of their ideals can be endless and unsatisfying, as it's based on the premise of always striving for something beyond our current state. It's crucial to recognize the limitations of these models and to choose them wisely. They should ideally represent virtues and goodness we aspire to, rather than unrealistic standards that could lead to a cycle of dissatisfaction.

Internal models require us to set boundaries, as their influence can be more personal and impactful on our daily lives. We must discern whether these models are positive and conducive to our well-being or if they incite desires that may not bring lasting fulfillment.

In summary, the memetic landscape of social media is a complex and powerful force that shapes our desires and aspirations. It's essential for individuals to critically assess the influence of both external and internal memetic models on their lives and to strive for a balance that promotes genuine happiness and well-being rather than endless striving for unattainable ideals.

Checking Big Think/Why the ultra rich get rich, explained in two charts ｜ Brian Klaas.txt
 The narrative that equates extreme wealth with super-genius is a myth that oversimplifies the complex dynamics between talent, luck, and financial success. Here's a summary of the points made:

1. **Talent Distribution vs. Wealth Distribution**: Unlike physical traits like height, which have a normal distribution, wealth does not follow the same pattern. It has a long tail, with a small number of individuals being extremely wealthy and a larger group with more modest incomes.

2. **Luck's Role**: In the fake world model created by physicists and an economist, luck plays a significant role in financial success. Talent is normally distributed, but when luck (like a "lightning strike") affects individuals, it disproportionately impacts those who are near the average level of talent due to statistical probability.

3. **The Simulation**: In simulations where talent and luck interact, the richest individuals often turn out to be those with above-average talent who have also been fortunate enough to experience a second lucky event. This contrasts with the idea that extremely wealthy people are necessarily the most talented.

4. **Complex Dynamics**: There are many factors beyond talent and luck that contribute to wealth, such as being born into a wealthy family or having a supportive network.

5. **Self-Perception**: Many extremely wealthy individuals attribute their success solely to their own talent and hard work, often underestimating the role of luck and other external factors.

6. **Elon Musk Example**: Individuals like Elon Musk, who have been successful in certain areas, may overestimate their capabilities and assume their skills are transferable to any field they enter. Their success in some ventures and failures in others demonstrate that talent alone does not guarantee success across the board.

7. **Greed**: A thirst for more money can drive individuals to pursue greater wealth, leading to a cycle of accumulation. This greed can also contribute to risky behavior and overconfidence.

8. **Societal Misconceptions**: The myth that equates genius with financial success perpetuates a misunderstanding of how talent and wealth are related. It ignores the arbitrary nature of their correlation and sometimes unfair disparities between talent and economic outcomes.

In essence, the path from talent to wealth is not direct or evenly correlated. It's influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including luck, societal structures, and personal traits like greed and overconfidence.
