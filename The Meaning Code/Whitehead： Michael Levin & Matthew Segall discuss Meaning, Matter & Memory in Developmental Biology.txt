I'm so humbled and thrilled to be here today with Matthew Siegel and Michael Levin.
Just to give a brief introduction of each of them, Michael Levin is an American developmental
and synthetic biologist at Tufts University, where he is the Vannevar Bush Distinguished
Professor, Director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts and at the Tufts Center for
Regenerative and Developmental Biology.
He's also Co-Director of the Institute for Computationally Designed Organisms with
Josh Bongard.
Dr. Levin received dual bachelor's degrees in computer science and biology from Tufts
University and a PhD in genetics from Harvard University.
His group uses computational and experimental approaches, and this is very important because
that's basic for Dr. Levin, is that things have an experimental approach to understanding
diverse intelligence in a range of evolved, engineered and hybrid living systems.
And they develop conceptual frameworks for understanding cognition in unconventional
embodiments, such as the collective intelligence of cells and use them to drive applications
in birth defects, regenerative medicine, cancer and synthetic bioengineering.
And Matthew David Siegel is a transdisciplinary researcher, author and teacher applying process
philosophy across the natural and social sciences, including the study of consciousness.
He's Associate Professor in the Philosophy, Cosmology and Consciousness Program at California
Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, California.
You can find out more about his research and writing at footnotes2plato.com, that's a two,
and also on Twitter, which where I have a lot of interesting conversations with both of
these gentlemen.
So I'm really thrilled to have both of you here.
Welcome to the meeting code.
Nice to be here.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thanks, Karen.
And I had asked each of you to talk about what you might like to learn from each other.
And now where did I put it?
Oh, this is great.
I had the questions right in front of me, but you probably remember what your questions
were.
So maybe I'll just let you get started.
I know that, Matt, you had a question about Dr. Levin's basic viewpoint of, I can't believe
I lost that thing.
It's a problem with paper.
Yeah, that's the problem with paper.
So I'm going to let you get started now.
Why don't you ask your big question that you had, and then maybe by that time I'll be able
to find number two.
Sure.
Yeah.
So, you know, I think whenever philosophers and scientists enter into dialogue, it's important
to clarify the relationship between these disciplines, right, and make sure that we're
working from the same basic sense of how we can learn from each other.
And so, you know, from my point of view, as a philosopher seeking a metaphysical scheme
in terms of which we can interpret every aspect of our experience, including science,
I'm not here to try to sort of tell scientists what the proper concepts to use in approaching
and operationalizing certain knowledge sets.
I'm here to learn from science and to generalize from what the special sciences are telling
us, including biology and physics and the special sub-disciplines within biology and
physics, and to generalize from those findings so that we can learn what the implications
are for the broader questions of the nature of the universe.
And I'm also interested in sort of looking at the epistemological presuppositions of
science, because I think historically, since the scientific revolution in the 17th century
and the basically mechanistic and reductionistic approach that drove science so successfully
for a few centuries, there was a sense in which the kind of universe that scientists
were describing didn't really allow for human minds that were coming up with all this knowledge.
And so, part of what I would want to do as a philosopher is understand nature, drawing
on science, such that mind would be something likely to be possible in this universe.
Because obviously, if science is possible, there must be intelligent minds in the universe.
And so we don't really want, I think it's a problem if our science is describing the
universe in a way that makes minds highly, highly unlikely.
And so that's why I'm so excited about your work, because you're trying to generalize
this notion of mind and agency and intelligence, so that in some ways goes all the way down.
That there's a continuum and gradual development through processes of evolutionary learning,
so that the scientists can understand themselves as an example of the very type of systems
that they're studying, right?
And so, I think my first question for you, Michael, would be, is this how you would understand
the relationship between philosophy and science ideally, or do you see it somewhat differently?
Yeah, no, I see it quite similarly.
And to me, the key fact that tells us how to think about these areas, science and philosophy
together, is basically the fact of developmental biology.
So if not for that, we could have two divergent worlds, and many people think we do have these
two worlds where we think about classical philosophy of the adult, the human, the moral
agent and things you know, and so on.
And then there's physics and chemistry and things like that.
And the thing that ties these together in a remarkable way is developmental biology,
each one of us has taken that journey from chemistry and physics to being a complex
metacognitive mind.
And that happens slowly and gradually, and you can watch it happen with your own eyes.
In the case of a frog, you can watch the whole thing from beginning to end.
In the case of a human, it takes a little more instrumentation, but you can still watch it.
And so each of us was once a quiescent oocyte, a little blob of chemistry.
And now we are whatever it is that we are, and that process happens slowly.
So to me, these things are fundamentally merged because whatever philosophical approaches we
have to what we are and how we should think about the outside world and so on, we have to
realize that we are continuous with what we call chemistry and physics and supposedly
mindless matter, which I'm not sure there is any such thing.
But right.
And so that continuity, I find just binds the two fields in a way that cannot be be untangled.
I like it.
Yeah, definitely.
Because developmental morphogenesis has been not totally left out of our understanding
of biology, but it's taken kind of a backseat in the 20th century with the focus on genetics.
And I think your work is blazing a trail in terms of bringing these factors back into
the picture, which I think really does change our understanding of evolution more as a learning
process and not just a passive selection mechanism that neo-Darwinism would suggest.
And I think that's, it's so exciting to see how you're moving the ball forward on that.
Yeah, I mean, another, you know, another thing, another area of interaction is that I think a
lot of, I mean, most of this was already available, you know, sort of conceptually, but now practically,
we can really show that a lot of categories that people who are having these sort of philosophical
and conceptual discussions, people throw around categories, a machine versus a living organism,
right? So people will say, well, machines can't this and that living organisms can do this and
that and robots is something else and evolved versus engineered completely different, like
to taking evolution seriously, taking developmental biology, bioengineering,
taking these things seriously tells you immediately that those categories are no good,
right? These binary crisp categories that people love to philosophize about,
I don't think there's any argument to be made anymore that they so-called carve nature at the
joints. They're just not, you know, we can now do lots of experiments that tell you immediately
that if you're operating with those categories, you're tied up in knots. You've got pseudo problems
that you're never going to resolve with that frame of looking at things. And so I also like that. I
like the fact that these advances, so I kind of see the philosophy and the science as a spiral
because they help each other out, right? And so they sharpen and a lot of people don't see it
that way. I've had many people tell me, you know, I'll talk about some data, some something we've
discovered and people will say, that's pretty cool, but I wish you wouldn't talk about all this
philosophy stuff, like that just like don't do any of that, just give us the science and the data.
And it's kind of like the old joke of telling the publisher, you know, we'll just publish all the
bestsellers. Like, right, after we've done the thing, then you can say, well, I see how this
works. Well, then we don't need philosophy. But we only did that thing because of a particular,
you know, philosophical way of looking at things. And that's why I think it's really critical. I
think the philosophy is absolutely critical. And I think the empirical work is critical. And together,
they can they can spiral up, I think. Well, so Michael, one of the one of the
philosophical questions that you wanted to ask, Matt, you said Plato's space of forms,
which is becoming increasingly more relevant as we discover ways to probe the latent space around
biological objects, and find forms and behaviors that cannot be explained by evolutionary
selection histories. And I just wanted to clarify the question a little bit when you talked about
the latent space around biological objects. Are you talking about the same kind of thing where
Anna Soto talks about the impact of the environment or the matrix in which something develops or
Darcy Thompson's work on attractor spaces? Or do you mean something else when you say latent space?
Closer to what Darcy, so I think Thompson was on to this in an important way. But I think it's
not quite what Anna says. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about.
People often ask me, where do the solar, let's just talk about anatomies, but it's also true for
behavior and physiology and so on. Specific anatomical target morphology, like a particular,
let's say, let's say a salamander limb or an embryo that has a particular shape. And if you
deviate it from that shape, it will regenerate and try to get back to that shape when it gets
back to that shape, it stops. So these sorts of set points for these kind of homeostatic
capabilities, people often ask, where do those come from? So where does the shape come from?
And the typical answer is for most natural things, the answer is, well, evolution, selection. So the
reason frogs look froggy is because for eons, they were selected for this particular shape that
fits a particular niche, solves a set of problems successfully and survives, and that's where it
comes from. It comes from that history. But now we know, and again, really, we knew this before,
but now we can really, it's right in our face now, that we can make, for example, xenobots,
or which have a wild type frog genome and they have a novel structure, they have novel behaviors
like kinematic self-replication that nobody's seen before in the living world. We can make all kinds
of unusual novel constructs. And the question is, where do those forms come from? Because the answer,
well, eons of selection is clearly wrong in this case. I mean, the cells, of course, did evolve
on Earth, but they didn't evolve in the context of being selected to be a good xenobot. There's
never been any good xenobots, and so there's never been selection to be a good xenobot.
And so you have many examples where there are new ways to solve problems, new forms,
new behaviors, new physiological competencies that arise out of some space of possibilities,
of which the standard example that we're looking at, let's say a particular embryo,
is just one little tiny glimpse of that space. And of course, people have studied developmental
plasticity before, and here are several different ways that this plant can come out,
depending on the water level of the environment and things like that. This is more than that.
This isn't just developmental plasticity. This is pushing cells into coherent,
large-scale behaviors in various spaces, including anatomical space, physiological space,
and so on, that have never existed before, and that you can't predict from the genome,
and you can't predict from many examples that I go through in my paper. So when people ask,
where do these things come from, it's kind of a subtle thing. And I always lean back to,
on this example, the Galton board, so you take a board and you bang them at your nails into it,
and you take a bucket of marbles, and you dump them in, and they go boom, boom, boom, boom,
and then they land on the bottom, well, they always land in this beautiful bell curve,
right? You always get the same shape. And so you could ask the same question,
where does that shape come from? And you could say, well, is it in a wood? Not really. Is it in
the description of the nails and the metal of the nails? No, not really. To me, it sounds like,
and Andreas Wagner is another biologist who talks about this stuff, it comes from the same place
where the truths of mathematics come from. It comes from the same place that tells you what
the distribution of crimes is, and the truths of number theory, and all this stuff that isn't
anywhere in the physical world. In fact, all the facts of the physical world, I think, could be
completely different, and all those things would still be true. So to me, it sounds like we're
right back to, and I think Thompson was onto this, in particular, the part of his book where
he draws animals on these grids, and then he does this deformation of these, these mathematical
deformation of these grids, and what you get is other existing species. I mean, we've done
things like this too, in the lab, we've actually done this, and this really does suggest that there's
some kind of a latent space, and now actually the machine learning folks are all over this stuff,
because you can, you can, just as a modern example, with one of these,
one of these programs that draws, it makes pictures from words, right? And so you can say,
I want this and that in the style of, I don't know, Salvador Dali, or Mark Shigala, whatever,
and it'll give you something in that style. So that's already cool that it can, you know, go
outside of the particular paintings that that person had done, but you can also make up a name,
and you can say, you know, I want, I want 10 paintings in the style of, you know, whatever,
and they'll give you paintings that all look like they come from somebody with the same style.
Where is that? They're not copying that from some particular person that they've seen before,
they're exploring this latent space that they've constructed by looking at other examples of art.
So this notion of having a space into which we can only see little tiny glimpses by the
few examples that we've seen, I think is really important. And I'd love to hear what, you know,
I certainly don't have a background in classical philosophy. So I'd love to hear,
you know, what did people say about this for mathematics for? Because I think, because in the
end, I think that's, it matters a lot. For example, is evolution really searching
this, the very difficult space of microstates for biological systems? I don't think so. What I
think evolution is searching for is a much nicer space of simple machines that pull down
all kinds of free gifts from the laws of physics, the laws of computation, the laws of geometry.
And what evolution does is optimize the hardware. But there's a ton of heavy lifting that is done
elsewhere, so to speak. I lack the vocabulary for it really. But, you know, it's like a final
example. And then I'll, you know, I'd love to hear what Matthew thinks. Just as a dumb example,
suppose you're evolving a triangle, a particular kind of triangle, right? There's an environment
and only that kind of triangle is really fit. And so you crank through a bunch of generations of
the population and you finally find that first angle and that works. And then you crank through
some more and you find the second angle, you're done. You don't need to look for the third angle
because the three angles of a triangle have to add up to 180. So it's not philosophy. It's very
practical. Evolution just saved one-third of its effort in finding that solution. You didn't need
to look for it. Why didn't you need to know? Where did that come from? That amazing...
And the same thing, you know, the same thing that we see in Zanibats and these other
creatures where you make a very small change and you get a lot, quote unquote, for free
with novelty, right? It's very likely that the evolutionary history had never seen before.
So that aspect that that's what I'm really curious about is where does all this stuff come from?
Can we use these synthetic biology and other AI for sure and then synthetic bioengineering
as a kind of telescope to sort of peer around that space and dig around and see what else is there?
Can we map out the structure of that space the way that mathematicians... I saw a map of
mathematics ones where they sort of have all the different fields of math and how they relate
to each other. So, you know, that's just one of the things that's up there. There's probably
all kinds of other things in that latent space. So anyway, that's what I'm asking about.
Yeah. So Plato obviously had his theory of forms and as a high-level summary of what I think needs
to happen here is we need to evolutionize Plato. And so the problem with Plato's view is it was
this static realm of ideas and everything physical in our experience is a pale imitation or an attempt
to mimic this perfect realm of forms and they're eternal, right? They never change and the ancient
Greeks had a very static understanding of nature. There was no speciation. It was pretty much
essentialist in the sense that the organisms that exist now all have their proper place in this
teleological order. This would be to speak in more Aristotelian terms, but Aristotle is kind of
like the first Neoplatonist and so there's a lot of continuity here. There's this great chain of
being in Aristotle's view of the cosmos, right? From minerals to plants to animals to humans
and then on up to this sort of super lunar sphere of higher types of beings on up to
the thought thinking itself, which would be like this divine mind
that everything else sort of emanates from. Now to evolutionize this Platonic or Aristotelian view
is kind of like tipping it out at side and horizontalizing what was conceived of in this
vertical way and showing how these forms can emerge in the course of evolutionary history,
but there's a lot to work out in the details here about how this actually works and I think
in the 20th century the best figure I've been able to find who's addressing these issues is
Alfred North Whitehead who you know Karen shared the name of my blog Footnotes to Plato. He's the
one who famously says all of Western philosophy is a series of footnotes or can be understood
as a series of footnotes to Plato, but Whitehead really wants to evolutionize Plato and the way
he does this is by pointing out that mechanistic science and we can talk about the mechanism organism
thing. I'll just briefly say I think that organic thinkers don't dismiss mechanism,
they say it's a subset of this more general self-organizing dynamic. Obviously living organisms
need to make use of mechanisms to do what they do, but when you flip it and talk about what
mechanistic thinkers tend to say they don't think there's any such thing as organism,
it's all just purposeless mechanisms that kind of fall together into place because of a series
of accidents that get preserved in the biological world because they're selected
because of the enhanced fitness that they provide. So from Whitehead's point of view,
mechanistic science that dismissed any or didn't really take self-organization seriously and was
more just the parts fall into place because of eternal laws. This mechanistic approach to science
was based totally on what Aristotle called efficient causes, the sort of things banging
into each other and had no room for formal or final causation and there was good reason for
in the history of science and the emergence of science for the first scientists to really want
to distance themselves from this idea of purpose in nature and teleology and whatnot because the
sort of scholastic way that those ideas were deployed was kind of naive and
inhibited our understanding of the natural world around us and so it turned out when you
bracket questions of purpose and final causality and stuff and just study nature as if it were
determined by efficient causes and you use mathematical modeling to do that, you can make
a lot of progress especially in terms of instrumental knowledge, like you can develop models that are
highly predictive and so we can get all sorts of technology out of this and that's been the story
of science for the last few hundred years but when you leave out formal and final causes then you
end up in the problem I was describing when we first started that it's very difficult to understand
how science could be possible, how there could be minds like ours capable of doing science if
there's only efficient causation operating in this universe and so how do you bring formal
causality and final causality back into this naturalistic picture, I think that's the challenge
and Whitehead does that by describing evolution not just as a, I don't mean just biological
evolution, I mean a general picture of evolution cosmologically speaking, there's an accumulation
of facts in the past that just as a mechanist would say like Laplace or something, everything
that's happened in the past has an impact on what's happening in the present, just causal chain
of influence and so evolution is a process of the accumulation of all these facts of history but
there's also, there's possible forms open in the future that are, that field of possible
forms in the future is constantly being adjusted as these facts of the past accumulate but we
can't understand the relationship in the present between that past of facts and that future of
forms purely in terms of efficient causation because what's missing in the mechanistic picture is
the agency that's operative in the present that can search this field of possibilities in the future
and so the challenge is how to understand that agency in a naturalistic way that doesn't rely on
you know what Dan Dennett called skyhooks in Darwin's dangerous idea right which would be
a conception of final causality that would imagine it as a kind of disembodied mind reaching in as
if it can, as if it's in the future already and it's like a retro causality or something and it's
almost like construing final causality in term as though it were just another kind of efficient
causality but working in reverse from the future and I think we need a different way of imagining
final causality that doesn't just reduce it to what efficient causality is doing in reverse
and so obviously well maybe it's not obvious but in Whitehead's picture at least the future is
open he's not a deterministic thinker there is real room for novelty here despite the accumulation
of the facts of the past that influence what happens in the present and despite the fact that
the present must conform to the past there's room in the present for a kind of agency which
is operates differently at different scales depending on the complexity of the system
that's exhibiting this agency but what agency is is yes it's inheriting and conforming to the past
which is what constitutes memory but it's also searching the future and in the present there's
some kind of confluence between future forms of possibility and past facts that are already
actualized and Whitehead's whole philosophy is an attempt to what he it's an attempt to devise
what he calls a cell theory of actuality such that agency is always understood to operate
in a cellular way and he's using a biological metaphor here but he ends up generalizing it
beyond just biology to talk about quantum events using the same set of categories that we would
talk about cellular biology but also the same set of categories would also apply to our own
conscious experience of being conscious decision makers that there's a there's a single set of
categories that applies across all of these scales and it's about a continuum of agency
inheriting the past searching these this field of future possibilities and so when we think about
biological development and morphogenesis this is obviously a collective form of intelligence
that has a goal in mind as a collective and like where is that goal that that form that
finished form it like as you're always pointing out Michael the cells know when to stop growing
when they've reached this this form that they have in mind and on some level that form is inherited
by you could say the genome but it's obviously not totally stored in the genome because you
can change the genome and the form would still be there the cells will find it you could say
that it's stored in the whole environmental context in some ways and I mean and this this
is where I could pivot to your work with Chris Fields and others on the free energy principle
and the agency of the environment in all of this yeah which I'd love to hear more from you about
but but I'll pause there and see if these thoughts are landing no no yeah super interesting just
just on the on the last bit so the thing about the environment yes but the environment is massively
undetermined right so so xenobots live in basically the same empty water dish as as frog embryos you
can't really pin the the shape of them on the environment per se the thing is that now now
now going back to you know where do these patterns store the funny thing is that we can now see them
so so we can actually see these so so just in the in the case of the planarian we can actually
visualize the pattern memory that tells them how many heads to have we have the technique you can
actually see it and that's and the reason we know that's what it is is that if you go ahead and rewrite
that pattern they'll build something else they'll build animals with two heads or no heads or you
know so we I mean this is just scratching the surface of what's possible of course but we're
starting to unravel the actual like like that that idea that there's a representation and you know
of course molecular biologists don't like this at all because they like they like emergence and
complexity and that's it they don't they don't want to have the system that has some kind of
representation of a future state that it's working towards but we can actually see those in the same
way that neuroscientists can read the electrical activity of the brain and see those in the case
of you know behaving creatures so so so the information structures are there and we can sort
of start to uh decode some of their physical correlates but I wonder if so so this is the
thing I wanted to kind of ask you about uh I wonder if the whole the business with them you
know uh the the four the Aristotle and the four types of causes and all that could we is maybe
this is crazy but is it possible that what what if what if instead of having sharp categories
here are four different types of causes instead of that what if we draw we we put we put an agent
in this like and I like this diagram I use it for my cognitive light bone thing it's almost
the Minkowski diagram we've got the you know three dimensionals of space here one dimension of time
is here right and so you put your thing on and all you're gonna do instead of having sharp
categories what you're gonna do is have progressive distance from the here and now of this agent
so we could say you know if you're if you're a if you're a bowling ball what I really need to know
is the sum of the forces on you right now so so basically I'm operating on the causes that are in
a very tight um you know cone around that system if you're a mouse in a field uh it's not enough
for me to know what your experience what's around you right now because you may have memories and
previous experiences and all kinds of other stuff that's going to determine what you're going to do
and um uh right and and if and if you're a human the answer the best answer to why did you do what
you did might be something like world war two that's why it's right so so it might be this giant
thing that's far away in space and time and or you know and so if we if we back off from if we
back off from the idea that um you always have to look at the lowest level right which is you
know that that's kind of how um that's how Dan Dennett analyzes free will as he says look when
you zoom in you only see two things you see either either hard determinism or randoms neither of
those things is what we mean by free will so therefore okay that's I mean that works if if
you're committed to the fact that everything has to be at the lowest level if you back off to some
of the work you know for example Eric Hall and and Julia Tononi and and those kind of guys who are
now like showing very rigorously that there are many systems in which the higher levels tell a more
causally impotent story than the lowest levels then then it all becomes a matter of prediction
and control from some kind of outside observer and that observer can draw not necessarily for
specific um you know bands around this thing but just a smooth sort of so you can ask this question
like in order to understand this particular system how far away are in space and time are the causes
that I need to most efficiently relate to it that would be that would be how I would do phrase all
this I would say that it's not discrete it's continuous and as an engineer like that's my
approach to all this is as an engineer when you're telling me something about the cognitive makeup
of a system which are really or claims you know yeah it's intelligent or yet has a you know cognitive
capacities whatever what I am hearing are engineering protocols you're telling me that
I can rewire it or no you can do better than that you can read you can change the set points the
things the thermostat cool or no you can do better than that you can give it rewards and
punishments even better no you can do better than that you could give it um a co-cogent
arguments and it'll go and you know and so so what I hear what what I hear from these claims is uh
how far away do I need to what do I need to know in this space time diagram to be able to optimally
relate to that system so what do you think of that as a kind of you know as a way to like
modernize these these these sharp categories you know it always bothered me that they were
supposed to be like you know that they sound so discreet I just kind of see a distance
I think this idea of a kind of cognitive light gone as you call it is is wonderful and it's
very convergent with Whitehead's understanding of you know what he calls actual occasions of
experience and how they complexify over the course of of evolution because of the relationships that
they enter into which he calls societies or you know you call them collectives cell collectives
or what have you and so I think that's that's right on and I mean the thing about Aristotle's
four causes or reasons you could even translate the the Greek term he's using there is that these are
when you ask questions about entities or processes of nature for Aristotle like these
are the four basic ways that you can get at why something happens and it's not that there are
some sorts of entities that are purposeful and other sorts of entities that are not
um so the continuum you're trying to describe I think is perfectly consistent well I shouldn't
say perfectly consistent but it's at least in in fruitful conversation with the perspective
like that Aristotle will talk about but yeah at the end of the day you know he would differentiate
between like you know a human being has like different levels of agency and sort of ontological
layering within within them we have we have the mineral realm within us which is our
the matter we're made of and we also have the sort of plant like nature this vegetative soul
we have an animal like nature the sentient soul and then we also have this intellectual soul
which is where our reason comes from and you know yeah it's kind of they seem like separate
sorts of things when what we would want in an evolutionary context is more of a
continuum here but I think to do that to switch perspectives successfully we end up having to
say that whatever we mean by reason or rationality this capacity to be persuaded by arguments
in human beings obviously that depends on language and stuff but the the germ of whatever
that capacity is must be rooted pretty far deep in our biology if not even more deeply right and
so you have to bite that bullet if you want continuity I would say otherwise you end up
in a situation where again the epistemological presuppositions of science start to become
challenging because whatever mind is in human beings seems to be discontinuous with
our biology and the nature of the physical world out of which that biology
arises right does that does that problem make sense yeah yeah yeah it makes sense I mean the
discontinuity could I just jump in with two small things here to kind of help me clarify
what's happening um and also maybe to reduce some of these big ideas into something that's
one one big idea and that would be there's something that Jordan Peterson always says
which I think scales in every area of this and that is the ideal is the judge
and it's really a very simple idea and it doesn't have anything to do with
doesn't have anything to do with metaphysics actually he's he's talking at the scale of
psychology the idea of whatever it is that you want to be or whatever it is that you look at
that you admire is something that is constantly judging you because either you're not achieving it
or if you're moving towards it how close have you gotten or if you've overshot it how far did
you over shoot it so you're always adjusting to this ideal and I think that scales all the way down
to particles it scales all the way down to cells your morphogenesis when the undifferentiated cells
are given their subroutine and they go off to build an arm there's some sort of an ideal towards
which they're working and that ideal is constantly judging whether or not they're getting there and
as a collective they're working together towards that and and I think that this connects to this
idea that you have of the distance because with the bowling ball the distance is very short
the ideal distance is very short because those are physical laws that are absolutely determinative
but by the time you get up to the human scale we're affected not only by our own personal
history but by the history of the universe and everything that we think and do right so the
distance of the ideal is much further from us and that makes the path forward very much more complex
and this made me think about your xenobots what is it that causes that form for the xenobots it's
not the matrix that they're in because other things can arrive in that same matrix that they're
floating around in but there's another idea that I learned from art that was very important to me
and that is constraint or limitation produces creativity and the way they used to say in the
old days necessity is the mother of invention so the one thing that those xenobots have absolutely
is necessity they've been dumped in this medium and if they're going to live they're going to
continue living they've got to get together and do something so this collective intelligence
is being driven by necessity and necessity is producing the creativity that allows them to
find that form where the form exists I don't know but I think it's the necessity that's driving it
so that's very interesting I completely agree with the necessity bit and then I'll say something
about it but you know just for the for the xenobot example just so we're clear on the biology
actually the cells could have remained independent so when we when we dissociate all the skin cells
they could have sat there independently they could have done nothing they could have crawled
away from each other they could have formed a two-dimensional monolayer like in cell culture
there's many things they could have done so and they would have lived they would have they would
have continued to live they're not under under some kind of external survival pressure to join
up together okay well that's new information okay but yeah yeah they could have they could have
done other things but but I love the constraint idea and I like it for the following reason I mean
this this links up to something that that Matthew said a minute ago which is this when when you are
a brand new living being starting off in this in this universe one thing you don't have time or
energy to do is to track microstates like simuloplasty and demon you don't have the energy
to do that you don't you'll get eaten if you're sitting there trying to calculate all the microstates
so what you have is tremendous pressure selection pressure for systems that coarse grain and be
are able to see higher levels of what's going on around them so you need to organize your experience
and into and chunk it up into macroscopic states that you are then going to track and decide what
you're going to pay attention to and how you're going to prioritize it because if you if you if
you try to um uh if you if you try to track the microstates you'll be you'll be you'll be
you'll be for for two reasons one one is if you know just limitations of time and energy
and then there's a more interesting reason but but you'll you'll be dead very very quickly so
so I think there is this this this um the pressure of necessity I think drives the ability of life
to see higher levels this is cool I think that one of the reasons why chemists and physicists
often don't see that agency and the things they they're looking at is because they're using low
agency tools so so there needs to be some resonance between the thing you're probing the the world with
and and what you're hoping to see so if you're using rulers and magnetometers and things like
this these are very low agency tools all you're gonna ever see is low agency chemistry and physics
but life has agency detectors we have to because otherwise you can't survive and so what we have
are the ability to see these higher levels to do you know well or poorly but usually pretty well
they uh living things have to be able to um uh coarse grain in the in the world and then once
you see these things and you start to make models of their behavior um uh you know that's a cell and
it does certain things and that's my neighbor's cell and that's it does certain things or that's
a cat that does certain things then eventually you can sort of turn that around on on yourself and
say well I'm a thing and I do things I there's I have a model of myself as an agent and so
this leads to a weird kind of thing I proposed which is that any organism or being it might be
completely an engineer you know an engineer thing it doesn't have to be biological but
anything that evolves under resource constraint under necessity is going to fundamentally
believe in free will I'm not saying it has it I'm saying it believes in it because because
fundamentally in order to survive you have to be able to you have to get good at telling stories
about agents that do things you cannot survive with stories of uh all the particles to sort of
move around on you know underserved like that you you you will not live that way and so and so
anything that survives has to be good at telling these causal stories of agents with with agencies
you know and so uh and so that's I think that's how we get to this to this um in place where
where we are where where it's impossible for us to do things like you know you might say you
don't believe in free will for example but if we go to a restaurant and you know the waitress
comes along and she says you know what what what what are you going to have we don't have the
ability to sit back and see what the big bang ordained for us to eat today like you don't have
that ability you will just you know we we we are fundamentally do doers um because and I think
it it's because of that I think it's and and that's the thing I realized just last week is that
it's funny I I think I put all the emphasis in this kind of agency thing on the doing
but actually most of the field I think has been mostly talking about the feeling aspect
that not the output the input side because for example we have this idea of what's it like to
be right that's a famous thing in philosophy of mine and and we haven't we somebody came up with
a theory of epiphenomenalism this idea that we just feel stuff but we don't actually ever do
anything right that you know there is what's the opposite I'm not aware of that there's an opposite
of this you know so people have realized so people do have a theory of well maybe you're just perceiving
and and you know you really are but the rest of it is fiction but nobody's that I know of has
said it the other way around but but I actually think the doing is the is is you know the more
I mean of course they all work together but but but the doing is is also really critical
and that's why so so coming back to this um to to to something that Matthew was saying
I think one interesting thing if you if you do try just imagine for a second a being that was a
you know a being that is a Laplacian demon let's say it was possible I mean for many reasons it's
not but let's say it's possible one of the things that that that type of there are two
interesting things I think that that type of being couldn't do and they're related what one
thing they couldn't do is for example they couldn't play a game of chess with you because
all of the microstates of what happens next are equivalent to them in terms of their value
they there is they don't believe in chess pieces they don't believe in the chess board all they see
is atoms and there's no such thing as the king or the position of you know dominating the center
or all this other stuff and they don't believe in these in these higher level um uh they don't
track these these higher level things so how do they choose their next move how do they course
grain all the molecular things that come that that that are grouped into a move a valid move and in
fact the best next move uh you know all the microstates are they it's very I don't see how
they would have a preference over the microstates if they don't understand the groupings of
the macrostate and that leads that also leads me to uh to to this if you if if you're very good at
following uh like like a Laplacian demon you're very good at following what happens next any given
system that somebody prepares for you you can in a deterministic universe you could say what will
happen next you can do that but what you can't do is prepare the interesting system in the first
place you you are you are a passive you know this prediction but there's no pre-invention
and and just as a kind of a dumb example of this what I mean is you know there's this uh you know
the cellular automaton the game of life right so you got these very simple rules about whether
whether the individual pixels are on or off and then if you follow these rules our visual system
starts to see interesting things like gliders you know these patterns that go up and what somebody
and so and so what what somebody did was was uh create a configuration that results in the touring
machine that uses these gliders gliders as information signals I mean it's this amazing
giant thing but so so if you were a determinist in that world you could say there aren't any gliders
all there is is individual pixels turning on and off according to some rules and if you give me
a prepared starting condition I will tell you what all the what what it's going to do from here
to eternity I can calculate out this is true but what they're never going to do is is is design
the touring machine because they don't believe in gliders right and so I I think there is this this
it and it's you know it all stems from the same place which is that if you're going to be uh active
surviving interesting if you're if you're if you're going to persist in this world you have to get
good at coarse graining into mesoscale you can't just stay at the lower levels because because of
the because of the necessity that that that you were just talking about and you you're never going to
uh do anything uh you're always going to be reactive you're never going to set up any anything
interesting if you again for the same reason that the that the Laplacian demons are not going to
invent they can predict stuff you make but they're never going to you know have enough
preferences to make anything interesting of their own so that's you know that's that's that's what
I've been thinking about this necessity but I actually think it's really important well the
other thing determinists don't take into account is anomaly I mean that what you do when you when
you create a designer tadpole and you screw up their eyes or or you know something like that you
you've injected anomaly into the system but anomaly happens even without a scientist coming
along and injecting anomaly into the system anytime you trip over a rock or or anytime
a wind comes along and pushes the bowling ball off the off the rack or something anomaly has come
in and that has set up something that has disturbed things when you take uh when you take a zygote and
you scratch through it and then all of a sudden you have two and maybe zygote is the wrong word but
anyway you end up with with two organisms instead of one organism developing um those are the
injection of anomaly into the system and um the thing that has always fascinated me is
way all these things scale all the way from social systems through humans down to particles
and what got me onto that is my own study of um creativity and the elements and principles of
design seems to be a key that I can use to interpret Whitehead or Jordan Peterson or or you with with
um with your work in developmental and regenerative medicine and so forth and Jordan Peterson's book
maps of meaning is particularly interesting to me because I can read a paragraph from there and
I can say oh this is exactly what Michael Levin is talking about I just want to read you one sentence
here the change that upsets and this would be an anomaly the change that upsets the presently
predictable and orderly also means potential or advancement into a more promising future
the unexpected is information itself information necessary for the constant expansion of adaptive
competence so all all the adaptivity that you're talking about that seems to be built into
organisms that allows them to face risk or anomaly or or danger or
someone injecting change into the system that's actually advancing information it's creating
more opportunity even if it creates more risk down the road and I think determinists don't
accept that maybe they don't maybe they think anomalies are also determined I mean yeah I
think that's what they would say right I think I think they would say that the wind that pushed
the bowling ball could have been if you if you could just track those air molecules you know in
and of course you know chaos the theory makes that very very hard in practice but but I think
I think they that's that's what they would say if you can you can look at a human situation
if somebody sets off a bomb someplace and and that has ramifications in a thousand different
directions for all the people and for the infrastructure and for the atmosphere and
all of those things was that also determined because that has injected anomaly into everything
everywhere but I think you know just to sort of steel man it a little bit I think what they would
say is that if you were tracking the molecules in that person's head you would have been able to
predict it that's what they would say that it's you know there's some neurotransmitters that
zigged instead of zagged and you should have been able to predict that this whole issue for me of
determinism in the scientific picture of of the universe is I think a side effect of this kind
of deistic hangover all the first scientists were deists right and so god is this external engineer
set the laws of physics and then the the universe just rolls forward a bunch of atoms you know
obeying these laws of physics and and for Newton or Descartes god doesn't reach in and
have to tinker with the machine because the machine was designed by this perfect being
to just be able to do everything it does without any interference and this deistic picture of god
I think plays into the some of the epistemological presuppositions of this type of science that the
observer is imagined to be outside the system reaching in tinkering and so on and 20th century
science from physics on up has just demolished the idea that an observer can passively measure
a system when we observe a system we're part of the very same system that we're trying to observe
you can't even you know in quantum theory this is it's on the one hand doesn't need to be a big
mystery that you need to use photons to measure a quantum system and that the photons going to
interfere with the system you're trying to measure and so you end up with limitations on the amount
of information you can get because you're changing what you want to measure by trying to measure it
and it's it's like kind of obvious but because there is this again a sort of deistic theology
underlying science for a few hundred years it's very easy to leave this idea out or this
it's not even an idea it's a fact that to measure something you got to get in there and interfere
with the system and so I like to say we need to reimagine science like reimagine physics
as endophysics like we're within what we're trying to study biology endobiology we're within
what we're trying to study and a lot that has a lot of implications but if I can go back to the
comment from Jordan Peterson about the ideal because I think I know he's read some Whitehead
he references him once in a while it seems to me though I wouldn't say that the ideal
is the judge I would say that the agent is the judge and the ideal is the standard
upon which that judgment is based and this gets back to Whitehead's view of
what these platonic forms are Whitehead calls them eternal objects he says that they're deficient
in actuality and he doesn't want to grant these forms any causal power all the causal power
in Whitehead's universe comes from actual occasions which are the agents and so
that means we can't say that the ideal is the judge the ideal is a lure that the agencies
are lured by and so decisions are made by agents right the ideal isn't where the judgment is coming
from but when we when we start to really have this scale-free conception of agency and of mind
you know we begin to be able to look at physical processes like gravity or entropy and say oh
okay this is a very minimal form of of purpose and if you don't use purpose it has direction
and all you need is this little bit of directionality at that level and then you can begin to evolve
higher forms of purpose which have a larger cognitive light cone right but this is a very
different picture of of the universe from what science where science started and I almost think
science needed to bracket purpose and agency and mind from its picture of nature for a few
hundred years to go as far as it could with that sort of a picture yeah but it's right it ran up
against walls in the early 20th century and we're still trying to figure out how to revise and
reimagine science I mean scientists have gone about doing wonderful work even without it's really
the metaphysics and the cosmology underlying science that needs to change because mechanistic
cosmology is is deism basically and we need a more I would say more organic cosmology to
understand how mind has been part of this process from the get-go and there's this kind of evolutionary
continuum to human types of minds but one more thing I want to say to pick up on what you were
saying Michael about epiphenomenalism and you know when it comes to consciousness studies and
philosophy of mind and neuroscience and how we approach this challenge of the place of
consciousness and in in nature epiphenomenalism seems to me to be a non-starter because if we
do want an evolutionary explanation we need to understand consciousness as something that has
a causal role to play in the behavior of organisms because if there is no behavioral
implication of this thing called consciousness then there's no way for it to be selected for
evolutionarily speaking and we shouldn't be conscious in other words right if it's just
epiphenomenal even if that is a total illusion it only seems like we're conscious and really it's
just the playing out of biochemical forces as many philosophers have pointed out who are usually like
panpsychists the seeming is precisely what we mean by consciousness and so if you can't explain the
seeming then you're ignoring part of the evidence that's there to be explained and so most science
has been for good reason the study of behavior observable measurable behavior kind of third
person perspective on things as if we were outside the system when you start to study
consciousness you're putting yourself back inside the system you have to take this first person
point of view and from the inside out thinking feeling willing these sorts of concepts become
really important that's the lingua franca of the interior domain which is what we're pointing to
with words like consciousness as vague as they might seem initially and so what is the place of
thinking and feeling and willing in nature we see behavior some of this behavior has clear
um can be understood as a goal seeking type of behavior and that has um that can be empirically
demonstrated like you know in the ways that you're doing it michael but this doesn't mean we
can't also ask the question from the other point of view the first person point of view about
thinking feeling and willing i think they always go together um i don't mean to make sharp categories
between distinctions between these things but when we talk about thinking though
we're more than just and this was a email exchange karen and i had we're more than just um human beings
any any any organism but especially human beings were more than just perceiving beings you know and
because there would be a kind of in the philosophical sense and this empiricist point of view that
says that all of our concepts and our ideas and our thinking is really just faded sense impressions
so we all we really do is perceive the world and then we we have these abstract ideas which are just
faded um perceptions that we remember and they we generalize these perceptions so that they start
to seem something like a concept but if that's the case if and this is what like david hume would
argue right if that's the case if we really only have that kind of access to the world around us
then our experience is very subjective and i start to wonder if natural science could
be possible if we can really take scientific law and scientific rationality seriously as anything
more than just a nice story that we tell ourselves that sometimes has practical payoff and maybe
you're maybe some of us are happy with that as what science is but i would want there to be more
theoretical heft to scientific explanation and i think to get there you need to take thinking
seriously that in other words we have concepts where not just perceiving beings but conceiving
beings and what a concept is or an idea is is exactly the same thing that that we mean when
we talk about an ideal or about these forms that cellular communities are are moving towards when
we think we're participating in this realm of forms and these are universal we all share the
same set of forms right and so what agency and experience would be then is the sort of
confluence between what we perceive which is always in terms of particular perceptions
the confluence of these particular perceptions with these universal concepts
and they meet and mingle uh and synthesize in the context of our experience but it's only
if we have access to these types of universals that we can really do science that we can talk about
law uh and then we can make explanations which would not just be useful explanations that's
important too and it's a criterion for what successful science is that this has instrumental
operationalizable payoff but that these are also true right and so i resist the idea like
you know the kind of work that donal hoffman is doing is really interesting and i think on some level
um it's accurate but i won't i can't go all the way with them because it again
undermines the epistemological presuppositions of science itself if we put ourselves in that
kind of a simulation right so yeah wanted to touch on all those things and see what see what lands
yeah yeah very very interesting um well a couple i want to say a couple things and one is uh
that uh this distinction you know first person third person i i also think that and i i haven't
seen a lot on this i don't know if somebody's already looked and looked at this before but um
i think i think actually this should be a lot of emphasis on second person which is that i think
a lot of this is actually driven by attempts to get some biology hacking each other right so every
cell is some other cells external environment every cell is trying to behave your shape its
neighbors and um you know trying to tell the trying to get get your neighbor whether that be
a commensal a parasite doing something to the host uh multi cells in a multicellular organism
creatures in a group whatever at every scale uh there's a lot of stuff going on at second in
second person which means you're trying to get somebody to do something and then trying to get
them to do something and trying to be efficient so you don't uh dispel all your energy and die
you need to have a decent model of what are they what is the what is the most
complicated thing they're capable of doing for the with the least amount of prompting for me
so it's very an engineering i see all of biology as as a fundamentally having a very
engineering perspective so when i look at something i ask how much competency can i
squeeze out of this thing so that it will do what i wanted to do without me there to micromanage
all of it like well how far can i go right and and that then once you're good at those kind of
things you can turn that back on yourself and you can tell a nice first person story well hey i'm
complex then i can do interesting things and right and so i think a lot of this stems from
this kind of second person necessity of life and then we can go back and and apply that same lens
to you know what you were talking about uh from physics all the way up like you know oftentimes
people people have asked me um you know in my framework is there a zero on the on the spectrum
right like is there any non-agential events in the universe and you know i think all the way back to
like uh just action principle yeah yeah yeah yeah right i like it like a dumb rock role you know
they always say well how about a rock rolling down the hill you know you don't want to say that's
coming i say well it's not much but it isn't zero because if i'm an engineer and i'm building a
roller coaster i have to work pretty hard to get the thing up the up to the top but but what i don't
have to spend any time worrying about is getting it to the bottom so i've just saved myself some
effort as an engineer by having a frame where this thing has some competency now it isn't much it
isn't you know the human level but of course it wouldn't be because we're looking for the minimum
right so so with these least action kind of things even particles do this kind of stuff
and there and then so then then you might think that it's there's a non-zero minimum
and then what the things we call life are the things that are good at scaling that up right so
if you just put a pile of them into a rock you haven't really scaled anything it's exactly the
same as what you started with just bigger but if but if but what life does is actually scale them up
into this hierarchical architecture where they can now do more in other problem spaces and what
not and we call that when things are good at that that's what we call living that's kind of my
definition of life and so yeah you know this kind of second person attempt to control things
in past messages is that that that engineering approach on all of this is you know it's kind
of what I what I see everywhere yeah I think I heard Chris Fields in one of your recent
conversations with him say something like that physics is really you can understand it in terms
of the kind of communications theory yeah yeah yeah absolutely and and so so I mean he's the expert
on this certainly not me but I think that this is different from the typical I mean the thing
people typically don't like about panpsychist views is that they see it as painting extra glow
onto perfectly good physics right so you've got a perfectly good physics that does everything you
want it to do and then we say oh and by the way also there's this other dongle that the kind of
hangs on to that this this conscious thing so people don't like that but but that's actually
you know people like Chris and Carl Friston and various others that isn't what they're doing they're
trying to actually redefine physics in a more useful way where the primary thing is the thing
that we're talking about here right the agential stuff is and so that's a completely different
thing and that's and and the judge there is going to be empirical utility it's not this this kind of
you know epiphenomenal glow that you paint onto stuff it actually has to work and I mean I think
I think it's done you know I think I think lots of interesting things have come of it I've asked
Chris once is it possible could could we design a universe that really had a zero you know that
had no least action all that and he said the only universe you can do that in is one where
nothing ever happens so a completely static universe that then you could say it's zero but
as soon as you have things interacting at least in ways that we understand you know and then
then that's it you're you're you're not zero anymore and you know with respect to like the
Hoffman stuff I mean I don't know I I think that part part of it is that and people sometimes
also ask like is it possible that we're living in a simulation or something like I'm like I don't
see any other alternative because we are we are very limited very specific types of cognitive
systems we are good with you know medium-sized objects moving at medium speeds through three
dimensional space we see a tiny slit of of the electromagnetic spectrum of the auditory whatever
we we don't seem you know we don't feel other things at all so it's kind of inevitable that
we're going to have some sort of perspective on these things that to what extent you know I
agree with you that I think it is picking out real things in the world but I think that almost by
you know I don't see any way around the this idea that what we're picking out is the low
hanging fruit for the kind of cognitive system that we have and then you know and then if there
was another you know that's that that comes up a lot in AI where people say they want human
understandable models they they don't like AI's that make good predictions but we can't figure out
why it is and I mean I get it we it's nice to have human understandable models but I don't see
any reason to expect that the vast bulk of the things that we want to understand are going to be
human understandable right I'm just not sure like just because we are a particular kind of like who
said you know if somebody said here's a you know here's a here's a planet of you know chimps
and and and you know and you would say yeah there's a whole bunch of stuff they're just not going to
get I'm not sure that we're you know I'm not sure we're past some sort of critical mass where okay
now we can really just understand everything I think it's entirely possible that we have a
particular lens and that lens is good enough as Don points out and then there are other kinds of
cognitive systems out there maybe maybe AI's will do it maybe there's some aliens out there or something
but but but other possible minds that are going to do a very different job of carving up the world
you know. If again if we were just perceptual beings I think everything that Hoffman is saying
would be absolutely true and I'm not trying to create a dualism here but it seems to me that
our thinking activity when we're doing science when we're reasoning about the world in any way
allows us to connect up percepts in meaningful and and intelligible ways so a concept is really a
it's a connection between percepts. My robot vacuum just decided to turn on so I think where's the
door? I know it's like hey I'm an agent over here. A concept is a connection between percepts.
Right and so without this activity that's able to and it's because we're not just remembering
how percepts have related to each other in the past because we're also capable of novelty
we're capable of adapting to new situations and so there's some other poll here to the
process of agency that's not just about perception and but but that perceptual poll
is definitely highly contingent on the type of sensory organs we have and on the type of
common sense way of amalgamating those different perceptual streams into a picture of a three
dimensional world of moving bodies and we get habituated to that world and that common sense
way of perceiving things but all I would say is that because we have this conceptual thinking
capacity there's no limit sort of a priori limit to the knowledge that we can gain of the world
around us right. We're limited as a matter of fact but in principle we can always overcome
any limit that seems to be in place whether we can get to the final truth of the nature or
everything I don't know but it seems to me that there's a pathway forward we have good reason
to believe that by engaging in this process of thinking we can discover new things about the
perceptual world that are not just there in the past as memory and habit that we've accumulated
right and I don't want to get all spooky and mystical but you you know Karen you brought up
Jordan Peterson he will often reference the logos the idea of this this ordering principle
in the cosmos and whatever morpho space is I think it has something to do with this ordering
principle and many traditions have referred to it as the logos and our thinking activity I think
is in some ways a participation in that ordering principle finite participation in an ordering
principle that's far vaster and more magical and mysterious than humans have yet even scratched
the surface of but nonetheless I think there is this deeper intelligibility in the nature of things
which if it if it weren't real science would not be possible right. Well the way to keep the
ordering principle from being spooky is to just think about it the way he thinks about it which is
at the at the border between order and chaos is this capacity to either move into chaos voluntarily
or fall into chaos accidentally and in the chaos there are all kinds of answers because all the
answers lie in the unknown all the new information lies in the unknown and that that's the ordering
principle gathering what's necessary from the unknown to bring it back into the known so that
the order becomes new again and does not remain static but still has that dynamic quality that
keeps it fresh that that's the ordering principle and I don't think that's spooky at all because
that also scales all the way down when you can see that everywhere.
Yeah yeah and I think that the challenge here is to avoid falling prey to
what Dan Dennett was so critical of this idea of skyhooks and you know I think this is why
we need to zero in on agency and recognize that whatever agency is it's operating at all scales
it grows more capable as it evolves because it learns how to dip further into this
space of possibilities and it knows how to do so not just as a matter of
you know ingressing novelty but as a matter of ingressing relevant novelty like agents can
human beings can dip into this set of unrealized possibilities in a way that is not just
chaotic but relevant to the past and that the real evolutionary challenge for agents is
is the ingression of relevant novelty because there's infinite possibilities
and we need to know as agents in any given moment of our experience which of those possibilities
have relevance to our actual situation and that's a that's a problem that I think
an evolutionary understanding and a an understanding of evolution as a pedagogical
process of of gradually learning about you know like what John Revekey would call relevance
realization and ratcheting up this capacity and it's a collective effort and I like Michael
your emphasis on second person I think that's right I think that's where all the action is
and we can talk about these two poles of the first and the third person but it's that relationship
the relationality the communication where all the action is and so this is why agency is never
just something that an individual does agency and intelligence even are always collective
efforts and I think for but for cells
to engage in this collective effort there needs to be something that they all
share right some kind of ordering principle that they're all capable of participating in
and that's the mystery I feel like that's what we're bumping up against here
and what we need new concepts to get a handle on and in a way that doesn't
certainly doesn't revert to the sort of essentialist teleology that scholastics
pre-evolutionary thinkers we're talking about but we need to we need to revisit some of those
ideas a platonic realism and again you know reimagine it in an evolutionary context because
we can't move forward without some understanding of ideals forms right I'd like to ask Michael here
when you were using this this term um ingression of relevant novelty it made me think about
something I heard Michael just say this morning um you were saying Michael that this was in a video
that you did with Carlos Farias I think you called it poly computing and you were saying that with
the right prompting meaning the right chemical signals from the parasite the oak tree leaf will
produce these beautiful galls so but when I was thinking about that I'm thinking does that prompting
presuppose that the subroutine that creates that gall is already present in the leaf and it just
needed to be prompted by the chemical signal yes or what does that mean right what does it I mean
that that's a that's a that's a tricky question it because and I think you know I'm pretty sure
the ancients were all over this in the sense that when you dump a bunch of marbles onto this thing
and you get this nice bell curve or you get a distribution of prime numbers does that mean
that was already there and all you did is somehow pull it out by virtue of creating the right machine
or or or not right I think it I think it's exactly the same question um in the prompt is the physical
machine uh that that you're using to get this effect and the pattern is the thing that you're
going to get I mean I don't know I I don't know if you know people argue about whether mathematics
is discovered or invented and stuff like that but there are so many cases where uh there is this uh
this this this deep um pattern that emerges and you know I'm not sure it's it's helpful to argue
philosophically about whether it was there or not but I do think so so here's how I've taken
this approach is is I you know I don't really want to argue whether this this thing was there
before or not but as an engineer what I'd like is to have a frame that helps me engineer
so a frame that helps me engineer if if a frame like that is boy you got to track all the microstates
of everything and and the only things that are there are things that were selected for by evolution
like those kind of frames are are provably deficient they do not do a great job and so
uh that means we can have a different frame which says okay there's a there's a space of
possible outcomes the evolution produces machines for exploring that space and we can hijack some
of that same machinery now faster and better with with AI and with other tools to pull out the
contents of that space and in fact to help me engineer I'm even going to make a map of that
space I don't want to have philosophical debates about whether that space is real all I know is
if I had a map of that space and I knew which things were next to which other things and therefore
which of my prompts I could I could leverage with the least amount of effort to pull out new things
I would do better than somebody who doesn't believe in the space who doesn't think it exists
you know all that that kind of stuff so that that's you know that's the approach I take on this which
maybe you know me I've had I've had people call it them you know philosophically unsophisticated
and fine maybe it is but but but in the end what I want is I want us to be able to distinguish
between competing worldviews and to me the thing that produces more more unified understanding
more compact descriptions of of reality that help us better relate to things around us the various
different agency things in our environment better prediction and control more invention more
discovery more new capabilities that that's the worldview I'm looking for that's that's the lens
whatever lens gets me to that and and I think then this question of whether it was there before I
don't know but I do know that there's a whole space of possibilities and I'd like a map of that space
as an engineer I want a map of that space well yeah I mean it it's like the possibility space
right I know mathematicians who say that they can actually walk around in that possibility
space mathematics they they they can visualize the entire thing inside their heads yeah and
that made me think about the salamander when it loses a limb it can regrow a new limb
is that is that some sort of memory capacity well well we know I mean in planaria we know
it's a memory capacity a because we can see it we can see the memories and we can rewrite to these
memories and also just for fun and this is unpublished so take this with a grain of salt but
preliminary data say that when you put classic memory blockers you know things that block
learning and recall and rats and humans and so on you can make planaria forget how to be a
planarian they literally go back and be a nice mic drop I mean yeah again I'm not peer reviewed
right like early preliminary data whatever you know take it take it with a grain of salt
but but but the fact is aside from any of that for all all the work that we've done
a lot of it is borrowing concepts from cognitive neuroscience and applying them
fruitfully to discover new things in areas where people normally don't think it belongs right so
we will take things a perceptual by stability and I mean of course active inference and and
memory and visual illusions and expectation I mean this old table in a couple of my papers I
get this long table of you take all these things and all of them are usable in developmental
biology and in other other fields because the techniques can't tell the difference and therefore
I that's why you know we kind of started out this way talking about fields and silos come come back
to that I think they're artificial we make these differences and we make departments of this and
departments of that and and and to the point where things I say in one department everybody's
like yeah no kidding we of course that's obvious and then another department they throw tomatoes
because because it sounds ridiculous right and and we have different journals and we have different
funding bodies and whatever but the techniques can't tell the difference and so that tells me that
this is artificial in a large sense there there needs to be yeah and and and that also goes back
to the strategy again I don't you know philosophic I don't know if this is naive or not but somebody
said to me once uh you know you get into this you get into so much trouble calling these things
memory why have all these arguments just call it come up with a different name just come up
with a different name and then and then people don't need to fight about it and all I could think of
was well Newton could have said well let's see there's gravity for the moon and then there's
shmavidy for the for the apple falling down to the earth good we now we got two names no
have to fight about it but but he would have missed out on like the core insight that it's the same
thing right and so so so no I don't want to come up with a new name because because I think the
name of the game is unification I think as much as possible we should be looking for symmetries
for invariance and not proliferating uh names for these things and yeah um this is exactly why
whitehead as a metaphysician uh wants to say that energetic transmission is uh a kind of vector
feeling and so that there are he I mean his technical term is prehension that that prehensive
relationships which would be his way of talking about causal transmission uh has a it's it's the
it's the transmission of feelings right and so uh some people would hear that and think it's
actually it's absolutely kooky but on the other hand it's a search for unification so that we
don't have to say that the very complex intense forms of feeling that animals and human beings
experience somehow arises through some other mysterious process that it seems very difficult
to ever understand that this was there from the beginning and we just need to we're not adding
something new to physics we're understanding what physics itself is already describing um as
in some sense continuous with what psychology would be describing yeah yeah right so I think it
was I don't I don't know if it was chris fields or who it was but maybe it was chris who said
you know the project is the sentience of physics and the physics of sentience absolutely and I
that seems that seems to get at all of it like you you made a comment in one of your other videos
that for you there's a very interesting distinction between control and relationship
could you comment on that just briefly as it might connect with what he was just saying yeah um
you know so so figure one in my my first paper on tame this uh technological approach to mind
everywhere framework figure one is this thing that uh is kind of like this it's I call it the
spectrum of persuadability so it's this idea that in order to put this this all goes back to even be
the the the whole um light cognitive light cone thing came about in uh 2018 when I was at a
Templeton conference and Pranab Das asked us to come up with a framework in which diverse
intelligences could all be compared together you know and so people were thinking um you know
primates and elephants and and and you know uh crows and maybe octopus and things like this and
you know and so we were we were thinking about this and I'm thinking okay let's what if we
crank up the knobs to 11 you know on all of this and say it sells AI you know software
ai's aliens synthetic beings like all of it what's the and so and so I started thinking about what
what do all agents regardless of their composition regardless of their provenance how they you know
designed engineered whatever what do they all have in common and so so I came up with this with
this kind of focus which again not super new I mean uh we Wiener and Rosenbluth had it in 1943
this this idea that that everything is about um levels of levels of controllability and so and so
I get this spectrum of persuadability which is basically uh you know you got at least it's just
some waypoints right so you get your mechanical clock which you're not going to convince of
anything you're not going to reward and punish you you just have to physically rewire it and then
you get your thermostat and that's better because you have a set point and you don't have to even
know how the rest of the thing works as long as you know how to how to rewire the set point and
then you've got some some animals which can and and some other agents which can learn from experience
and there you really don't need to know much except the currency of behaviorist uh
kinds of protocols because they offer this amazing interface to you this learning interface where
you know humans for thousands of years train dogs and horses without knowing any neuroscience at all
and then and then you got humans and whatever else past that and so and so one way to think
about this as an engineer is control so what I want is I want to be at the right place on this
diagram for any given system somebody gives me something I don't want to undershoot
with agency I don't want to be um you know treating uh the human brain as a as a as a
paperweight and and kind of not understand what I've what I've got and I don't want to overshoot
I don't want to look at that I don't want to be yelling at this um uh mechanical clock and
trying to make it feel guilty I want to be I want to be at the at the right level for whatever the
system is um so so an engineer sees that and he sees efficient prediction and control but
but I see this much more broadly which is what you're really looking for is a relationship with
the system and at lower ends at the lower ends of that spectrum it really does just kind of
smoothly blend into an engineering approach but ultimately sort of at the at the higher ends and
so we're talking with other humans with uh possible you know cyborgs in the future maybe with AIs
maybe with aliens who don't look anything like us what you're looking for are ways to relate to
that system to ask how much agency is there that I can um relate to and specifically I found um
something uh and I apologize in about one minute I'm gonna have to run um somebody I recently found
something that that they they came out they came they're trying to come up with this thing to
distinguish human products from things that AI makes right because some people think that's a
very profound difference and so they want to know so they call it proof of humanity that you know you
get these like um uh cryptographic certificates or something that says it's you know proof of
humanity and and as I think about it you know if I want proof of humanity for whoever I'm having
a relationship with what do I really what am I really after am I really after knowing what your
DNA is nah I don't care about your DNA am I really after knowing what your anatomy is and then I'm
going to find out that you know 80 percent of you has been replaced by artificial organs I don't
care what what do we care about when we're talking proof of humanity and I think what we care what
we're talking about is a uh is is a level of compassion a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
minimally human standard human level of ability to care about certain things and having similar
existential um uh you know struggles and and and stuff like that so so it's not just about the
engineering and control like we have in regenerative medicine it it I think it shades into the kinds of
things we do with other with other humans and societies and so on. I love that we're ending
here with ethics because there's so many ethical implications here um with your research and this
point of view because if we're dealing with agencies all the way down obviously there's no way to
never um um inhibit or want to control the agency of some beings like we have to eat
life is robbery as whitehead says but he adds the the robber needs justification and that's where
ethics and morals come in and for whitehead the whole process of evolution is this this movement
from force to persuasion is the dominant mode of relationship and that's what human beings are
struggling with right now right so I know we both have to go but I think that's a great place to
to end um so much more to talk about but this was so much fun absolutely yeah thank you so much
yeah great great to meet you Matthew thank you Karen this was a lot of fun yeah a lot of fun
bye bye thanks all right bye bye
