Hi, good evening everyone. Thanks for joining this session. So tonight we're going to talk about
introduction to data jobs. So we will be discussing a few different data roles, such as data analytics,
data engineering, as well as data science. We'll briefly touch on generative AI and how AI
and our engineering works. So yeah, I expect you to ask a lot of questions and that's why I didn't
use a formal presentation. I'm mainly going to use Notion to walk you through. I think I'm going to
ask you a lot of questions and let's have a discussion and hopefully along the way I can
convey my message and hopefully that's useful for everyone if you're in the process of sort of
career switching or trying to get into data science or data engineering. Okay, let's get started.
So first of all, a quick introduction to WeCloud data. I think many of you have attended past
events. So you know that we are a training academy and we primarily focus on training
data scientists, data engineers as well as AI engineers. If you're interested in watching
past event recordings, you can go to youtube.com slash at WeCloud data. I think we upload most
of the recordings to our YouTube channel so you can find those. We also have some career guides
such as data scientist, BI data engineering. It covers a lot of details from what is data science,
the type of data science jobs, data science roles, and then how do you get started at job
market and things like that. So yeah, I think you know where to find us if you have questions
or you are interested in attending one of our data courses. Let's start from the definition.
What is data science or the type of data jobs? And when it comes to data jobs, I think there's
three main categories, data engineering, data analytics, and data science. And of course there
are other data related jobs such as AI with a focus on machine learning or maybe generative AI,
but data is an important part of it. So I guess my first question to everyone is that
how familiar are you with data engineering, data analytics, and data science? Do you have any
questions? So for example, do you know what a data engineer do? Some of you may come from
data fields already so feel free to chime in and I'm happy to discuss and share my experience
and insight. You can type your message into Zoom chat or feel free to unmute yourself as well.
Anybody coming from the data industry already, you know, maybe you work as a data engineer
or you work as a business analyst? No, actually I'm enrolled in a course of data analytics right now.
Oh hey Nishan, how are you doing? Good, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. All right, so you want to
tell us your understanding of data engineering and data? Not the engineering, like I'm enrolled in a
course, diploma course in data analytics right now. Yeah, oh cool. Welcome to this event. Anything
you would like to share? Have you started the training yet? Yeah, I started the training like
I did Excel Power BI and we're gonna start data handling and we're gonna start like SAS soon.
Okay. Yeah, we did three of the modules like Power BI, Excel and Data Handling. Okay, so you
mentioned a couple of tools right? Excel, Power BI, and then I think you mentioned SAS as well.
These are the tools I think business analysts, data analysts would typically use
for data analytics jobs and sometimes data scientists use these tools as well. Have you
learned Python as well? Sorry, what? Did you learn Python in your training? No, we're gonna learn in
future Python or SAS, yeah, we're gonna learn in future. Oh, that's great. Yeah.
Yeah. Anybody else would like to introduce yourself or maybe tell us a bit about your
understanding of the data industry?
So Chetan is saying that data engineering is about making sure the data is collected and stored
in the right way. Yeah, I think that's correct, partially. First of all, actually the reason why
I put data engineering on the top, I would like to introduce that first. It's because without
data engineering, I think data scientists and data analysts wouldn't even have the right data to work
with. So you're absolutely correct. I think data engineers need to make sure that data is not only
collected and stored in the right system, but they also need to be stored in the right way.
That sort of includes data cleaning, right? Data ingestion, understanding the business rules,
because in a typical business, there are data coming from many different sources and different
systems. You might be dealing with like, you know, 50 different data sources and even more.
So in that case, you know, if a data analyst need to build dashboard, you need a decent data model.
The data model has, you know, tables and schema and the data may come from many different systems
and someone need to do the job and do the pipeline to prepare the data for this kind of tasks.
And that is very important because in any kind of data system, it's garbage and garbage out, right?
So when data engineers help companies ingest data into, you know, data warehouse or databases,
it's very important for them to, they're playing a very essential role because they do need to
understand how data is generated by different systems. There are a lot of business logics they
need to apply to get the data into the right format. So the downstream analytics tasks can
become a lot easier. And that is so important. If you have ever worked in a startup environment
where that the company doesn't have a proper, you know, data warehouse or a data lake yet,
and then whoever's doing the data analytics work, it's such a painful process because
they'll have to write a lot of scripts and a lot of code to manipulate data. But with the help of
data engineers, I think you can not only produce high quality analytics work, but also you can do,
you know, you can do that with even, you know, real time data sometimes. So that is very important.
Okay. But if you dive deeper into, you know, the data engineering field, it's actually
pretty complex. There are a lot of things, a lot of tools you need to learn. So I'll give you a very
high level introduction to data engineer or at least the kind of tools you need to know
in order to become a data engineer. Okay. So let's say tools, data engineer needs to, you know,
and the landscape here for, you know, the tools landscape for data engineering is very,
very overwhelming. There's so many different things you can learn. I'm going to list a few
important things, but it doesn't mean that you need to know everything in order to get a job.
And usually you just need to be very good at, you know, some of these tools. And then I think
you'll be able to find a job. And then of course, there are different types of data engineering jobs
depending on the kind of tools you work with, right. So on the data ingestion side,
that's where you usually, you know, the beginning of the funnel, you need to collect data from
different sources. And that's the starting point. So you need basically data ingestion, right.
These could be, you know, ETL developers, or, you know, big data engineers, and even sometimes,
you know, software engineers that work with different kinds of, you know,
data ingestion tools and, you know, working with or even building connectors, right. Some of the
traditional tools people use for ingestion are enterprise tools. But, you know, in the community
right now, if you would like to build tools quickly to get a job, I think you need to know
a few data ingestion tools such, you know, as Apache AirBide, for example. AirBide is basically
a data ingestion tool and it's low code. And it has, you know, connectors or integration with
many different data sources. Now, let's think of a fictitious company that, you know, that sells
some kind of product, right. So that means they need to do marketing to sell their product. They
have to do promotions. And once they have the customers, they have to manage the customer
relationship. So they need CRM tools as well. So typically, companies will be working with,
you know, marketing tools such as MailChimp, right. They might, you know, use Google Sheet
for some sort of simple data, you know, collection and manipulation.
For CRM, they may work, you know, HubSpot. And they may work with some sort of, you know,
text messaging tools. But a list of like 15, 20 essential tools that need to manage, you know,
their product and sales and marketing. And the problem with this is that data you need, right,
it's siloed and it's stored in many different, you know, platforms. So the job of a data engineer is
to actually ingest these data from MailChimp HubSpot, different systems into a centralized
location, right. That could be a data lake. It could be a modern data warehouse, which are
basically just databases that store data. So you need to collect data from these different
data sources. And sometimes data just come from the web, right. Especially when companies want
to build their large language models or do fine tunings. And you need to collect a lot of data.
For example, ChatGPT, who was pretty much trained on the entire, like the data collected from the
web. And so they did a lot of web scraping. And now they get into all kinds of legal issues.
But that's probably what most of the company do. And some companies, you know, such as UAE's,
you know, Falcon models are built on some open data. Metaslama model was trained on some open data.
But if you read those, you know, articles and paper, you realize that they typically work with
15, 20 different major data sources. That requires a lot of data engineering as well.
So data ingestion is the first part. You need to get the data into the warehouse.
And then there's the part of analytics engineering. So, you know, it's good that
you have data engineers or developers who collect data and store them in a centralized place.
But who's going to sort of prepare those data, right? If you get hired as a data scientist
at work in a product team, a marketing team, you are typically not involved in those data
ingestion process, which happens on IT side. And you don't really understand those sophisticated
business rules, a lot of data scrubbing, a lot of, you know, things that need to be sort of figured
out. So this is where analytics engineers come in. These are the engineers who understand business
logics. And they know how to prepare data and sort of do ETL or ELT.
ETL stands for like data extraction, transformation and loading. Load means loading data into a
warehouse. There's also some other process, you know, which is called ELT, which basically means
that after data extraction, we're going to load the data into the warehouse first,
and then do all the transformation in the warehouse. And the modern data analytics engineer
usually prefer to work with the ELT stack. And ETL has been around for so many years,
and it's pretty traditional approach, but it's still very powerful.
Things analytics engineers need to need to know include, you know, database, you know,
systems and data warehouse tools, such as, you know, let's say Google BigQuery,
Snowflake, you must have heard about Snowflake, data warehouse, you know, in Amazon, then
Redshift. So there are different kinds of, you know, data warehouse tools. If you would like
to build workflow, a lot of SQL based, you know, transformations, look into DBT, which is the
data build tool. It's very popular right now. If you would like to work as an analytics engineer,
I strongly recommend you learn DBT. And of course, there are other tools that you can use,
such as, you know, Python Spark and Airflow, but DBT works pretty well in a modern data stack,
and it has really good integration with some of these tools. And of course, you need to understand
data modeling and the fundamentals of data warehouse. So a lot of SQL, but that's very important.
So data, you know, there are data engineers that purely focus on data ingestion. That's a big job,
right? You may, you know, in terms of the path, you may actually just switch from project to project
because there are new data sources that a company will build, you know, all the time. And you need
to understand systems and integrating with many different data sources and working with APIs.
And sometimes you might need to write, like, you know, APIs yourself as well. What if there's one,
you know, data source, which is not very popular, and you don't really have a connector provided
by Airbyte. So you might need to sort of roll up your sleeves and just write the connector yourself
in Python. So coding skill is very important as well. When it comes to analytics engineering,
of course, the most popular job title is just Analyst Engineer. And basically working on data
warehouse stuff, which is also very important. And there are also BI engineers. This role is
somewhere in between BI data analytics and data engineering. And these are the BI developers who
are very good with data modeling, and then they, you know, they build business intelligence solution
and some other tools they work with include Power BI, right, and maybe writing DAX and things
like that. But this can fall into under the data analytics or BI career path. But there are also
BI developers who are like sort of very strong in data modeling. So they know how to build
efficient data models so that the queries can run, you know, quick, very fast. And then
that really serves the dashboard in purpose well. Okay. They're also big data engineers. These are
the folks who work with data lakes. Data warehouse has been very popular. But there are also, you
know, different schools of thought when it comes to, you know, manipulating big data.
For most of the companies, I think Analyst Engineering Data Warehouse will work really,
really well. But for tech companies that has, you know, millions of customers that they deal,
if they deal with hundreds of terabytes of data, I think the cost of data warehouse might be a bit
high. And then very soon, you're going to hit some sort of limitation, especially, you know,
a lot of the data you work with, if, you know, our unstructured data, right, that doesn't fit
into the SQL paradigm very well. And that's where you need to use tools like Python and Apache Spark
to manipulate big data. And first of all, the data will need to be stored efficiently
in a data lake. So we're talking about, you know, Hadoop HDFS, which is sort of like legacy systems
already. But if you use Amazon, then it's simple storage service, right, S3. And data lake is just
the, you know, the sort of the data architecture storage layer on top of, right, S3 or, you know,
blob storage. And Google has its own storage system as well. And then once the data is stored in the
data lake, data engineers will, or big data engineer developers will need to know how to use
tools such as, you know, Apache Spark, Apache Flink to access the big data. And we're talking about,
you know, terabytes of data and even petabyte scale data. And these jobs are typically quite
expensive if you're going to do that in data warehouse. So we're going to leverage distributed
systems. Big data engineer jobs require definitely stronger coding skills, right. So if you're sort
of transitioning from data analytics to data engineering, the analytics engineering is relatively
easy for you to, easier for you to get started with. And if you come from IT, you know, software
background, big data engineer might be something you want to look into. But you can always, you
know, sort of start from analytics engineering and then, you know, eventually become a big data
engineer. And in some companies probably need to do a bit of everything. But just so you know,
that when you learn data engineering, you need to find a focus as well. It's kind of hard to sort of
master all of these right away. It takes years of experience. And then there are a lot of legacy
tools. And sometimes people get confused. So they don't know what tool they need to focus on.
But I would recommend probably just focus on the modern, you know, tech stack,
because the industries of data engineering is moving pretty fast. And a lot of the projects you
will be working on is probably migrating from the old system to the new system. So you'll definitely
get trained on those legacy tools, but you need to be really good at the new tools. So I think
that's one of the exciting part about data engineering. There are also some new trends,
you know, things like, you know, lake house. But that's just the next version or next iteration
of, I guess, big data or data lake. But we're talking more about streaming data, real time data.
So a lot of software engineers actually work in this category. But definitely, if you are passionate
about real time systems and big data systems, that's definitely the direction to go.
And so, yeah, this is just a very quick high level summary of, you know, some different types
of data engineering jobs. But when you look at this, you know, it's just the end to end pipeline
of the data engineering system. It always starts from data ingestion that involves, you know,
distributed messaging systems as well. There will be batch data ingestion. And of course,
if you dive deeper, there's the real time data ingestion. And once you ingest it into the system,
you either need to work with a data warehouse or a data lake, right? And on top of it, we're going
to add, you know, ETL data transformations. And of course, data analytics, data science as well.
So as you can see, data engineering is serving many other purposes. And their job is to make
everyone else's life easier. So I really admire data engineers who can build large scale systems.
A lot of times it's not just about using the tools, you know, in many big tech companies,
data engineers are involved in building new tools and systems. And that's quite,
quite, quite exciting. Okay.
Data modeling is better a topic for data science or MLEs. I don't think so. I don't think
machine learning engineers need to do a lot of data modeling.
And orchestration tool, yeah. Thanks for the reminder. I think data engineers, because you're
building, you know, data pipelines. And imagine you're dealing with like 50 different source data
and or the data systems. It's hard to do all of these manually. Definitely, you'll need to
know how to do automation. So NTN workflow orchestration using, you know, tools like
Apache airbite. These are, sorry, airflow function or data pipeline automation. So I would
recommend tools like, you know, Apache airflow that has been around for, for many years. It's,
it has really large community, something a data engineer would definitely to look into.
Let's check in on some of these comments here.
Is it worth pursuing a career in data with the rise of AI in 2024?
Especially data analyst? That's a good question. Well, first of all, my answer is definitely
worth pursuing a career in data. I think generative AI or the rise of AI, it depends on how you
look at it. But a lot of people who's pursuing PhD sort of, you know, start to become a little bit
worried that, you know, AI is sort of progressing at a much faster pace. They spend four or five
years, but they still can't, you know, when chat GPT or GPT-4 came out, you can't even beat it,
right? Even Google's having trouble to sort of building a better model. So this is indeed
evolving very fast. But the way I look at it, based on my limited view and experience,
is that I think it's really, you know, making data analytics professional, becoming more,
become more efficient. I don't think AI tools at the current stage is able to replace
an experienced data analyst and data scientist. You will see a lot of useful demos, or maybe
exciting demos, where you can just, you know, write some prompts, and then they will generate
SQL queries and generate visualizations. I think that really, that's really cool, and I use that
as well. But it sort of just replaces the very low-level coding part, right? And if you know Python
and Pandas, generating a pie chart, really just two lines of code. So I think that's what chat GPT,
for example, is really capable of doing right now. But data analytics is really not just about
writing the queries. Even though, unfortunately, a lot of data professionals, they spend quite a
bit of time writing queries and manipulating data. And the time they spend on these is actually not
because writing code is hard. If you look at SQL, there are only a few SQL patterns. It's
very easy to learn. But it's the business logic that's really complex. And that's why, you know,
even if you work as data analysts in the same role, with different companies, your SQL query
patterns might be very different. Because in some companies, the business logic is quite complex,
or the data is simply too messy. And then there's a lot of data cleaning to need to do.
Today's generative AI, you know, especially large language models, most of the times when we interact
with LLM, we do that through prompting. And prompting has a limitation on the context window,
even though the new GPT fall four or anthropic models, they have really large long windows.
But it doesn't mean that you can dump everything as in a context window, and it's just going to
work perfectly. Because it's still going to suffer the memory issues. So yeah, so if you have seriously
tried to use chat GPT to do your data analyst project, you realize that sometimes you'd rather
just write the query yourself. It's just not there yet. So I'm definitely not worried about
the data jobs being replaced. However, I think AI is indeed going to threaten a lot of jobs,
but maybe the impact is much bigger in other categories as creative jobs like
writers and even design. So yeah, I'm less worried about data jobs being replaced.
But however, I think if you're just getting started with data, your job is not just learning
how to write SQL code. That's not enough. You need to understand different use cases.
You need to have the experience of working with many different types of data.
And that helps you build the experience. Because when you write the queries, it's not
the syntax that matters. It's the business logic that matters. It's just like software
engineering. If you really rely on chat GPT to do your job, you're going to be very frustrated
because the reasoning part of these AI tools is just not there yet. But maybe someday it's going
to become a crazy group, but at least not in the near future. That's just my two cents on this.
Yeah, I'm not really worried because I tried to use chat GPT to do my job. It's just impossible.
Yeah, so Thomas said regarding someone needs to teach the model. But we teach the model through
prompting, but there's still limitation. So all of these pre-trained models, it really depends on
the data used for learning. So that's why there's a fine-tuning category and also the retriever
augmented generation. So it doesn't have a knowledge base. So you feed the data into the
pre-training process and it starts to have memories. It can only memorize so much unless
you feed the entire world's data, but that's impossible. The biggest models are probably
still just trained on terabytes of data, but they're like way more data generated on a
daily basis. So you can't possibly feed one year worth of internet data into chat GPT or GPT-4.
That's simply too expensive to train. So that's why we need to do prompting and teach chat GPT
or large language models. Panda's AI is pretty cool. I definitely recommend everyone look into it.
That's something I played with it and it's pretty helpful.
Cool. I'm going to get back to some of these questions later. Let's move on at this point.
So we talked about data engineering. Next, I would like to talk about data analytics.
And I mainly want to help everyone understand what data analysts do because sometimes
there's some confusion about data analytics and data science.
From my perspective, data analytics, sometimes they need to know data science and machine
learning as well. Eventually, I think data analytics and data science are the two
disciplines that are going to probably merge because of generative AI. It's because
building dashboard and producing plots and visualizations nowadays become super easy.
So a data analyst's value is definitely not just creating the dashboard itself. Again,
as I said, business rules, business understanding is very important. Another important aspect of it
is just data prep processing or data pre-processing for visualization.
The large language models are mainly trained on the Internet data, but we haven't
feed a lot of the business data into it. So I'm not sure when this is going to happen, but
the reason why it's capable of writing code is, for example, you just dump all of Stack Overflows
data. The way people answer questions through coding and copy and paste, pasting Python scripts
or snippets into those answers, and you can train a next token prediction model based on that.
I shouldn't say no one, but not many companies are willing to dump their customer data in their
transaction systems into chat GPD. Maybe that's going to happen. For example, you can fine tune
that, but imagine you have terabytes of data. It's just, again, too expensive. So I don't know when
this is going to happen. It would be cool, but at current state, I don't think it's possible.
That basically means that anything that's related to your business's proprietary data
and other business rules, it's not capable of learning that yet. So I think data analysts
and data scientists still have tremendous amount of value because your job is definitely not to
create a pie chart for the company. This should be automated, and that's why you never know what
questions your business team is going to throw at you because they don't ask the same question,
because the business scenarios always change. If there are some common questions they would
like to address, that's where data analysts is going to build a dashboard, standardize things,
but as a data analyst, actually a lot of times you're working on ad hoc requests. Business teams
will have a lot of questions about the product, about sales, about their customers.
That's when you're going to run a lot of queries to help them understand the business better,
whether it's helping the company to make better decision or just understanding the customers.
That's typically what a data analyst do. So expect to address a lot of ad hoc requests,
answering a lot of questions through data analytics, and you're mainly writing data queries.
As a data analyst, you need to join a lot of business meetings as well,
be comfortable with preparing a PowerPoint presentation as sort of overlaps with business
analytics, but that's what data analysts do normally. There are data analysts that focus more
on just writing queries and producing dashboards, but there are also data analysts that are
pretty integrated into the business process, so you work with a business team very closely.
And then you definitely need to be a very good communicator and know how to
manage relationship as well, and also just be ready to say no, because people are going to line up
and ask you all kinds of questions, and they expect things fast, and they can easily get
overwhelmed, so you sort of need to get well organized and know how to prioritize things.
So that's a data analyst from my view. And depending on the type of questions from the
business, it's not always just about writing queries, merging tables, and doing some sort of
aggregation. I think data analysts need to understand the statistics as well, and because
you need to tell stories as well, and help the business understand the distribution of the data,
and sometimes you need to understand statistical sampling and statistical inference,
and do A-B testing, for example, and sometimes it's data scientist's job, and data analytics
professionals will do A-B testing as well on marketing campaign results. So understanding
the basics of statistics and the basics of predictive modeling will be helpful as well.
The line is a little bit blurred between data analysts and data scientists, because
when it comes to predictive modeling, sometimes it's explaining things, explaining a decision
tree, but sometimes data scientist is probably working on models that can be deployed in the
production system, but data analysts need to understand predictive modeling as well.
Maybe you're trained and proficient with SQL, but it doesn't stop you from leveraging
low-code and no-code AI tools. There are no-code tools such as HTO that allows you to build
machine learning models without writing Python code. A lot of data analysts, I think one of
you guys mentioned you work with SAS. SAS has a UI called GUI-based tool called Enterprise Guide,
and there's Enterprise Miner as well. Basically, you don't need to write a lot of code, but you
can still build predictive models. So I think data analysts will need to be comfortable with that as
well. When people traditionally talk about data analytics, it's more about reporting and dashboard,
but I think understanding predictive analytics and advanced analytics will be helpful as well.
And compared to data science, I think data scientists will definitely focus more on
building machine learning models. If the data scientists only build dashboard and
do ad hoc analysis, actually a lot of them do. Then that's basically data analyst jobs.
That's why I think data science and data analytics is going to emerge as profession, because in the
future, maybe you can just use no-code tools as long as you understand how to process data,
and then the ML part can actually be automated. And then you get the insight, you need to be able
to interpret those and work with the business to make better decisions. So that's, I think,
what some of the data scientists will need to do. But of course, I think the exciting part about
data science is that this field is evolving really fast. Some of the traditional machine
learning techniques we learned, it's already becoming outdated. So I think as a data science
professional, SQL and Python, these are data manipulation skills that you need to be very good
at. But once you start to learn more advanced analytics, data science and machine learning,
I think in the future, you'll definitely to focus a little bit more on the
generative AI side. So data scientists will definitely become more specialized in
in machine learning, deep learning, as well as generative AI. And data scientists also need to
have very strong data manipulation capability, because they're probably going to deal with a
lot of big data as well. Okay. All right. So we talked about data analytics, data science,
and also, I'm sure some of you are interested in machine learning engineering and AI engineering,
these are typical engineering related jobs. I would say if you're taught as
MA engineer or AI engineer, engineering skills are probably more important.
And it is a little bit confusing, because in some companies, MA engineers basically work as a data
scientist. But in some other companies, MA engineers actually work as ML ops, which is like
dev ops, who knows machine learning. And there, of course, there are AI engineers that's somewhere
in between. So expect to sort of know different tools and understand system design as well, because
if you work as an AI engineer, most likely the work you produce is this expected to be put in
production. So you work with the software team more closely. And you're, for example, if you're
building, you know, a rack systems, right, leveraging large language model to build a QA,
like build a chatbot, for example, for your company that you can feed your companies, let's say,
legal documents or whatever HR, you know, data into a large language model. And you would like
people to be able to sort of just use prompting to talk to the chatbot and get answers they need.
So that means you need to understand how to build a rack system from end to end. That involves,
you know, different kind of vector databases, model deployment, because now you'll need to
decide whether you're going to work with chat repeat, open AI, or you're going to work with an
open source large language model. If you decide to go down the open source route, then you need to
know how to deploy these open source model, you can always just use a hugging phase, you have to
deploy that in your own industry as an infrastructure. That requires engineering skill, ML ops skills as
well. And, you know, working with large language models in production, you need to understand how
to work with different types of GPUs. So a lot of software engineering skills involved as well.
I think I put that on the data related jobs, because data is so essential for the success for
any kind of AI projects. That's actually what I would like to talk about next, data and generative
AI. I think a lot of people sort of get scared a little bit, because they think generative AI is
going to replace their job. But I think they're complementary to each other. First of all, there
are a lot of benefits of generative AI, you know, to, to, for the data professionals, right?
I do notice myself, like my work pattern changed a little bit. I tend to ask chat to use chat to
GPT more frequently. A lot of the small problems I'm trying to solve. Now I'm getting into the habit
of just asking questions. I think that's actually really good. But when you actually want to work
on something more seriously, you need to rely on your own capability. But chat GPT is going to
actually help you do research and answer a lot of questions. I sort of use that to replace open,
sort of over, you know, Stack Overflow. Even though I noticed that sometimes I still need to go back
to Google and Stack Overflow. But that still saves me a lot of time and make me become more
efficient. And even just writing formulas for teaching sometimes, you know, I take a screenshot
of something, I would like to convert that to, to latex, right? Though all of these are very
helpful and preparing tables. So that's really good. And, or, or maybe just like generating some
sort of starter code. But sometimes you realize that you're actually wasting more time, you'd
better just write your own code. But I'll leave this to you to decide. And however,
when you want to become an AI engineer, definitely don't just focus on the models and algorithms.
And I think you should focus on engineering skills, as well as the data skills. Because if you look
at the landscape of large language models, a lot of the innovation nowadays, you know, everything
is based on transformer, like the similar, right, architecture, what's really different, or some
of the innovation come from data. So data preparation becomes so important, even for generative AI.
Because there are lots of issues with, you know, the, the benchmarks for when some company come
out and say our model beats chat GPD4 or GPT4, or GPT3.5, you can't just trust those. Because
people always have bias, they always want to say their model is the best. And it really depends on
the kind of data set and benchmark they use, right, for evaluating the models. And it's very
confusing, you know, place, because there are all kinds of evaluation, the methodologies,
there are all kinds of evaluation data set and different kind of leaderboard and dashboard
are like benchmarks out there. It's very confusing. So that's why I think this field is
evolving really fast. So evaluation is always related to data, right. And I see papers, you know,
or large language models out there, that basically just, you know, cheat a little bit, right, because
the data they use for evaluation is actually sort of used as part of the training process.
So that's cheating. And of course, the model performance is going to be good. But when you use
that in real life, most of the real business scenarios, the way you evaluate the models has
nothing to do with those benchmark metrics. So that's something you have to think about as well.
And what kind of data we feed into the pre-training or whatever fine-tuning process,
the data is actually way more important. A lot of companies, they struggle to have, you know,
labeled data set, right. And cleaning all of those web data is also very important,
because if you don't do data filtering and cleaning, then your model might be very biased,
right. Bias in AI is also a serious problem. So again, I think as a data professional,
your work sometimes can overlap with generative AI. And data is very essential for the success of
of generative AI. So, so I guess my suggestion here is that whether you want to become a data
engineer, data analyst, data scientist, or even working in AI, data skills is very important.
And then the business, you know, experience of business knowledge and business logic is also
very important. And don't be scared by, you know, chat GPT being able to produce plots and visualizations,
because that's something you always want to automate, because we wasted so much time just
like writing code to visualize data. Now it can be automated. It's great. You can actually
do a lot more deep dive analysis, but you still need to be the human who is actually
interpreting the chart. I don't think the AI tools are able to do that very, very well at this point.
So, yeah, hopefully, I hope that I make my points clear. And I would love to exchange ideas. I see
there's some comments here. So I'll go back to some of these comments and
