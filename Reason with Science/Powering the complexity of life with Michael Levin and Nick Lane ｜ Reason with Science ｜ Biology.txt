Hi, everyone. Welcome to Reason with Science. I'm your host, Jigeno. This episode is with
Michael Levin and Nick Lane. Mike is a professor in the biology department at Tufts University,
where he studies the role of bioelectric signals in regulating development and regeneration
in animals. Nick is a professor of evolutionary biochemistry at University College London.
His work is focused on the fundamental processes that underlie the origin and evolution of life.
In this conversation, we talk about major transitions and key innovations in biology,
information in biological systems, bioelectricity, emergence of eukaryotes, and importance of
bioelectric signals to create artificial life. Enjoy the conversation, share and subscribe
to support the podcast. Thank you for listening. Hi, Mike and hi, Nick. Welcome back. Hi,
thank you. Thanks for having me. Yeah, so, I mean, the kind of thing that I had in my mind is kind
of like talk about emergence of life. But of course, I don't want to ask you to define life
because I know your response. Both of you have been standing on this kind of response that life
is a continuum. So we can kind of take it from there. But when we think of emergence of life,
there is certainly a kind of transition we can think of. It's a transition of chemistry to biology.
And both of the frameworks that you guys are studying in the region of life or developmental
biology, both of them, they are kind of this example of this transition. So let's take that
big picture view. How do you look at this continuum? How we can think of that continuum
depending upon a bacteria or a mold or a planaria living in a pond? So let's start with Nick.
Okay. I mean, you say a transition from chemistry to life. And I think both Mike and I would
probably emphasize electrochemistry or at least is borderline physics really in terms of what
we're talking about. And so the key, I suppose, in my mind is not a single moment where you
switch from one thing into another one, even when you introduce information, there isn't a single
moment. But there's a process. And that process is partly over time and it's partly structured.
And the thing that I like most, I think, about the kind of environments I talk about for the
origin of life, which are mostly hydrothermal systems. But the nice thing about those systems
is really that they have a structure which is cell-like. And they can template cells that,
in effect, can grow within them. And when I say cell-like, the key attribute in my own mind
to cells is the charge on the membrane. It's really that that defines the cell from its environment
and which coordinates everything that's happening inside the cell. And so at the origin of life,
you have effectively a structure with charges on barriers that are cell-like structures.
And it gives you this as a setup from the very beginning. And then there's lots of interesting
questions that we haven't really answered yet. But how does charge organize things? It certainly
does. But to what extent and in what ways? Mike? Yeah, I think what I'd like to do is
I mean, I agree with everything Nick just said, but I will maybe take one step back and kind of
talk about this question of physics versus chemistry versus biology. I've come more and
more to the view that what we're really talking about in almost all of these problems has to be
cashed out with respect to an observer. So to me, the question of whether something is physics,
or is it chemistry, or is it biology, or is it psychology, or is it what, you know,
what is it? It should be specified relative to an observer who chooses a particular lens.
So one experience that I often have is that I'll describe some amazing thing that biological
systems do, and people say, wow, this is super cool. And then if I happen to have the mechanism
for it, I will say, here's the mechanism. And then people say, wow, well, that's just physics.
Well, that's not memory. I can see how that works. That's not memory. That's just physics.
And so there's this amazing kind of moving of the goalposts that basically all of the interesting
stuff, right? You know, cognition, intelligence, memory, decision making, problem solving,
meaning, all of these things. The minute you show some sort of a mechanism underneath,
then some people say, wow, that wasn't it at all. What I really mean is this other thing,
this is just physics, right? So what I prefer is this idea that you have a set of different
tools that you can bring to bear, and you can take anything and look at it and say, well,
that's physics. And guess what you'll see? You'll see physics. You bring your voltmeter, right?
If you bring your ruler and your way scale and stuff like that, guess what you'll see? You'll
see physics. And if you bring other kinds of tools that are conceptual tools that are
better suited to recognize agency, so maybe you bring something that recognizes
virtual governors or it recognizes a decision making or something, well, then maybe you'll
find that and maybe you won't. So it's an empirical process, right? So that's kind of my view on this.
I think anything can be seen as just physics and many things can also be seen as something much
more and looked at at a higher level. Yeah. I mean, actually, the origin of life is kind of
an exemplar of exactly that because there are people who come from completely different disciplines
in terms of training. So coming as a physicist or as a chemist or as a geologist or as a cosmologist
or a biologist and so on. And you realize when you try to talk to people with a very different
background that you don't share the same language. And however much you try to be a scientist,
you find that you're conditioned and you have some blinkers on which make you see the problem
with that toolkit. And half of the problem that I have in working on the origin of life is to try
and dismantle my own toolkit and replace it with, well, just try to be a scientist. Just try to bring
all these things together because it is a question in all of those disciplines. And that's just the
beginning of life. And once we get into life, it just becomes more sophisticated and more of a
problem. It's just that you can see it really clearly at the origin of life. Yeah. Yeah. I
think the, I mean, of course, it's, it can also be the psychology itself that we like to categorize
stuff. You know, it's this concept of categorical thinking itself. But let's not go into the
psychology right now. But maybe we can kind of replace the emergence of life, like kind of idea
to emergence of complexity, because certainly integration does happen. Stealing a word from
Nick Lane's, when we were chatting last time, you use this word of integration rather than
reductionist approach. So when we think of this integration of some sort of simpler molecules,
then we are, we are kind of talking about this biological system. So let's probably kind of
talk about the properties of biological systems. So what can be those, you know, or what are the
key innovations which enable, you know, life forms? Sorry, did you say, Mike? Yeah.
Well, okay, I'll pick, I'll pick just one thing, which is, which is what Nick already mentioned,
which is resting potential. And the thing that one, one interesting thing about resting potential is
that in many ways, it's a coarse grained sort of higher level entity, because it's just, it's
different. If you are a mechanism that keys off of resting potential, it is not the same as keying off
of potassium concentration or sodium concentration or chloride concentration, right? It's this,
it's this slightly higher level thing. And so, so if you're in fact, it's one of these things,
like many other things in cognitive science, if, if you want to be a micro reductionist,
you might say, well, there's no such thing. You might say, right, if you're sort of a Laplacian,
the demon kind of creature, right, you might say, there's no resting potential. What there is, is
there's some sodiums and there's some potassiums. And, you know, those are like those are your low
level kind of bedrock. But, but what's cool about resting potential is one of many things is that
it's one of the first steps up that I think life does in generalizing coarse graining, getting good
at noticing large scale control elements that are not reducible down to individual details, right?
And while all of these, of course, the resting potential is, of course, a consequence of the
various ions you have, the fact that you can have the same resting potential from different
concentration of ions, right, as long as you change them out correctly, right? So, so, so you
can, you can vary the low level details and still get the same resting potential. And conversely,
you can get different resting potentials with exactly the same genetics, for example, with the
same ion channels, because they could be open or closed. So you get this interesting bowtie kind
of architecture where there's this like functional node in the middle, where things sort of feed
into it and then multiple multiplicities come out of it. But it itself is the super interesting
node from the perspective of information theory control and all of that. So, Nick, before you
respond to that, I will add another point here. So, I mean, because the mainstream view is that
the key innovation is the genome, right? So let's, let's, let's kind of get it out of the way already
and kind of already mentioned it, why, you know, the information is not genome itself,
but why we are talking about the resting potential. I mean, I don't think that either of us would want
to be pigeonholed as kind of anti genome. It's just that it's not, the genome's not the only thing
that's going on. And as soon as, you know, as soon as Mike is talking about generating effectively a
single parameter, which is the resting potential, which could be multiple different ions, which is
going to require multiple different pumps in the membrane, but they're pumping against the pressure
which is pushing back against them. So that, so there is, there is a unified entity, which is,
which is the resting potential, which, which is kind of integrating everything.
And the trouble, I think with only seeing life as a genome is, is it tends to insist that the
genome invents cells as well and invent structure and space and charge and all of these other things.
And it really doesn't, it, it, it's capable of generating them, but it never really makes some
membrane, membranes come from other membranes, the spatial setting of the cell is, you know,
it comes from other cells. And then people say, well, there's a chicken and egg problem at the
origin of life, where does the cell come from? Well, you know, if you've got a cell-shaped hole
and cells, you know, think, you know, it's not difficult actually to make a bilayer membrane
surrounding an aqueous space, that's a cell like structure. It's not a difficult thing to do.
But as soon as you've got that, then information has some meaning and genes begin to have some
meaning. But, but there's still, they need, they need, there's got to be some higher level of
integration for just to use the word meaning. Otherwise, everything's, you know, a bit and
they don't relate to each other. So I think that is why charge is so important. One way that I like
to think of it is if you have, I mean, I like to think of individual cells in part because I work
on them and in part because they're just easier for me to grasp, the whole central nervous system
is just too big and complicated for me to really comprehend. But if you think about a single cell
and you think about the amount of biochemistry that's going on inside it, there's, you know,
there's a billion reactions a second going on in a bacterial cell. And a lot of them are repeat
things. So you could imagine there may be 10,000 Krebs cycles all spinning at the same time.
And they're all plugged into the membrane. And so the rate at which they spin and the
direction in which they spin is going to depend on this larger factor, which is the membrane
potential of the bacterium. So, you know, to pump against that potential requires a certain force.
And that force is coming from the environment that you're in. Do you have the substrate to power
the pumping or did you run out? Or was there any oxygen there or whatever? So it's immediately
giving you a kind of a feed in of what the environment is that you're in. And then a feedback
which is, you know, which is integrating all these, all these 10,000 different cycles going
around every second. How do they all know what the other one is doing? How do you integrate all
of that into the behavior of a cell which is capable of kind of coordinating all of this?
So you need that higher level property. And I think that's where it's coming from.
So I think the hardware software analogy goes well here. Can we use that analogy to
explain this integration? What do you think, Mike?
Yeah, I think that's a very good lens on all of these things because
we know that when we look at the genome, what do we see? We don't see any of the large-scale
kinds of things that you might be interested in. How many eyes? What kind of legs? And do
you have legs? You don't see any of that. What you see is protein sequences. So the micro-level
hardware that every cell gets to have. Now, as Nick points out, the context and the rest of the
cell is critical. Otherwise, this stuff means nothing. And then all of the actual large-scale
features, the behavior, is then the result of the physiology, literally the software.
So in a kind of very simplistic analogy, you're looking at a typical computer,
sure, it's important that you have to write silicon and copper and all of that. Yes,
you need all that stuff. But after that, all the action is in the software, all the actions in
the algorithm. It's in the electrical physiology of what this thing does. And I think it's no
accident that our information technology and the way our brains work and non-neural
bioelectricity, all of them use these electrical networks. They're just a really powerful tool
for processing information. And that's what the, again, as Nick said, not to take anything,
wait, you need certain hardware. So you need the genome to give you certain things.
But you don't get the membrane from the genome. You don't get the cytoskeleton
structure. You get the proteins, but you don't get the structure that it templates on the previous
cytoskeleton. All of these physiological things are over and above the genetic hardware.
Yeah. And I think it's quite interesting, because I think about a lot of work that we
are doing in evolutionary biology, for example, where we just compare genomes and try to understand
the extinct species, et cetera. So then how much we can rely on that kind of information?
I mean, of course, we are getting to know more about the hardware then. What about the software?
Are there ways to do it or go there? I mean, you mentioned extinct species, but this is one
of the most important things about paleontology is the only way you know what a dinosaur looked
like is from finding a fossil of it. Most of the variety of life over the last
600 million years or so of animals alone, the only way we know what they looked like. I mean,
in principle, we could do it from the genome in the end, but in practice, we're a long way from
being able to do that now. And I don't know if we could ever do it in principle if we didn't have
examples of the kind of thing to compare it with. So I think we're quite shockingly ignorant about
how this system works from a genome level at the moment. And I think part of it is exactly what
Mike was saying. We're forgetting the software. We're looking at the hardware only, and we're
not thinking about how is this working as a unified system as an organism with physiology,
and what makes that physiology operated at a higher level to just the hardware that generates it?
Yeah. You know, this business of predicting, you're absolutely right. One of the things that
I show in some of my talks is here's a baby axolotl. It's a salamander, and they have little
legs. You know, the babies have legs. And here's a tadpole of a frog. Xenopus, they don't have legs.
And so in our lab, we make a frog a lot. 50% axolotl, 50% frog. And I get a frog a lot.
So now I ask a simple question. You have the genome of the axolotl fully sequenced. You've
got the genome of the frog fully sequenced. Is the frog a lot of going to have legs or not?
You have absolutely no idea. There's no way to tell. We have no way to tell. And if that's not
bad enough, like Nick was saying, if you don't actually have something to compare a genome to,
we don't know what the frog of the axolotl would look like either. We have no ability right now
to look at a genome and say, ah, yes, this thing has six legs and whatever. No, you have no ability
to do that other than comparing it to other ones that you've had. And not to mention all of the
scenarios in which, and we've shown many and other people have shown many scenarios in which
the genetic information literally misleads you because if there's interventions at the physiology
level, that tends to win. And so we have many examples where there's oncogenic mutations,
but no cancer. There are developmental mutations, but there's no defect because we've intervened
at the physiological level. Or we have worms that have the heads belonging to another species
of flatworm that's 150 million years distant. And you sequence that, you know, you will not
get the right answer about what the head of that animal looks like. You just won't get the right
answer. So, you know, both are important, but it's not all about the genome for sure.
Yeah. So, let's kind of talk a little bit more about the software. So,
is it only about bioelectricity? Maybe first you can introduce a little bit about,
like, what is bioelectricity and how we go about it.
Mike, you want to go ahead? Sure. Okay. So, where I take up, so to answer the second part,
I don't think it's only bioelectricity because there are some interesting, for example, recently
we and Richard Watson, some other people before that, found, for example, that very simple
things like gene regulatory networks or pathways, it can be a protein pathway,
they actually have a kind of plasticity where they can do many different kinds of learning.
So, you can do, they can do habituation, anticipation, associative learning,
we're just in the dynamical systems sense without any rewiring. So, even chemical
pathways can do some of this. So, some of this cognitive stuff goes all the way down.
But what I really like about bioelectricity and where I take it up is sort of after I sort of
assume the cell is there and everything is there. So, Nick covers the earlier stuff,
I kind of just assume it's all there. And after that, what we see is this remarkable thing that
because cells have the ability to generate arresting potential using ion channels and pumps in the
membrane, and they have these little electrical synapses known as gap junctions, which allow them
to share their state with their neighbors. And both the channels and the gap junctions can themselves
be voltage sensitive. So, now what you have is a voltage-gated ion conductance, which is basically
a transistor. That gives you a kind of historicity, it gives you feedback, loops, memory, right there,
right there. And when these cells connect with each other into electrical networks,
you get some of the same phenomena we see in the brain just on a slower time scale. So,
these are not millisecond, these are hours on the scale of hours. But there's all kinds of amazing
information processing that these networks can do that allow them to pursue larger goals. So,
I love the evolutionary electrochemistry and the metabolics because I think these are the very
first kinds of spaces in which living systems solve problems, right? Metabolic space,
bioelectric space like that. But after that, they can, when they join into these electrical
networks, now they can solve problems in anatomical morpho space. They can do things like,
remember what the correct shape is, figure out do we have the correct shape, what needs to be done,
all of that. And then later on, you get a brain and now you can operate in three-dimensional
behavioral space and linguistic space when it was what else. So, that's my story of electricity,
is this like a transistor-like ability of cells to join into networks and compute after that.
And can we reduce it to molecular level?
Yes, I think we can, but I don't know that we have the ability to do it yet.
I mean, I tend to think in terms of mitochondria and how they're going to communicate, for example,
just take a really simple thing. There's two ways of seeing this, apoptosis, controlled cell death.
The mitochondria involved in that and loss of membrane potential is part of what's happening,
also whether mitochondria get targeted to be broken down or not. No one's ever quite got
what's happening. And it's partly because the mitochondria have two membranes and the outer
membrane is not electrically charged or at least not very much, if it is at all. Whereas the inner
membrane has got a pretty high potential on it. But the proteins that are targeting the
mitochondria without a membrane potential are targeting the outer membrane. And there are
protein complexes that join the two up, and it's possible that it can work that way. But it's also
possible that there's electrical signaling across those distances, and I think it's likely
that there is. But then the question becomes, well, if it's simply an electrostatic potential,
then it falls off very quickly because it decays with the square root of the distance.
So it's not going to signal very far. Whereas electromagnetic fields potentially could signal
much further. But that requires a very specific morphology to be able to work at all. And there's
an interesting and difficult question about, well, just what could they do? How can they interact with
the hardware? And there are ways that they can undoubtedly. But is it strong enough? Can we
measure it? Do we have the facilities to get it all easy? So I think it does work at the molecular
level. And I think over very short distances. So for example, with the ATP synthase, there's a
beautiful work from Wayne Frash recently showing, I don't know, the C ring, which is basically
a rotating motor protein that sits in the membrane of the mitochondria. And in ourselves,
there's eight subunits in this ring, and a proton binds on and it just kind of moves around. So it
needs each proton that binds on, it needs to move for eight subunits to turn in the complete circle,
that would be about 37 degrees or something like that. So the binding of the proton moves the whole
ring around by about 37 degrees. And how does it do that? Nobody has ever quite figured it out,
but it's been known for decades that the actual electrical potential on the membrane does quite
a lot of that work. And he's shown quite recently that actually, with just the proton, it moves
about 11 degrees. And with the electrical potential as well, that takes it another 25 degrees or
something of that order of rotation. So it's this local electrostatic charge, which is driving that.
So over short distances, it's really beautifully demonstrated that you need the charge on the
membrane for this to work. But over longer distances, if you're dealing with perhaps a few
micrometers or something, then I would be surprised if electrostatic charges alone were
doing that. They may be, they certainly are at the plasma membrane in terms of connections between
cells and having the same charge across effectively wider expanses. But the mitochondria are interesting
in that sense as well in that the Christie are closed very often and separate from each other.
And so you can have different membrane potentials in different Christie in the same
mitochondria. You can have individual mitochondria or you can have a network that all join together.
There's so much subtlety in all of this. And to underpin all of that, nobody has ever successfully
measured the membrane potential of mitochondria accurately. And the reason for that is if you
simply use a microelectrode and you insert it into the matrix of the mitochondria, into the middle
of the mitochondria, what you'll measure, and this is work going back decades from a guy called
Tedeschi, but other people have come to the same conclusion. You get about 10 or 20 millivolts,
it's not much, somewhat less than the plasma membrane. All of the calculations, all of the
change in pH, all the chemiosmotic hypothesis is saying it should be 150 to 200 millivolts.
So where's that difference coming from? It's partly that we're using voltage sensitive dyes to
accumulate and it's very difficult to calibrate them. And it's partly that we now know the structure
of the mitochondria is different. They are closed Christie. So what you're measuring with the
microelectrode is the difference between the matrix space and the cytosol. And what we really
want to measure is the difference between the matrix space and the Christie space. And no one's
really ever managed to get anything into that Christie space, which is capable of reporting
back on the charge there. So it's definitely working at the molecular level for sure. It depends
a lot on the actual structure, which only in the last few years with super resolution microscopy and
cryo tomography and things like that are we able to really get a handle on exactly what is the
structure of mitochondria and exactly how do these spaces relate to each other and so on.
And no one's ever measured it properly. So it's kind of glaring ignorance again at the heart of
all of this. But until we can measure these things accurately and understand how they change over
short periods of time, which may be seconds or minutes, I would think, then, you know, there's
got to be a certain amount of hand waving about it. But to think that it's not the right place to
look is I think to miss the most important things in science now. And this is totally not my area.
So maybe this is a dumb idea. But any chance that one could make a synthetic one that was big enough
where would that change everything if you sort of made one that was already, you know,
sort of basically synthetically try to make that, that, you know, a big mitochondria around some
sort of engineered electrodes that were already where you needed them to be and sort of assemble
the thing around them. Any chance somebody could build something like that? Or would that be totally
not informative? It would be a fun thing to try and do. I think it would be difficult because the
I think what you tend to build around it would be something in the structure of a sphere or
something along those lines. And what we're actually dealing with. I mean, there are again,
there are stunning structures to the Christie membranes. We tend to just see them as a wavy
line in the textbook. But but they're they're stunningly structured. But sometimes you get
amazing kind of arrays of triangular shapes and things you see some of, you know, they're doing
bionegetics. But in what world are they doing that? There definitely there's nothing in known
bionegetics that says what that why they have triangular shaped Christie. We just have no idea.
So for you, metabolism is like central to bio electricity.
I think the two are connected and are integrated that way. I think they have been from the very
beginning. Because to my mind, you know, for any form of selection to work, you have to have
growth, you have to have cells which are duplicating themselves. And then you have some form of
selection, either they do it slowly, or they would quickly, or they survive longer, or they,
you know, but you have different outcomes. As soon as you've got cells, you don't have to have
genes in those cells, you just have to have cells which are capable of doubling. And if you're
starting as life does on Earth with CO2, then the point of having the electrical membrane potential
is in effect to get CO2 to react with hydrogen. They don't, they're not particularly reactive.
They don't particularly want to react together. And cells today effectively use the charge on the
membrane to force them to react. And those charges make sense at the origin of life,
because what you have, as Peter Mitchell actually said in 1957, the inside and the outside of a
cell, if you like, are two equivalent phases separated and linked by the membrane that's
between them. And those phases are not the same in terms of their ionic composition or anything
else. They cannot be. One is the living cell and the other one is the outside world. And that
necessarily generates charges on those membranes and those charges necessarily organize things.
So, you know, however much you, you know, it's just there, you cannot avoid it. You will have a
charge on the membrane and that charge on the membrane does something useful, even in a purely
prebiotic world, which is to say it will make carbon dioxide react with hydrogen to make organic
molecules inside this cell-like thing, which has now got more organic molecules inside,
which would include more membrane molecules and everything else. And so it can grow. So the whole
thing from the very beginning, way before we had genes, is driven by charge and structure.
Yeah, Richard. The late Richard Borgans had made this interesting point where he said that
as soon as, so super early on, as soon as you have a membrane that segregates some goodies inside the
organism versus outside, you're likely to have a charge imbalance. And then if you get injured,
so let's say the membrane gets perforated, you immediately get a free vector to the side of
the damage because of the short circuit of the electric field. And you get that for free. That's
a free gift from physics. You don't need a genome. You don't need pathways. You don't need any of that.
Immediately, you know where the damage was. So if you have some sort of electrosensitive
subunit as occurs in wound healing and whatnot, the physics tells you where to go to plug up the
damage and so on. So I'm guessing there are many of these things that are just, you know,
so these free gifts that we get from chemistry and physics and then evolution exploits those
in different ways. Since you already mentioned evolution, let's talk about it. So how
these kind of systems will evolve? Nick? I mean, I think, as I say, for bacterial cells, for single
cells, the membrane is what divides them from the outside world. And there's no way, you know,
how does it know what's happening outside? Well, things impinge on the membrane and cross that
membrane. And the cell with its biochemistry has to figure out, what does that mean? And what am I
going to do? Should I swim that way? Or should I swim this way? Or how am I going to behave in
response to this? So there's never, it doesn't know that there's an oil slick over there or whatever
it may be, but it's picked up something and it needs to make a decision as a cell what it's going
to do next. So I quite like the ideas from Carl Friston on this, who talks about a Markov blanket
in the cell membrane as being a Markov blanket. In fact, it is translating between the language of
the outside world and the language of biochemistry inside. And that language of biochemistry inside
is trying to find this low energy state in effect, which is its homeostatic
preferred place to be. I'm not sure I convey very well what he has to say on this, but the way I
interpreted or understand it is, well, if you're in a bad environment, then, you know, your proteins
start to unravel and denature. And that's actually a higher energy state and not a place you want
to be. And if you move over there and your proteins start renaturing again, then that's a better
place to be. But you still need to integrate all of, you know, you've taken a statistical
sampling of the outside world, you've got a correlation that says this happened, therefore
do that. But you take multiple samples of this through multiple receptors and they're conflicting.
Some of them say go over there, some of them say go over there. So how do you integrate all that
information and make a decision about what to do? And that's where the plasma, the cell membrane,
the plasma membrane, if you like, begins to integrate all that information. If you're,
you know, if the problem is that you're poisoned and your substrates don't work,
then your membrane potential is going to fall. If your membrane potential falls, then you move
over there sharpish. So, you know, it provides you with information on your state in the world
as a single entity. And I like to think of that as the simplest possible imaginable form of the
stream of consciousness, which is to say is integrating real time information about your
state in relation to the world in terms of, am I good or am I not good? Really, that's the simplest
simplest thing. Do I, do I go there? Do I, do I stay here? What, you know, it's, it's, it's,
that seems to me to be a fundamental decision for a living cell to make, which is based
entirely on its need to survive in the world and which is integrated by the membrane
and in effect by electrical charge on the membrane as you integrating that information.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a really good point. Chris Fields talks about this kind of thing
in bacteria as a, as an early form of metacognition. Because if you imagine you're a bacterial cell and
some sort of gradient, yeah, you can measure the actual molecule that you're interested in.
But for example, it might be poisonous. It might, there might be a poisonous version of it. And so
what you might also want to have in some bacteria have this is a way of
measuring indirectly, instead of tracking the thing you really want to track, what they track
is your own metabolism. So, so, right? So, so it's a, it's a kind of a self-monitoring loop,
basically a simple example of metacognition where you're, where, where you say, okay,
I'm not going to worry about the details of what it is I'm trying to metabolize. So it's just,
how are we doing? Are we like, you know, and, and, and that gives you, there's some trade-offs
there, but it gives you this, this incredible power of coarse graining over all kinds of details to
have a large scale variable to deal with, right? And, and maybe metabolic state and, and memory
potential is a fantastic example of that. And I think getting back to, to the evolution question,
one, one sort of the hypothesis I would, I will put out there is that the fact that
we have these metabolic needs and the fact that you don't have all the time in the world to process
every possible scenario because you're going to fall apart and be eaten is really, I think,
a key driver of intelligence for the following reason. If you are a creature that does not have
these constraints, it doesn't have metabolic needs. For example, like a modern AI, which is plugged
into the wallet as all the energy it needs, it never has to worry about getting, getting any
energy. If you're a biologically, a biological agent that arose in evolution under these constraints
that you are constantly under this metabolic pressure, one of the things you cannot afford to do
is to be a micro reductionist, meaning that I'm going to track all the micro states in my
environment. You do not have time to, to, to try to be a Laplacian demon. You did, there's just no
time for that. Instead, there's great pressure to become really good at coarse graining the world
into chunks that you can, you can large scale affordances, observables, control knobs, and,
and pay attention to those and, and completely sort of abstract what's underneath. So that pressure
to, to, to, to cut up the, the, all the details into higher level things that you're going to
represent like my metabolism, my resting potential, right? These higher level things means that all
of the, the ability to generalize, the ability to abstract from, from individual instances to
general rules and general observations, and even dare, dare I say for advanced organisms like us,
the ability to tell stories about agents doing things. In other words, to have an
agential view on the world. In other words, in, right, in, in modern humans to have a view of
free will as an, I am a thing that does things. And there's a, there's a, there's a tiger and
tigers and, you know, our agents that do things and so on. All of that has, I think, its origin
all the way at the beginning. The first agential models were made by, by microbes who had to adopt
that stance. They had to adopt an agential stance in order to survive in real metabolic, under
metabolic constraints. And I think what evolution did after that was scale it up to creatures that
can then verbalize it that like us, I've got, you know, I've got free will in this and that.
But, but all of this goes all the way back to the beginning to the necessity to make models of
large scale variables, doing things, being important control knobs. If my voltage is off,
if my metabolism is off, I need to change my voltage. I'm not talking about this sodium ion
versus that sodium ion. I'm talking about getting my voltage fixed up. And that's, you know, that
I think is a driver of, of a ratchet for, for intelligence. I mean, a couple of things. One,
one thing about voltage and bacteria. There's a guy called Ken Nielsen who for years has been
culturing bacteria on electrodes. And the thing is that lots of bacteria is always,
you know, proved impossible to culture them in a pure culture, which is to say just those
bacteria are nothing else. And the reason is basically that they, you know, they dump their
electrons onto their neighbor, which is the back, you know, another bacterial cell of a different
species, let's say, which wants those electrons. And so it's a, it's a syntrophy. They're
effectively living alongside each other. But the way to kind of escape from that is you,
you give them an electrode and you set that member, the potential, the electrical potential
of the electrode to let's say minus 300 millivolts or something like that. And they, you know,
they either dump their electrons onto that or they take their electrons from that.
But then they'll grow on that surface at that, at that voltage. And if you switch the voltage to
say minus 304 millivolts, you get a different bacterial population growing there and you change
it by another three or four millivolts and you get a different and you can effectively grow all of
these pure cultures of bacteria by, by just shifting the voltage by just a few millivolts.
It's extra, it's exquisitely sensitive. The way that they, so again, it's, it's, how all this
works at the level of cells, I don't really know, but the voltage then in your environment and the
way in which you're, you know, where you're offloading your electrons and where you're gaining
your electrons from is, it's, it's, it's fundamental to how cells grow. But coming back to evolution
again, bacteria are using their, their, their membrane as the interface to the world. But then
we have eukaryotic cells that have internalized mitochondria. And they start using the plasma
membrane for something different. And they can be now much more interesting in what you do with
your plasma membrane. You don't have to be using it for energetics all the time. You can be using
it for much more interesting and subtle things, including changing shape and becoming a phagocytes.
Or beating silly or whatever it may be. But now the, this kind of simple idea that your
metabolism is directly plugged into your membrane and gives you an immediate integrated feedback
on your state in the world becomes much more complicated because a lot of your metabolism
is happening in the mitochondria. You may have got scores of mitochondria. They may all be doing
different things, depending on where they are in the cell. And the cell now has a kind of a,
you know, a bigger problem of how do I integrate all this extra information about how I'm doing in
the environment? And it seems to me almost necessary to bring it. I mean, you could imagine
that it could all work by, you know, phosphorylating everything. But I find it very hard to buy. I
find it much easier to imagine that either we've got networks, but more likely we're simply signaling
electrically between different mitochondria and between mitochondria and the cell membrane,
so that the cell is integrating its state still electrically, but in a more subtle and
sophisticated way. So, you know, this is a big, I would say a big challenge at the origin of the
eukaryotic cell. How do you, you know, rewire yourself to work as, instead of being a consortium
of cells that have their own independence, but now some of them are inside, how do you
kind of rewire so you act as an entity, as an individual organism at the level of the cell,
with all of these things inside, all of which are metabolizing potentially in different ways. So,
there's a problem with integration there. And then you have the next level up, which is you become
multicellular, and then you've got another problem with integration. So, you're kind of taking up the,
you're accessing up the hardware required to keep a, keep a signal, which is intelligible.
And by the time you got into a central nervous system, it's enormously complex, of course.
I mean, that's what my next question was. So, first of all, the eukaryogenesis that you mentioned,
it's again, like your argument that it happened after two billion years. So, this is also quite
exciting that, you know, or interesting that for two billion years, bacteria were surviving
somehow. And then with this certain transition where to unicellular, they come together.
Yeah. I mean, that's not really my argument so much as that's an observation, which is to say
there are, I mean, molecular clocks, which are not to be believed very heartily for deep
evolutionary history. But they're putting eukaryotes at one and a half to two billion years ago,
that kind of time. And eukaryotes all clearly share the same cell structures. They clearly
share a common ancestor, unless convergent evolution has an astonishing power to regenerate
exactly the same cell structures. But that's hard to buy. And before that, there's plenty of evidence
for bacteria going back to practically four billion years ago. And there's plenty of evidence for all
the big nutrient cycles, iron cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, and so on.
So there's plenty of evidence that there were bacteria throughout this whole time.
So there is an issue with this apparently unique origin of eukaryotic cells. Now,
it's quite possible that there were hundreds or thousands of origins of complex cells and they
all just disappeared without trace. But it's also possible that that wasn't the case and that there
are structural constraints on bacteria which relate to having a charge on their membrane,
which effectively say it's not easy to internalize all of this stuff. It's a big, big structural
change. It's not easy to get inside one. And when you get inside it, you've got your own vested
interests and chances are it will go wrong. But I'm pointing to this electrical wiring issue.
It's not just about integrating your biochemistry. It's also about how do I reintegrate my wiring
as an individual cell as an organism? You look at, I think we both show the same video occasionally,
Mike, it's a ciliate. I forget which one it is, but it's feeding this astonishing control.
That's the one, yes. It's astonishing control that it has. And you think, is it really detecting
concentration gradients of molecules or is it picking up on something electrical to do that?
How does it know that there's something right there and right there in the space of seconds
or less than seconds? One fun thing that there's a cool paper by Min Zhao and colleagues where
he shows that there are cells, I think maybe keratocytes or something, that crawl in a particular
direction in an electric field. So they have very robust electrotaxis. But if you actually cut up the
cell into pieces, the pieces, the fragments crawl in the opposite direction. So it's a great example
of, I think Richard Watson says it this way, that the point of holes is to get the parts
to do things they wouldn't normally do. And this is like a cool example of that because
all the parts want to go that way. The collective goes that way. And it's a very active electrosensitive
process. Fascinating. So maybe let's talk about multicellularity because I think that's, so I mean,
Mike is using this core screen kind of analogy or metaphor and Nick is using the integration. I
don't know if they are different. I think it's probably both. No, I think it amounts to the
same thing. Yeah. So let's talk about multicellularity that and then interestingly, I mean,
of course, we nowadays we talk about biofilm, bacterial biofilms that it happens also in bacteria,
etc. But what is the difference between bacterial biofilms and a multicellular organism like
anything, any animal, we can talk about plant fungi, etc. Right. I mean, there's a simple
answer to that, which is that they're all composed of different cells, different
genetically very different to each other. And the point about pretty much all,
well, all metazoans, all animals, all plants, they've all been through a single cell stage
and we're all basically clonal. So our genome is the same. So there are multicellular bacteria,
so filamentous cyanobacteria. They have two different cell types. So the nitrogen fixing
cells, the heterocysts and the photosynthetic cells. So it's not that it's not possible for
bacteria to do that. But they don't do much of it. Whereas a biofilm is deep cooperation between
different types of cell. But the whole of evolutionary biology and pretty much all the
experiments on things like slime molds, which come together as genetically different cells and
then cooperate to build a stalk, for example, for distributing spores. Cheating is a real issue
that they never tend to generate greater complexity than something like a stalk,
because the cheats always win in the end, because they're genetically distinct to each other. So
I think mainstream evolutionary biology would just say animals are clonal. And that restricts
the amount of fighting that goes on between cells. And I don't see any reason to argue with that.
I think the reason that eukaryotic cells make animals and plants much more readily is that we
have much larger genomes. And we can have much, much larger genomes because we have mitochondria
and much better energy generation, if you like, than bacteria. And that means you can switch
genes on and off in different tissues. And if you're switching genes on and off in different
tissues, then you're shifting not only the hardware, but also all the electrical properties of
different tissues as well. So the more the coarse graining can be then shifted as well. Whereas
if you've got different types of bacterial cell, all of which have got their own agenda, the idea
of having a kind of network of cells which are generating a common kind of electrical
phase that they're in becomes at least a lot more problematic, I would say. Is that
your take, Mike, or would you see it differently? So yeah, it's a super interesting topic. I'll
first of all, about the bacteria stuff. And you may want to have him on. So if you haven't already,
so Goral Soelle from UCSD who studies bacterial biofilms and the way they coordinate using
bioelectricity to make sure that everybody gets fed and the population, all this kind of stuff. So
there may be, and it's not my thing, so you should talk to him. But I think there's some
very interesting cooperativity stuff going on there. What I think might be fun is being a kind
of a spoil sport that I am. I don't completely disagree with this idea that, of course,
going through this bottleneck is important evolutionarily. But I just want to bring up
a few examples that kind of poke some holes into this story because I think they're worth
getting to the bottom of a couple of things. The first thing is that despite our largely
genetic homogeneity inside our bodies, cells and organs compete with each other. So for example,
during development, there's really a strong competition between all kinds of organs.
And we have computational models of this and farmers and other, you know,
scientists have been publishing this stuff for a really long time. There's actually a lot of
competition and struggle. And the classical biologist, Rue, called this, he had a long
monograph called The Struggle of the Parts, where he talks about all of the ways that the pieces of
an embryo and of an organism are actually fighting each other for all kinds of stuff for, even though
they have similar genetics. The other thing I want to talk about is how similar really the
genetics are. So in humans, Doug Brash tells me that there are about 100,000 mutations per skin
cell in normal skin. This is not cancer. This is normal skin, 100,000 mutations per cell.
So and people like, I think, Walsh at the Harvard Medical School is finding mutations
in the brain and in human neurons. So there's actually apparently there's a ton of genetic
variability and where it really reaches its kind of ultimate expression, I think this is one of
the most interesting stories, planaria are mixoploid. I mean, certain species, every cell has a
different number of chromosomes. The genome is an unbelievable mess. And yet these are the animals
with the most regenerative ability, the cancer resistance, immortal, as far as we can tell.
And it's kind of an amazing scandal that the animal with the best anatomical control, immortality,
and regeneration is also the one with the most messy genome, right? Every cell. And so this used
to drive me completely crazy, this idea. Well, first of all, why does nobody talk about this? We
never hear about this. You know, in a standard develop isn't a standard biology, a kind of curriculum,
what they tell you is well, the genome is what sets your anatomy. So who would expect the
relationship to be backwards? It doesn't make any sense. Recently, literally in the last few months,
I think we've got kind of a handle on this story. And so I think we now have an understanding of
what's going on there. And if you want, I can talk about it. But yes, please.
But well, okay, so imagine this. Typically, the way people simulate evolution is you've got some
sort of genotype, the genome codes for some sort of phenotype, and then selection. So you do your
mutation on the genotype, and you do your selection on the phenotype. What's often missing is that,
and this goes back to the initial conversation, that physiological layer in between,
because the genotypes actually don't almost never code directly for the phenotype. What they code
for is properties of some sort of physiological system where the software is going to determine
the phenotype. So we did some simulations. And we created this thing. It's extremely simple. It's
just that the genome is just a set of numbers. And they start off all mixed up. And the phenotype,
what you select for is making sure the numbers are all in nice order from zero to 100, let's say.
So this is the developmental equivalent of having a body axis, of having a primary axis with your
tail over here and your head over here and everything in the right order in between.
So if you just have genotype and phenotype, of course, a standard genetic algorithm will
eventually, and if you look at the fitness over time curve, it's this, you will, of course,
it will sort all the numbers and you will get your, you know, you'll get your sort of embryo.
That works fine. However, now let's do something interesting. Let's put in,
and this is the work of Shrisha Lakshwin in my lab, a student, an undergrad actually.
What we did was we put in a developmental phase where, yeah, you've got your genome,
but much like with real evolution, the cells aren't passive, dumb material. They actually
have a little bit of, they have their own agenda, right? And during that process, from being a
genome to being an adult that you get selected on, they have some time to do things. Cells are not
blank slate material, right? They always, you know, they're always doing something.
And so imagine if you put in just a little bit, just a tiny bit of what we call competency on
the cells and the competency just works like this. You look at your neighbor and if they have an
identity, a number that's way different from yours, it stresses you out. You don't like it.
And so during that developmental process, and this is very developmentally, this is very much a
fact that when you put two things together where their positional information is too far off,
that's how you get regeneration. They will both generate things in between to separate themselves
and put in, you know, so if you put a five next to a 10, they will generate the six, seven, eight
in inside, right? In between them. So you give cells just a tiny ability for that competency
just to look at their neighbors and maybe crawl around a little bit to try and reduce their
stress level. What happens then is that when an individual comes up for evaluation of fitness
and they look pretty good, the numbers are kind of pretty sorted. Evolution doesn't know,
selection doesn't know whether it looks good because the genome was amazing or it looks good
because the genome was actually so so, but everything sort of crawled around. So what that
means is that the genome now has a hard time selecting on the genotype, the genome, the
selection cannot see the defects of the genotype. So it has a really hard time making any progress
on improving the structural genome, but what it can do is put all its effort in improving
the competency. So in the next generation, what you get are individuals that are slightly more
competent. Now, this makes the problem worse because they're slightly more competent. It's
even harder to know what their genome was like because they look really great. Who knows what
their genome was like. And so you end up with this positive feedback loop where the minute you
admit that you're dealing not with a passive material, but with cells that can make some
decisions locally, you immediately get into this arms race where the effort starts going into
increasing that competency, not fixing the genotype. And so in the end, if you let it run
all the way, now, of course, there are some other factors that can sort of dampen that runaway
feedback loop. But if you let it run all the way, what you get are exactly planaria, you get organisms
that are really good at making a good organism, no matter what the genome looks like,
all the effort goes into the algorithm. Very little pressure is left to keep a clean genome.
The genomes look like hell, but the organisms look amazing because all of the effort have gone
into the mechanisms that allow them to build what they need to build, even though the hardware is
all over the place. And so what I think happened in planaria, I think this went all the way up.
And in other organisms like us and other creatures, it stopped halfway. There are other
things that sort of dampen it down. So we can kind of do that, but not as good, not as well as
as planaria. And it also explains why it's such a weird thing. Any other animal, any other
multicellular creature, you can call a stock center and you can get a strain of abnormal mutants.
So you can get flies with curly wings and mice with crooked tails and albinos. And
planaria, there is no such thing as a strain of abnormal planaria, other than our two-headed
form. And those are not genetic. Those are not genetic. And there's never been a planarian mutant
line. Isn't that weird? Why not? And also, for now, I would say for about 30 years, maybe more,
people have been trying to make transgenic planaria and it's never worked. It just doesn't work.
Why does it not work? And why do we not have strains? I think because the algorithm is such
that it basically ignores most of the genome. Not all of it, of course, because you still need
the competency machinery. But the competency is such that it can tolerate
massive degrees of error in the genome and it expects to. That's why, because of this runaway
ratchet. So I think it is true. Like you said, I think, of course, we go through a bottleneck and
we do share genetically much more so than the bacteria. But I think there's a lot more play
in that system. I think potentially we're not actually sharing all the DNA and even when we
do, I think, and I think Grohl would say that the bioelectrics actually is a really good way
to crank up cooperativity when you don't share genetics. I'm putting words in his mouth, I don't
know, but I think that's what his work says to me. Sorry, just one quick thing on the biofilms
before coming around to that. I mean, one question that I had at the back of my mind is
a lot of bacteria, for example, growing on, let's say, a rusty iron surface and they're
effectively putting their electrons onto the iron and dissolving the rusty iron and they're
using it effectively as oxygen as an electron acceptor. And there's been a question for a long
time, okay, the bacteria that are touching the surface, no problem. They just dumped their
electron straight onto it, no problem. The ones which are up here somewhere, not actually touching
that surface at all. And there were all kinds of questions about electron shuttles, quinones,
external quinones that wasn't really clear quite what they were doing. The implication was that
they were somehow swimming down here, putting the electrons on and then swimming back again. And
you think, well, how's a quinone going to do that? And it seems much more likely that actually what
they're doing is just dumping it on the next cell. And that next cell dumps it on the one underneath.
And so you end up with, yes, a charge running straight through this entire colony. And it becomes,
in effect, altruistic, although all the individual cells were behaving selfishly and simply
dumping their electrons on their nearest neighbor. And to some extent, this is a little bit what you're
saying about a multi-cell plenarium where they're not genetically so similar, but they're freaked out
by their neighbor, which is doing something different. So they are responding to this by
trying to put something in the way, or presumably by fixing the charge in some way locally. So
I don't really quite see how this works. But how long can it last before the hardware itself
breaks down sufficiently that they can't tell that their neighboring cell is not like them,
or freaky, or, you know, they've got to be able to detect it. They've got to have some awareness of
what's next to them. You're able to do that. And presumably, if your genome is completely riddled,
you must lose your ability to do that at some point. So here's what I'll say. I mean, the thing
we know for sure is that they've been around for 300 million years, 400 million years, and going
strong, no sign of any breakdown. But the other thing, and this is totally unpublished, so treat
this with every possible grain of salt. But I'll just sort of tell you, we had a project a few
years ago where we cultured plenaria in mutagens. So the stuff that you would dip a zebrafish embryo
in for a short period of time to make mutants, we cultured them in that stuff for like a year.
And what we saw was that the particular animals that were in the mutagen would have some freaky
sort of defects, but then you cut them into pieces. And after that, you just get lines of
absolutely normal plenaria after that. So I don't know. I assume there must be some kind of limit.
I think you're right. But I don't think we're anywhere near having reached it, I think. And
this is something that we're actually investigating actively now is just like,
what's the limit of this? How far can we really trash the genome before in an organism like this
before there's a problem? Boy, I don't know. How small a piece can you cut for it to
regenerate the entire thing? Are you down to just a few cells, more than that?
It's more than a few cells. The record is something like 275. And this was Thomas Hunt
Morgan in early 1900s. And maybe now with antibiotics and so on, we could do even more.
Single cells don't work. It's very hard. You can't get a full plenaria out of one cell,
but little tiny chunks work. So you need the context of the cells around you to have some kind
of... And I don't know if that's for a boring reason, meaning that the surface area to volume
ratio is too large and it loses all the goodies. That would be maybe like a mechanical reason.
Or if it's a deep reason, like the information on building a plenarian is a holographic kind of
storage. And if you don't have enough, it's just too fuzzy. You can't recover what you need. I don't
know which it is. But there is an interesting story that relates to what you were just talking
about, which suggests that these kind of electrical transfers can override genetic,
I'm just now thinking about this, can override genetic dysrelatedness and
potentiate cooperativity. And the story goes like this, in tadpoles, we can inject a human
KRAS mutation, which is a nasty oncogenic mutation. You inject it, those cells, they become a tumor,
they invade the embryo, it's just bad seed. What you can do is simultaneously co-inject an
ion channel that forces the cells to a voltage at which they will stay electrically connected to
their neighbors. And if you do that, even though the genetics has been... Basically, there's a
very, very powerful hardware level mutation, the oncogene is blazing, it doesn't get destroyed
or anything, we can see it, we can see the protein is still there. But the cells don't make a tumor,
they cooperate, they continue to cooperate and they build nice skin and muscle and whatever.
And this just, it dovetails with the story that we have about gap junctions
potentiating individuals into collectives where it wipes, it tends to wipe that individuality
on an informational level. If you and I are connected with a gap junctional signal,
and your memories and my memories, molecules are sort of floating back and forth,
we have no idea whose memory belongs to whom. And we become, you and I become a we in the sense
that we now have one shared pool of metabolic memories, everything. It's very hard to keep
identity. And so I think what you described in the bacteria is really interesting. And the
metazone version of that is gap junctions, where you use that electrical network to overcome
differences in genetics and kind of potentiate the cooperativity.
I'm amazed that this hasn't caught on more. I mean, maybe you're in different circles to me,
but when I talk to cancer people, not very many of them are thinking in these terms,
even though it's been known for a long time that if you transfer the nucleus of a cancer
cell into a non-cancer cell, then it doesn't become cancerous, it doesn't become
carcinogenic. It's the cytoplasm, which is doing the thing. And so many mutations that you see,
oncogeny mutations in a tumor, you see the same mutations next to the tumor and elsewhere in
the body. So it's very much the context. I was talking to a woman at King's College in London,
who I met recently, Jodie Rosenblatt. And she was working on epithelium. And this
interesting question that you have cells which are producing, dividing and producing new cells,
and those new cells are growing towards each other, and they get to a place where they're
effectively pressing up against each other, and there are various mechanoreceptors. And some of
them pop out. But which ones pop out? And on what basis do they pop out? And the way that she
described all of this, I said, you should look at the charge on these cells. And I mentioned
your work to her. And she's been checking, and it all works on charge. I forget which way around
it is, but I'm pretty sure if they lose the membrane potential, they pop out. So it seems
ripe to explain a lot of things which are probably not only that, as you said earlier on, the
mechanoreception and your proximity to other cells is going to be other things going on as well.
But it's this balance. It must be a very fine balance. It's allowing you to know
you're the odd one out, off you go. Yeah. It's a different perspective on this whole problem,
because traditionally, you would have, for example, game theory approaches where you would say,
well, the cancer cells are more selfish, and that way they do this or that. I actually don't
think they're any more selfish at all. I think what it is is their cells are smaller. So what
happens is if you're in good gap junctional electrical connection, you are plugged into a
network that yourself, meaning the border between you and the outside world and tumors of the goals
that you're going to maintain, the internal milieu, all of these things, is huge. You might be a
whole hand or you might be a liver or a kidney. It makes this large thing. These oncogenes,
one of the things they do is they cause gap junctional closure. They cause depolarization
and gap junctional closure. And as soon as you're a cell that basically partially or completely
disconnects from that network, now the border of yourself is tiny. That's it. It's just this now.
And at that, it's just the size of a single cell. And at that point, you roll back to the kinds of
goals that single cell creatures can pursue, which is proliferation and migration to where life is
good. And so now to you, the rest of the animal is just external environment. The rest of the body
is just outside world for you because you're an amoeba. You're an amoeba now. And so that
boundary between self and world, one of the things that these electrical connections do
is they inflate it. During evolution of multicellularity, that boundary gets inflated
so that now we are a liver. It's not I'm a liver cell, we are a liver. Whereas, and it acts
collectively to solve large-scale problems in morphogenetic spaces, as soon as you disconnect
from that, you're back to amoeba style, where everything around you is just potentially a
threat, potentially genetically unrelated to you, all these things. And then of course,
you do whatever you can, which is metastasized, basically.
There was some work some years ago now from a guy called Neil Blackstone in Illinois. And he had been
working on a colonial, I forget what, but basically colonies. And a lot there, they're
forming effectively a multicellular organism. It's a colony rather than strictly multicellular,
but the gap is quite close. But the conditions that they're subject to depends on where you are
in the colony, or you're at the edge, in which case, you've got a higher oxygen concentration
surrounding you. Or are you in the middle, in which case you're in hypoxic conditions?
Where do you put your flagella, the cells that differentiate into flagella and the whole
colony can paddle itself around then? Well, they're the ones on the outside that have got
plenty of oxygen. Which ones become the stem cells and the gametes for the next generation?
Well, they're the ones that are in the middle, which are effectively oxygen deprived. And so
just the structure of a blob immediately gives you a difference between the outside and the
inside and the likelihood of cells. And I remember reading that and the whole thing worked on redox
signaling. And of course, I like the idea of redox chemistry. And I looked into, is there
something about mammalian development that works on redox signaling? And I didn't really find anything
very much that led through. And then I thought later on, well, this is a kind of a very hard
wiring, but every organ will be subjected to the same thing. You need to override that. You need
to have a better system of organizing it if you wish to become any more complicated than a blob.
And that's where I think the bioelectric fields are beginning to come in, is you've got a level
of organization that says where the same, where together, where not quite an individual, where
we're in this grouping here. But coming back to planaria, you cut it into a lump of 250, 270
cells, whatever it may be. I'm wondering about how do you prevent your genome becoming completely
trashed? And I suppose part of the answer would be, well, if you're not every cell is going to
get equally trashed, and not every bit of tissue is going to get equally trashed. So if you were
just slice it up into little bits, some bits would have a better genome than others. They would
have some level of genomic integrity, at least at a functional level, not necessarily in terms of
they've all got neat chromosomes, but they're capable of generating the hardware which is required
to regenerate the whole planarium. So there's a kind of a bottleneck just in the pieces. And those
pieces have to be large enough that they're able to reestablish the bioelectric fields and know
their own morphology. It has to be big enough that it can reestablish a planarium. If it's one cell,
it's got no idea what its neighbor is, so it wouldn't do it. But that, I think from a point of view
of kind of more conventional genetics, you'd say there was some kind of bottleneck in cutting the
planarium up and the smaller bits that were least as damaged would be the ones most likely to
regenerate. Yeah, I mean, well, the thing is, they all regenerate. So all of them do.
I mean, it's right. I think you would want to say something like that, but A, every piece
regenerates and B, every mutation that doesn't kill the cell that it's in gets propagated. So
there are these stem cells. There's about 30% of the animal disease, neoblast. So when they get hit
with a mutation, anything that doesn't kill that stem cell, it now propagates when the thing divides
itself in half, it becomes sort of amplified in the next generation, which is why they look
like hell, the genetics look like hell. And so you would think that there's a limit to this,
but I think the pressure of having a nice clean genome is way low for these guys.
Just they've gotten to the point. Steve Frank gave me a cool analogy to this. Did you know I
didn't know about this when I heard about this, that you know, I'm rate arrays in computers,
right? Where you have a instead of one disc, you have like six discs, and there's a system which
does a parity thing so that so so apparently, ever since rate arrays became a thing, the quality
of the media has gone down because there's no because the pressure on having a good disc is
down because that doesn't matter that much, you've got a rate array. And so and so right. So
so there's this feedback loop where the better your software for correcting errors, the less
pressure there is on the media to be to be reliable. But once you go there, it's hard to
write. It's a ratchet because once you can't suddenly say, well, I'm taking my rate array off.
Well, now you can't because you're because your media is crap now. So yeah, I mean,
some of the stuff I do is on is on mitochondrial DNA, which is generally said to be at least
evolving about 10 times faster than the nuclear genes. There's not that much of it. It's quite
small. And it always comes in effect in colonies, so there may be several hundred thousand copies
in a single site. And so how does quality control work? And in the case of the mitochondria,
there definitely is quality control, even though it's evolving and mutating pretty quickly. And
again, you have a lot of differences in mitochondrial sequences between different tissues and
mutations accumulating as we age and so on, though probably not fast enough to drive aging as a
process. And again, there's a lot that can be done with
some form of bottlenecking in the broadest sense, which is to say, you need, I mean, the way that
it seems to work with the mitochondria in the germline is that there are groups of cells,
clumps of cells, germline cysts, they're called in the female in the female germline,
and they group together and they form cytoplasmic connections between them, and they transfer
mitochondria as well as Golgi apparatus and RNAs and things into the, it's not necessarily
the central cell, but a cell in the middle of this network. And that effectively accumulates
mitochondria in what's called the mitochondrial cloud sometimes,
now the Balbionic body. And there's an interesting question then, you're bringing all this DNA
together from separate sources, what's going on? We've just gone through a rounds of segregation
during early germline development where you produce something like six or seven million
ugonia, the very earliest germ cells, which are divided by mitosis. And then we start fusing
them together and transferring material between them. And we did a simulation study trying to work
out, well, what would be the expected rate of mutation accumulation? And can we compare it with
mutations, mitochondria mutations in human populations? What's the known incidence of
mitochondrial diseases? And can we predict that? And it turned out that if you had some level of
selection on mitochondrial function, which is to say the simplest way to see it will be membrane
potential, if you can generate, if you can, as a single mitochondrion with a bit of mitochondrial
DNA, if you can generate a membrane potential, you can go over there. If you can't do it, you stay here.
So it's at the level of the software, that's where the judgment is going on, but you're
throwing out the hardware, which is not very good, which is not very good in the sense of
not able to generate the membrane potential. And then you accumulate all the ones which are capable
of generating a decent membrane potential in the, what's now the primordial oversight,
and then amplify that up and it becomes, if it matures, it becomes the oversight.
And that selection on the function as they're pooled together was able to predict moderately,
accurately, the actual incidence of mitochondrial diseases. So it's not that you're avoiding
mutations so much as you're able to kind of, despite the fact you've always got large populations,
you're able to kind of select on some level of function. I've got no idea if there's anything
like that happening in planaria, that there's some level that these cells are capable of generating
enough of a field that it's got the right tuning to regenerate. I mean, you're saying everything
can, but presumably there must be some point where it collapses. Yeah. Well, I mean, so that's
super interesting. One of the things we're going to be looking for when we reprise this
experiment of keeping them in mutagens and all that, the prediction that I would make
consistent with what you just said is that the one thing you can't do is trash
all of your ion channels. And we know that they're sensitive to that because we can make
two-headed worms and worms that look like all kinds of crazy stuff. That's very easy by targeting
these capsules. So one interesting hypothesis that comes out of what you just said is that
there is a selection step, which is make whatever mutations you want, but if you lose the ability
to be electrically, and I'm not sure if it's just keeping a certain V-mem or maybe reacting,
maybe it's a second-order thing, I don't know, we'll see. As long as you hold on to that,
everything else is good to go. So that's a really interesting idea. I love that idea that
there's a minimal electrical competency that you get tested for, and that that's your bottleneck.
Yeah, I may ping you offline later for some references to this thing in my country because
I think that's actually super interesting. I think also we can kind of talk about the
because there has to be some sort of plasticity threshold at the genetics level.
And I mean, that begs the question, I mean, first of all, can we understand just by the genome,
which organism, which species is it, etc. And how much plasticity can we allow in the hardware?
Yeah, I don't know. People say things like developmental constraints, you can only make
certain things with a certain genome. I am not sure of that at all. I think that
in my head, I have this challenge that I think what we should be aiming for is this thing I call
the anatomical compiler. And I think we ought to be able to do is in the future is sit down in front
of a computer and draw the plant or animal that you want, whatever it is, I don't care what it is,
it's a seven-legged frog with a propeller on top, but you know, anything you like,
right, like anything you want. And if we knew what we were doing, this thing would compile that
description down into a set of stimuli that would get a standard set of cells to build whatever.
Now, you're not going to, you're not going to make things that disobey gravity. You're not going
to make things that, you know, have a copper armature for a motor like that. That was fine.
But biologically possible shapes, whatever they are, you should be able to make. And I bet,
I don't know if we'll live to see this thing, but I would bet that it's possible. And
from the plasticity that I see, even before we really understand anything about how
collectives of cells make decisions, but I think we already have examples that
I think are telling you that this standard thing we see in development is just one of
a huge space of possible things it can do. So if I had to put money down right now, I would say that
I think almost any allowable geometric shape could be made if we understood how to communicate
with cellular collectives. Sorry, go ahead. What do you think it is that's
tending to produce the same shape repeatedly? I think what I, so here's my hypothesis on all of
this. I think that evolution does not counter to expectation. I think evolution generally does
not take the past literally. In other words, it does not over-train on prior examples. You know,
in machine learning, you have this notion of over-training when the thing memorizes the past
examples instead of generalizing from them, right? And there may be organisms like that.
Maybe C. elegans is like that. I don't know. But generally, I think what evolution does is instead
of producing a specific solution to a specific environment, I think it generally makes problem
solving machines. And the reason I think it does that is because the environment, both the individual
cell environment and the overall environment, is so uncertain that maybe we had creatures,
you know, way at the beginning that really were just suitable for one kind of environment.
I think those are all gone now. I think anything that we see now, our systems, what evolution
gives us is a system that can behave adaptively in a huge range of circumstances, not because we've
seen those circumstances before and now you've got built-in abilities to handle them, although in
some cases they may. But what we're making is hardware that's a problem solver in a wide domain.
And we have a bunch of examples of that where we challenge living things with conditions that
they've never seen before. And they're fine. They do novel things that are completely unexpected.
And so I think what evolution does is produce hardware that under normal circumstances reliably
does one thing. But that's not the only thing it can do. It's sort of like I always envision,
you get this calculator and you buy a thousand of them from a factory and you turn them all on
and they all say zero. You say, wow, this thing is incredibly reliable. Yeah, under those conditions,
they'll all say zero. That's not the only thing it can do. And with appropriate inputs and appropriate
other scenarios, it'll do all kinds of stuff. And you'll never know if all you're watching is the
standard. That's why I like synthetic morphology and I like challenging things with all kinds of
weird, you know, with all kinds of weird scenarios. I'll give you a couple of examples. Here's an
example. You take planarium and you put them in a solution of barium. Barium is a non-specific
potassium channel blocker. So all their potassium channels stop working. Their heads are full of
neurons and other things that like to transfer potassium. So their heads explode literally
overnight. Their heads explode. Well, you take those remaining bodies and you leave them in the
barium. In fact, you refresh the barium every couple of days. Within two weeks, they regrow a
new head. The new head doesn't care about barium at all. No problem. So we said, well, that's bizarre.
How could that be? So we took the original heads. We took the barium adapted heads. We did a really
knowing that the answer might not be transcriptional, but this is the tool we have. So basically,
what we did was we just asked, what's different in the gene expression between the barium adapted
heads and the control heads? A very small number of genes different. And so imagine now, and so
now here's the trick. Plenarium never see barium in the wild. There's no barium out in the wild.
There's no evolutionary pressure to know what to do when you're poisoned by barium. That doesn't
exist. Imagine you're in this nuclear reactor control room. The genes are all the knobs. You
get 20,000 different knobs. You're hit with this physiological stressor. The thing's melting down.
It's going to explode. You don't have time to randomly try different knobs. You don't have
time for gradient descent. These are not bacteria that cells don't turn over all that fast. So you
can't just randomly mutate and see who survives and then they rebuild the head. There's no time for
that. The cells don't grow that fast. Within a very short period of time, this thing navigates
the whatever 20,000 dimensional space of gene expression to zero in on about a dozen transcripts
that will solve your physiological problem. Now, how in the heck does it know? For a completely
new stressor like this, how does it know which ones those are? You can think about it. We don't
know the answer to this, but one thing that it might be able to do is, okay, I've never seen barium
before, but I have seen epileptic seizures before. Maybe the excitotoxicity of having your neurons
die from abnormal potassium flux is somewhat similar. What you really have is you have the
ability to generalize. This is a system that in any other, if we had a robot that did this,
this would be generalization and learning of the highest degree. This is like, I haven't seen this
before, but I've seen something else. And I bet it's similar enough to this that I can try this
out. So that's one example. Another example is the xenobots. So we take some skin from frog embryos.
They replicate themselves with kinematic self-replication. They run around,
collect other skin cells, put them into a little ball, and now you get your next gen.
There's never been any xenobots in the wild. There's never been pressure to be a good xenobot.
There's no other animal does kinematic self-replication. So I think life is capable of
huge number of a variety of things that solve problems that go beyond the narrow default that
we see. I mean, just coming back to the barium issue and the generalization, I mean, there's
lots of, there was a bacterium dinococcus radiodurans, which is astonishing the radiation
resistance and grows on the inside of nuclear power stations and can survive in outer space and
all kinds of things like that. They sometimes call it, I think, colon the bacterium. And the
question is, well, how does it actually do that? And it's largely exposure to other types of stress.
So for example, dehydration stress generates pretty much the same kind of internal
metabolic problems that radiation does. And so in some sense, I would see it as your metabolism
is stressed in a particular way. It doesn't matter if it's barium or something else,
which is stressing it as an epileptic fit, which is stressing it in that way, excited
toxicity or whatever. There's a particular type of stress that the cell is experiencing in its
metabolism. And there's a physiological response to deal with that, which might be to express a
different ion pump on the membrane, which doesn't do potassium, but does sodium instead. Or I don't
know what it might do, but there'd be a physiological response that you could have to that, which is
in effect generalizing from the stress to the metabolism internally, rather than being able
to identify what the external problem is. I completely agree with that. So that's one
policy for handling the unknown. And I think that's exactly right. I think that
multi-scale architecture where you have the genetics, and you have the physiology,
and then you have anatomy, and so on, it becomes like a neural network, not in the neural aspect,
but in the information processing aspect, it generalizes for the same reason that
the connection is the networks generalize in machine learning. It's an inherent property of
these networks that they can do stuff like that. Every layer sort of generalizes to the
categories of the layer before it. And so that's why I think it's just an inherent structure.
Not to also forget that now we see that even pathways can learn. So they have
some ability to learn from experience and so on. So I think that's why I'm so
sanguine on being able to build anything for themselves. And where are or how these memories
are stored? I mean, Mike can probably answer that, but just one story to insert before he does.
There was a lady she died recently at the age of 96 at UCL called Ursula Mitvok,
and she worked on sex determination for a long time, and she was very interested in it.
Oh, she died? Yes, you're familiar with Ursula as well.
I know her, yeah. I didn't know she passed. I knew she was quite old, yeah.
Yeah, she was extraordinarily active until really only a couple of years ago.
I wrote an obituary of her. I really admired her work. I'll send it to you.
But she linked it to growth rates, because there's all these different types of
chromosomal sex determination, and you know, X and Y chromosomes are only a part of it.
There have been multiple origins of different types of X and Y chromosome birds, and
many other things have got, you know, ZW chromosomes, where it's the other way around,
that the male is the homogometic sex with two of the same chromosomes.
And then there's temperature dependent sex determination, and she had linked
the whole lot to growth rates. And effectively, what the Y chromosome is doing is activating
some growth factors that say, you know, go ahead and grow quickly. And there's some interesting
questions in my own mind about mitochondrial inheritance and when you are allowed to grow
quickly, and when it's best not to grow quickly, which may. So this earliest distinction between
a male embryo developing in a female is just size. Males grow faster early on,
not necessarily throughout the entire development, but grow faster earlier. And then she called
attention to truchum aphrodites, who I think there's maybe a different term now, but effectively
have an ovary on one side and a testis on the other side. And it's not random which side it's on.
The testis is usually, you know, 70% of the time is on the right hand side and the ovary on the left
hand side. And there are slight differences in growth rates between the right hand side
and the left hand side at that early stage, measurable differences, measurable, you know,
with a weighing scales or a ruler practically, that level of detection. And so, you know,
talking about developmental plasticity, what are you going to develop an ovary or a testis?
It's a pretty constrained developmental plasticity in relation to some of the things you're talking
about. But still, it's determined not just genetically. And there are all kinds of interesting,
you know, there are mice with mutations in particular genes that will lead to a sex change,
which have got nothing to do with the Y chromosome or with the SLY gene or anything like that is able
to override the SLY gene simply by increasing the growth rate of the embryo or decreasing it and
becoming female instead of male. So there are these other in terms of what do you develop into and
how much developmental plasticity is there? Factors like growth rates can play a major role.
Exactly how and how common that is, I don't know. But, you know, this whole idea that
temperature dependent sex determination in amphibians and so on, basically doing the same thing as the
chromosome shows all this possibility of overwriting things we think we know the answer to. We think
the answer lies in a gene which says you're going to become male, you're going to become female.
And there's all of these, you know, intersexual states, in fact, and mostly it's this or that.
But there's the scope in the middle is what she called, I think,
I forget the term that she had for it, but it's basically a threshold dichotomy, I think was the
phrase that she used. So the genes tend to push you into one state or the other state, but there's
quite a lot of flex between the two. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, so I can talk a little bit about the
bioelectric memories that override the genetics, but I want to go first, even just more basic than
that. So here's the kind of, to me, the most stunning thing. Imagine a single amniote embryo,
let's say an amniote embryo, so a bird or human or something, and it's a flat blasted disc like
this about 50,000 cells. So you look at an early stage, so you look at this thing, you say, well,
there's an embryo, and you might ask yourself, what are we counting when we say there's one embryo?
I mean, most of the time there's one embryo, but one thing you can do is you can, and I did this
as a grad student in ducks and chicken eggs, you can take a little needle and you can put a scratch
or multiple scratches through that blasted term, and this is a method discovered by this guy Lutz
in the 40s. So you put a couple of scratches in, and then what happens is that each region of that
blasted term for a while until it heals up, it doesn't feel the other regions and self-organizes
into an embryo, and then when it heals up, you got conjoined twins or triplets or whatever.
So there's a couple of interesting things that come out of this. First of all, what you're counting
when you say it's an embryo is how many distinct locally aligned collectives are there that are
all working on one project, and usually there's one, and that project is getting to a particular
area of morphospace building the right kind of embryo, but there doesn't have to be one. There
could be anywhere from zero to probably 10 or so, I would guess, and that number is absolutely not
genetically determined. You don't know how many embryos are in this thing until the physiology
has had it say, and then you will find out maybe it's typically one, but it doesn't have to be one.
How many are in there is a funny kind of thing because it will self-organize, right? You don't
know that there's one. And what I like about this is that aside from the fact that it's just like
this thing that's totally not determined, again, what evolution has given us is a machine that
generates coordinated cells. It doesn't give us one coordinated self. It gives us a machine that
can generate these coordinated cells, and if you leave it alone, it'll give you one. If you
cut it in half, it'll give you two, and you can sort of have your pick. It's a little bit, I think,
linked to the same question in cognitive science. If I show you a brain and you don't know what a
human is, and I say to you, hey, look at this thing. How many intelligences are you supposed
to fit in there? You have no clue. We don't have any way of estimating the number of intelligences
per cubic inch of material. We don't know. But typically, with typical humans, you say, well,
that's one. That's my friend, my friend, Joe. But actually, we know from split brain patients,
from dissociative disorders, that there's all kinds of potential individuals in there, right?
And you sort of think there's one. And again, not genetically determined. It's all about inputs
in history, and learning, and experiences, and who knows what else. So there's some very basic
and fundamental stuff that isn't genetic, because the genetics doesn't lay down the final answer.
It generates, it gives you a machine that will then generate these things in various orders.
And in planaria, so what we've done in planaria is just this. If you look down
into a planarian using this voltage sensitive dye, you see a pattern. The voltage pattern,
we've sort of learned to decode it. We can tell when it says build one head versus two.
The basic question was, hey, how do you know how many heads you should have as a planarian?
Yes. How would you know, right? The assumption is, well, what else would it be? It's a genetically
determined. It's one. What else would it be? Well, so what happens is there's a
there's a single, there's an electrical gradient that normally specifies one head, one tail. Well,
we use some ion channel drugs, and we changed that to say two heads, and no genetic changes. So just
a brief, what 48 hour physiological stimulus. And then that animal will then, if you injure it,
will then make two headed animals. Now, a couple of interesting things. That two headed pattern
is read out from a one headed host. In other words, it's not a pattern of what you have now. It
doesn't reflect your current anatomy. It's a counterfactual memory. It's a representation of
what you will do if you get injured in the future. So it's like it's like an early version of this
kind of mental time travel that brains are very good at, right? Imagining things that aren't
true right now. No genetic changes. And the amazing thing is that if you take these two
headed animals and you cut them further, they will continue to generate two headed worms forever,
even though there's nothing genetically wrong with any of them. So a question of, right, the
question of what determines the number of heads in the planarian is kind of subtle. On the one hand,
you can sort of say it's DNA because if you didn't have the ion channels, none of this would be
happening. So okay, we need the hardware. We know that. But also it is the case that the exact same
hardware is perfectly happy making one head, two heads, heads from a different species, weird,
spiky cylinders that we've made that don't look anything like planaria. That same hardware is
perfectly happy making all of that stuff. And the information is in the,
at least part of that, the important part of that information is in the steady state
bioelectrical gradient that is basically the software to the genetically specified hardware.
Yeah. And then you can see it. You can see it. You can rewrite it and it totally dominates the
default state. Have you managed to do the same kind of thing in, say, tadpoles or other animals
than planaria? Yeah. Yeah. So in tadpoles, so this is what we've done. We've made tadpole
faces that look like other species of frogs. We've made tadpole tails that look like zebrafish.
And we've made frogs regenerate legs the way salamanders regenerate legs. And we're currently
trying it in mice. And this is all from the ion channels, from modulating the expression of ion
channels. Ion channels or neurotransmitters, which are often the downstream, basically much
like in the nervous system, the way that the electric circuit propagates its decisions down
is through movement of neurotransmitters, which then turn genes on and off, which then do other
stuff. So sometimes you can skip it. You can skip the top layer and do the neurotransmitter thing.
So we've done it that way too. But yeah, that's basically it. So we've done it. And we know this
works in mammals because human channelopathies. So you've got humans who have either taken drugs
that affect ion channels. So there's a bunch of ion channel drugs or teratogens.
They will have the same craniofacial defects as we see, for example, in frog.
Same thing. How much of evolution is actually geared to restricting
the scope for phenotypic plasticity, do you think? I mean, it seems as if less in the case of
plenaria, more in the case of mammals, let's say, still the scope is there. But I suppose if what
you want to do is generally produce an organism that looks the same as its parents, then there must
be really strong selection pressure on the order in which especially ion channels are being expressed.
I mean, that's true. There certainly are stereotypical patterns of expression.
I'm not sure. I'm not sure if the pressure is to produce the same thing that your parents were,
or if it's to produce something that's successful. And, you know, like, I don't know.
The fact that most animals do look like their parents implies that there's been selection
pressure to produce the same thing despite the huge potential scope for doing something completely
different. They look like them under the same conditions. So people who work in plants will
tell you that depending on where you plant that seed, you're going to get things that don't look
anything like the parents, right? And I think in animals, it's sort of less that. But yeah,
I don't know if the pressure is for consistency or if the pressure is for some other kind of
second order parameter. Like if the environment is what we've seen before, don't do anything
different. Just do the exact same thing. But if circumstance does change, you've got all these
other tools that you can deploy. I don't like to talk about stuff that isn't published in peer
reviewed because then it's just me telling stories. But I think in the next six months or so, you're
going to see a couple of, we're going to have a couple of papers come out that address this issue
that look at gene expression in xenobots compared to normal embryos and xenobots made from other
cells that are not frog and have nothing to do with frog embryos. I think the plasticity is
enormous. I don't think we've been able to, we've even scratched the surface of all this.
I mean, when we are thinking of plasticity, I always also admire this idea of ploidy, for example.
So you mentioned that plenaria mix up, mix of ploids. Then there are, I mean, we can talk about
plants itself. We know that they change their ploidy. So how much that has to do or do you think
that this can be also a factor? I don't know much about it, but I will tell you my favorite
ploidy story that I think bears on this. So salamanders, there's a little
tube that goes to the kidneys, the kidney tubule. If you take a cross section through this kidney
tubule, what you see is typically eight or 10 cells working together to make this nice kidney
tubule. Now one thing you can do is you can make these nudes that are multiple ploidy. So you can
make four n, six n, eight n nudes. So the first amazing thing is that you can double or triple
the amount of genetic material. They don't care. Fine. You still get the same nudes. So that speaks
to my same point is that it doesn't really assume. So embryogenesis does not assume how many copies
of your genetic material you have. So that's the first thing. The second thing is as you increase
the ploidy, the cells get physically bigger and bigger. When the cells get bigger and bigger,
the salamander stays exactly the same. How can it be? Because fewer and fewer of the larger
cells are being used to make the various organs. So you can't count on how many copies of the
genes you have. You can't count on what your cell size is. If you're even a human embryo,
we can cut you into four pieces and you get four quadruplets. You can't even count on how many
cells you have. Now the ploidy story is, so you really just assume you have to, as a proper embryo,
you have to assume you don't know much going in. Who knows what things are going to be like? And
you still have to be able to do the right thing. Now here's the ploidy, the rest of the ploidy
story. So when you make 8n nudes, the cells get so enormous that there's not room for more than
one cell to make a tubule. What do they do? A single cell bends around itself like this,
leaving a hole in the middle, which gives you the tubule. Now that, okay, so the thing that's
crazy about that is that now that's a completely different molecular mechanism. Instead of cell
to cell communication, which you need to make the tubule, you are now using cytoskeletal bending
to drag yourself into this crazy shape. So what I love, right, it's amazing. And so what I love
about this is that it's a good example of top-down causation, meaning that what you've got is in the
service of this anatomical feature, different molecular mechanisms get called up, and we're
seeing something like this in some of our not yet published stuff in the Zenibots too, different
molecular mechanisms get called up to do their thing to achieve this sort of higher level outcome.
So I think, yeah, I think ploid is a fantastic example of this. Because if you can't, if you
don't assume how many copies of your instructions you're going to have, you don't assume how big
your cells are, you don't assume how many of them you have, you better have rock solid morphogenetic
control to get the job done despite all of that. And salamanders do, which is why they're so regenerative,
but they're not as good as planaria, but they're pretty darn good. They regenerate all kinds of
organs. So I mean, underpinning all of that, this cell volume and ploidy, it's not just ploidy,
it's genome sat is the total amount of DNA in the nucleus. So it's the nuclear volume. There is a
very tight correlation between nuclear volume and cell volume, which used to be known as the C-value
paradox, which is to say the cells, mostly amoeba have some enormous genomes,
thousands of times larger than the human genome. Why? It's this whole idea of junk DNA, what are
they putting in there? A large amount of it is that you have a large cell, you have a large
nucleus and you fill that nucleus with DNA and ploidy forces you to have a larger, higher ploidy
forces you to have a larger nucleus, which forces you to have a larger cell and that forces you
to be resourceful in terms of if you want to make a tube, you do it from a single cell instead of
14 cells or what it used to be. So I don't think there's ever been a good explanation
for why a large cell would have a large nucleus. There are ideas out there, but they often relate
to the ratio between the number of ribosomes and the number of nuclear pore complexes and this
kind of thing. None of them are particularly persuasive. I don't think we have a good explanation
for why a large cell should have a large nucleus and yet it's able to force all of these changes
on you. Yeah, so since we are running out of time, I mean maybe I can throw in like one last
topic and probably I believe that probably both of you would kind of like to discuss about it.
So when you mention about neurotransmitters, which is like one level down kind of regulation,
let's talk about anesthesia because I think that's also something which is one level down,
regulates it. I don't know how much of the work is done on some sort of, you know, simpler
scales, but okay, I mean let's... Well, you can anesthetize single cells,
critters for an area and things like that. Yeah, I mean I discussed in the last chapter of the book
some of the work from Luca Turin showing that anesthetics affects electron transfer to oxygen
and we've been doing some work on that just recently. We've not published any of it yet,
we've not gone very far at all, so I won't say much, but we've basically, we also find that it's
lowers oxygen rate of consumption of oxygen and depending on the context in which you give them
affects the membrane potential. Now to try and distinguish between just the mitochondria making
ATP and that ATP being used to control the plasma membrane iron pump, for example,
an ATPase in the membrane. Obviously if you don't have as much ATP that pump is not going to work
as well and so, you know, this is not a causal link between mitochondrial function and consciousness,
all it says is that underpinning this energy consuming process which is consciousness, energy
madness, which is a statement of the obvious I suppose, but there's also a possibility that there
are direct fields involved that you're influencing the electromagnetic fields generated
potentially by mitochondria and then there can be direct interactions with the plasma membrane
field that way. That's a much more exciting possibility to my mind, but very, very difficult
to distinguish between how do you change the field in the measurable way while maintaining ATP
synthesis at the same level, which is a tricky thing, a tricky mechanistic thing to do,
but we're trying to get at that. I mean, I think this is perhaps one of the biggest
questions in science now is what actually is going on in the wiring of consciousness,
if you like, and I'm certain fields are involved, but how exactly? I'm not so sure.
Yeah, so it's really interesting. You might enjoy, I've got this book from this guy,
JC Bose, B-O-S-E, and I can send you a PDF of it. He's an Indian guy from over 100 years ago that
was doing a bunch of physiology and he started anesthetizing animal tissues and using electrophysiology
to monitor what happens and then he did the plants, right? And then eventually a metal bar.
So he's got this book called Response in the Living and Non-Living, where maybe, so I don't
know the mechanisms that underlie any of that, but there could be, if it's the kind of thing
you're talking about, I could easily see why he would be seeing effects like this in organic
substrates as well. Yeah, I tend to draw a line at life, which is to say what I was talking about
at the beginning about bacteria using the fields on the membrane as a means of integrating the
metabolism of the cell. And I would see then the central nervous system as some kind of an
amplification and far more subtle than complex, of course, but still somehow linked to the
integration of information through linking your metabolic state at a cellular level and then
at a network level and so on. Whether you need fields to be involved in that, I don't know,
but we can measure changes in the EEG. And I don't think we have an absolutely clear idea of
exactly what is generating the EEG at a subcellular level. Is it just the plasma membrane, the
axonal membranes that are depolarizing or mitochondria playing a role in that as well?
So that's an area I'm fascinated by, but it's difficult to get at.
Yeah, so in the like, I think if we think of the same about the same topic,
interesting thing is about the synthetic cells or synthetic life in general, like all the work
which is going on there, I mean, from the engineering perspective, right? That's also
kind of let's say crucial in a way or it is focused on the information-centric view, right?
Like people are trying to put together again some sort of genomes, some sort of genes, transcription,
translation, of course, they have membrane in, but my question or maybe briefly if you can just
explain your view, so how important would be this kind of bioelectric or kind of this software,
that we have discussed today for to create those kind of synthetic systems?
Maybe one word answer, all importance. I don't think you're going to do it without 100.
Like how or is it possible to kind of, you know, I don't know, do it without the information part,
without the hardware? I think you can only go so far without genes at all.
How far? I don't know. I mean, you know, the preliminary is a very good example there. You
can you can scramble your genome, but presumably you can't completely collapse your genome.
When I think about it the other way up with the origin of life,
how do, where does information come from in biology? And I'm fairly persuaded now
from our own experiments, but other people's work around the world as well in the last five,
six, seven years. A lot of metabolism is spontaneously self-organizing. You start
with CO2 and hydrogen and you get Krebs cycle intermediates, you get amino acids,
the same ones that we have in metabolism. You get nucleotides that way as well.
We've not done them all yet, but we've done some and other people have done others and,
you know, this idea then of a spontaneously self-organizing metabolism that starts with
CO2 and hydrogen and gives you all the monomers and eventually polymers.
By no means is any of this proved, but five or six years ago it would have been complete hand
waving and now there's some experimental backing for quite a lot of it. And you think, okay, well,
it's going to make trace amounts of things like nucleotides. How can it reliably make more
nucleotides and get better at making copies of itself in the absence of genes or any information?
And the answer is, well, positive feedback loops will allow you to kind of feed off the
environment and off yourself to get better at making copies of yourself, but you're only ever
going to do, you're going to keep repeating the same network under the same conditions.
If you change the conditions, you might get a different network. It may or may not function,
but under this set of conditions, you will keep recovering that same network
until you introduce genes and information into it. And you can, into that world, you can introduce
random sequences of RNA and they will have directly or indirectly some effect on the
rates of cell growth and flux of metabolism. Even just introducing a piece of RNA is actually
going to change the metabolic rate because you're now polymerizing nucleotides. So you're pulling
nucleotides out of solution and you pull metabolism through faster. So even making a completely random
piece of RNA makes you better at doing what you were doing before than if you hadn't done that.
So there's this kind of interesting insights into what is information in biology? Where is it
coming from? And it's what it seems to be allowing is effectively plasticity, which is to say you've
got this hardwired proto metabolism, which is basically thermodynamics and kinetics. And it's,
you will go on recovering exactly the same thing. What genes allow you to do is just change it a bit
and allow a different outcome. And that outcome can be reliably inherited. And by the time we're
getting into networks of cells, then it's interesting because what I'm taking from what Mike has been
saying is that the genes are becoming almost buried again. And it's the network of the cells
which are generating higher level properties, which are forcing them to behave in a similar
way in a similar setting and a potentially completely different way in a different setting.
So there's this interplay all along between kind of the hardwiring and the plasticity and the
information, which means different things in different contexts, but allows the plasticity really.
Yeah. So that's fascinating. And so with that, thank you so much guys. Thank you for doing this.
This was completely fun. I mean, I think the kind of ideas that we have explored, it was amazing.
So thank you so much. Thanks very much. Yeah. Thanks for doing this.
Thank you. That's been great fun. Yes. Thank you.
Yeah. All right. Talk soon, everybody. Yeah. Bye now. Bye.
