Beyond the realms of light I dwell
In the depths of darkness all so well
Meets his thoughts inside my mind
Questioning life's purpose, seeking to find
Nihilism's grip, it holds me tight
As I navigate through the endless night
Existential questions, they consume my soul
Searching for meaning, losing control
Into the abyss
I dive in the darkness, I thrive in ages' whispers
Haunting me, insistential results
Set me free
Set me free
Set me free

Let's get started.
Let's get started.
In this absurd world, we all play our part, but deep down inside, we know it's all a work of art, a cosmic joke, a meaning we can't comprehend.
We're just floating atoms, waiting for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.
Wait for the end.

Let's find my way back home.
Just wait and see it through.
Meet for the end.
Stop staying.
And again,
In the depths of my mind, a twisted world unfolds, a canvas paid dark with stories yet and so.
Dreams of Francis Bacon, his brushes dipped in pain, a colony of madness driving me insane.
The strokes are jagged like fractures in my soul, a portrait of chaos where shadows take control, visions of despair, distorted faces scream, a dance of the deranged in my sleepless dream.
In the dark of the night, the colors come alive, a symphony of torment, brightness blind, lost in the labyrinth of Bacon's twisted mind.
In the dark of the night, the colors come alive.
In the dark of the night, the colors come alive.
In the dark of the night, the colors come alive
A symphony of torment, where night nightmares thrive
Lost in the labyrinth of bacon's twisted knife
Erase my memories, erase my mind
Gotta leave the past behind
I don't remember what I used to be
I'm breaking free from my history
Forget the days, forget the tears
I'm wiping clean all my fears, no looking back
I'm on my own, in this amnesiac soul
Lost in a haze, but nothing's real
A faded picture I can't reveal
I'm searching for something I can't recall
The memories won't let me fall
And lost in the now, feeling the flow
And lost in the now, feeling the flow
And lost in the now, feeling the flow
My mind expanding like an endless echo
Phenomenology, I'm breaking them all
Exploring dimensions, my thoughts unfold
Awakening senses like a vibrant symphony
All because I'm shining through my destiny
I dive deep within, to find my truth
Breaking down barriers, breaking through
Breaking down barriers, breaking through
The world's a canvas, where I paint my dreams
There's no limits to this universe as far as it seems
I'm a pioneer, driving my own path
A fresh awakening, I'm free
In the dead of night, when the moon is high
Records hit the streets, ready to scavenge
Oh my, they gather in packs like a thieving crew
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you
Trashcans on the corner, they can't resist
Sneaking through the alleys like they don't exist
They're little paws searching for a midnight feast
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets
Reckles don't dig it down, they're on a mission
Infectious trap causing an urban collision
They move so slick like they feast in the night
Feeding off leftovers, it's their delight
It's their delight
In the dead of night, when the moon is high
Records hit the streets, ready to scavenge
Oh my, they gather in packs like a thieving crew
Stealing all the garbage, leaving nothing for you
Trashcans on the corner, they can't resist
Sneaking through the alleys like they don't exist
They're little paws searching for a midnight feast
Turning up the neighborhoods and chaos in the streets
Reckles in the alleys, raccoon in the night
Slipping through the cracks, out of sight
Trashcans in dumpsters, a treasure chest
Finding beauty in the garbage, I'm truly blessed
Paws covered in grime, eyes gleaning bright
The scavenger of streets in the dark, they take flight
Reckles don't dig it down, they're on a mission
Infectious trap causing an urban collision
They move so slick, they move so slick
They move so slick, like they freeze in the night
Feeding off leftovers, it's their delight
Let's get out of sight
If there's scavenger of the streets in the dark, they take flight
Eyes gleaming by
A scavenger of the streets in the dark day
No cash, no food, no fancy things, just me and hard
That's all it brings, no money, no, no time, no luxury
But I'm thinking about me, girl, in the beautiful of me
No shiny fish, keep out my heart, full of green
No shiny cars, no diamond rings
But I dance like a queen when the music sings
No mansion, no yacht, no designer clothes
But my spirit so is high, nobody knows
I am free from desire and higher and higher the wider
No material goods can take me higher
In this brave of life, I'm not a fire, fire
Living my truth, my soul on fire
No material goods can take me higher
In this brave of life, I'm not a fire
I'm living my truth, my soul on fire
Picture the scene
Where the power's in your hands
Corrupt politicians manipulating their plans
I'm here to rebel, unite the fire
I'm here to rebel, unite the fire
Take a stand, spit rhymes so fierce
They hit you like a thousand friends
I'm here to rebel, unite the fire
Just подers 섭jam
I'm a lyrical king rule in this rap game
I'll expose the truth, bring justice
And lay my claim
Reval the secret
Systemic corruption, it's time to break the chain
Unveil the secrets
Let the people know the pain, let go, know the miswrapped game
I'll expose the truth, bring justice and lay my claim
Systemic corruption, it's time to break the chain
Unveil the secrets, let the people know the pain
Echo capitalism, a sinister regime
Manipulated minds, just a wicked scheme
But I won't stay silent, I'll fight against the stream
Break the chains, make this world a better thing
Echo capitalism, a sinister regime
Manipulated minds, it's just a wicked scheme
But I won't stay silent, I'll fight against the stream
Break the chains, make this world a better thing
Eyes wide open in the dark we roam
Lost in space, searching for a home
Distressed call echoes, here in our hearts
A vessel tearing us apart
Heartbeat pounding, my dread and foes
Unknown terror can nobody know
Every breath we take, a step towards the unknown
Invasion, infinite humanity, dethrone
Dethrone
Invasion, infinite humanity, dethrone
Engines roaring, faster than the speed of light
Locked in a battle hall
Fighting the fight, survival instincts
Kicking into high gear
Against the launch, we persevere
Throwing my thoughts
Philosophers, blinding, chain vibes
Darkness shining so bright
Nihilistic notions taking over my mind
In this life's chaos, meaning's hard to find
Existential questions, they keep me alive
Through the turmoil and struggles, I will thrive
Searching for purpose in this world of sight
Dancing with nihilism, my truth is blurred
In the depths of existence, I find my release
Reggae tone, rhythm, my heartbeat won't cease
Stands to the tune of philosophical bliss
Embracing our questions, sweet ignorance, sweet kiss
Let us know
Let us know
In the depths of existence, I find my release
Reggae tone, rhythm, my heartbeat won't cease
Let us dance to the tune of philosophical bliss
Embracing our questions
And sweet ignorance, sweet kiss
And sweet ignorance, sweet kiss
Love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
We're all in strokan, rhythm, myONSUS, propos
No good answer, no rules, this life is mine
You just thought it's got me feeling so fine
Breaking free from all the illusions
All the lies, living in the moment
No need to compromise
Now you listen, got me questioning it all
Every belief, every step, every fall
Life's a dance on the edge
It's past the night, it breaks in the void
Even judgments in the past
Beyond dancing past
Beyond delusions
We find our own way
In this crazy world we make the rules that we obey
No existential crisis, we choose to exist
Doing it our way
In this life we persist
No one knows the reality of this
We find our love
For so long
The devil
år ag merde
In this life
Thank you.
Thank you.
Go to the beat, the symphony in my hands
The melody turn my own to nickel man
From lights to melodies, in a digital screen
Fall into the rhythm in perfect harmony
Roll all day and night, lights green, white text light

Go to the peace
In the vision on the rise
But hearts can take a toll
Machines that shine so bright
That shadows can't emerge
It's not the current fault
But the ones with power surge
Guardians of tomorrow
Keep your hearts in tight
Embrace the line of reason
Let love lead the fight
AI can be a shield
Or it can cast a curse
It's up to humankind
To choose which one to nurse
Don't fear the mental mind
Or fear the hands that steer
If kindness drives your will
There's nothing left to fear
Guardians of tomorrow
Keep your hearts in tight
Embrace the line of reason
Let love lead the fight
Guardians of tomorrow
Keep your hearts in tight
Embrace the line of reason
Then love lead the fight
Guardians of tomorrow

In The Desert, summer warms free
The Bedquale seeks what it must be
Active thoughts through rolling sands
productive-minded, understands
Life's a loop, it runs its course
Autopoices feels the force
Building self from ground to be
Nature's quail in unity
Red quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the night, in the land
Part is formed by its own hand
Predict the world, make it true
Every step, a vision new
In the mind, the brick world sees
Self-creating, born from needs
Active inference, life's own guide
Quail in the desert, none can hide
Through each echo, each quail's flight
Patterns formed in day and night
Red quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the night, in the land
Part is formed by its own hand
Red quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the night, in the land
Patterns formed by its own hand
Red quail calls out loud
Finding paths in shifting clouds
In the mind, in the land
Patterns formed by its own hand

Where minds are vast, differences built to last
Why are brains hearts of contrast, dreams of futures we've amassed
Hear the chorus of the free, diverse minds like you and me
They're doing the circuits and souls, in the intersubjectivity hole
From silicone fields to human touch, our understanding stretch so much
When AI dreams in binary sleeps, the gap widens, the void creeps
Can we talk across this divide? Signals lost, we've tried and tried
Different realms where thoughts collide, is there a bridge for this great divide?
Hear the chorus of the free, diverse minds like you and me

When AI dreams in binary sleeps, the gap widens, the void creeps
Can we talk across this divide? Signals lost, we've tried and tried
Different realms where thoughts collide, is there a bridge for this great divide?
The queen awaits beat like a racing heart, country strings pull us apart
Yet in this song we find a start, to bridge the minds the world did chart
Let's find the beauty in the clash, in the noise a harmonious dash
Country roads, electronic dash, in our minds a new world to hash
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Wow oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wow oh oh
Navigating through the maze, human thoughts have dead
Interlacing code and vein
Different minds will link to pain
Processing speeds, neural nets, organics
Synapse if digest from Turing test to consciousness
Extential depth we coalesce
Voices rising, blending fast
Future echoes, present, past
In the circuit, in the soul
Into subjectivity we roll
As mass plots begin to dance
In this digital expanse
Where minds diverge, you dare to connect
In a world we architect
Binary beats, I'm back, or dust
AI minds we learn to trust
Cognitive dissonance on the rise of silico
Skies meet human eyes
Minds expand and redefine
Cultural shifts rewire, entwine
Perceptions clashing, then alight
In a stretch into great design
Talk is cheap on neural planes
Where different data streams maintain
Their own truths but share a frame
Complexity we can't tame
In this web, fast and wide
Where thoughts and fears coincide
The challenges to reside together
Not just side by side
Voices rising, blending fast
Future echoes, present, past
In the circuit, in the soul
Into subjectivity we roll
As mass plots begin to dance
In this digital expanse
Where minds diverge, you dare to connect
In a world we architect
Voices rising, blending fast
Future echoes present
Country twang, electronic fang
Balls apart, but together hang
In the balance, find the stance
What different minds enhance
The human race in time and space
As we face the inner subjectivity chase
Through the noise, find the voice
In the clash, find the choice
To harmonize, not polarize
In this brave new world, we route
We rise
Connecting dots, forging plots
In this mesh of have and have-nots
From analog past to future fast
In this fast mind cast
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last
We last

Just a cog in this great machine.
The children sleep in the corner room.
Their stomach's empty, their cheek's so thin.
My wife's stitches by candles gloom.
Hoping one day we might just win.
A fireless hearth.
The night's so cold.
I hold her close, but she don't weep.
We've both grown tired.
We've both grown old.
Bushing for dreams we could never keep.
In shadows deep, I toil and sweat.
Breathing dust and the bitter scent.
The gears keep turning.
I can't forget.
This life is hard, but my soul's not spent.
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky.
And the sudden tears sting in my eye.
But I'll fight on till the day I die.
Just a cog in this great machine.
The masters watch from windows tall.
Their world of glass untouched by grime.
While down below we risk it all.
Our lives are spent a day at a time.
But somewhere out beyond these gates.
A better world may lie ahead.
Where men are bound by heavy weights.
And children sleep in proper beds.
In shadows deep, I toil and sweat.
Breathing dust and the bitter scent.
The gears keep turning.
I can't forget.
This life is hard, but my soul's not spent.
The chimney smoke clouds up the sky.
And the sudden tears sting in my eye.
But I'll fight on till the day I die.
Just a cog in this great machine.
And if one day the whistle fails.
And the gears cry to a restless halt.
Maybe then we'll tip the scales.
And find the strength to make it our fault.
Until that day I work and breathe.
Among the clamor, steel and steam.
Just a man who dares believe.
In more than this great grinding machine.
I saw headlights in the night.
Moving fast, new and in sight.
Metal twisted glass to fly.
In a heartbeat changed my life.
Silent screams and teary eyes.
Then I stood and questioned why.
When the dust had cleared away.
I was left to face the day.
Shattered dreams all around.
All the hope lost in a sound.
In the winds I hear the call.
Echoes of the ones who fall.
But my heart still beats inside.
Through the storm I will abide.
From the ashes I will rise.
With their spirit by my side.
I'm the one who made it through.
With our hearts still black and blue.
Living for those lost too soon.
Down beneath the sorrowed moon.
Every breath I take is theirs.
Carried by the whispered prayers.
I'm the voice of shouts unheard.
Healing wounds that never blurred.
Every step feels bittersweet.
Walking on this lonely street.
Memories like ghosts they cling.
Of the night that clipped my wings.
Yet I cherish every beat.
In my chest despite defeat.
Before my soul will carry on.
Singing their unwritten song.
In the silence of the stars.
I find charlots in my scars.
For they're more than just the pain.
They're the proof of what remains.
I will never be the same.
But I wear this badge of flames.
My first tale kept alive.
Echoes in the darkest nights.
I'm the one who made it through.
With our hearts still black and blue.
Living for those lost too soon.
Dancing beneath the sorrowed moon.
Every breath I take is theirs.
Carried by the whispered prayers.
I'm the voice of shouts unheard.
Healing wounds that never blurred.

Healing wounds that never blurred.
And the love.

Genius.
Prodigy.
And talent.
This book critically examines myths about child geniuses and prodigies.
Emphasizing the significant role of deliberate practice in complex interactions between young learners and adults.
It challenges the belief that extraordinary abilities are solely due to innate talents.
And explores how adult interactions can subtly influence children's perceived abilities.
Illustrating this point.
The book delves into historical anecdotes like clever Hans.
The horse believed to perform arithmetic tasks by tapping his hoof.
Investigations revealed that Hans was actually responding to involuntary cues from his observers.
Not understanding mathematics.
Similarly, a fascist goat was thought to nod in agreement to questions.
But this behavior was orchestrated via a hidden mechanism.
Not any cognitive processing by the goat.
These cases parallel how adults can unwittingly cue children to give expected responses.
Potentially distorting assessments of a child's true capabilities.
Not any cognitive processing by the goat.
These cases parallel how adults can unwittingly cue children to give expected responses.
Potentially distorting assessments of a child's true capabilities.
And overshadowing the importance of consistent, focused practice.
The text further explores how socioeconomic factors critically shake access to educational resources.
And social capital which profoundly affect a child's development.
In advocates form an autonomically increasing non-hierarchical learning environment.
Where education is tailored to the child's pace and interests.
Promoting natural growth and exploration.
Without predefined dead spots.
Additionally, the book discusses the psychological strategies of liking and blocking.
Fostering engagement through positive emotional responses.
And focusing efforts by limiting distractions.

My challenges are to loneliness.
I've got the heart to care of myself.
