It was so dramatic
Our minds seem like clouds, the heart's prediction is light
We open the blind paths where free work is born
We're in motion, in action, in rules we dissolve
Freedom breathes fire beneath the threshold of consciousness
The whole world is lost eventually
The fire water burns hot
The hidden paths from darkness
Seat the truth, watch the truth
Let the flow of energy be free
Let the prophet see ahead
The mind knows the end
Defeat the cold foreseeing, oscillating
Now within Markov's nets, living works are woven
The walls of uncertain borders adorn, both form and function
Action reflects the mind, nature grimes with order
Knowledge becomes auto-catalysis, a spark creating a new path
The whole world is a source of entropy
The fire water burns hot
The hidden paths from darkness
Seat the truth, watch the truth
Let the flow of energy be free
Let the prophet see ahead
The mind knows the end
Defeat the cold foreseeing, oscillating
In the cybernetic circle
The pulse of mutual learning beats
Where motion drives understanding
Where the cycle completes
Heaven's light embraces the end
Chaos grows within the senses
Let practical voices arise
Let creative art live
The whole world is a source of entropy
The fire water burns hot
The hidden paths from darkness
Seat the truth, watch the truth
Time bends live in hot
The mind runs forward seeing
The universe feels itself
A light's glow emerges
As moves, light is born
The space of truth is here
Prediction and action revolve into infinity
The�� main focus is here
What if you Knit the screwdriver
Richie, Madness, gravity podr on the forces
Light the best
Lo believe
ável
The gravity, the way
Let the flow of energy be free
Let the prophet see ahead
The mind knows the end
Defeats the cold
Foreseeing, oscillating
In the cybernetic circle
The pulse of mutual love
The walls of uncertain borders adorned
Both form and function
Action reflects the mind
Nature grasps before the knowledge
Becomes our catalysis
A spark creating a new path
In the cybernetic circle
The pulse of mutual learning beats
Emotion drives understanding
Where the cycle completes
Heaven's light embraces the end
Chaos grows within the senses
Let practical voices arise
Let creative art live

We start with a curve
Smooth as it swerves
Plotting the path that our functions preserve
Talking calculus
It's more than just nerve
It's the art of the slope
The rate we observe
See a curve on a graph
It's like a road on a map
You wanna know how steep
Derivative's the chap
It taps into the tangent
Just a single snap
At any point you pick
It's the slope's recap
In the land of the infinite
Where tiny steps meet
With limits defined
Where the intangibles concrete
Derivative slope
But the line's so sweet
It tangles sums the parts
A whole complete
Now flip the script
Let summit no subtract
Area under curves
Integrals the pact
From A to B
Fill it exact
Add the slivers of space
That's the integral impact
It's like stacking bricks
From the ground to the sky
Each piece so small
But together they fly
The base to the summit
Don't even need to try
Integral builds it up
Right before your eye
Between the lines
The story unfolds
Derivative and integral
Bold as gold
Limits approach
The tales they've told
Infinite small
Yet the truths they hold
As X approaches anything
Listen to the call
The functions whisper
Limits capture it all
From tiny increments
A pattern to install
In every slope and sum
The rise and fall
In the land of the infinite
Where tiny steps meet
With limits defined
Where the intangible's concrete
Derivative slope
Of the line's so sweet
Integral sums the parts
A whole complete
The line's so sweet
The wind whispers that the day
On these secrets we can gain
Dark as water, stretch the sea
With no from the ocean's flame
Hide the rest by voices
All ignites
Turning, jump to liquid light
Bubbles rising in the lights
On the waves of future's plight
Creates man sweeping magic code
Ocean's gift to man bestowed
Chemical deaths transforming balls
From seas embraced until redone
Underneath the swirling throats
Nature crafts our new homes
Silent waves and ancient tones
Guide us where the future rolls
Hydra-respiralysis
All ignites
Turning, jump to liquid light
Turning, jump to liquid light
Power's rising in the lights
Under waves of future's plight

In the lab where wave flows play, fields converge and phase delay.
Microwaves in Fourier's volt, harmonics hum, equations told.
Antennas twist, Lissage's trace, modulated, signals grace.
Lasers split, coherence streams, photons pulse in quantum schemes.
Rippered state, but near and far, signals sift through spectral stars.
Frequency locked, precision's height, dance with photons through the night.
Oscillators guide the flow. Each frequency, its eye can glow.
Amplitude tuned, we map the dark. Datas curve, the lab's own mark.
Clip-its sync, in tangled pairs. Binary codes, in pulsing flares.
Transmissions pulse, and we assume. The resonance, the glowing plume.
Rippered state, but near and far, signals sift through spectral scars.

Thank you.
Consider the model called triotic cyclex, a theoretical construct and speculative reflex, populated by entities, whales, mushrooms, and trees, representing metabolic lifeforms, symbionts, and stabilities.
There's the oculostylum of photonic scaveled strands, synthesizing baryonic flows through a cosmic asylum plan.
And don't disregard the lamprodine field, a hypothesized medium through which dark energies conceal.
Herbs it onto a double-gummic colony, designed to minimize waste.
Integrated glucose, my elimination with systemic efficiency and taste.
Transmitting essentials through pipelines, no obsolete scores like dead.
Goods per process, prepackaged, all precision fed.
Past, present, potential, future, these nodes in time align.
Sliding across entropic vectors, much like existential twine.
Three primary force axes, heave, sway, and surge.
Align spatial motion to universal waveforms, a perpetual energy splurge.
The inside-out yarn ball, a delivery paradigm.
Unspools glucose wraps through controlled kinetic design.
Encased in biodegradable glucose threads.
Structural analogs to biological myelin around our deadly grave.
Trust the overcome economy, optimized for every need.
With each nutrient pre-threaded, empirical growth-shaped.
Forget the aisles, the checkout lines, the weekly grocery run.
This closed-loop system ensures that urban life is spun.
Projected gains include energy-safe, cities designed to breathe.
Pipe-fed homes where glucose threads weave.
The urban xylem connects every cell, every vein.
And dark matters whispers, ensure planetary sanity remains.
Lamphrod and Lamphrodine, distinct yet coiled intact.
No comprehension test required, no need to cross-check.
Just know that nutrients come pre-wrapped for ease.
With optimized glucose packages, just press and retrieve.
Behold the bubblegum economy, streamlining all excess.
Glucose-threaded provisions, derived free from egress.
Conceptually quirky, but technically pristine.
The cleanest mechanism for futuristic cuisine.
Quistine.
So say farewell to stores and carts, to consumptive strife.
Cosmic deliveries will furnish life.
The Cyclex delineates each phase with precision sublime.
