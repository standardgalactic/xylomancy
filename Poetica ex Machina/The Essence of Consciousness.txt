What I wish I knew about consciousness instead of just focusing on brain power.
Mark Solms' theory turns everything upside down.
Forget what you've heard about consciousness being all about high-level thinking.
Mark Solms, a leading neuroscientist, says it's actually our emotions at the core.
Solms argues that consciousness isn't born from our complex thoughts but from the primitive
brainstem, the area responsible for our survival instincts and feelings.
Think of emotions as the brain's alarm system.
When our automated responses fail, emotions kick in to guide us.
This fresh perspective flips the script on traditional theories, suggesting that our
ability to feel is central to how we experience the world.
Critics might question it, but Solms' theory has sparked a huge debate in the scientific
community.
So next time you feel something deeply, remember.
Your emotions are not just reactions but the very essence of your consciousness.
