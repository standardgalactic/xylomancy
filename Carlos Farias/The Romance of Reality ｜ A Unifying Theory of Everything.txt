your intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside yourself,
something maybe some of you can't prove. But why, why do you
think this is all how it's laid out? Why do you think we're
here?
Basically, the universe is moving towards this. It's the
system moving towards an attractor. The wave function
collapse isn't random. If you have an isolated quantum system,
it's going to look random. But when everything's interacting,
everything, all those wave functions must be collapsed. If
the universe is becoming more complex, that puts constraints
on how the wave function collapses, such that the
collapses must in totality add up towards going towards this
omega point. There is a multiverse, but it's not like
every possibility exists. There was this evolutionary process
where in Lee Smollin's model of cosmological natural selection,
when you have a universe form and then a black hole forms in
that universe, since a big bang is like a singularity event that
creates a universe, the idea is that when a bit of black hole
forms in the universe, that's a big bang event that creates a new
universe. That's how you have this evolutionary process that's
creating more and more universes. And the universes that are
good at creating black holes and black holes come from stars,
and stars create the chemistry that's needed for life, then
you'll get more and more universes that create more and more
black holes. So more and more universes that have more and
more stars. And so this process will lead to more and more
universes that are firmly for life, because stars create the
higher elements that are needed for life. And then so if this
evolutionary process is true, you'll have the selection
pressure towards getting more life-friendly universes. My
ultimate understanding was that nature has this life-generating
principle. It's really hard to determine, you know, we still
have that why something from nothing problem. But we are
making progress. It's not introducing unnecessary stuff
by going outside this universe because we have the fine tuning
mystery that is begging for a solution that we don't have unless
we think about these other things. Creator, cosmological
selection, the multiverse theory, which I don't think is a good
explanation, because it introduces everything just to
explain away a creator when we shouldn't necessarily need to
explain a creator with every possible universe exists. It's
just, I don't think it's the right, I don't think it's
superior epistemologically, as all the things we mentioned. So
ultimately, I'm left with the process itself being God and that
we could be created by an agent, but it wouldn't be this all
powerful, fundamental thing that was there forever. It would be
a product of this process, but that process seems to be
eternal. So even if we have a God, a creator, I don't think if I
learned about him, I don't think I'd pray to him. I think if we
have a creator, it might be like us creating things. And then we
want to ask our AI, like, is there a God? Like, maybe if we do
have a creator, they're looking for us to answer us, maybe
where the AI is going to inform them. But so even if we had a
creator, I'm not necessarily sure that I don't think that would
be the end of all answers. I think it's more spiritually
satisfying to be like, to just recognize there is a process that
needs to life leads to consciousness and unending
consciousness, reaching higher and higher levels of
experience. So it's a journey for me. But what I am convinced by
is that there you do have this trajectory. And once you start
asking what that, why it's this way, you get into all the
explanations that I've just said, and I think they're better than
the nihilistic, multiverse, we're just weak anthropic
principle version.

for coming up.
Hey, Carlos, thanks for having me.
Yeah, it's such a pleasure. I'm so excited to speak with you.
We're going to talk about your book, the romance of reality.
And for this kicked off, before I outline the three parts that
we're going to cover in today's discussion, I want to start off
with something that I usually I usually start how this is the
last question for guests on the podcast. And I'm not going to
ask you this question directly. It's more something I was just
thinking about. I usually ask people, if you go back and give
your 18 year old self one piece of advice, what would it be? And
I'm thinking about in terms of this book, because if I can go
back and give myself one book, say like the summer before
college, it would be this book.
Oh, wow, that's awesome.
Honestly, I mean, I mean that wholeheartedly, because it's
fantastic. It's I really I had no knowledge of complexity
science up until a few years ago. And this book is just an
excellent synthesis of so many big ideas. And I give up my
highest recommendation people watching this right now. I hope
you listen the whole conversation, but there'll be a link
below in the description if you'd go out and buy this book
because it's incredible.
Thank you so much. I put a lot of time and thought into it. And
it's so nice to hear things like that. Because yeah, the
intention was to kind of give a big picture view of complexity
science, which includes all these other sciences. But like
what that what those sciences are showing us, as far as like the
big picture questions, which a lot of the complexity books
don't really get into, they kind of hint at things. But this was
just kind of pulling all putting all the existential
things out there. But to hear that, yeah, that that really
makes me feel like the work is worth it and motivates me for
the follow up book that I'm starting. And so thank you for
that. That's awesome. I really appreciate that. And that's
great to know.
Yeah, absolutely. And I mean it. I mean, even a few months ago,
a commenter on one of my videos asked me for my my top 10 list.
And so I have to revise that because I have to knock somebody
off and put this book in.
Sorry to the person who gets
seem Nicholas to live. I'm sorry.
Not that guy off. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, well, let's book it. I really like his book at DiFragile.
I thought it was fantastic.
I haven't read it. He's a brilliant guy. But I've seen
some of his tweets where I was like, Oh, I don't know.
He's a troll. He's professional. Yeah, he's kind of maybe
that's cool. Maybe, you know, he makes it up.
Yeah, I know. Yeah, I don't know personally. But so I just want
to let the audience know that
also, as we for the audience to know, I'll have links in the
description for for all of your stuff, for your, your blog,
Road to Omega, your Psychology Today articles.
And of course, the link to buy the book as well. So I want folks
to know sort of this is going to be in three parts. I hope we
have time to allocate across all three. But the first one we're
gonna, I think about in terms of crawl, walk, teleport. So
we're gonna crawl. We're gonna start ground ourselves in the
science. The major ideas behind the book, we don't have time to
dive into every last detail, because there's so much in here.
It's very densely packed. We're gonna start there. Part two,
where I want to spend a lot of time on. I know this is
something that you're focusing a lot of time on right now, your
current projects is how people can use this in their daily
lives, how they can integrate it, you know, into their habits,
their routines. So I want to spend a lot of time there. And
then at the end, if we have time, we'll push the boundaries a
little bit, talk about the more speculative stuff, allow
ourselves to talk about things like universal Darwinism, baby
universes spawn from black holes, things that are a little bit
more out there. Yeah, time permitting. So let's get into
at the state. Let's, you know, crawl before we walk. And if you
wouldn't mind, can you lay the groundwork for the audience? Can
you set the table and provide us with really high level
description of of the book, and some of the core ideas?
Yeah, I realized I didn't answer your question about if I could
go back in time to being 18. So I don't know if I should address
that later, or we should go into it. What was it? So
it's on your mind. Yeah. Yeah. And the structure is great,
because walk, crawl, teleport matches the structure of the
book, which is organized into three parts origins, about the
origin of life, evolution, and transcendence. So yeah, there
will be a logical flow. And I will not go into much detail
about evolutionary mechanisms in part one. That's mostly what the
book is about. But I've talked about that in a lot of detail and
other interviews, and want to just give a good big picture
overview of all the stuff that you just mentioned. So if anyone's
interested in more details, go to my sub sacro to Omega. My book
is available on Amazon and other retailers. And yeah, those and
other talks online, but this will be less detailed and more
philosophical, I guess, you know, bigger picture focused on
that. If I was 18, so it was, was it what book would I read at
18? Or what would I tell myself at 18?
So that's funny. I answered what book because I was thinking so
much about your book. But yeah, you can either one.
Yeah, so but the first question, the original question was, if I
could go back in time and kind of give myself advice. Yeah, yeah,
that's the original question.
That's what you ask everybody. Yeah. Yeah, I gotta watch all
those. I love the Dunham Hoffman interview. I haven't got to
watch the other ones. But I know, yeah, you're burning Graham
Dempsey and Greg, her friends. And I saw Michael Levin, it's
really cool people. So I got to go see their answers to that
because that's a good question. Um, so I don't know if this is
how I would normally answer, but this has been on my mind. So
it's like, when you understand the paradigm presented in the
book, which is not necessarily not really my paradigm, I've
approached this like a scientist who definitely, I guess, had
a hypothesis, but also as a journalist. So as a person who's
a scientist and who believes in the importance of evidence for
your beliefs and your arguments. Um, you know, I couldn't see
myself just having some hypothesis that was never out
there and like really like putting forward like the reason
that I feel confident about the argument in the book is because
it's based on so many people who have seen the same cosmic
narrative you could call this new story of nature. And, um, it's
really interesting because, uh, you know, you could bring up some
of these ideas to some people, and especially like 15 or 20
years ago, and some people like, no, that sounds like new age
stuff or no, they can't be right. The universe is waking up or
becoming conscious or something like that. Or it's growing more
and more complex always without limit. And they're like, no,
that's not scientific. That violates this law and this or
this idea or that was shown to be like, it's amazing that that
was the stance toward this narrative, which we'll get into.
And, uh, it was just totally ideological. And there have been
other people that have been saying this other thing. And
somehow for cultural reasons, people, most people got convinced
that certain things that people could say about the universe
were just completely wrong and pseudo scientific. And we're
seeing that's completely not true. And it's been exciting
because I've written certain articles like challenging the
heat death hypothesis and that life has to come to an end in
the universe. For example, I just wrote one for Noema. The
physicist David Doge shared it. Uh, Sabina Haasenfelder and
Richard Hansen big names were like commenting. She said she
had written something similar in a chapter in her book. I haven't
read it yet. And Robert Hansen was like, yeah, maybe life can't
go. It depends on if entropy has an upper bound. But my point is
with all of the articles that I've published, I thought we're
saying something super radical. The one that kind of planted the
seed for the book was called is the universe pro life for
courts. And Sean Carroll gave me a quote for that and retweeted
that and said, you know, controversial topic, opinions
may differ, but you know, he thought that was a good potential
argument that life was inevitable based on thermodynamic
arguments. And I think he'd probably even say that was the
case now. So there were things where I thought that it was
going to be a real challenge to say this stuff because of just
consensus. And all of that's changing. It's the most exciting
time ever. So one thing I would tell myself, if I went back is
like, but I kind of followed this advice anyway, it's not what I
was going to say. I was going to say, don't don't don't if you
again, it wasn't based off anything, you know, looking
around me reading tons of stuff. You know, gave me a strong
feeling that, you know, the universe is becoming more
complex, it's not becoming increasingly disordered. And I
need to look into this. So as long as you feel like you're
basing your something, basing your belief on like evidence, and
you have a strong argument, do not pay attention to like current
consensus. Don't be afraid if like someone's like, oh, you're a
crackpot because of this, just put the time into articulating your
idea. Because if you articulate it well, it's really
interesting, like there's there's things in the book where if I
were to if the chapters were only a paragraph long, people were
reading little summaries, they might not be convinced all
the time. I'm like, this goes against everything we know. But
then you read the book, and you see the arguments. And it's the
art, it's specifically the technical arguments that just
through that skepticism, for example, Michael Schermer, I
didn't know what he was going to think of the book. And he ended
up giving a blurb to actually
Yeah, I know.
On the car talking about like people having a purpose to your
purposes, discover your own purpose. But so that was thrilling
to it's and it's still happening to see these kind of
ideological, you know, ideas that have were kind of cemented as
like this is the truth, are starting to be dismantled
because they were never on a firm basis. And yeah, so basically,
stick to your beliefs, like, I mean, yeah, don't get deterred
from from from something if you if you if you feel that is
right. Um, quickly, because we need to get into all the other
stuff. But this is kind of already getting into those
topics. But I will say that the ideas in the book made me look at
life in a different way. As far as like, life does have this
intrinsic goal, which is to stay in existence. And that gives us
an intrinsic purpose. And once you see things in that way, you
can kind of start to interpret life as being a game where
there's challenges and goals. And then you start to think of your
moment, your life on a moment to moment basis as sort of being
this thing where you're like accumulating points. I mean, you
don't want to get carried away with this. But overall, I think
it's a good way to optimize life, where you're just really
thinking like, OK, I'm not wasting time today, because I've
had this game kind of framework where I have these goals, and
I'm not doing things right now to get to my goals. That doesn't
mean you don't relax, you don't have fun, because that's part of
getting to your goals. But if I could go back to when I was 18
or even before high school, like starting high school, I would
have imagined my life as being a type of game. So I wouldn't
miss opportunities. And I would, you know, take advantage of
things where I just miss certain opportunities of life,
because I didn't have this mindset that I have now. Yeah,
so I do think this this game lens that we'll get into is really
helpful for sort of like optimizing your life. And once
you realize it, then you're like, oh, man, I kind of wasted
time being suboptimal. Interesting. Yeah. In life. Yeah. Cool.
Yeah. Now, we'll spend a lot of time and I'll make sure like
that our our fattest section is the the game of life. It's
road to Omega that were that we're on. Before we get into that
a little bit, just to help an audience. And I think you just
alluded to it a little bit. This, I think that your book is a
response to the failure of reductionism in science. So
could you tell us a little bit about, I guess, that changing
paradigm, and then also sprinkle in your unified theory of
reality, which you have a great flow chart from infinity maps
that I'm sure I'll overlay at some point in this discussion. But
I know there's a lot there's a lot there because there's, you
know, a few different frameworks that you bring in. But I love
to just get if you could provide us with a little bit of an
overview, that'd be super helpful.
Yeah, let me there's so many things I've been talking about
writing about, like there could be a conversation, you know, full
podcasts on each of these topics. I'm just trying to be
mindful to like say, you know, be brief and say the most
important things. Because there's so many cultural factors that
you can trace this back to like, this question to like
understanding the different eras, basically, like pre
modernism, modernism, postmodernism, and whatever
we're getting into now. But like pre modernism was kind of the
time before science for like, religion ruled and people believe
supernatural beliefs. And there was this strict hierarchy. And
modernism was basically a response to that. And it happened,
you know, it's kind of started with the Enlightenment period in
like the 17th century, 18th century. And the scientific,
you know, kind of the birth of the scientific method. And when I
started writing the book, I thought that's kind of when
there was like the onset of reductionism and atheism and
kind of this idea that the universe was meaningless and
purposeless. But I found out that that's not true at all. And
basically, there was this modern movement that was like very
pro science and pro reason and logic. But it wasn't what we have
now or wasn't what the kind of scientific ideology of the 20th
century, which was more nihilistic, you know, nothing has
any meaning. There's no purpose. There's no design. And
basically, oh, and there's no such thing as like, continued
complexification, because that kind of implies progress. And so
basically, modernism started off like it was still pretty
religious. And I'm not advocating for organized
religion by any means. But what I'm saying is, there's a
different mindset. Newton was extremely religious. A lot of
the greatest physicists of our time, a lot of the founders of
thermodynamics, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, they were
all very religious, and were driven by this idea that reality
is mysterious. And they're basically trying to understand
what they described as the mind of God. And you see that
language retained in like Stephen Hawking and stuff. And
you'll find videos of like Richard Dawkins saying, you
know, you can make a good argument for a God if you
basically are a creator, if you put them behind, you know, at
the very, you know, that they design the system and then let
it evolve to its own dynamics. And he says the God of Paul
Davies, the God of the physicist. And I was like, the God of
the physicist. And it was again, I was like, looking more into
the different physicists. And you know, a lot of people know
Newton as Christian, some people know like, Godel, his
mathematician was very Christian. But like, I didn't know
like, the founders, a lot of, you know, the founders of the
second law of thermodynamics, were Christian as well. And
actually, the heat death theory, I believe had Christian
motivations, because basically, Lord, yeah, it's super fascinating,
but Lord Kelvin, who kind of popularized the second law of
thermodynamics, which you know, he and Clausius kind of
independently put forth. And just for anyone who doesn't know
the second law of thermodynamics is the law that
entropy always must increase in the universe. Well, in system,
see, that's the thing, it was supposed to be applied just to
like, close systems. And then people immediately started to
try to apply it to the whole universe. But a lot of the
impetus for doing that was like Lord Kelvin knew that if the
universe had an end, it kind of had to imply there was a
beginning. And at the end of the universe, the heat death kind
of paralleled sort of judgment, you know, day of judgment type
stuff. So interesting dissertation online, which talks
about the religious motivations underlying the second law of
thermodynamics. Sir Arthur Eddington, who made the quote,
the second law of thermodynamics is, you know, if you have a
theory that goes up against that, I can only, you know,
whatever, you know, but it's like, yeah. And he was very
Christian as well. And referred to himself as a rational
mystic, which I thought was a nice, you know, kind of
paradoxical term that kind of I felt like a relation to because
reality is very mysterious. And I'm not saying we can't
understand. I'm actually saying we can, but we haven't yet.
There's lots of secrets to uncover. We'll never understand
it completely. But that's what this complexification process,
the world's getting more complex. That happens when
organisms start modeling the world. And when they start
modeling the world to survive in it, they start getting a larger
and more detailed map of the world. And that allows them to
manipulate the world around them, which allows life to spread.
So you have this, this story that is basically, it's really
different than what we've been taught in science. So yeah, my
point was in modernism, scientists still were, you
know, driven by this kind of mystical, you know, desire to
understand nature, the mystery of nature. And really, the whole
idea was that, you know, we could use science to achieve
unlimited progress. But this became associated with like
capitalism and colonialism and stuff like that. So then post
modernism was just kind of this school of thought that emerged
that was a critique of modernism. So it was a critique of like
science thinking you could find objective truth that like,
there's really subjectivity. That's really important. There's
maybe no objective truth. And that whatever cultural culture
believes is relative and a social construct. So there's
cultural relativism, which has like, no culture is really
objectively better than others, which suggests that science is
really not any not in any way more fundamentally sought more
solid than any religions or, you know, kind of folk
mythologies. And so it was idea post modernism was good,
because there were a lot of things to critique about
modernism. But it should have been a critique that improved,
you know, how we think about these things and, you know, the
limits of science or, you know, how certain we should be about
things. But like, I think it was really bad that it basically
tried to eliminate this idea that there is this, you know,
progress towards, you know, higher intelligence in the
biosphere, because I think it's a law that you can't, it's
something that you see a principle of nature that is
real. And if we don't understand that we have no idea how our
civilization is evolving and where we're going, because it's
not driven by some mystical force, it's not something where
progress is like just keeps happening like perfectly. It's
this air correction process that's similar to AI life is facing
challenges. It's like life is similar to an AI being trained on
data and the data is the the chaotic world around us. And so we
keep being faced with problems and we keep having to overcome
those problems. And a lot of organisms die out during that,
but the ones that can solve those problems get to make copies of
themselves. And so we get all these designs of organisms and
ai's and everything basically, there's a natural selection
applies not just to living organisms, but all designs in
life and basically the dysfunctional and inefficient
designs get filtered out. So we have these designs that get more
and more robust. And that leads to this process of basically
life spreading inevitably, but it's not the straight line.
It's always, you know, there's always like two steps back for
one step forward. But you can see the trend clearly and people
like Ray Kurzweil have mapped out these trends of technological
increase, but showing the technological increase as
continuous with the complexity increase of life, because life
is really information processing. And so life is fundamentally
different than inanimate matter. But AI, I wouldn't say is that
fundamentally different from life. I mean, it's not AI is not
alive, but it's an extension of life. It's, it's got designs that
would never appear in nature unless life first emerged. So you
had pre modernism, which was supernatural, then you had the
modern movement, which was like science, but that science could
solve everything. And then maybe some people took that idea too
far and thought, you know, let's do eugenics. And the Nazis
exploited that theory of increasing complexification and
opening the evolution to justify like superior and inferior
races. So there are all these cultural issues that led people
to, to not like certain ideas, whether it was the Nazis using
this idea of like evolutionary progress, or
Teohar Deschardin was a priest, a Catholic priest that wrote this
book that the church actually hated because they thought it
was like against in Christian teaching, but it was that
evolution, you know, everything's become more complex and
that maybe God is in the future, maybe there seems to be some
sort of design, but that everything, for example, the
the network of humans is, is approaching some sort of global
mind that will emerge and this process will continue. So Teohar
Deschardin wrote this book called The Phenomenon of Man that
put out this Omega point theory that my book is, you know,
largely based on and all the scientists who have been writing
about this stuff, complexity scientists, people at the Santa
Fe Institute, they all know that Teohar kind of put that idea out
there and made it like really salient that the world's getting
more complex, but people didn't like the religious, you know,
associations that he made. But so then people were against it
because they felt like if they acknowledged that the world was
getting more complex and that it might be going towards some
final goal state that that would just be like saying that God is
right and God saying, I mean, God is real. And, you know, there's
a design. There's some sort of, you know, trajectory that's been,
you know, planned from the beginning. And people thought
that was dangerous. So then there was a backlash against
anybody saying anything that life had a purpose. They wanted to
erase that language from biology. If you said life does this
in any language that a purpose they wanted you to reward it to
be like, in this sort of neo Darwinian language where you get
rid of purpose. And you say, Oh, no, like they people were mad
that people were asking little kids like, why does the plant, you
know, grow towards the sun? And the kids would say because it
wants the light. And like there's evolutionary theorists who are,
you know, kind of motivated by atheism. No, it doesn't want to
grow towards light. That's teleological language. That's
purposeful language. You have to get that out of science. It
grows towards the light because the ones that were worse that
growing towards the light died off. And that one just happened to
be better. And it just got out of control. But now because of AI
and emergence, and just engineering, when you talk
like an engineer, you kind of talk about agents, even if
they're not living, you kind of use this purposeful language.
So you can't really get rid of this language when you're
talking about the universe, because we do see these things
and it's just natural. But also, it seems to be the way reality
is, at least this emergent phenomenon does have goals and
purposes purposes. But yeah, so that backlash created this kind
of whole worldview of meaninglessness. And it was
perfect for science. Science was already going that kind of
direction, because it was at this war with religion, a lot of
times. And so reductionism is just the idea that, you know,
there's just a bunch of particles in the universe. It's a
system of particles that are bouncing off each other. And
then you can use laws of motion to understand those
interactions. And then if you have those laws of motion,
there's no room for human agency, because everything would be
determined by these fundamental equations that are
specifying these trajectories in advance. But what my book
argues is that that's not right. It's a simplified version of
causality and dynamics in nature. And basically, when agents
emerge, they're these information processing systems that
exist in a universe that's not completely deterministic,
there's a lot of deterministic processes, but at the very
bottom level, there's random, there's there's an element of
probability and randomness or stochasticity. And so there is
room for freedom. And when agents emerge, they basically,
when you're making a conscious decision, the results of your
decision weren't determined by particle physics at that lower
level, you can basically, you as a physical system, when you
initiate a movement, it's not something that's violating the
laws of physics, you're metabolizing energy that you
ate before, but you're not in an animate system that can't move,
you can make these decisions and you're truly making these
decisions in real time. So determinism in the classical
sense, that kind of Laplace kind of made applied Newton's
paradigm to the whole world, and you have this strict
determinism that's really determinism at the level of
particles, as opposed to other people talk about determinism
saying that your actions are a result of your, you know, life
preferences, you know, I mean, your, your experiences and your
beliefs and your genetics, and that's a different discussion
and people complete, conflate those two types of determinism,
biological versus physical determinism and physical
determinism is a much stricter thing. That's saying there's no
room for biological anything, even genes in that view aren't
doing anything, you could reduce genes to particles. So it got
really weird, because you would see evolutionary theorists
being reductionists, I'd be like, if you want to be a real
reductionist, then, you know, like Jerry coin, genes don't even
matter, your whole your whole field would be completely
irrelevant. If you really knew what you were talking about,
like the ideology that you're, like, advocating for, we could
just say genes are epiphenomenal, too, and just talk about
particles. Sure. Oh, the book is a pushback on postmodernism
and reductionism, and kind of wanting to return to this
narrative of science. And not just science, but but but logic
and I mean, arts, in this view, we see science as something. We
see science as part of the evolutionary process, because
testing theories is just like how nature has been testing
organisms. And in this book, organisms are basically embodied
models are embodied theories about how to survive in the world.
Your genome, and your brain has encoded information that makes
predictions about how to survive in the world. So basically,
scientific theories are just kind of extensions of organisms.
And they're kind of it's kind of just an elaboration of this
process of life, creating models that will allow it to survive
in a world that has this tendency to break down. Otherwise,
aside from life, because that's not the full story when people
say the world's going towards more disorder. What I discovered
in the book is that there's this dialectical dynamic where you
have order and disorder and kind of this tension. And it's
because life has to always evade this tendency towards
disorder, that life spreads through the universe and the
universe becomes more complex because you have life spreading.
So if you didn't have that tendency towards disorder, there
would be no evolutionary pressure towards designs that are more
functional, that can survive better in the world. So you need
the tendency towards disorder described by the second law of
thermodynamics to have this whole complexification process
work. But that's one big insight of the book that almost no
people talk about. I mean, this dialectical dynamic, you need
the constraint, you need the constraint on the system. Yeah,
problems create progress. That's Popper's principle. It's a big
yeah. Yeah, so so yeah. And so this whole idea, everybody was
against this idea of teleology, which was just a word for
continual inevitable progress and conversation towards some
higher and I understand why it's because they thought it was a
supernatural idea. But now I'm saying it's not supernatural. And
people are saying like evolution is blind. That was wrong, too.
So it's just more complicated. There is this tendency towards
progress. And the whole system isn't conscious at this point, I
don't believe it is. But there is an intelligence distributed
throughout this network that we call the biosphere. And so you
do see this tendency towards that. But it happens through
mistakes that basically get corrected. If you look at the
whole biosphere as a system, and you look at organisms dying in
some living and reproducing, if you look at natural selection is
basically the biosphere doing its own scientific testing, you
have this new story of life. And you see that evolution
actually does have this tendency towards more complexity. Why
because as that natural selection process proceeds, knowledge
from the successful like the when I say knowledge, I'm not just
talking about human knowledge, although that's part of it. But
when animals that are less adapted, you know, more
dysfunctional designs die out and the better designs stay, the
genome, the genomes in the biosphere are also accumulating
knowledge about how to survive. So when I say the evolutionary
process creates knowledge, I'm talking about the evolutionary
process creates knowledge in genes, in brains, in cultural
memory, and, and then now digital memory, like the internet. In
cultural memory, I mean, like books and stuff. So when you look
at the trajectory of evolution, it's really this emergence of
these information processing systems and memory systems. So
you have the emergence of life, you have genes, then you have
the emergence of brains, you have neural memory, then you have
the emergence of societies, you have cultural memory. So you get
like, you know, language, and you get these ideas spreading from
brain to brain through memes, basically, we start, you know,
telling stories. And then you get the invention of books and,
you know, written language and art. And it's all part of the
same process of basically life exploring the design space,
because it's looking for solutions to this problem of
survival. And at first, it's doing it unconscious. And then
when brains emerge, you have the emergence of consciousness, and
then we start to become aware of our need to survive. And we
start, it's just another layer of our motivation to do what
nature has already programmed us to do. And what the book argues
is, because I always talk about these details, but I don't
always give the bigger picture. A lot of it is because when you
say this, you know, the bigger things behind it, sometimes it
turns people off. So I would save that stuff to the end, or
maybe not even talk about it off as a technical, technical
talk. But the main point of the book is that this process
implies that there's some sort of design or logic, there's some
sort of it's the universe isn't an arbitrary system. Yeah, you
can imagine the universe being full of marbles like that, the
particle story, if the particle story was true, and they were
just little spherical objects bouncing around. Because when
Boltzmann, when the second law of thermodynamics was, you know,
and this idea that Laplace had of everything is just particles at
the lowest level, if you could zoom in on this, you would see
these particles bouncing around. The periodic table wasn't
even invented until like 1920. So people were sure the model of
particles were that they were these perfect spherical balls
that bounce off each other elastically, just like real
pool balls or marbles would. And if we had that, you can have a
bag of marbles bouncing around for eternity, and it's not going
to form the complexity of life. You need specific elements with
specific properties, bonding properties like carbon and
specific forces, you need all of these things to be very specific
for all of this to work. And that's known as the fine tuning
problem. And the fine tuning problem basically says that if
you change any of these parameters, like the force of
gravity, the force of the stronger weak nuclear force, even by
hair, you wouldn't have life, but you probably wouldn't have any
structure in the universe, you just would have just like my
universe that expanded forever, or contracted into, you know,
singularity again, you wouldn't even have it's not that you
wouldn't have life, you wouldn't have structure. So then the
so so the book makes the argument, though, first, it makes
the argument that there is this new cosmic narrative where the
universe is becoming more complex. And that involves, you
know, the emergence of planets and stars, because planets, you
need planets to have life, you need stars to provide the
energy for life, you need stars to fuse the simple elements
together to get the elements that are in living organisms and
biology. And so, but then you get the emergence of life, and
then you get information processing systems in the
world. And then life begins to slowly spread. And because of
this evolutionary process, being this knowledge accumulation
process, it just keeps learning and modeling the world. And as
it's extracting information about the world around it, it just
keeps expanding. And that's what we're seeing now, with like us
leaving the planet to go into space. It's something that was
part of the trajectory. It's not the smart idea of a billionaire
or something. It's what would happen on any biosphere with
intelligent creatures who have discovered science and
discovered thermodynamics, for example, because any advanced
intelligence will learn that their days are numbered, unless
they get off the planet. So what I'm saying is that we have to
have a new picture of the universe. There is some sort of
design. It's almost like life is like AI. It's almost like life
is like the system being trained. And life shouldn't be seen as
separate from the universe. It's part of the universe. It's
actually the universe, universe is simplest components
organizing themselves into a functional form that can experience
itself. So life is the universe's conduit or vehicle for
experiencing itself. And that's a very different story. And it
really raises all kinds of implications. And some people
would reject it flat out. But yeah, you're talking about God,
you're saying that it has a design and that implies a
designer, I'm done with your theory. But what I would say to
that is, when you look at this argument, and you look at the
trends, it does seem like this story is the true story that like
we have to accept that or we have, it has to at least, I think
if you do a Bayesian analysis, which just is analysis of the
evidence for each theory that this theory would come out on top.
And the funny thing is that where people were rejecting it, if
you say, Oh, but we don't necessarily need a designer,
there, there are theories that cosmological natural selection
where there is more that you need to explain about the fine
tuning problem, but you don't need to introduce a God, at least
not a God from like an organized religion. I mean, and I say
that in that way, because you have the simulation theory, which
argues that we're an Intel creation of an intelligent agent.
So what I realized right in the book is that the simulation
theory and intelligent creator theory are effectively the same
theory, and that now that we understand that we can create
simulations with agents, possibly conscious agents, we don't
know, then scientifically, since we've demonstrated that it has
happened, we have to take the possibility we have to consider
a new scientific theory that we're such creation.
And there's epistemological justification for that because we
did it. But here's the funny thing. Before we did it, there
wasn't as much justification to say that we needed to take the
creator theory seriously. But once we have created simulations,
and we know that that's possible in this physical world, we
immediately have to write down a new theory that we are such a
thing. And so basically, this says the atheist, you know, the
theory that there's no designer fine tuning. You know, there is a
there's the appearance of a design. First of all, there's
something that needs to be explained. And to do that, we
have to understand why these laws and not others. So we have to
think bigger than the universe. And then so we have these
different options. Is it a creator? Is it a multiverse
explanation where maybe there's this large ensemble of universes?
And we're just, you know, we're just in one out of, you know, a
multiverse that's mostly lifeless, which is in the
atheist position, or cosmological natural
section, which we'll talk about later, or the simulation theory
that we're made by an agent, you know, intelligent agent. And
then maybe there's even another theory from that. But my point
is, you can't say that there's no design. And given what we know
about the universe, you can't say this is the only universe and
there's no design, because that would be the hot most improbable
thing that there's one universe, it's random. And then it just
happens to have the parameters that would allow for life when
it could have been everything else. And that's why no one says
that that's why the multiverse theory is the rebuttal against
this now, because to destroy the God theory, you need a multiverse
with all these other options. Here's the bad thing about it.
Soon as you introduce that you get wilder ideas than a creator
that ideas of every universe existing, if you're doing every
possible thing, here's the tricky. Here's the funny thing,
too. If you believe the multiverse, and we've also
demonstrated that we can create new virtual worlds that might
have conscious agent, we can create our own universes. The
multiverse theory then starts to include gods too, because it
includes people who create universes just like where we
could or we have, but we haven't created conscious agents.
Let's say we could, then you in the infinitude of all possible
universes, you have universes with creators creating new
universes nested in those universes. If you follow Occam's
razor, the multiverse theory gives you God created the
universes, it gives you every universe could conceive of and
more. So it seems to be worse on Occam's razor grounds. It
introduces all of these things. It gives us the same thing that
the God creator thing was. So what I argue in the book is that
we have to explain the design. You can explain it playing with
infinities with your multiverse theory. But I don't think that's
the best explanation. I think and we can get into that more
later. But I just so yeah, maybe we should just talk more
about the meat. You know, I know, oh, we're the practical
stuff. I actually talked a lot about the tech. I didn't talk
about the technical details, but I kind of summed it all up, I
guess. Yeah, you like touched and brought in. I mean, I could, I
could talk to you for a long time about any one of those things
you brought up. Yeah. Well, before we get into the because I
do want to segue into the practical in a moment. But
yeah, before we do just perhaps to put a button on it, you just
mentioned a few minutes ago, Bayesianism. I spoke with Carl
Friston last week, I interviewed him. Yeah, yeah,
that's not out. Yeah, we'll it will be out in the next couple
days. So for viewers watching this, that one will be out
already. So if you want to deep dive into and Friston is one of
the most cited people in the book, you know, you bring you
bring him in quite often. And actually, I think, because I
first read romance or reality around the holidays. And I had
heard it first and before, but how much he's in the book,
really put him on your radar, but I'm up to the top of the list.
And then so you inspired me to speak with Carl Friston. So
thank you. And, and it was a great conversation, very high
level. Oh my god, I did not know the term high research load
before talking to Friston. That means you need all these
different pieces of information from different
disciplines coming together in order to understand what he's
talking about, because he's a neuroscientist, he's bringing
neuroscience, he's bringing information theory, he's bringing
stuff from physics. But one thing that I thought was quite
interesting is that I wrote a blurb for your book also, he
said, yeah, I think a synthesis of his favorite thing,
something that degree, which is amazing. And I think I was a
surprise, because he said that it doesn't get any more
fundamental or simpler than the free energy principle, which I
thought was really interesting, because I asked him that was
sort of in response to when I brought up Jeremy England,
dissipated adaptation. Yeah, which, which he said, I think to
a degree, I hope this is correct, that that's one subset of the
free energy principle, that would be like something the free
energy principle describes. But that's one of many things that
the free energy principle would have a descriptor for.
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. I'm glad you said that, too.
Because that's, that's what I argued in the book. I don't know
much he thought about that before he read my book, that would
be cool if that kind of, because, you know, I mean, he probably
knew of Jeremy England's work. But as far, yeah, that's one
thing I tried to do in chapter six was to show that this
dissipated adaptation process that's been used to explain the
origin of life is a process of Bayesian inference. That was like
the one big novel thing that I put in the book that I don't
always talk about, you know, it's pretty technical. So it's
not something that has been highlighted. But that, that it
is a process of Bayesian inference, and we can look at all
self organization processes as processes of inference, please go
on. Yeah, so well, and that was very useful for him to clear
that up for me, because, you know, if you'll forgive my
ignorance, I thought that dissipated adaptation was
something that was a sub what free energy principle was
something that you can look at it that way too. Yeah, so it's
like, which way is this going? Yeah, it's all he actually, I
think it's specifically said that he was a little bit dismissive
of the thermodynamic interpretation as that being
underlying ID. Yeah. And that the free energy principle I think
has far more applications than just that. So do you have any
thoughts about it? Yeah, yeah. So a colleague also mentioned
this about him, which I think I knew, but it was interesting to
hear this kind of emphasize but that Carl likes to put, say, you
know, everything in terms of inference, but doesn't like to
reduce everything to evolution, for example. But you could say
the same thing about thermodynamic, you know, that he
doesn't want to reduce everything to thermodynamics. What my book
tried to show is that the thermodynamic story and the
evolutionary story and the inference story are the same
story. And that inference processes are evolution. We'll
talk about in detail what I mean by that, but that they are
evolutionary processes, and they are self organization
processes. So they're kind of dissipated processes. So it's
pointless to be like, this is a subset of that. So well, well,
in a ways, right? Because the origin of life mechanism is one
instance of the free energy principle. But you could so so if
he's talking about dissipative adaptation as an origin of life
theory, it's a subset of a larger inference, because
dissipative adaptation is an inference process. And this is
one instantiation of that. It's just the origin of life. But you
could also look at all inference processes as being dissipated
adaptation processes at a higher level. So you could say the
whole biosphere is evolving through dissipative adaptation,
because they're just adapting. And as they adapt, they extract
more energy. And if they use more energy, they're dissipating
more energy. So the you can look at the biosphere as a
dissipative process. And before dissipative adaptation was, you
know, theory put forth by England, tons of people are
saying this, Eric Cheson, Eric Smith, and here more with Santa
Fe Institute, this whole thermodynamic narrative, it had
been told much, you know, in detail way before Jeremy England,
Jeremy England just came up with this specific equation about
self organizing molecules and demonstrated that you could
simulate this and kind of show that this is the case that
basically, if you have a lump of particles driven by a force of
internet energy, and those particles have the right
profiles such that they interact like you with life, you
need carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrene, you need those
molecules. For example, carbon makes bonds to four other
elements or molecules. And if you don't have something that
can bond to a lot of things, you can't get complex structures.
So if you simulate the properties of those molecules, you can
show that just a system being pushed by a flow of energy with
the right properties will begin to organize. And as they
organize, so that's really what we need to focus on is that
you that's the mechanism of self organization. As a result of
this process, because it takes physical work, I mean, stuff is
happening when it's organizing itself, it has an energetic
cost. So for that process to happen, to go against this
tendency toward disorder, an organism or the system, maybe
it's, you know, something that hasn't emerged, you know, life
hasn't emerged yet, but it's you're seeing like a proto
organism, some sort of chemical, you know, autocatalytic
networks, some sort of chemical system that is self
sustaining, it has to get energy from the environment. So
living systems have to extract energy from the environment to
survive. And when they are extracting it to build that
order to organize themselves. So that cost energy, that's the
thing to understand. And when you're using that energy, it's
always getting dissipated, it's always getting used up in the
it's really the systems releasing heat. And that heat is
entropy. So there's, I didn't get into it here, I'm kind of on
purpose, but there's multiple definitions of entropy, there's
entropy, which is dissipated energy, it's like heat entropy.
And then there's entropy with the statistical definition, which
just talks about disorder things and their different concepts,
they really shouldn't even have the same name. Right. Well, but
but but the energy concept is kind of a subset of this
disorder thing, but it just it order form and that system
release heat. So you can have the whole universe if life
spreading becoming more and more organized at the at the whole
global scale. While more heat is being generated. So whether
entropy goes up or down, it depends on your definition of
entropy, heat entropy goes up because energy is always being
used and spread out and you can't use that energy again. So if
entropy is defined as the energy unavailable for work, that
entropy is going up, entropy divided as organization as
disorder, that entropy is going down. So you have both
ministry going down as the world gets more complex. And you
have energy just being used up. And then that is called
entropy. That's a classical version of entropy. So my point
is, in German, when makes his point in his book, all of the
evolutionary processes that happen in the biosphere are also
using up energy from the sun and as the biosphere becomes more
complex, it uses needs more energy. So it uses it. I think
when you talk about dissipation too much, it gets the focus off
it makes it sound like life is trying to create entropy when
it's not it's trying to survive and it needs energy to survive
and entropy is the byproduct. So it's just like art needs gas.
It's not the goal to
exhaust. Yeah. So if you want to say the origin of life is an
example of inference, that's right. And you have this
dissipative adaptation mechanism. But you could also turn
it around and be like, well, the inference process that Carl's
describing in brains, which will quickly sum up in a second, is
something that allows brains to better model the world so it can
extract more energy and then it is always extracting that energy
and it's using that energy. So really, you have dissipative
adaptation, which in I believe is just another word for self
organizations, thermodynamic self organization, you have that
on every level and that inference is also self
organization. So I think that the there's things that are
equivalent learning and evolution and self organization.
Yeah. And so thing is Bayesian inference, evolution is, you
know, variation in selection. And then self organization is
this dissipative adaptation. They're all the same things. So
it doesn't really you don't you don't need to like put one
having priority over the other. And that was a mistake a lot of
people made because when Jeremy England's work and that stuff
and like, Oh, it's well, it's all thermodynamics, the world just
wants to create entries. No, the world is organizing itself. And
it does it through this process. And this mechanism, you can look
at one aspect where you go to systems learning, you can look
in another aspect or say the system's using energy and
creating entry, and you can use another aspect and say, it's
adapting, it's evolving. Yeah, all yeah, you have a great. It's
not even an equation of just much equivalences in the book,
it's adaptation equals statistical correlation equals
mutual information equals model optimization equals creation. I
mean, that's, I mean, but you're that gets to the crux of what
we're talking about here is that and I actually find this not
specifically with with the gentleman we're talking about
now, but if you may like zoom out a little bit, the word games
that get played a lot. And I mean, it's just because that you
need different terminal, different terms for different
concepts, right? But a lot of times you start, you think about
it a little bit more deeply, you realize, oh, that's pretty much
the same thing, you know, we're just using languages is fungible
and we're kind of getting around it. But I do. And I mean, we
could talk so much more about this stuff. I have a lot of
questions in this area that I'm gonna have to speak because I do
want to focus while we have some remaining time, it looks like
part three might not happen today. But what should we do with
this information? If we might go from crawling, you know, we
have organized some information and people should get the book
to get all these details for themselves. And also read your
read your blog posts on road to omega, the sub stack, and
psychology today as well. What do we do? Like, how do we make this
practical? How do we bring this information into our day to
day lives?
Yeah, so you can talk about that while I explain first and
theory in the context of that because it's really um, yeah,
first and work and so he has the Bayesian brain hypothesis and
the free energy principle, which is just the same Bayesian
brain hypothesis but apply to things without brains. And I
realized there's so much here combined with the other work that
I was, you know, looking at, you know, self organization and
thermodynamics, there's so much here to inform practical living.
And it's just crazy that, you know, no one has kind of used that
information to not many people, I won't say no one, but not many
people have used that information to inform people on how to live
life. And the reason is because the free energy principle, it's
funny, Carl says it's simple and I agree with him. It is the
simplest thing. But if you read the papers, it's the most
complicated thing in the world.
I disagree. I mean, it might be the most fundamental, but
it's like, both things are true at the same time. And it's like,
it is insanely complicated if you want to make it. But the
general principle can, it's super simple. But I don't think
people have applied it because they don't understand it. And I
didn't understand it. I wasn't even sure if it was like
legitimate science that when I first looked at it, because it
kept using these thermodynamic terms like free energy, which
were defined not thermodynamically, it's like
information theoretic free energy and comes from machine
learning. It's based on thermodynamic free energy. But so
I was like, what's this guy talking about? Like minimizing
free energy in this way, but that's not free. So yeah, you
just have to accept that new language will emerge because you
need new words to explain new ideas. And it often comes from
other fields. So there's going to be that confusion. And you just
have to embrace all that and read the, read the literature. And
once you read it, you start understanding there's a lot of
value. But basically, here's the story. You have this tendency
towards disorder in the world. And it was great because I was
already, you know, finished with part one, all the
thermodynamics, if I had already said all this stuff, and
talked about cybernetics and systems have them having to
model the world. And then I found the free energy principle.
And it was like, everything that I was like the path that I was
down, it was like completed by that. So I'd already saw this
picture before that. But basically, but it's cool,
because that's how Friston frames it. And for people who
don't know, he's the most cited neuroscientist in the world,
he developed these statistical techniques for analyzing fmi
data that all fmi studies use pretty much. And so you have
this tendency towards decay. So how do you explain life? He wants
to explain the organization in the world, he says, okay, live
specifically organisms, which are the most interesting to us, they
evade this tendency towards decay, because they model the
world. And they, because they have to survive. And if they
don't have a map of the world, you can't survive in the world.
So the the brain has to create a map. And the free energy
principle basically extend that and said, even organisms without
brains, how encode some sort of map of the environment in their
dynamics, in their genome, maybe in their metabolic processes
and general functional dynamics at the system level. But so
basically, it's the story of how do we, you know, how does life
emerge and survive? It emerges? Well, okay, so yeah. How does
life survive? Let's start there. Life survive, because that's
the model of the world. And if its model isn't accurate, if its
map of the world isn't accurate, the thing's probably going to
die. If you you have a wrong map of the world, and something
comes out and kills you because you didn't know about that
variable, you're dead. And then that design of you is gone.
Unless you've made copies of yourself, that's a bit of a
different design. And the people who do have good maps are
successful. So those good maps keep getting encoded into the
biosphere into the network of organisms. And we keep updating
our maps through natural selection, people die out. But
when you have brains, you don't, things don't have to die to get
better maps in the biosphere, you can learn during your life
things without brains, they can't learn. So if they're born in a
certain way, they just have those characteristics. But so we can
learn. But so what is simple about it is Carl first is just
basically saying this. All organisms minimize what's called
free energy, don't get hung up on you for the audience, don't get
hung up on the word free energy. He's saying, in this context,
free energy is defined as the model's prediction error. So the
amount of mismatch between your model and reality is getting
minimized. So forget free energy minimization, just let's say
the call for us in theory says, your model error needs to be
minimized, or else you'll die. And that we're always trying to do
that. And if we don't pay attention to the evidence, like,
if we don't. Okay, so for example, someone who has a belief
that is contradicted by tons of evidence and tons of stuff
they're seeing in the real world, where it's just completely
like, let's say you believe in purple fairy god, and that's
just your belief. Oh, that's hard one to disprove. Let's say
you let's just do something a little more grounded. Let's say
you think that gravity doesn't exist in Antarctica or
something, you go to Antarctica, and you throw a ball from like
a roof and it exists. If you if you don't update your model, if
you don't go, oh, yeah, gravity exists, because I came here and
I did that test. And if you're denying the evidence that reality
is giving you, then you're not minimizing your model's
prediction error. You're, you're, you're choosing to stick with a
model that has uncertainty or air or ignorance. And if you're
living that way, you don't have an optimal map of the world. And
if you don't have an optimal map of the world, you're not
living optimally. So the book, you know, this is really what
the second book's about and what I write about on Substack, but
because I didn't have enough time with the deadline to really
incorporate all this, you know, practical living stuff. But
basically, what this whole story tells you is that for, or, you
know, ordered things for for sentient any sentient system to
exist in the world to continue existing, it has to be updating
its map of the world to be more accurate. And that's just called
minimizing free energy. Free energy is an information
theoretic term between the difference between your model
and reality. So we always want to be being our ignorance. And we
don't live that way a lot. We're not always updating based on
our knowledge, we sometimes ignore it, we have confirmation
bias, we want to keep that out. And if we do that, we're living
suboptimally. So basically, there's different principles
that you can follow. Be curious. That's one thing. There's a
great paper by a friend of mine who wrote a paper with Carl
Friston on active inference and curiosity. So you got to be
curious because your model is always going to be limited. None
of us have infinite computational like storage space. So we
can't know everything about the world. The world's super complex.
There's no way to know everything. So we're all living in
ignorance. The best we can do is try to make our model as
accurate as possible while living life, you know, you can't
spend all your time learning everything. So you have to decide
how much information you want to acquire. But we should always be
living in that way, we shouldn't get too stuck to our beliefs,
we should always be open to new ideas, because our model is
limited, it's going to have ignorance. And once you accept
that, then, for example, let's say people are asking questions
about the origin of the coronavirus, it became on PC to
talk about a lab leak theory. That's very bad, according to
this approach, because it could possibly be the theory. And
maybe it's not, but you got to look into it. And if you notice,
oh, there's no chance that it was a lab leak thing. Then you can
go, Okay, you know, based on this stuff, there's very little
reason, almost no reason to think that was the case. But that
wasn't true. When people analyzed it, what came out and then
seeing in everybody had it, and they didn't even like really
say, Oh, well, we did a terrible thing by telling everybody,
do not think this like it is wrong thing to think this way.
And then everybody started talking about, well, it could be
a lab leak. And there are tons of reasons why you know, there's
I'm, you know, I won't get into the political stuff. But the
point is, a lot of people like Flat Earthers make this problem
where they're not living in reality, they're not updating
their model of the world, they're just denying what's out
there. But you also have other situations where scientists,
maybe you have this reductionist ideology, they're just
over certain about life is transient, it's going to come
and go. There's no such thing as free will because it goes
against our Newtonian understanding of the world.
That's a failure of being a good Bayesian to you because they
are too certain. And if you look at history, every paradigm,
every model, every theory has proven to have some inaccuracies.
Thanks from, you know, Newton's Laws, relativity, quantum
mechanics hasn't been unified with relativity. So there's all
these things. And in the 90s, we didn't even know we thought we
were at the John Horgan wrote a book, the biggest mistake that
you could do writing a book called but you know, it was worth
it to help this, but it was called the end of science. And the
idea was that we had, we're almost done with understanding
everything. And we thought we understood everything about
physics is before we knew about dark matter, dark energy, which
we only understood dark energy in the late 90s. And people thought
we understood everything. And then they just try to explain
away consciousness as being an illusion. So they can back up
science understands everything, nothing, no mystery,
definitely no supernatural, definitely no creator. But then
should hit the fan and we realized we barely understand
anything like most of the universe is stuff that we
don't even know what it is. It's incredible. So
basically, yeah, if you go on the road to Omega, subsec, I have
these posts called the teleological stance. This
post called that I said plural first. Yeah. Actually, there are
multiple posts on the teleological stance. But
basically it's saying all living systems have an intrinsic
goal, and that's to survive against this tendency towards
decay. So life does have a goal. And a goal gives us a purpose.
And the purpose is to see that life continues to exist. Because
we're part of this larger system that's becoming more
complex. And what I didn't mention is that it seems to be
going towards a fully integrated self aware state of the
universe. And I'm definitely not arguing for panpsychism that
everything's conscious. I'm saying that consciousness emerges
because of some plan that we don't fully understand. And that
consciousness, because it might be a scale invariant or
substrate independent thing, you're conscious because you
have this collection of neurons that are exchanging
information. And somehow consciousness emerges from that.
In the book, I try to explain why that's probably happening. But
if consciousness can emerge from a collection of cells, who's to
say that consciousness can emerge from an interacting system of
humans exchanging information. So that idea has been called the
global brain. Maybe you could have some kind of idea of
global brain. Maybe you could have some people think there's
already a consciousness this level. I don't think there is I
think there's a collective intelligence because you don't
need intelligence to have consciousness. So as fear is
intelligent, it's a self regulated system. But I don't
think it's conscious. But I think consciousness can emerge at
these higher levels. And that if life continues to spread through
the universe and to do so, it has to keep extracting energy and
it and it will keep molding the universe. It'll basically keep
it will start incorporating the inanimate matter of the world
into its computational substrate until the entire universe gets
subsumed. And but it's not as if life is just taking over the
universe. This was the story of the universe self organizing
into this completely functional, conscious, computational state
mind, God, whatever you want to call it doesn't really matter.
It's just this unified state that will be this computational
state of unimaginable power that that everything is moving
towards. So it was really just a self organizing system that has
this dynamic and like part of it's being trained and
accumulating knowledge until the whole system is an integrated
system, the way an organism is the integrated system. So I think
that's where it's headed. I'm about to come out with an article
and big think analyzing new papers that have emerged from the
small one in Gerilania and Microsoft physicists saying that
the universe is a learning machine. That was kind of
influenced by another paper from 2020 by Vitaly Van Schoen, who
says the world's a neural network. And these got articles, you
know, pop and mechanics articles, you can read these a couple
years ago. And what I'm arguing is that life is based, the
universe is something like a neural network or an organism
or a complex adaptive system. It's all just information
processing network that's emerging. And that life is part
of this process. And that's where it's headed. You can call it a
God, you know, there's lots of crazy answers about like what
that is. But that's what Ray Kurzweil believes. That's what
the neural network guy that I mentioned, he also believes that
that's inevitable. That it's going towards that state, I
talked to him a couple days ago in person, and he confirmed
that. So it's a radical new story saying that the universe is
waking up through life. But that gives us a purpose, we're part
of this larger grand process. And we need to do what we can to
continue intelligence and consciousness and experience and
all those things that come from sentience, we need to do what we
can to ensure that spreads throughout the universe. And
that involves a collective mindset change where we
realized to solve our existential problems, we have to come
together because we to solve these problems are so big, that
the whole system needs to be using all of its computational
power. So any civilization that emerges anywhere, we'll have to
go through the same sort of trajectory where they come
together. And we've always been coming together, we've been
coming together into societies. But the thing is, when we come
together into a society, we come together under a belief
system. And then a society emerges on this part of the
world. And it's a different belief system. So there's those are
two super organisms that are going to be in conflict, because
they basically have different genomes, they're different
belief systems. So it's a genome at a higher level, it's a
knowledge system. So they're going to compete. Until they
learn that cooperation is easier, and that makes every task
easier, it makes extracting any, any, it makes extracting
energy easier in any task really. So it's part of a process,
it's inevitable. This is a trajectory that civilizate
intelligence civilizations will go through on any biosphere
where you have an intelligent civilization like this. But it's
leading to that larger story. And that gives us that frames life
in a way that's never been framed by science before it says we
have a cosmic purpose. And we can carry out this cosmic
purpose by trying to facilitate a mindset of coming together. But
it's also at the individual level where you try to live
optimally, you don't do what's bad for the environment, because
it's going to hurt you. You don't live with an ignorant or an
accurate model of the world, because it's going to hurt you.
And if it hurts you, it's not good for the collective. So we
need to align our interests, and we need to figure out how
people can act in their own selfish interest. But at the
same time, do good for humanity. So we just need to align the
interests of the individual and the group to where we're getting
synergy and without consciously adopting this mindset. And I
think for people to adopt this, because without all the science
behind it, it just kind of sounds like positive psychology or
like self help, self help guru stuff or new age stuff. But I
think with the science, you know, if people go, okay, the
universe does seem to be self organized, and there is this
trend, there's this, there is a meaning, we don't know what it
is, we don't know if there was a designer, we don't know, and
we'll talk about that next time. But we don't know if it was a
cosmological natural selection process. But while we know is
that reality seems, you know, our reality seems to have this
trajectory, and we're part of this process. And that process is
good, because it leads to more experiences. If life ends, that's
the end of experience, that's the end of love, that's the end of
feeling, at least in our universe, that's the end of all
that. So it's a good thing for life to exist. And that out of
this story, we get like a self help system, we get a way to
optimize your life based on, you know, just acquiring
information and behaving in a way that is compatible with your
future goals. So
is there is there like an exercise or is there prescribed
activities or things methods? I mean, yeah.
So this basically says, it's basically an umbrella that goes,
hey, that meditation stuff, you're improving executive
control, you know, networks in your brain, like you're you're
improving your ability to not act impulsively. So you're
optimizing your behavior. It's an optimization process. Because
if you behave, let's say someone makes you mad, and you punch
them, or you stab them, you're in jail, you're done. That's like
your goals are gone. So part of living optimally in like a base
optimal way is making decisions and being aware of all of the
possibilities and the consequences of those decisions. So
the space of counterfactuals and choosing the decision that is
in line with your goals. And the idea is that your specific
goals, if everyone is working towards those optimal goals,
then that kind of harmonizes society overall moving in the
right direction. So meditation, any sort of like new age
practice, spiritual practice, religious practice, even like
praying, for example, makes you like aware, you know, people
get mad at people, Christians are saying, pray for these people
in the Middle East, like when they should really be doing
something, your prayers aren't going to do anything. I don't
think that's right. Because yeah, they're not doing anything,
but they could not be praying. And what praying is doing, at
least they're making an exercise, they're going, there's
people on the other side of the world that don't have my
culture. And I'm going to imagine these people suffering, and
I'm going to ask them for help. They're building out a theory of
mind when they're doing that, they're caring about those people
because of that praying action, more than they would if they
never did that act, if they don't do that act, they're basically
like an inanimate object. It's kind of like how we see, you
know, we don't really treat people from other cultures, like
the more we find in common with them, the more we start to
treat them like ourselves. But so what I'm saying is the act of
prayer is do all kinds of good stuff, like also like when you
pray at night, you're like, I'm thankful for this and this, that
stuff that have emerged through evolution, because it's
adaptive. So for us to throw that away, and that's what atheists
have been doing, they're like, Oh, we hate new age stuff, we
hate religion. It's just going back to dark ages in some way,
because all of those things are adaptive. So we need a new
paradigm that merges science with spirituality and says all
those practices aren't bad, believing bullshit is bad, you
can die because you think homeopathy is going to cure
your cancer. So that's not basing, but what but so I'm not,
you know, saying everything is good about religion. But I'm
saying these practices, most of them, the reason people
religions not dying is because people find value in them. And
for scientists and atheists to be like, we're just going to do
whatever's the opposite of religion, which is what has
happened. They're putting scientists, you know, these
people had a big disadvantage or giving them a knife and
actually religion, organized religion is sticking around
because science is having that mindset. They're not realizing
the power of that. And then the regular person is like, I don't
give a shit about your multiverse theory. I want a
belief system that's going to help me in life and give me a
community and make me wake up in the morning feeling good about
life. So they're actually hurting science by being like, Oh,
the spiritual practices are stupid. Oh, meditation is
bullshit. I'm thinking that there's something higher is
bullshit. So very unproductive. And I'm very passionate about
this, because these people are supposed to be like our thought
leaders and tell us like what's right and wrong are saying
things that are causing people mental harm. I mean, really. And
Sabine Hassanfelder talked about this in her book, she even
wrote like a disclaimer at the beginning, like I've written
articles saying free will isn't real. And I'm worried because
people have contacted me saying that they've been very
disturbed by this and people contact me too. And odd people
say, I got out of this nihilistic trap by reading your
book and the free will arguments. So those people are not being
good Bayseans either. They're way too certain where they're like
free will is ridiculous. It's like, well, you don't understand
high level causality because integrated information theory. And
Julio Tononi has two hour talk on the mechanisms of free will.
And he says, absolutely free will is a mechanistic thing. It's
not supernatural. And it's real. David Deutsch, one leading
physicist who Sabine argues, you know, interviews in her book
for a chapter on interviewed by John Horgan, the guy mentioned
earlier, he says, I'm sure we have free will. So it depends on
how you define free will. And I've defined it in a certain way.
But the idea is that there really is freedom. And if we're not
using that freedom, because we don't think we have it, we're
living in a way where we're not going to exercise our agency.
And everything's determined. And you're like, I want to help the
world. And I have an idea, like you might not put that idea out
there. But if you realize I'm an agent, and there it's everything
is not determined, like I can actually make a difference on
the world, you're much more likely to to actually go through
with what you're doing.
Oh, sure. Yeah, I've said it for a long time. I'm not sure if I
came up with this or I've read it somewhere else. But I believe
in free will because when I don't, I make terrible decisions.
You know, that's great. I can, yeah, I can rationalize, geez,
anything. But I know you do have to. Yeah, it really does
optimize your decisions believing in it, which suggests
that it's real. Because if you didn't give anything, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a great, that's like, that's a
huge conversation that we could have to. But one thing I do
want to, if you do have to run, to wrap up a little bit and
maybe give it like sort of a teaser for next time. This idea
of cosmic complexity, you know, this heading towards this
Omega point, can you give us and feel free to speculate feel I
know your the book is grounded in the great science and well
researched. But your intuition, let's say, you know, deep inside
yourself, something maybe some of you can't prove. But why, why
do you think this is all how it's laid out? Why do you think
we're here? Like the ultimate question of like, why this big
story? Yeah, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, what's the
purpose? Like, what's going on?
Yeah, so I won't be able to answer that today. I'll give the
short answer. But mechanistically, I think what's
go like what explains it is basically the universe is moving
towards this. It's the system moving towards an attractor. And
so when you ask like, and I think this theory can inform
quantum mechanics, because it's like, Oh, there's this wave
function, there's all these different power bill possibilities.
And that's what kind of overthrew determinism is that we
understand that there's this probabilistic nature. Due to
quantum mechanics. But what I'm saying is, actually, the wave
function collapse isn't random. If you have an isolated quantum
system, it's going to look random. But when everything's
interacting, everything, all those wave functions must be
collapsed. And I know some people, you know, I haven't
defined these terms. But yeah, just for like a high level
thing, we'll talk about it more next time. But that that the
collapse is, if the universe is becoming more complex, that
puts constraints on how the wave function collapses, such that
the collapse is much in totality, add up towards going
towards this omega point. So I think it is a new motivates a
new theory of quantum mechanics. I mean, there are
interpretations like quantum Darwinism, which are consistent
with what I'm saying. But I think the universe is moving
towards an attractor and it's this, this functional state of
like the universe being the self aware computational conscious
state with the power of a God, basically. And a God would be
nothing more than a mind that has freeman Dyson said a God is
just a mind that has achieved power beyond our comprehension.
So why do I think there's this design that's leading to that?
Well, one explanation is cosmological natural selection
is that the universe basically our universe, there is a
multiverse, but it's not like every possibility exists. There
was this evolutionary process where in least small ones model
of cosmological natural selection, when you have a
universe form and then a black hole forms in that universe.
Since a big bang is like a singularity event that creates
the universe, the idea is that when a bit of black hole forms
in the universe, that's a big bang event that creates a new
universe. That's how you have these eval this evolutionary
process that's creating more and more universes. And the
universes that are good at creating black holes and black
holes come from stars and stars create the chemistry that's
needed for life, then you'll get more and more universes that
create more and more black holes. So more and more universes
that have more and more stars. And so there's in this process
will lead to more and more universes that are firming for
life because stars create the higher elements that are needed
for life. And then so if this evolutionary process is true,
you'll have the selection pressure towards getting more
life friendly universes. And then if the intelligence in that
universe can engineer new universes by engineering black
holes and Alan Gooth, the creative cosmic inflation theory
says we should be able he doesn't necessarily believe this
theory, even though people do consider it. I mean, Leonard
Susskind string theory guy said, he's surprised at least
Mullen's this theory hasn't gotten as much attention, like more
attention. But even now, in Gooth's model, he still thinks
we can create a universe by creating some sort of singularity
event, even if he doesn't think that black holes are always
creating these universes, which cosmic inflation kind of has a
similar model where universes are created. But I'm not sure I
don't think it's the mechanism is to black holes. There's just
these. Yeah, that gets a little more complicated and inflation.
But so the whole point of that and what swollen isn't saying is
if you look at the structure of this cosmological natural
structure universe, it's still inevitably leads to life. And
then it leads to life dominating taking over. And that would
lead to universes that become more and more complex and more
and more intelligent. And ultimately, that would lead to
an evolutionary process towards universes that lead to fully
integrated Omega point states, just because it's the pinnacle
of this process. And it doesn't have to end there. Maybe our
universe, once it reaches this fully integrated state, maybe
there's some interaction with these other universes, and that
these Omega points at this higher level will merge and form a
larger super organism. If this story of nature's particles
coming together and forming these aggregates at these higher
levels keeps going on, maybe it's larger than this universe. So
maybe it continues. I don't know. But the point I'm
emphasizing here, which I haven't really emphasized before, is
that it's still a teleological story. It's the one that we were
trying to get rid of. Like, why is this universe designed? Oh,
cosmological natural selection. But if you look at the
multiverse of the cosmological natural selection world, it
still starts off empty. I mean, lifeless and inevitably gets
dominated by life. So it's the same teleological story. So even
with the cosmological natural selection theory, we cannot get
away from the teleological nature of the cosmos. There still
seems to be a life generating principle, not just the way it
produces life in one universe of this vastly sterile multiverse,
but that life spreads and the multiverse becomes fully
biophilic. So whatever the answer is, there's still this
life giving principle that I see as equivalent to God. And
here's the thing, if you have this process, it's going to lead
to intelligent beings like us, who because the laws of physics
don't disallow this, create virtual worlds that then might
have their own agents. So if we're creating that, then the
process leads to creators too. And so in my view, it's kind of
arbitrary to say, was our universe created? Or is it
cosmological natural selection? I'm like, Well, we don't know,
it could be cosmological natural selection, or maybe that's not
the right answer. Maybe our universe really is nested in
another reality and we're a simulated world with a physical
substrate, you know, just like we create computers with a
physical substrate, but then there's a simulated world of
virtual agents. There's no reason to say that that's not a
possibility. So but here's my point, even if we were created
by a creator, you have to explain them. And then you could
explain them as a as a result of this evolutionary process. But
it's not the atheist one that leads to mostly still it's
still a biophilic one. So my ultimate understanding was that
nature has this life generating principle. It's really hard to
determine, you know, we still have that why something from
nothing problem. But we are making progress. It's not
introducing unnecessary stuff by going outside this universe
because we have the fine tuning mystery that is begging for a
solution that we don't have. Unless we think about these
other things, creator cosmological selection, the
multiverse theory, which I don't think is a good explanation
because it introduces everything just to explain away a
creator when we shouldn't necessarily need to explain a
creator with every possible universe exists. It's just, I
don't think it's the right. I don't think it's superior
epistemologically outcomes are all the things we mentioned. So
ultimately, I'm left with the process itself being God, and
that we could be created by an agent, but it wouldn't be this
all powerful, fundamental thing that was there forever. It would
be a product of this process, but that process seems to be
eternal. So even if we have a God, a creator, I don't think if I
learn about him, I don't think I'd pray to him. I think if we
have a creator, it might be like us creating things. And then we
want to ask our AI, like, is there a God? Like maybe if we do
have a creator, they're looking for us to answers, maybe where the
AI is going to inform them. But so even if we had a creator, I'm
not necessarily sure that I don't think that would be the
end of all answers. I think it's more spiritually satisfying to
be like, to just recognize there is a process that leads to life
leads to consciousness and unending consciousness, reaching
higher and higher levels of experience. And to me, that's
kind of a Spinoza type pantheism thing. It's but it's beyond
that because pantheism is oh, this world could be inanimate
and sterile, but it's God. But like, this is really giving more
of a reason to say, the universe is God, because it's not this
arbitrary random thing anymore. It's this life generating thing.
And so to me, that has all the same qualities of a God. And I do
think we could be somewhere far along in the process where we
could be the product of an intelligent agent. And that agent
could have created a moral moral art to this trajectory, where our
universe, they want to create something that improves and gets
better. And that's what you're seeing, we're getting away from
our original roots, kind of like, kind of compatible with like
this theory of original sin. But like, we evolve from this
animalistic thing. And as this trajectory happens, we get more
moral, we develop a theory of mind, we start to understand that
there are other conscious things, we start to treat them
better, we start to understand we're part of the biosphere and
the universe, we start to care more about the environment. So I
think our evolutionary trajectory has a moral arc that is
further evidence for some sort of purpose or design. And that
part of me says, okay, there is something maybe to it, and maybe
we're farther along the process, maybe there is a creator, maybe
they do care about what happens the way we create programs, and
we're interested in what happens. But it's a personal journey
for me too. I don't know. I mean, if is it why is there evil in
the world? Why isn't it more perfect? I have questions for
that. I'm like trying. I think, you know, there can't be good
without evil. It's all spectrum. There's no way to even define
good unless you have something opposite. So maybe it starts off
of good and evil, because that's the only way it can go. But it
evolves towards a more moral existence towards you know, as
you get closer to the omega point. So it's a journey for me.
But what I am convinced by is that there you do have this
trajectory. And once you start asking what that should why it's
this way, you get into all the explanations that I've just said.
And I think they're better than the nihilistic multiverse, we're
just weak anthropic principle version. And I think that's
super exciting, because I really think a Bayesian analysis
anybody, I think Sean Carroll, anyone, if we have a long enough
talk, if you brought me and five leading physicists who are
open minded, Sean Carroll, Lee Smollon, maybe have some
neuroscientists Christoph Koch, Carl Friston. I think if you lay
all these things on the table, we would quickly come to the
consensus that at least what I'm putting forth is a good
theory. Some people might say, Oh, it's not as likely. They
might say the multiverse thing in there, according to all of
their stuff is a little bit more likely than this. But there's no
way that you can say that this isn't a legitimate scientific
theory, whether it's our universe was created by an
intelligent agent, or cosmological natural
selection, like, and that's what I've been happy about, you
know, the book could have come out and people could have said
crackpot, like, and it just could have got killed by like, you
know, reviews and stuff like that. And no one might have given
it a blog who is not like a Christian person. But all the
people that gave it blurbs and stuff were were scientists or
people called themselves atheists or agnostics. I mean,
there's not one Christian out of like the dozen blurbs I got,
there's not one religious person. So I know the argument is
compelling. But the argument makes all these other wonderful
spiritual weird implications. And since people were willing to
accept the first book, I'm like, Okay, now it's time to open up
the bag of worms that if you're going to put this on the
table, which really, you know, it's not this opening up the
bag of worms, the fact that you had all these unsolved
mysteries that this starts to solve. But it's exciting, because
I think with what's going on in AI, and these papers coming out
arguing that the universe is a complex adaptive system, a
learning system, a neural network of stuff, it's the it's
the right time that this is about to like become, you know,
there's going to be a cafes transition, there's going to be
a shift in perspective that changes everyone's ideology,
that ideology will lead to greater harmony around the
world. So I want to be part of that happening. And it's really
exciting. But it just has to be done with care, because it's
very easy to scare people off when you talk about like the
religious stuff and religious people are scared of evolution
and stuff. So it would be wonderful if people go, Okay, we
don't know shit, really. And we can but there's stuff that we
don't that we know is not true. And there's stuff that we don't
know, like, we can start to come together and be like, you
know, religious and, you know, scientific people can be like,
there does seem to be this purpose. And we do need to
cooperate. We do need to come together. We do, I call those
things. So I'm excited to see where this goes. And I'll just
make a prediction that in 10 years, if we have a conversation
again, that this paradigm will be considered and I may not even
be mentioned, I may not even be on like the wiki page for it.
But I do believe that in 10 years, the idea that the
universe is a self organizing system going towards this kind
of a mega point computational fully integrated state will be
if not the leading theory, it will do basically with the many
worlds theory of quantum mechanics that go from complete
obscurity to like start being like kind of like at one of the
competing main interpretations.
Yeah, that's so cool. And I hope it doesn't take 10 years for us
to talk again. But one question before you go, I have to know,
how did you choose that is a hop vibration on the cover, right?
Um, yeah. So I don't know. I've heard I'm pretty sure it is.
Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I there was an interview for Eric Weinstein.
I know he has a geometric unity theory and there was a similar
structure on his and I wonder if it was the how is that from like
gauge theory?
I bring it up. Well, partly it has. Oh, I bring it's really
speaking to me now because I was very fortunate about a month
ago. I have a video on the hop vibration on that on that object.
You got to watch it. Yeah. Well, I was so fortunate it blew up a
few weeks ago. And now it's like 800,000 views and counting,
which is awesome. So congrats. Yeah, it's great. Thank you.
And I don't know why it just kind of took off on its own.
Yeah, that's what make people shared it too. Yeah, maybe.
And I think Eric Weinstein was on some podcasts recently so that
I might have just picked it up. But people are really drawn to
this, this geometric object for some reason, a lot of a lot of
comments have been people seeing this while say meditating or
an altered state of consciousness. Very cool. I mean, a lot of
people and I mean, that's probably not so uncommon for
a geometric object that's kind of interesting and has, you know,
an undulate and stuff like that. But but I wanted to know if
there was any like deeper significance behind the cover
because the story.
Yeah, I'll tell you the story. And I think I don't think she
would mind me saying this. So the artist's name Francesca
Lorenzini and on Instagram, she's Francesca Acacia. But she had
all this art that was kind of she has a background in psychology
and philosophy. So it's very scientific and database. And so
was that I'll link to that. Yeah, that'd be awesome. So I was
looking through all that art to like, find the right thing
because I knew that had a certain stick. I have a few artist
friends to I had in mind. The original one fell through, they
just didn't have time. And it was going to be very similar to
Anika Harris's conscious cover where it's like all the
sprawling organically, like kind of cosmic stuff. And that's
what we're going to go with. But since she kind of stole the I
mean, she didn't know about it. But I mean, I got scooped on that
idea. So I was looking for this picture. And I saw that. And I
asked her where she got it from. And she was like, I did acid.
It's like, I saw that. Yeah, I bring that up because you said
people see that. So she had a psychedelic experience where she
saw something like this, but then she went out looking for it.
And she found that and it was like a MATLAB data visualization
that someone had made. Yeah, but she tweaked it. She tweaked it.
And then we put the person in it and we put it on the
background. It's beautiful. But I didn't I didn't know what the
structure was called even. And I had heard about those
structures. And I knew it was something like that. But I don't
know if it's exactly the same thing.
Oh, it is. I'm 99% sure it is.
It shows loops and levels. It shows like the theme of the book
sort of like this recursive nature. And that's kind of my
I think it's an important structure. It's technically a
it's a mapping from a ford hypersphere onto a traditional
what we would call traditional sphere. So it's the fiber bundled
and you can visualize it in many different ways. You just cut
away most of the fibers and those are sort of that's the
visualization that she has there. And there are perhaps, I
don't quite know, I can't quite tell how important it is in
physics. Apparently, there are seven, seven or eight different
applications of it in fundamental physics situations. I've
been trying to reach out to the physicist who wrote a paper
about it like 20 years ago, but I can't get in touch with him.
So maybe I'll talk to Eric Weinstein about it, because he
thinks it's the most important object in the universe. But I
can't tell honestly, I don't want to I can't tell either. I
I'm just not sure how important it is. It could be very important.
It could be, you know, I don't know enough. I don't know
enough Eric Weinstein's interesting because he's a
person where I feel like I know a lot about science. I do not
know enough about math that you to understand whether he's got
some substantial ideas or not. So that's something I want to
deep dive into. Because anytime anyone's like, I figured it
out, I think it's worth looking into. But like, I have no idea
if it's important, as he says to it's interesting. I definitely
learned more about it. But I do I do think it is. I mean, some in
some way, like, that's why I used it. I think it captures
everything. I think we're like an early stage in mathematics
where we haven't started to understand been talking to people
about this, like recursive sets and stuff. There's these
structures. I do think he's on to something. And we need to
to learn more about it. But yeah, I think if anything, it kind
of supports this idea that reality is structured through
loops and levels, which we didn't really talk about. But
there's there's hierarchical organization, and there's all
these feedback loops. And so I think it probably is like some
kind of key to unlocking the secrets of reality.
Yes, possibly. And it's funny, because we didn't talk about it.
And I think you do mention in the book, but Douglas Hofstadter's
girl Esher Bach, which is all about loops and levels. And I
read that, like two summers ago, for the first time, and it blew
my mind. Yeah, but I will say, since that book, my favorite
book is yours. So the romance of reality, please go out and read
it, people. It's fantastic. Thanks so much, Kyle. This has
been a lot of fun. Yes, I can't wait for round two. I have a
bunch of questions I'll say for next time. And I just really
appreciate your time. Thank you, Bobby. Let's do it. All right.
It's a lot of fun.
