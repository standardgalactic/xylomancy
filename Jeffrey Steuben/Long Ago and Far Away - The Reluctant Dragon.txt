["Pomp and Circumstance"]
Long ago, on a still afternoon, when the world was green and the sky was blue,
a shepherd and his son were tending their flock, as they often did,
in the shade of some tall rocks on top of a high ridge.
Being a shepherd suited the boy, as it gave him time to think about elves and gnomes
and pixies and goblins.
For the boy was a dreamer.
What do you think, lad? Rabbit pie or vegetable stew?
But the boy did not reply.
He was daydreaming about a magic spell that had to do with a witch's cauldron
and an enchanted princess.
Pay attention, lad.
Oh, sorry, Father. Did you ask me something?
It wasn't important. I was only trying to make conversation.
What was it that you wanted to know?
No matter, no matter. We'll find out soon enough.
Well, it's very nearly supper time now.
You might run down home, in fact, and tell your mother to set the table.
Very well, Father.
Hurry now, and don't dawdle to play at sword fights with the innkeeper's rowdy lads.
I don't play at sword fighting, Father.
And don't stop to pick flowers on the way down, either.
Oh, sorry, Father.
I wonder what we will be having for supper tonight.
Rabbit pie or vegetable stew?
Or vegetable pie or rabbit stew?
But the boy's thoughts were on other things.
Winged horses and one-eyed ogres.
Crocs of gold at the ends of rainbows.
Wishes granted by genies released from bottles.
Daydreaming again.
Said the boy's mother when he couldn't remember why his father had sent him home.
Never mind. I've no time for your foolishness now.
The table's not even set for supper yet.
There'll be your father home in less than an hour.
But the boy's mother was wrong.
His father would be home in much less than less than an hour.
Oh!
What ever is in this?
Up there. It's up there, I tell you.
Then he went on to explain that while he'd been sitting up on the rocks
in his usual spot outside the cave,
there had come from inside the most awful snuffling and snarling
and moaning and groaning and downright ranting and roaring
that he had ever heard in his entire life.
Snuffling and snarling.
Moaning and groaning.
Ranting and roaring.
Well, I never.
I shouldn't worry, Father.
He's only a dragon.
Dragon?
Why, dragons bite spokesheads off.
Not always, said the boy,
who knew about such matters,
having met many wild and wonderful creatures in the world of his own imagination.
Some of them are quite nice.
I'll go up there if you like and find out exactly what it is.
You don't know such thing.
I'm not having you coming back here with your head bitten off.
Or we're still being swallowed whole and not coming back at all.
Somebody's got to go, Father.
You wouldn't want the flock to be eaten either.
The lad's right, wife.
And so, at next morning's cockroach while the village was still a bed,
the boy set off,
not stopping on the way to pluck wild flowers.
Although the temptation of some early morning mushrooms
proved too much for him,
but he dallied no longer than a moment.
And only several moments after that,
he arrived outside the cave.
Oh.
I never knew dragons purred.
We live and learn.
Hello, boy.
Dragon.
Uh, did you hit me or bung stones or squirt water or anything?
I won't have it, so I tell you.
I wouldn't do anything of the kind.
Oh, um, do you like mushrooms?
Uh, yeah.
Delicious.
I've only come up here to see what you are.
I should have thought that was plainly obvious.
And why you were making all that noise last evening?
Because I snoring. Don't tell me.
Oh, very uncivil of me. I don't often snore.
Oh, I do beg your pardon.
Um, will you be staying long?
I can hardly say at present.
I haven't given much thought to it yet,
although I must say it seems a nice enough residence
at first acquaintance, very quiet and peaceful,
much better than the last place.
Where have you come from?
Oh, a long way from here, thank goodness,
where all the other dragons live.
But I just had to get away from them, you know.
Why was that?
You know, what dragons are so active and earnest
and all that, always rampaging and skirmishing
and scouring the desert sands
and pacing the margin of the sea
and chasing knights all over the place
and being chased and going on, generally.
Whereas I like to get my meals regular
and then to prop up my back against a bit of rock
and snooze a bit.
But it's an active mind, you see.
It's always occupied with something.
What's it occupied with?
Did you ever just for fun
try to make up poetry versus that kind of thing?
Of course I have, lots of times.
But mostly in my head,
they don't go in for poetry much in our village.
They didn't go in for poetry much where I came from, either.
I say, I am exceptionally glad I met you,
sort of, kindred spirits.
I wonder if you'd obliged me with your opinion of a stanza
I've been working on.
I'd be glad to.
There once lived a prince among dragons
and exquisite dragon was he.
He was not quite green and hardly blue,
but greeny blue, just like the sea.
I like that.
That poem is not only by me, boy,
it is also about me.
It is an autobiographical poem
and you don't get many of them to the groat,
I don't mind telling you.
It's very good.
Thank you.
Would you care to hear another poem?
Yes, please, but not just now, if you don't mind.
I've got to go back and explain about you to my parents.
Bring them along with you next time.
I'll recite a few verses for them to ask the entire village
about the more the merrier.
I'm not sure they'd come.
I'm not sure they'd quite understand
or even let you stay here if they knew about you.
Why, if not, indeed.
You are a dragon, after all,
and they'll say that makes you a scourge and a pest
and a baneful monster.
You are an enemy of the human race.
Absolute and utter terror-diddle
by having gotten an enemy in the entire world.
There's a dragon on the downs.
There's a dragon on the downs.
It's inside the cave,
snuffling and snarling,
moaning and groaning and ranting and roaring.
Is it fierce and scaly?
Is it sharp tooth and needle claws?
Oh, we need a dragon.
Dragons are the worst possible kind of creature
a village could be playing with.
Well, I'll say they bite your head off, dragons do.
They bite your head off, and then they choose it up.
They bite your head off, they choose it up,
and then they swallow the rest of you down whole.
It's sitting up there now, biting folks heads off.
I'll be bound.
Chewing them up.
Crunch, crunch.
Swallow and the rest of them down whole.
Arms, legs, bodies, all at one go.
But it really isn't that kind of a dragon.
It's a friendly dragon.
It's no good just standing here and talking about it.
Something needs to be done.
There's only one thing needs to be done
with any dragon neighbors,
and that's...
kill it.
No, no!
Push it down.
Uh, how do you put down the dragon?
Set the trap for it.
Lay down some poison.
No, no, no.
You slay the beast.
You send for a gallant knight to slay it for you.
Of course you do.
You send for a professional.
You go to that sort of job yourself.
Where do you find one?
It's already taken care of neighbors.
I've sent for the very best man there is.
Three cheers for Saint George.
Where is the scurvy beast?
I'll put it to the saw.
Please, please listen to me.
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!
The dragon of good taste comes.
I have never done any one harm.
It also went to...
The dragon of charm and good taste
said the time spent in writing awaits.
It's all up, dragon.
They've got Saint George.
He's coming to fight you.
I don't care who they've got or who they haven't.
I've certainly got no wish to fight him.
But it doesn't make any difference what you wish.
If he's come here to slay you, he will do.
He's got a snow-white horse and a pointed lance
and a sharp sword too.
He's Saint George.
He's the bravest, strongest knight of all.
He'll chop you up into little pieces.
Then you must tell him what you told the other.
He's not the fighting kind.
I'm a gentle soul.
But they didn't listen to me.
Neither will he.
Even you're not listening to me.
And if you're still here tomorrow, he'll kill you.
Oh, I don't know.
I'm sure he won't.
You'll be able to worry in something.
I know I have every confidence in you.
You're such a manager.
Meanwhile, Saint George himself,
as was the custom with all gallant knights,
had shut himself away in solitary vigil,
devoting his thoughts towards the conflict,
the lairhead.
Who stands with us?
May I come in, Saint George?
I'd like to talk to you about the dragon.
What is it, boy?
Now, don't be afraid.
Am I to weak a quick revenge for you?
Another tale of misery and wrong, I tell you.
Of whom has the tyrant beast bereft there?
Thy father, mother, sister, brother?
Now, I'll have the foul fiend's heart tomorrow that I warrant there.
No, that's just it.
It hasn't bereft me of anybody.
And it isn't a tyrant beast either.
It's a good dragon.
Is it really 45 foot tall
and is, uh, far at its mouth?
No. I mean, it's a good dragon, a kind dragon.
It's a friend of mine. It writes poetry.
Does it really?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Pull up a stool, boy.
That's not what they say out there about the beast.
They say it's been banging off people's heads.
Oh, they would.
They'll say anything that suits them.
Fights and meat and drink to most of them.
They don't care if it's fisty cuffs
or bare-baiting or slaying dragons.
I bet they've been telling you what a hero you are
and how you'll win in the cause of right and honor.
Well...
As I peeked in at the window just now,
I could hear them betting six to four on the dragon.
Six to four on the dragon.
Mm-hmm.
It's a sad world there.
There are times when I begin to think
that all the wickedness in it
is not entirely bottled up inside the dragons.
You're all the same.
I am Saint George, and it is a dragon.
I don't see any way out of the conflict.
I, um...
I don't suppose you might manage
to arrange something, huh?
Somehow?
Oh, that's just what the dragon said.
The pair of you think you can leave everything to me.
Couldn't you just slip away quietly?
Slip away quietly?
Me?
Saint George?
Absolutely out of the question.
Well, you're...
Right, right.
So say.
Mm-hmm.
I've brought someone to see you, dragon.
This is Saint George.
Saint George, let me introduce you to the dragon.
So glad to meet you, Saint George.
How do you do?
All this is devilishly regular.
Uh, so, um...
Beast, my young friend here
tells me that you have little stomach
for the forthcoming noble encounter, huh?
If you're referring to the brawl that's been proposed,
none whatsoever.
Shame on you.
If you've no objection,
I should rather like to recite a few verses
that have composed on the subject of violence in general.
But there isn't time for that.
And if you would only come out and admit it,
you'd tell him you're not much looking forward to it, either.
Not much looking forward to it?
How dare you, boy?
Ask some million whether I've ever ducked out of a scrap.
Why, uh...
Well, it's not for this touch of rheumatism in me,
and the twinge of arthritis in me knee joint
where me armor lets the wet in.
But, oh, but fight, I must.
I am Saint George.
And if you're afraid to face me, monster,
you must run away.
Lipscond, from here,
I shall do nothing of the kind.
Why should I? I have done nothing wrong.
I happen to like this cave.
I live here now.
This is my home.
Oh, it's Fodkin's tyrant beast.
Then thou shalt have to fight.
You shan't.
But you can't just stand there
when I come at you on the field of conflict.
You can't just stand there ditherin
while I stick things in your...
If it's in your perverse nature to behave like that,
I don't see that I have much choice.
But there'll be people watching.
They'll expect a spectacle.
They're entitled to one.
Some of them may have traveled miles.
On top of which, it'll make me look such a fool.
Confund it, dragon.
You'll have to put on some sort of show.
That's it. That's the answer.
What are you, um...
What are you suggesting, boy?
You can both put on a show for them tomorrow.
You can pretend to fight.
Pretend to fight?
I'd have to win, of course.
Why not?
There's no skin off my snout.
But we...
We'd never get away with it.
The next day dawned as bright and clear
as any public holiday deserves.
Oh, come on, dragon.
Oh, well done, dragon.
Whistle.
Whistle.
Oh, hello!
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, darn spirits, right here.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
No!
Dragon.
Aren't you going to finish it off?
What about it, Georgie?
Come on, then, no more night.
Lights off its head.
Pay it back for swallowing folks down old.
It hasn't swallowed anybody, not a single person.
Well, you might have done.
Give an aft of charm.
I think you'll find, friends,
that this dragon has learned his lesson.
I think you'll find this dragon
will behave itself in future.
I think you'll find
he'll prove a credit to the community.
I think you'll find...
it's time the innkeeper opened his door.
Later that same night,
St. George related to the villagers
that which he had not long learned himself.
And full more.
Never be too hasty for a fight.
Remember that all creatures on Godzilla
deserve man's respect
and most importantly,
don't judge anyone or anything
on his or her or its appearance.
Then the feasting and rejoicing
went on hour after hour.
Tankards were filled, songs were sung.
And the dragon was delighted
at being invited to join in the celebrations.
He had, of course,
composed several verses,
especially for the occasion.
It was a dragon of taste,
charm and wit,
who's been around the world quite a bit.
There I stayed off the cup.
I have traveled enough.
There's a place I've found friends.
This is it.
In conclusion,
I'd just like to say
it's been a remarkable day.
You've all been so kind
and I'm sure you weren't mind
when I tell you I think I might stay.
Thank you, thank you.
But all good parties have to end.
How along, old friend.
Get him lit.
We'll walk you up your cave.
We'll see you home.
