Can I ask you a bit of a weird question?
What is the purpose of true crime?
What does it do?
You're watching We Are In Hell.
Hello to all you Necroheads out there and welcome to another episode of True Crime Exhibition.
We are in to his house, bow, bow, bow!
And speaking of in the house, for Air Canada Gal, September 25th, 2010, started like any
other day.
She got off work at 6 o'clock, which was pretty normal for her.
She drove to her house, which she shared with her partner, Dolphin Girl.
She arrived at the house at some time between 6.30 and 7 p.m.
So we don't actually know the exact time that she arrived home at?
No, and that's actually one of the things the detectives found challenging later was
pinning down the time she got home.
So at some point in this window, she arrived home and opened her door, unaware that her
life was about to change forever.
Hello, boys, ghouls, and non-binary jewels.
I hope that you're all having a de-frightful halloween.
Fuck that, fuck, fuck, we're not doing that, that's stupid.
I'm sorry.
This is like going to be a long video too, can you imagine if this was the whole time
woke cryptkeeper puns?
Hey, everyone who's still watching.
For this very special halloween edition of Where in Hell, we're going to talk about
true crime.
True crime is one of those things like astrology where, at least when I was a kid, it was like
trashy, but now every girl I know is obsessed with it.
By the way, my stance on astrology is that I don't believe in it, but the way it'll
piss off the most annoying types of guys is hilarious and has made me a critical supporter.
Although maybe there is something to it, I mean, I get all these comments that say that
I'm cancer and I'm like, dude, that's crazy, how did you know I was born June 25th?
So what is true crime?
Basically, it's a non-fiction genre that focuses on the details of crimes.
Wikipedia also describes it as trash culture.
So that description's a little broad, not to mention harsh, although what do I know?
I am a culture raccoon.
True crime can take lots of different forms ranging from podcasts to TV shows to documentaries
to airport books to great books to the evening news.
And while I do think trash culture is a bit much, there is definitely lots to criticize
true crime for.
Please don't close the video, I swear this is going to get more interesting than just
a bunch of true crime is canceled hot takes, but first, an exhaustive list of true crime
is canceled hot takes.
Hot take the first.
True crime is often quite exploitive and disrespectful towards victims of crimes and their families
as Sarah Zed talks about in her great video about American Vandal.
Also shows like cops in the first 48 can function as copaganda as skip intro points out in his
great video about the subject.
There's also the fact that so many of the podcasts I listened to when I was researching
this are sponsored by home alarm companies, which can be an extremely sketchy industry
in its own right.
By the way, did you know that you probably spend more time being watched on security
camera in America than in China?
But that's somehow okay because it's capitalist doing it instead of the government.
There's also the issue of what gets categorized as true crime versus just crime, right?
Like there's nowhere near as many podcasts talking about the unsolved murders of black
and brown people in shitty neighborhoods as there are about middle class white women getting
kidnapped in the suburbs.
And another criticism is that being really into true crime seems more than a little serial
killery.
And this is the criticism that I think is the least founded.
It kind of reminds me of the old playing violent video games will turn kids into school shooters
argument.
And I do get it, like it is definitely weird when I'll be like talking to a girl in theory
and I'll ask her what she's into and her response is just murder.
But when you check out true crime, like at all, especially with the podcast, it becomes
pretty clear that the focus of the show is not how to become a good serial killer so
much as it is how to avoid getting killed by one.
There is a reason that these shows are sponsored by home security systems, not latex glove manufacturers.
As I said earlier, the majority of true crime fans are people who aren't straight men, people
who are a bit more justified in their fear of getting put in someone's trunk.
Okay, now that's all out of the way.
This video isn't going to be about why true crime is problematic.
It's going to be about why it's necessary.
When Air Canada gal got inside the house, it was completely silent, which was unusual
since she would normally be able to hear dolphin girl splashing around in the tub.
Right, that seems really strange since dolphin girl was probably pretty loud.
Right, so she went upstairs to investigate but what she found in the bathroom was horrifying.
First of all, there was blood everywhere as well as ropes and handcuffs in the bathtub
but no dolphin girl.
Wait, so you're saying there was blood everywhere but dolphin girl wasn't there?
Yeah, Air Canada gal was shocked.
She was freaking out, right, but she noticed a trail of blood on the floor so she walked
out of the bathroom to investigate.
The question I want to answer in this video is what is the purpose of true crime?
One pretty obvious answer would be that it's to inform people.
I mean, it is nonfiction, true crime.
The problem with this though is that while yes, true crime does usually provide the true
facts of a crime, it's actively terrible at informing its viewers about broader trends
in crime.
A study found that heavy consumers of true crime are actually less informed about the
true crime rate than members of the general public since their heavy consumption of crime
stories makes them think that gruesome murders are just happening constantly.
In order to understand true crime, we're first going to have to go back to its origins.
I think the most interesting thing I've learned in researching this video is just how old true
crime is.
It has literally been in print since we invented the printing press.
There's this one hilarious Chinese book of true crime stories that dates back to the
Ming dynasty, and it's just full of these really funny, like, dumb, low-level cons.
And this is a translation, but coaxing a sister-in-law into adultery to scam oil and meat, or pilfering
green cloth by pretending to steal a goose.
Honestly though, who among us hasn't lost just swaths of green cloth to would-be goose
thieves?
The earliest true crime we have, though, comes from 16th-century Germany, which is where
and when the printing press was invented.
Clergymen would sell or give out pamphlets that included horrifying stories of true crime
meant to shock people into acting morally by showing them the consequences of a life
of sin.
The stories would have titles like, a true and most horrifying account of how a woman
tyrannically murdered her four children and also killed herself.
You'll never guess what that one's about.
She first went for the eldest son attempting to cut off his head.
He quickly to the window sped to try if he could creep outside.
By the leg, she pulled him back inside and threw him down onto the ground.
Ladies, if you skip church, you're gonna wind up murdering your kids.
That's just how it works.
There are a few interesting things about this.
For one, historians don't think that the church made any money off of these.
At best, they'd be breaking even.
Also, like, I get that this is how academia works, but it is so funny to me that there
are people who've devoted their lives to working out the business model of the 16th-century
equivalent of Chick Tracks.
But this is evidence against another criticism of pulpier forms of true crime, which is that
they're just a cash grab.
I mean, I'm sure that that is true to some extent, but also this shows that there is
some non-monetary motivation for true crime.
But I think the most interesting thing that you see when you take a historical look at
true crime is how the types of crimes that get covered change.
The 16th-century Germany was a point of rapid social change, and at that time, you started
to see a lot of stories of mothers murdering their kids.
In a paper by Joy Wiltenberg, she argues that depicting this kind of violence on the most
fundamental forms of social interactions mirrored fears from that time about the changing nature
of society.
Later, post-Reformation Protestants were pushing for basically parental controls over marriage,
and around that time, you start to see more depictions of married couples killing each
other, a mirror to societal anxieties around illegitimate marriages.
As Wiltenberg writes,
The crime featured in sensationalist accounts were not the most common, but rather those
perceived as most horrifying.
I would argue that you can see true crimes fixations on LGBTQ people and Satanists throughout
the 20th century as tapping into the cultural anxieties of their time in the same way.
Even more recently, I think this has kind of been flipped on its head.
In a time of increasing awareness of police brutality, I don't think it's a coincidence
that the most popular true crime stories are things like serial and making a murderer.
Those where the horror comes not from the crime committed so much as the arguable imprisonment
of an innocent person.
Essentially, true crime acts as a sort of social control, enforcing the norms of a society
by depicting the most graphic violations of those norms.
It's fucking rush hour outside.
God damn it.
Fucking fasten the furious out there.
Just zoom, zoom, zoom.
And this doesn't just mean that true crime tells people how not to behave.
When they condemn something, they're kind of implicitly affirming its opposite.
For example, when someone condemns the act of rioting, they are implicitly supporting
the value of private property.

This all relates to the theories of a French sociologist named Emile Durkheim.
Durkheim was arguably the first person to legitimize the field of sociology, and his
work went on to form the basis for the sociological theory of functionalism.
Functionalism is one of the big three foundational theories of sociology, along with symbolic
interactionism, which I talk about in my crappy jobs video, and conflict theory, which is
essentially just Marxism, which I talk about in every one of my videos.
Functionalists analyze things by asking what that thing does for society, or basically
what is its function.
And when it comes to crime, Durkheim's hot take was that it's good, actually.
Well, not exactly.
Durkheim didn't think that crime was good, but that it was necessary.
Like pain, or me reading my YouTube comment section.
These things are horrible experiences, but are physiologically necessary.
First of all, Durkheim argued that every society has had crime, and even if there was some
magical place where everyone was a perfect person and no one did anything wrong, there
would still be people in that society who would violate the rules and be considered
criminals, even if degenerate scumbags like you or I wouldn't think that they had done
anything wrong.
You might even say that old Durkheim predicted cancel culture.
Kill me.
And so, Durkheim figured that if something is a necessary ingredient in any society,
it must serve some kind of purpose.
And when it comes to crime, he argues that the purpose it serves is to define the border
between what is and isn't acceptable.
From this view, crime is necessary because it allows us to define ourselves in opposition
to it.
This isn't like just saying that if there were no murderers, we wouldn't think murder
was bad.
The functionalist view is that a culture can't exist without defining itself in opposition
to those outside of it.
There has to be an us and a them.
For Durkheim and functionalists, part of forming that group identity involves labeling certain
behaviors as deviant and anyone who engages in them as other.
Crime then is the experience of outgroup behavior invading the interior.
I think this in part feeds into why true crime is so white and upper middle class.
In a society that views those groups as the norm, there's a greater horror to crime
invading those spaces where it supposedly shouldn't belong.
Part of the fascination with Ted Bundy, for example, is that this horrifying murderer
was in fact a handsome, well-spoken white dude, someone who by all accounts should fit within
society's in-group.
An important thing to understand with Durkheim and later functionalists is that no act is
inherently criminal in and of itself.
Instead, certain behaviors become deviant or criminal because they offend what Durkheim
calls the collective conscience.
Since there cannot be a society in which the individuals do not differ more or less from
the collective type, it is also inevitable that among these divergences, there are some
with a criminal character.
What confers this character upon them is not the intrinsic quality of a given act, but
that definition which the collective conscience lends them.
If the collective conscience is stronger, if it has enough authority practically to suppress
these divergences, it will also be more sensitive, more exacting.
And reacting against the slightest deviations with the energy it otherwise displays only
against more considerable infractions, it will attribute to them the same gravity as
formally to crimes.
In other words, it will designate them as criminal.
Now some of you may have noticed a bit of an issue with that.
For Durkheim, laws and even governments are just expressions of a collective cultural
will.
And so if something is illegal, it's because most people in society just more or less agree
that it should be.
But that's not really true, is it?
There are lots of laws that exist not because they represent the collective moral compass
of society, but because they benefit people in power.
One example of that might be marijuana prohibition in America.
The vast majority of Americans are chill as fuck, or to use layman's terms, support
legalization.
However, weed remains illegal, mostly to serve the interests of the prison industrial complex.
No Kennedy III once explained that the reason he opposed marijuana legalization was because
if it was made legal, cops wouldn't be able to use it as an excuse to claim probable cause
when they pulled people over for no reason.
If you smell marijuana in a car, you could search the car.
When it became decriminalized, you couldn't do that.
Although to be fair, it does kind of make sense that Kennedy might be a little nervous
about cars.
This is one of the key issues with functionalism.
It inherently views society as a harmonious organism where all the pieces work together,
and so it's much more interested in maintaining order and stability than in addressing injustices.
This makes it, to say the least, a pretty conservative way of explaining things.
And you can definitely see that when you look into Durkheim's work.
For example, in his most famous book, he did a massive study on suicide and discovered
that suicidality is linked to a lack of social solidarity, something which he believed was
getting much worse as industrialization and modernity were eroding traditional social
structures without providing viable alternatives.
His proposed solution to this was to create new sources of social solidarity by...
You guessed it, giving capitalists almost complete control over every aspect of their
employees' lives.
Much as I hate to admit it, history did prove him right on that one.
I mean, we do all know how famously happy Amazon workers are.
Now, to be fair to Durkheim here, he did also believe that crime is a good way to change
society.
He figured that if a law is unjust, then the way to make people realize that is by breaking
it.
Crime implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes, but that in certain
cases it directly prepares these changes.
Where crime exists, collective sentiments are sufficiently flexible to take on a new form,
and crime sometimes helps to determine the form they will take.
It would never have been possible to establish the freedom of thought we now enjoy if the
regulations prohibiting it had not been violated before being solemnly abrogated.
At that time, however, the violation was a crime, since it was an offense against sentiments
still very keen in the average conscience.
Now, while I do think it's reasonable to read that quote as Durkheim supporting the
use of civil disobedience to fight injustice woke King that he was, Durkheim was actually
pre-racist towards indigenous people in Australia, so maybe not that woke.
But most functionalists are definitely not coming away from reading Durkheim ready to
go dumpster diving for food not bombs.
The functionalist perspective is inherently interested in maintaining the order of society,
not in changing it.
If you want to do that, well then mask up comrades, let's talk about conflict theory.
So Air Canada gal literally follows the trail of blood and it leads her to her worst fear.
Uh oh.
She finds the love of her life, dolphin girl's lifeless body.
She was lying on the floor dehydrated and clutching a stab wound as if she had broken
free from her bonds and made it all the way down the hall where she finally collapsed and
died.
So she was actually able to escape from the rope and make it down the hall before dying?
Right, that's what I just said.
The conflict theory of sociology kind of came as a response to functionalism.
While functionalists view history as periods of stability punctuated by brief moments of
unrest, conflict theorists see the exact opposite.
And while functionalists believe that if you want to understand something, you need
to ask what it does for society.
Conflict theorists say that if you want to understand something, you got to ask who's
getting fucked over.
For example, two years ago up here in Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, also known
as the Mounties, the RCMP, or horse pigs, were planning to use live ammo on the Wetsu
Wetten people who were defending their land from being illegally stolen and destroyed
to make an oil pipeline.
However, now that commercial fishermen are illegally preventing the MiCMAC people from
fishing on their land through threats, intimidation, assault, destruction of property, and arson,
the RCMP have now said that, ooh, sorry, that's actually not a police issue.
I'm just kidding there.
They didn't say sorry.
Now while for me personally, I'm not a huge fan of the police existing, I have always
pictured police abolition as sort of a slow process where more and more of the police's
responsibilities would be placed into the hands of different organizations and members
of the local communities.
Call me a lib, but I certainly wasn't thinking that fucking arson investigations would be
first on the shopping block.
Regardless, I don't know how you could really argue that that makes sense as an expression
of any collective conscience.
Like the only coherent sentiment that you could glean from that would just be that
genocide is good, actually, but Durkheim was actually pretty racist towards indigenous
people in Australia, so actually, yeah, that does check out.
No, but I mean, even if you do think that that's an acceptable moral position, first
of all, eat shit.
And secondly, I don't think that you can reasonably argue that vigilante justice is
an acceptable part of a stable society.
Going back to Joy Wiltenberg's paper on the history of true crime, oh yeah, that's what
this video is supposed to be about.
She makes an extremely interesting observation about the history of true crime and really
crime itself.
In the Western world, the modern concept of crime draws on older conceptions of sin,
but focuses expressly on acts that are forbidden and punishable by human authority.
As a violation of public order, crime came to new prominence with the emergence of increasingly
effective states and judicial systems in the later Middle Ages.
Of course, violent acts like those featured in sensationalist accounts were also committed
in the early Middle Ages and became the subject of discourse, although not in the forms later
taken by sensationalism.
Medieval chronicles record acts of mayhem and murder committed by noblemen and rulers
against each other.
Unlike the events recounted in later sensationalism, these violent clashes lacked an ordering
authority to seal their significance and focus the action on a single miscreant and
his punishment.
Essentially, the very concept of crime is contingent on the enforcement of state power,
not like whatever society agrees to vibe with.
In fact, the collective conscience can and very often is shaped by the media and the
state who move the Overton window to wherever is most convenient to serve their interests.
And by the way, don't get me wrong here, it definitely doesn't mean that you support
genocide if you're interested in Durkheim's theories or anything.
Folks, please do not harass Emil Durkheim.
I shouldn't have to say this because he died over 100 years ago, but do not start swarming
his replies or sending him threatening messages if for no other reason than because it reflects
badly on me.
But seriously, like asking what does X do for society is a very interesting and useful
line of questioning as I hope I've demonstrated by asking that about true crime in this video.
We do, after all, live in a society.
It's just important to remember that very often things are the way they are not because
they're natural or agreed upon, but because people with power wanted them that way.
When the police arrived, all eyes were on Air Canada gal.
She was the one who allegedly found the body and yet there were no signs of forced entry.
What what?
Big red flag for me there.
Yeah, and the police noted that she was a little bit too forthcoming with information
which they found suspicious.
Is it possible the nature of their relationship was also an issue?
Like an airplane and a dolphin?
Both women?
There's a little cray cray.
Yeah, so police call that type of thing intuition and while not officially it likely did play
a role.
So they arrested Air Canada gal?
Yes, she was thankfully arrested and charged with the murder of Dolphin girl which now
means that her dolphin family can rest easy knowing their daughter's killer is safely
behind bars.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
They're in the water, they're in the water, they're in the water, they're in high
The ocean feeds, the dead beneath, can you feel them float up from the deep?
What can you do? Where are your friends now? Where's your head now? Yeah
You'll feel them under you, the black billow calls, and they are here now, yeah
You'll feel them under you, the black billow calls, and they are here now, yeah
Thanks for watching!
