Hey everyone, in this video we're going to talk about porn.
Well, actually no, not really. This isn't a video about porn. This is a video about bringing people
together even when we have to stay apart, about getting the job done and what we do when we're
done at our jobs, about innovation and staying true to our roots. That's right,
this is a video about the sexiest topic of all, big data and monopolistic web companies.
Now, I'm just going to say this off the top that while this video will be fairly critical of
aspects of the porn industry, I'm just going to take it as a given that there's absolutely nothing
wrong with making porn or doing any type of sex work in and of itself. This is a no-swerve zone,
baby, so get out of here. For anyone who doesn't know, swerve stands for sex work exclusionary
radical feminist. It's a play on the term turf, which stands for bigotry. Also, there are some
people who will say that turf is a slur, which I find so funny because I always assumed that they
picked that name, right? Like, trans exclusionary radical feminist is already so much nicer than
what I would have named them. That'd be like if I told everyone to start calling me cool smart guy
who fucks and then people started saying stuff like, yo, cool smart guy who fucks is a sack of
shit. And then I just started saying calling me cool smart guy who fucks is literally violence.
Anyway, this is the last thing I'll say about this, but there's this really messed up thing I've
noticed where people, often ones who would not consider themselves swerves, will consume the
products of sex work while simultaneously denigrating the people responsible for making them come.
And like, not in the hot way. If you find that you are one of those people, I think you really need
to do some soul searching, do some research, and reevaluate your views. Or else, at the very least,
you should stop watching porn and simply go fuck yourself. There are lots of great videos
specifically focused on debunking swerve talking points, some of which will be linked in the description,
but that's not what I'm doing in this video. I put that debunking life behind me.
One of the problems in porn is that it's very rarely taken seriously by people in power. And
when it is, it's pretty much always just as like a freedom of speech issue. It's very rare to see
it be addressed as a labor issue, as an artistic issue, or as a technology issue. And that's exactly
what I hope to do in this video. I should also add the caveat that I'm not a sex worker. And while
I did talk to a bunch while I was working on this video, I am an outsider who's coming in acting
like I'm some kind of expert to talk about a group of people who are shit on by society. You
know, standard straight white guy stuff. It's kind of our thing. It's what we do best. It honestly
is part of our culture. And frankly, anyone who tells us not to is basically a fascist. But as
we'll see, non-sex workers talking about sex work tend to get things wrong a lot. I've been working
pretty hard to minimize my fuck ups here, but if this is your first time learning about any
of the things I'm going to cover, please just consider this video to be at best a jumping
off point for you to then go and learn more. I should also point out the fact that I'm
uploading this video to probably the sketchiest tube site of all, YouTube. I'll be addressing this
a bit more later, but for now, let's just not be under any illusions. Almost all of the bad
things I'm going to talk about are just as bad if not way worse on YouTube. Anyway, I think that's
all the disclaimers out of the way. The swarps are all gone. Everyone's going to be cool. Now,
on to the fun part, starting with a brief history of corn on the internet.
Get it? Because this is what it looked like when people had to download corn on dial up.
Corn has always been on the cutting edge of technology. VHS versus Betamax,
Laserdisc versus DVD, HD DVD versus Blu-ray. Corn picked the winner in all of those.
The first online purchase with a credit card was to buy corn, and so not surprisingly,
sex workers were among the first posters on the early internet. One thing that I think is really
cool is that in the early internet, corn would be on these small sites that were usually completely
run by the performers. As the internet moved from web wheels to search engines and sites became
more complicated, fuck you CSS, corn sites changed. One interesting thing here is that while niche
and fetish porn had obviously existed before this, the rise of search engines meant that
porn needed to be labeled with keywords, which is what led to the development of more distinct
genres. As hard as it may be to imagine now, there was a time when if you wanted to see
My Little Pony fin dom breath play, and to be honest, who doesn't, you had to track down
a specific website that would be just that. But also, sites became bigger and harder to manage
by individual people, and so you would get online companies. These gave rise to aggregator sites,
which starting out were just hosting pirated content. These came to be known as tube sites
since they were modeled after, and in some cases just straight up copy pasted the code from YouTube.
Which, you know, points for consistency. I mean, if all the content is pirated, why would you
expect them to write their own source code? One way that porn was actually behind the times was
that the digital disruption of the 2000s took longer to hit porn than other types of media.
While CD sales fell apart in the early 2000s, porn was actually able to hold on to the traditional
mom and pop selling DVDs behind a beaded curtain distribution system until nearly the end of the
decade. Inevitably, though, around 2008, DVD sales crashed and tube sites took over. Now,
when I say tube sites, there's actually only one company that really runs things.
MindGeek is not only how Chris Angel addresses nerds, but also the name of the biggest streaming
company that you've probably never heard of. MindGeek owns an ever-growing list of the biggest
porn sites and production companies. At Time of Recording, MindGeek owns
Pornhub, RedTube, U-Porn, Tube8, Brazzers, X-Tubes, Spankwire, ExtremeTube, KeysMovies,
PornMD, Thumbzilla, RealityKings, MajorityHobby, TransAngel, SeanCody, Men.com, Digital Playground,
MoFos, Babes, GayTube, Twisties, Peepers, SexTube, PornIQ, Webcams.com, BDSM.XXX, Casting.XXX,
Chetch.XXX, DameJones.com, FakeAgent.com, FakeTaxi.com, Lesbia.com, MassageRooms.com,
Mature.XXX, Tubes.XXX, Orgasms.XXX, PublicAgent.com, PublicSex.XXX, Teen.XXXX,
and Mom.XXXX. I mean, say what you will about them, you can't deny they're a family company.
Now, I'm not going to call MindGeek a monopoly, but there are absolutely no other single companies
that own as large a chunk of the industry as they do. And like, they do some monopolistic shit.
Basically, MindGeek is a monopoly in the same way that I can grow a great mustache.
Like, there's some gaps in here, but you can tell what the end goal here is.
MindGeek's inner workings are extremely opaque. If you go to their website, it looks like this
and just says that they're a technology company. This is so weird to me because MindGeek
is the porn industry. Nothing I've said here is in any way a secret. Why is their site like this?
Did the owners just not tell their wives that they make porn and then hastily cobbled together
this site as an alibi? As best as I can tell, MindGeek's business model is essentially as follows.
When any of the many large production companies MindGeek owns shoots a video, first a script is
written by MindGeek's in-house team of writers, which basically consists of like a dozen burnt
out comedians in Montreal. By the way, don't let the fact that most of MindGeek's staff and
offices are in Montreal fool you into thinking that they're a Canadian company. They are a
Luxembourgian... Luxembourgish? Luxembourgian? I think that's right, but it sounds wrong.
Anyway, the point is that they're technically from Luxembourg because that lets them avoid paying
taxes. The script is then sent to the director who is subcontracted by the studio and is also,
just like the rest of the cast and crew, non-union and paid a flat rate, no overtime, no residuals.
Once made, the video is then posted either to be streamed behind a paywall or sold as a clip.
Either a shorter version of the video or just a full video that's old enough to no longer be
lucrative will then be posted for free. The free content then is basically just used as advertising.
Individual performers can then also, depending on the tube site, set up their own premium accounts
such as Pornhub VIP. Pornhub will also actively funnel viewers towards the accounts of performers
they watch, and also pays out a hell of a lot better than any comparable tube site, including
YouTube. As for how MindGeek makes the money, well, they obviously make the money from all the
premium content made by the production companies they own, and then there's just some good old
fashioned ads and copious amounts of data that they harvest from everyone who uses their sites.
Surprisingly, it's actually pretty difficult to find out what MindGeek does with all the
information they collect. Weird, huh? Real, uh, real alas, more a set moment, you know? Probably fine,
though, right? I mean, actually they almost certainly just use it to curate what type of content
you'll see on their sites, as well as to feed you targeted ads and or sell it to someone else who
feeds you targeted ads. It's basically the exact same business model as probably all the sites that
you spend your time on, including this one. Although, while MindGeek is absolutely in no way unique
for doing this, they are kind of unique, at least among streaming sites, just in how good they are
at it. Once again, leading the way in technology, tube sites gather data on everything you do and
everything you watch. These sites know things about your sexual preferences that you don't even know.
MindGeek has data on what clothes you think are hottest, what positions turn you on, and even
what furniture layouts make you nut the hardest. The other really weird thing that makes MindGeek,
or at least their most public-facing site, Pornhub unique, is how they like to show off your, I'm
sorry, their data. Pornhub runs a page called Pornhub Insights, where they post quick-baity
articles about how people are looking up all sorts of epic and random stuff, like fidget spinner porn.
And like, I'm not saying that them posting that stuff is evil or anything, at least not
any more evil than any of the other websites that use this exact same business model. But like,
isn't it weird that it's just seen as like, funny and cool when Pornhub publishes data on how
much porn people have been watching since the start of the pandemic? If Facebook published the
data on how often people creeped their exes' profiles since March, I don't think we would
all just be cool with that, right? The other interesting thing here is that while Pornhub
Insights get lots of press, they're never independently verified. I mean, it makes sense
that MindGeek is so protective of their raw data, since that is one of their most valuable assets,
but maybe we should be expecting news outlets to apply a bit more scrutiny rather than just
uncritically reporting whatever Pornhub says. Like, who does MindGeek think they are? The police?
And I'm not saying that the data is fake or anything, but Pornhub Insights is absolutely a PR
campaign, so it might not be great that very often they're the only source that's used in a lot of
pop psychology surrounding porn. The Insights Pornhub publishes are manicured to be funny or
happily report that people are more sexually liberated than ever, and I'm absolutely not
saying that either of those are bad things, but you'll never see any Insights published about
how many people watch the racist or transphobic videos that MindGeek hosts on all of their sites.
But the big issue with MindGeek is their hosting of pirated content. Like I said,
this is how TubeSites started out. Imagine if Spotify started as Napster, but also still was
Napster. And this is an important part of how they were able to take over the industry. Not
saying that this is a conspiracy or anything, but when Manwin, the company that would waiter
become MindGeek, was first negotiating with porn producers who might not have wanted to accept
whatever offer they were making, Manwin could, since they still host pirated content, basically
say to them, look, your stuff's gonna wind up on our site either way. If you take our deal,
at least you'll make something off of it. Again, I'm not trying to put any conspiracy theories
out. I don't believe that that was a literal conversation that anyone at Manwin or MindGeek
ever had with anyone, but that dynamic is absolutely why MindGeek was able to dominate
the industry. This, of course, isn't an issue anymore, though, since MindGeek bought most of
the major porn production companies. I'm just gonna take a big sip of coffee while I look up
the definition of a vertical monopoly. It's actually really hard to find the definition
of a vertical monopoly. Now, real quick, first of all, I definitely don't think that all piracy
is necessarily bad, since I'm definitely not a fan of intellectual property being a thing that exists,
but I'm even less a fan of artists not being compensated for the work that they do.
Secondly, to be fair, MindGeek has made efforts to deal with piracy, and with the
amount of videos that get uploaded daily, it is inevitable that some pirated stuff will get through.
They've actually gone further than basically any other platform by developing their own
fingerprinting technology that allows creators to, like, register their videos across all of
MindGeek's sites. However, if you want to use that technology to proactively prevent people from
uploading your videos to any of MindGeek's sites, you have to upload that video yourself,
which is a problem for any of the people who just don't want their content on MindGeek, period.
They do still take down videos for independent performers who aren't on the platform,
but the onus is on the performer to find the video and report it, which involves them
spending ridiculous amounts of time or likely hiring someone to comb through the web looking for
pirated videos, which is obviously not very doable for smaller performers who, you know,
just don't want their only fans' content to wind up on Pornhub. And while experiences with
this process differ from one performer to another, MindGeek has a real bad track record when it comes
to removing revenge porn or videos containing illegal acts. This is especially ridiculous,
since Pornhub claims to manually review every image or video that gets posted to their site,
which is just the most ridiculously obvious lie I've ever heard. In 2019, 19,000 videos were
uploaded daily to Pornhub. This is all to say that MindGeek is not totally evil and obviously not
totally good. Even with the very serious problems that they have, they have also done a lot to
raise the standards of working conditions in the industry, and I don't want to take that away from
them. Choo choo! All aboard the Nuance Express, next stop, fair and balanced critique.
So something else that's worth talking about here is how porn gets studied and reported on.
When I'm making these videos, I would say that one of the things I'm the most proud of in my work
is the amount of research I do. Pretty much all my videos are heavily researched through
academic sources and some good journalism. I've definitely been doing some of that in this video
too, but then I also started reaching out to people in the industry and quickly found out that
a lot of what academics and journalists write about porn is straight up wrong.
The reason being is that these people very rarely actually talk to real sex workers,
and so you see some really bad takes in these articles that are supposed to be from official
sources. For example, one thing I would see is in the few articles that actually talk about the
labor conditions of porn performers, they would frame it as low wages from tube sites forcing
performers to become escorts and that the solution was just for them to move over to only fans.
As one sex worker who asked for a main anonymous said,
Rates in the adult industry have been stagnant since the 90s or so,
which is related to tube sites but also to production companies not raising wages with
inflation. We also lack any kind of royalties like mainstream film actors, so we have to get
by on just that one-time payment. Porn performers definitely have to diversify using things like
camming or only fans or escorting, which creates a sort of gig economy. While we're here, I would
like to challenge the framing of forcing performers to turn to escorting. Escorting is labor like
any other and should be decriminalized, and I would never criticize someone for wanting to make
it an hour with a client what they would otherwise make in a day on set. I don't think stagnant wages
in porn force someone to be an escort. Any more than low wages at our Starbucks job might force
a woman to become an escort. Capitalism forces everyone to make decisions about what kind of
labor they do to survive. Escorting is often framed as the worst most denigrating labor,
and I want to challenge that. It's emotional labor, it's body work, it's sex work,
and of a lot of what makes it bad is criminalization and the threat of state violence.
So I guess one question would be like what do you think people get wrong when they're trying to study
sex work or the porn industry particularly or just more broadly? I mean like excluding just
like straight-up swurfs like what is it like when people are trying to come at it in good faith that
they'll get wrong? Good faith is a good question because most of the things that I see on sex work
or pornography in general are not academic studies. I'm not saying that those aren't going on but most
of what I see is the things that people are interested in which of course is the sensationalized
stuff whether it's you know the Netflix documentary Hot Girls Wanted that most of us has seen
or other things like that like any television show reality television show or expose on something
you know salacious they're going to try first to sell it because what is the documentary that
just sits on the cutting room floor it's absolutely nothing. So without salacious content you don't
have viewers and so often to find that salacious content you're going to whether it's as a journalist
or as a documentary maker you're going to be drawn to those stories that are more
not just interesting but fit you know that journalist's view already so you're compiling
information that's already you know making the dialogue you've have set out in your head real
and you can do that in both academics and journalists but the benefit of having you know
academic studies which doesn't happen very often is you hope that they have a greater sense of
objectivity you know what I mean not that that's entirely true but when you're basing most of your
information on the sex workers especially you know with the the things that we look at the most
which is television you're getting a very skewed view so I think that's a big part of the problem
the social stigma what people across the world have decided about us definitely drives what
they're interested in driving sales and then driving the content itself right I mean do you
think that there's anything that people could do who are trying to make like a good faith effort
like what is there any like guiding principles or like best practices that you would want to see more
of that's a tough one um just some small little things that I often find um I don't know if the
word is annoying or inaccurate I find a lot of the especially television type documentaries
they and I'm not sure why they do this if it's accessibility or its lack of knowledge but they
go after people or they've they've interviewed people who in most cases are there's no there's
only one harsh way to say this I guess irrelevant you know it would be like saying I am going to
do an expose on American basketball and never interviewing anyone who is ever relevant in
the sport like like if you're asking Kobe he'd be like who like those aren't the people you want
to interview I mean you want to interview people who are really playing the sport who have made a
career out of playing this board who are playing the sport at the highest level and who have the
actual information that you're trying to get I don't know if those people in foreign aren't
accessible to a lot of the journalists or if they don't have the story that the journalist was looking
for but it seems they're excuse me often going for um very uh you know like because porn is huge
right how to become a pornographer like you could right now jerk off under the table and
sell it on porn hub boom you're a pornographer but that doesn't mean the people who are doing this
grinding it out day in day out would know who you are right so are you relevant of course you have
an opinion but I I wish that more people who other performers who are just doing it as a career
would at least know the name of you know right that would be that would be my wish that they would
go after people who are really living the and doing the work they're trying to get information out of
um the biggest mistake obviously I is people going to people who aren't sex workers about sex
worker shit because you can find all types of fucking dumb shit articles all over the internet
about like just just untrue things like complete like false uh narratives that people create just
because they they think sex work is an easy target or porn's an easy target um so you know I I would
like I would say to anyone who wants to do anything like this is do exactly what you're doing
and you know talk to talk to actual like working performers and like working sex workers um
you know to to to see the state of the industry of the sex industry in general that's that's how
you that's how you get here usually it's a lack of when people are uneducated on things they rely
on stereotypes so a lot of stereotypes that have been provided provided by the media and
Hollywood and stuff like that are not very empowering about sex workers and until you
actually speak to sex workers start reading books that were written by sex workers I think you don't
really understand the nuances that go on and the fact that there is a huge difference between
someone consensually doing sex work and someone being coerced into doing it in any form including
financial coercion which is like the biggest problem that I have with it is that in the
capitalist society that we live in people are financially coerced into doing things that they
normally wouldn't be doing and I don't like that that is when people are put in situations I think
that harms harms their soul their happiness it doesn't lead them to living wholehearted fulfilling
lives when they are in a sexual situation and they are saying I would never do this if it wasn't
for the money more generally though the issue with a lot of articles that talk specifically about
mindgeek is that they tend to frame things in these very black and white terms whereas in reality
things are a bit more gray let me give you a bit of an analogy for a long time I lived and worked
in a neighborhood of Toronto called Kensington market for anyone who's never been this picture
should tell you everything you need to know about it Kensington market basically looks like if a
20th century European fishmonger and a tie-dyed shirt fell in love and formed a small nation state
together it's a place where crustpunks, rostas, and artsy hipster trash like me all live in harmony
Kensington market is also in the process of being brutally gentrified there's kind of this constant
struggle going on with Kensington where you know Starbucks or whatever will try and open a store
there and everyone will sign petitions and the community will get organized and we'll stop them
for now but I remember when I was working there I would always think how you know I certainly do
not want Kensington market to turn into a bunch of condos and rexalls like everything else in
Toronto but also if I was working at Starbucks I'd get a raise and dental and maybe the accountant
who keeps sexually harassing female staff members might get fired. Mind Geek is the Starbucks of
porn here you know there's lots and lots and lots to criticize them for but also I feel I could be a
bit dishonest if I didn't bring up the fact that most of the performers I talked to would
much rather be on a Mind Geek set than anywhere else. The like all the research I've done especially
if you're looking at like the academic and the journalistic stuff a narrative very quickly emerges
that portrays Mind Geek as this extremely evil monolithic monopoly. Yeah so I guess yeah like
my question would be is Mind Geek evil? Evil no I don't think a business entity at least you know
Americans we value capitalism right and I think a lot of industries for better or worse I think a
lot of people could argue on both ways have become monopolies whether it's Amazon or your local
cable company or a lot of other things so I think a lot of people would say that you know monopolies
might be bad for creativity monopolies might be bad for independent business owners you know and
they're not a genuine monopoly like a lot of other industries you know. I mean you know as far as the
question is is Mind Geek evil you know I don't really think that you know you have a situation
where like you know companies are good or evil. I do think that they've you know made some some
poor choices and choices that really didn't consider the impact on the adult industry and the impact
on production companies impact on performers and I do see them trying to kind of like make up for
that in some ways I think they're some very easy things that they can implement to protect studios
performers and just individuals especially when it comes to kind of like revenge porn you know
making sure that you know people who upload stuff are verified yeah so that like you know when you
know actions need to be taken they can be taken I think a lot of the issue is that so much stuff
that happens on a porn hub is done anonymously so it becomes really really hard to correct things
like when they go wrong and when they hurt people you know and I do think that they have definitely
you know put forth this trend that porn should be free and I firmly believe that you should
absolutely pay for your porn and try to buy it you know directly from the source as possible
from those performers who are making that content whenever you can I mean I think if you are smart
and you realize that you yourself are a brand you can utilize the mind geek websites and tube
sites to build your brand and get your message out there for whatever it is because a lot of
people are on there you can utilize it however you want but I think that only fans has changed
the landscape I don't think we need these giant porn production companies to like become big stars
anymore it's it's all up to us it's all up to us to be a responsible like individual and save up
our shit because we definitely don't have any 401ks you know originally our stuff was completely
stolen and then some of the more ethical tube sites were like oh this is fucked up we're gonna
play ball with the artists and some of them are still like fuck you we're gonna do anything we
want and happily steal all your stuff so yeah I'm just glad that at least some of them are like
you know what we're done fucked up we're gonna give you some of this money and some of them are like
stealing your stuff still and a lot of ways mind geek has been leading the charge in legitimizing
and improving conditions in the porn industry through things like the fingerprint technology
I mentioned earlier better pay a higher standard of quality on set and even things like consent
checklists that allow performers to check off what they are and aren't comfortable doing not to
mention their work to legitimize porn and sex work as a whole through things like the porn awards
and their big PR campaigns which we'll come back to but it is important to recognize that
legitimizing sex work is a very good thing one of the things that a lot of journalists have talked
about is how performers are afraid to come out and criticize mind geek for fear that they'll be
shadow banned or punished by the algorithm and while there absolutely have been several people
I've talked to who have remained off the record for fear that criticizing mind geek would hurt
their careers there have also been performers who I've talked to who don't want to criticize them
because they like mind geek mind geek is a pillar of the industry in a small business sex workers
are a marginalized group and the porn industry is like a little family we tend to look out for our
own especially with so many misconceptions running rampant I find that porn performers tend to tell
our stories as ones of empowerment since so many people prefer to paint us as victims the reality
of porn and of mind geek falls somewhere in between good or bad we defend them and point
out the good and porn because we know there will always be outsiders eager to point out the bad
often in an attempt to undermine us and our rights mind geek is an easy and to be fair very
justified monopoly to go after but I think that also when people cover them they do so in a way
that lets other things slide there are some way worse players in the industry like dog fart or
blacked who regularly put out incredibly racist videos although it is pretty easy to look good
if you're being compared to companies like that it'd be like I don't know imagine if Canada just
laughed off a bunch of human rights abuses because we're next door neighbors to a country that did
a lot of way worse shit with that said while mind geek may not make those types of videos
they certainly don't have any problem making money by hosting them on their sites likewise
while they may not mistreat their workers they don't have a huge problem with those who do
since they keep giving awards to Axel Braun a director who's notorious for abusing his cast
and crew because porn and sex work are so stigmatized a lot of the industry has been able to develop
without much critical oversight or at least not the good kinds of critical oversight the
porn industry is basically exactly how the film industry would have turned out if sag after had
never existed I haven't even had time to go into the treatment of crews on porn sets but
because of this lack of attention mind geek has been able to craft its own narrative and position
itself as this woke ethical vanguard and while I don't want to take anything away from the good
things that have been accomplished by people who work at mind geek I'm not holding my breath for
them to tackle issues like how wages have remained stagnant and porn for the past 30 years or them
implementing a much needed policy that would prevent non-verified users from uploading content
something which would massively curb the amount of pirated videos as well as revenge porn and
illegal acts things which also make mind geek money and this is all obviously because we're
talking about a massively profitable multinational corporation whose good deeds will never extend
to the point of actually hurting their bottom line ultimately porn corporate wokeness while
much sexier than regular corporate wokeness choke me girl boss it's ultimately never going to enact
real reforms I think this is a real problem moving forward as sex work becomes more normalized the
people at the front of that movement should not be your friendly neighborhood secretive
multinational conglomerate any more than they should be out of touch academics or journalists
nor for that matter should they be really cool and smart youtubers with a confusing occult aesthetic
the people we need to be hearing from are actual sex workers the stagnation of rates in the adult
industry and our lack of royalties are big concerns it would be great if we had some organized way to
people never talk about issues facing crew who are also non-union and lack labor protections
the public also focuses on female performers as victims so they neglect the needs of male performers
who can also be in coercive situations especially because they have fewer supplemental
income opportunities than we do I'd love to see more conversation about including
diverse voices in writing and direction since we live in a deeply white cis male dominated sphere
now this wouldn't be a weird in hell video if I didn't end pessimistically I think there's a lot
of misplaced optimism right now in the porn industry being disrupted by sites like only
fans and look I'm never going to be upset about sex workers securing the bag I just don't think
that bag is as secure as people might think I've seen a lot of like glowing accounts about how
only fans give sex workers all this freedom and control and allows them to be their own boss
and set their own schedule and it all just sounds exactly like how people talked about uber in 2012
in fact it's actually so much worse than that since making porn is actually a violation of
only fans terms of services the precarity of only fans was made very clear in september of the
endless timeless haze that is 2020 actress bellathorn joined only fans as what some would
accurately call a pr stunt and or cash grab she cleared a million dollars in subscriptions in one
day and then started selling what she claimed was a nude photo for $200 this allegedly became the
most purchased picture on the site and was also a scam and so when all the furious fans of adam
sandler and drew barry more movie blended realized that they weren't actually going to get to see
naked pictures of hillary they demanded refunds i'm gonna be honest i don't know anything about
bellathorn but i assume everyone who joined her only fans was just a massive blended head
only fans responded to this blended backlash by changing their payment policies to limit the
amount that creators could make and also changing their payment period from once a week to once a
month thousands of sex workers incomes were put in jeopardy overnight and this is just a small
taste of what could happen if say only fans decide they really want to be on the app store and so
they started enforcing their to s to comply with apple's ban on explicit contents this is all to
say that none of these platforms can ever be trusted to look out for the interests of creators
or workers also if you like this video please like comment subscribe hit the bell maybe become a
patron or just share the video my last video didn't do very well and i do not want to go back to
delivering for uber eats anyway to step back and talk about things a bit more broadly very little
of what i've talked about in this video is unique to sex work the transformation of the porn industry
has as usual reflected the direction our world is going in which happens to be stagnation and
precarity but if i can end this video on a bit of a happier note which is very off brand for me
if porn does predict the direction that our world is going in then maybe we can get a bit
of hope from the fact that the sex workers i talked to aren't resigning themselves to the
neoliberal gig economy hellscape so maybe we simps shouldn't either
hey please do not click off the video yet i look at my analytics i know that everyone
turns off the video as soon as the credits roll just want to say really quickly that if you took
anything away from this video please you can make a bit of a difference by buying your porn i know
a lot of my viewers as well as me personally will be fairly skeptical of the idea of individual
consumption habits having a massive impact with the absence of systemic change however buying
your porn can very much mean the difference between a sex worker being able to afford their
rent or not so please please if you took nothing else away from that consider supporting your local
sex worker and where better a place to start than all the wonderful people who were featured in this
video i'm not really sure what youtube is gonna let me put in my description but i'll link them
somehow probably their twitter or something but yeah please please go and support all the fine
people who you heard from in this video i know that the holiday season is a difficult time financially
for a lot of people but i can absolutely say that all these sex workers would absolutely appreciate
it not just because these times that we find ourselves in are trying in general but also
because we're just coming out of no nut november and i'm sure that their incomes were absolutely
devastated by that so really help them out there anyways this video would not be possible without
the help of my wonderful patrons so big thank you to all of them especially christopher tubs
