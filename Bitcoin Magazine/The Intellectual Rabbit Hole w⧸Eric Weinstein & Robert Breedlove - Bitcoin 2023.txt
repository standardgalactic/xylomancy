Hey, brother. Hey, man. Good to see you again. Good to see you again.
Feel like we do this all the time. Yeah. Last time was in Chicago, maybe?
Yes. Yeah. And rooftop in LA and lots of cool places. Love it.
So mine today,
as we, I guess it was yesterday that we met to talk about what we're going to
talk about. And one of the things you brought up that I found to be very
interesting was this idea that there have been three key white papers in the
past. Well, I guess it's 2008 that have really changed the world.
The first one's pretty obvious. It is the Bitcoin white paper. There you go.
But perhaps you have kind of some unique views on the Bitcoin white paper
before we get into the other two. Sure. So I think one of the things that for
me is having a background in mathematics and physics about the Bitcoin
white paper is if you think about Bitcoin is digital gold, what is gold?
Gold is actually mathematically a wave in a substrate called a vector bundle.
And the idea that you've solved the double spin problem
translates in physics to a conservation law, right? That the idea is that
something is destroyed here to be created over here and you don't have this
ability to in some sense increase it.
The issue is, is that all of these conservation laws come from symmetry
principles? So one thing I would challenge the community is that Satoshi
must have created a symmetry principle in order to create a conservation law.
And does it stop there? Is it possible to port all of the features of the
physical world into the digital layer as Satoshi did for this kind of
conserved way? You have a token and you may have a series, a wave of claims
against it from the private keys that are held. And in some sense, try to
think about gold and Bitcoin in a single framework where effectively you've
created some substrate and some wave for it to be digital gold. And I think
that there's a lot of unexplored territory here, but absolutely one of the
most brilliant things that's happened in our lifetime. Just forget the money
aspect. It's simply an incredible intellectual innovation in decentralized
computing that happens to work great as money or you guys wouldn't be here all
these years later with all the attacks against you. So, you know, go look a
vote all the honor to you. Thank you. Yeah, I like a description you've shared
before is like a bridge between the logical and the physical domain. And
that's pretty important for a society that's moving into the digital age
clearly. Yeah, if one advertisement I wrote an essay on Bitcoin when I
didn't buy it in 2010 called Go Virtual Young Man. And we were trying to get
prime brokerage and nobody would do prime brokerage for Bitcoin then so we
gave up on the project. Definitely one of the dumbest things I've ever done.
But you can see the hope that was inspired because that was the hope back
in 2010. Now, the second white paper is one you told me about titled Attention
is All You Need from 2017. I'd never heard of this, but apparently it was
instrumental in the AI revolution that we are perhaps moving into today. Can
you tell us a little bit about that white paper? It's hard. It's hard. And
but isn't it interesting that you're all talking about chat GPT and how
suddenly computers can seemingly do so much of what we thought was intrinsically
human. And yet, can I have an honest show of hands? How many of you have never
heard of Attention is All You Need? Just be honest. Isn't that remarkable that
we're not sharing what caused that explosion? You're sort of on the retail
end of this. And you know, we Jews have a horrible joke. Why did God create the
non-Jews? Well, somebody had to pay retail. We can't be in the re...
I can't believe I told that in a mixed audience. The thing is, I don't want any
of you thinking about this from a retail perspective, come to the wholesaler,
which is reading what changed in the architecture. So this has to do with
something called transformers. And there were certain kinds of neural networks
that were pretty inefficient and difficult to train. And Attention has
something to do. If you think about a very long sentence, there are different
regions of the sentence. How do those regions fit together? And how can you
sort of parallelize the training of this artificial mind? The Attention is All
You Need paper came up with a hyper-efficient way of making sure that
the different regions got the attention that they needed so that you didn't
have a trailing off of interest. And that new architecture started to show us
something which I think we haven't really digested, which is very disturbing. We
keep talking about AGI, artificial general intelligence. The idea is that we are
supposedly generally intelligent and the computers are not actually intelligent
because you can see all they're doing is some linear algebra followed by a
little bit of nonlinear function theory. So we know what they're doing. We can't
figure out why it looks like us exactly. In other words, we can't go into the
neural net and say, oh, well, this part of it is doing this and that is doing
that. Well, what's going on is it turns out that most of what we do is not very
intelligent. So we had a conceit about ourselves, that we're thinking all the
time, we're being creative all the time. And in fact, mostly you can finish each
other's, right? And so the whole idea is, thank you guys for that. I really
appreciate it. What's going on is that for the most part, we're just doing the
same thing we did yesterday. We have the same conversational patterns. And when
somebody says something new, we tend to call them a grifter. We tell them that
they're an attention hog or they're whoring for clicks, all of these things.
And mostly what we want to do is repetitive activity. And what this is
is doing is it's eating our lunch. It's correctly figured out that most of what
we do is not generally intelligent. It's just repetitive. And so when you train
your children in school, what you're really doing is putting them in the
crosshairs of artificial intelligence. Because a computer program spends its
time in two separate sections, loops and parts that only happen once. And if you
stop a computer program with a debugger, you'll almost always stop it in a loop.
That's where computers spend almost all their time in repetitive behavior. And so
excellence in what we do in school in general trains you to do something that
a computer will do better than you will. And so think very carefully about what
you want to train your children to do. Think about how much of your day is
actually spent in nonintelligence. And I met a guy backstage who had an idea
about putting Bitcoin in computer hardware so that when you needed to
recover the machinery at the end, there was something that paid for it. And it
gave you an incentive not to just throw it into the world as trash. And I said,
that's genius. And he said, oh, no, no, no, no. And I said, no, every act of
creation is a violent act, which is difficult to do. So think about what
portion of your day you're actually doing something that's never been done,
even if it feels minor to you. And take your own genius seriously because this
thing is going to eat your repetitive behavior that you thought was your
highest end product. But really what this paper did was allowed us to
parallelize things, make it much more efficient so that you didn't have to
have these dependencies. And then what we find is that every sentence that we
speak can be tokenized. And then it's just an input output machine where you
say, if this is the input, what has been the output? And then you let the thing
read some giant corpus of text. And so it turns out that that's pretty good to
fool us into thinking that we were intelligent all along. And the big
discovery is mostly we're not.
While we're on the topic of...
These are the nicest people on the internet.
Bitcoiners are the best.
Aren't there any Maxis out here?
Any Maxis?
While we're on the topic of artificial intelligence, if we could speculate on
the implications of this a bit, what does it mean when we move into a world
that all of the professional services that many people are providing today,
attorneys, accountants, etc., investment bankers, a lot of that appears it will
be eaten by this software, right? I think AIs are already passing the bar
exam, for example. What's left for humanity? Is that a net benefit or is
that a negative?
This is the most dangerous, great question.
What's happening is that capitalism and communism, you thought were rivals
and capitalism won and communism lost. But it's really like Thelma and Louise
going over the cliff. And the question is, who hit the ground first? It was
communism. Whatever's coming next isn't going to be capitalism or communism.
And we have to be thinking, as Adam Smith thought, as Hayek thought, as Mark
thought, about something new. And some of those things are not going to work.
But the key point is, always machinery and technology have chased humans into
higher value activities.
Well, the high value activities that may be left might be like human touch.
You don't want to go to a robot therapist. Maybe you do. Maybe robot
therapists are going to be better. But my point would be that this is enough to
break labor markets, for sure. And it's enough to break education. And it's
probably enough to break certain parts of capitalism. And so what I challenge
you guys to do is think about, if you weren't hamstrung into these old
paradigms, capitalism versus communism is an old issue. This thing changes
labor markets. And you and I have talked, if you have something technical that
you call market failure, that used to be a small slice of the pie, and then it
suddenly expands to become an enormous slice of the pie, you can't tax the
stuff that works in markets to pay for the small stuff that doesn't. So
whatever it is, we need your brains coming up with an entirely new economic
system. I don't know its name. But I think that you'll find, my wife has this
beautiful thing. She says, this is the golden age of AI complementarity, where
you engineer a prompt, the machine does something, you realize it's not exactly
what you want, you go re-engineer the prompt, and the two of you converge.
This is when humans and machines played chess together. That's a temporary
issue. Take the period of time where you have that and try to innovate
something so that we don't get crushed, because K versus L, capital versus
labor, is going to get very ambiguous very quickly. Interesting. Okay, the
third white paper, uh-oh, this one's interesting. I guess I should mention
Bitcoin White Paper published 2008. Attention is all you need published
2017. The third one is the project diffuse grant proposal. And this was
published in 2018. What is this third one all about, Mr. Weinstein? Oh, boy. Okay.
Raise your hand if you've absolutely never had COVID.
Most of you guys got taken out. I did. I did. Okay. We do not know whether
project diffuse run by a hippie charity called the EcoHealth Alliance
practicing something called One Health, um, has something to do with the
origin of COVID. Now, I'm not telling you that this white paper actually
caused all of you to get sick. I am telling you that it is an incredible
coincidence that a group active in Wuhan, China, talking about, uh, if you're
in cleavage sites in spike protein in bat coronaviruses was proposing
something that looks eerily like the coronavirus that was in your child's
lungs. There are 13 letters in my first and last name. Now, there are four
amino acids in the fur in cleavage site, each of which requires three
nucleotides to code for it in your DNA. That would be 12 letters to try to
imagine that with far less information than is in my name, we shut down
planet Earth. That is the issue of leverage. All three of these white
papers, Robert, are incredibly high leverage discoveries. And most people
cannot imagine a short paper completely transforming planet Earth. But that
fur in cleavage site is the secret to the virality of the COVID virus. The
spike protein is particularly, uh, important. And this tiny region of DNA
of, uh, nucleic acid coding was enough to make this thing, uh, spread like
wildfire. So even if this white paper was not the origin of COVID and even if
it came from a pangolin or a wet market or a civic cat or whatever, we now
know how little it takes to completely change everything. And if you think
about Bitcoin as programming, this is programming in a different language. Do
you speak Haskell? Do you speak Python? Do you speak nucleic acid? It takes
almost no change in nucleic acid. What's more, we've distributed this
platform, this Corona platform worldwide. I'm very focused on a
particular island in the South Atlantic called Saint Helena. I don't know if
anybody's been to Saint Helena, but if there was ever a gulch, you should
check out Saint Helena. It makes a perfect gulch. It was COVID free because
it had a very strong perimeter during this pandemic, but almost nothing
escaped. And one of the things that you guys don't understand, people say,
are you a Bitcoiner? And I say, well, you guys are a little communistic for me.
And you say, well, what do you mean we're communists? Well, you're willing to
share an atmosphere with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which I'm not.
And if you think about all of the way of privatizing property rights, your land
might be defensible, but your atmosphere is shared. We are all breathing
each other's air. And my concern is that this last one was not the Spanish
flu. It was not the super deadly pandemic like the plague that we could
have had. But it is a giant warning shot across your bow that you cannot get
confirmation as to whether or not the United States government was in some
ways active in a biological weapons convention workaround using the National
Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. If you took out the word
allergies, it would be the National Institute of Infectious Disease, and it
would be much clearer to you that it probably has something to do with the
rules and restrictions we placed on ourselves through the Geneva Convention
and through the Biological Weapons Convention. And you'll notice that
Anthony Fauci was in the same role for approximately the length of time that
J. Edgar Hoover was at FBI. I think one of the things that we're in danger of
finding out is the truth. We have a lot of very old people, and it's typically
thought that they're clinging to power because they're power crazy. And I want
to throw out a different possibility. The different possibility is that there are
a lot of secrets that are holed up inside of our government, and we yell at
people as conspiracy theorists and paranoid and lunatics like you all. But
not me. And it may be that there are a lot of secrets that are going to change
your entire conception of your country, your planet, your world, your safety,
and what threat your family is under. One of the reasons that I'm hopeful in
talking about these white papers we came to this is, I think it was a great
call on your part, is that a white paper can also be hope. A white paper can
change everything for the better. The ability to stop sharing an atmosphere
with Putin and Xi and various other people that I would prefer not to be
because we have three things we have to worry about. Radiation travels in the
atmosphere, pathogens travel in the atmosphere, and climate, even though we
lie about climate, we still have climate issues. Don't be fooled just because
we're lying about it, that climate's totally safe. In all of these cases,
what Yuan says is true. We need to make sure we're diversified, and the
communalism of your atmosphere and your oceans is a remnant of your
communistic tendencies. If you're willing to accept that, recognize that we may
need to spread out and have more spheres, and we have no idea how to do
this, because inside of our solar system, there are three rocks that are
sort of possible, the moon, Mars, and this beautiful planet of Earth. Chemical
rockets can only reach these. In order to get out of the solar system, you need
what? A change in physics, and you're not working on physics, and you're not
endowing physics departments, and I came with Avi Loeb last year to talk about
this. If you want to stop your communism, you're going to have to come up with a
large number of habitable spheres that do not share resources, because one
change in the current cleavage site proves how vulnerable we are. Is there
a white paper that changes physical law that stops us believing that we live
in space-time, which is merely a map and not the underlying territory? I don't
know, but if you guys are the big dogs, and I want to say this very clearly,
I'm here this year in part. It's smaller, we got kicked in the teeth, and it's
more intense because a lot of the froth got blown off, and we have a very strong
underlying core, so first of all, give yourselves a round of applause for
appearing here now. If you're going to be the big dogs, it's not enough to think
about personal freedom. You're going to have to start endowing things. One
thing Robert and I did is we went to the University of Chicago to Milton
Friedman's old seminar, and what would it mean for the Bitcoiners to start
endowing chairs of economics with some direct ability to direct the field? You
guys are giving up certain opportunities, which will allow your freedom-based
approach to change everything. So what about a white paper, for example, that
examines how a small capital outlay could fundamentally shift the entire
economics profession towards an understanding that we may need to move
away from fiat, and then we were talking about inflation earlier. I think
that's another white paper that's probably important that hasn't been
written exactly. Yes, yeah. A lot of great points there. First, I'd like to
say we're going to need a new word for this Weinstein brand of libertarianism
where we all get our own planet. That's taken private property to a whole new
level. So I really hope that comes to pass. Sounds crazy, but then again, so does
digital gold. Yes, indeed. Before inflation, should we talk about the discovery
of the neutron? Because part of what we're talking about here in these white
papers is you said the novel inventions or discoveries or proposals that
radically change the world by very high leverage points in time and an analogy
that you drew upon in our preparations for this was the discovery of the
neutron and how that led us into the nuclear age. And now, I mean, I guess we
could just look at AI as the most recent discovery or invention leading us into
a potentially unimaginable future. So, and then feel free to segue into
inflation whenever you like, but I like the discovery of the neutron story. So
we discovered the neutron in 1932. I think it was Chadwick, maybe it had been
proposed by Rutherford. And immediately, it sets off an intellectual chain
reaction. The neutron leads to a proposal of chain reactions by Lise
Meitner, chemist, incredible woman working, I think, in Germany. Enrico
Fermi at Chicago comes up with Chicago pile one first controlled nuclear
reaction. Oppenheimer takes the ball to the Trinity test. We drop two devices on
our enemy in World War Two, Japan, proving this in the field. And then
Teller and Ulam come up with the idea that the bomb that we drop in Japan is
only the detonator for the mega bomb, which takes the shockwave and refocuses
it and leads not to fission but to fusion. So within 20 years from 1932 to, I
think it's November of 52 with Ivy Mike, the first hydrogen bomb, we become
gods, whether we like it or not. We have the power and responsibility of gods.
Nobody has ever seen fusion on the surface of a planet before. And suddenly,
within living memory, we see something that only happens on the Sun,
happen in the Pacific. That's how fast things move when you have a deep
insight. And the idea that you're trapped here and that you think that you
will never get off this planet and do anything really significant within our
lifetimes is because you've grown up inside of a stagnation. Your entire
lives have basically been in a stagnation. This is not real life. All your
memories are in a bubble. And I don't know how to say this. What WTF happened
in 1971 is really what WTF happened in the early 70s. And it's not just the
gold standard, it's not just Bretton Woods. It was predicted by Derek DeSola
Price. It's a slowdown in the exponential increase in technology and
science. And as a result, we don't realize that between 1902 and 1952, that
50-year span is effectively 10,000 years. Things change so much. And this span
of 50 years, things have been highly stagnant, except for a tiny number of
areas, digital being one of them. So we do see things like Bitcoin. That seems
to be coming to an end. I've called this the Great Knapp. And more or less
since 1945 or 1952, we haven't seen early 20th century events on those scales
except for the disaster of Mao's great leap forward. So we have a wrong idea
about war, about our safety, about what's possible, about how fast things can
change. I will point out that there were people who saw action in the Civil War
who lived to see Ivy Mike, the first H bomb in the Pacific. So in some sense,
the Civil War was almost a nuclear holocaust. Think about it. It's hard
to conceive. With respect to inflation and the monetary supply, it's very
interesting that at the exact same moment there was a huge spike in M1,
there was also a change in the reporting requirements. So if you say, look at
this graph, every academic will pack up, pat themselves in the back and say,
oh, you don't realize there was a discontinuity in the time series. That
means nothing. Now think about this. That means any time I want to jack up M1,
all I have to do is change the reporting requirement and all the academics
will pat themselves in the back saying, oh, you can't use that series because
of a discontinuity. What's more, what's going to tell the impact of changing
the monetary supply? It's the BLS's computation of CPI. And you guys are
incentivized to think about, oh, the number was 7.2, 6.8, which is insane.
If I said that the temperature in the United States was 68 degrees or 68.25,
you'd say, what are you talking about? I want to see a map. It's a field concept.
Every meteor, I say field. I was talking to Sailor last night and he said it's
too complicated to say what it really is, which is an element of a group.
Inflation is a group element. He says, too complicated. I say, it's a field.
Well, that field is a concept that everybody who watches television
meteorology knows. They see maps, they see pressure systems, they see
temperatures, and we're all sitting around like absolute morons pretending
that this number means something. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
claims to have moved to a cost of living standard, which is hysterical.
That's a very technical concept. It means that you know the tastes of somebody,
how much they prefer coffee to tea. And so if they can shift their preferences,
you don't need to pay them as much in a cost of living adjustment because
they are going to shift what they buy. If you're indifferent between beer and
wine and the price of wine goes up because of grape harvest, you just buy
beer. We don't have to pay you more money. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does
not maintain taste data. This is a giant catastrophic lie that is so big
within the economics profession. It's like labor shortages. You've probably
read about the labor shortages in technology. There are no labor shortages
in market economies because supply and demand adjust. I have a Bugatti
shortage. Why? Because I don't feel like paying for a Bugatti, right? So my
point to you all is you're living with absolutely transparent institutional
lies, but you're participating in the game every time you try to guess the
CPI release. And so what you're seeing is you're going to have to take over
this conversation. You're going to have to say, look, we don't exactly know
what you did because you screwed up the time series, but that was the wrong
moment to change the reporting requirements. If you're going to say
cost of living, where's the taste data? It's called a Conus Las Pairs
Index. Get technical, get informed, endow some chairs and realize that these
white papers have been very frightening in some cases and very liberating.
You're here because of a white paper. And the thing is, is that we've got to
stop pretending that Bitcoin is perfect. We have to realize that it's up to us to
continue to innovate, to build not only on top of it with things like
lightning, but to actually think about what is this technology? How do we use
the wealth that is generated? Not only for personal freedom, but also for
societal freedom. And I want to say one thing about this. Oh, thanks. You guys
are the best. They don't know how powerful this technology is or the violence, the
threat of violence against you would be much greater. If you want Bitcoin to
survive, the problem isn't with Bitcoin. The problem is that you're
vulnerable to threats of violence. And so if you're not going to cough up your
keys with a gun to your head, that's fine. But very few people are willing to
make that trade off. This is the time to figure out how to infect the system in
a positive way. Instead of viewing them as the enemy, think about mitochondria
inside your cell. If that's a captured bacteria, try to imagine it as an
infection. If you tried to pull the mitochondria out of your cells, you'd
take away your ability to produce ATP through ATP synthase. In other words, the
infection is absolutely essential to life itself. Now is the time to try to
infect the system with something positive rather than treating it as the
enemy so that when it comes with violence to try to shut you down for
holding this instrument, it finds that it can't because it's actually
dependent upon you. So that's my hope for this crypto winter is that when you
appear to be weak, when they write articles about how your conference is
shrunk, when they try to make fun of you, have fun getting poor, right? Don't
listen. Take the winter, take the opportunity, run like mad, and try to
infect the system in a positive way rather than viewing them as the enemy
so that they come to thank you later for the infection just the way your cells
think it's mitochondria for making life possible.
Eric Weinstein, Robert Breedlove, thank you for always inspiring us
Bitcoiners to hire in greater action. It's not enough just to stack sats and
sit and wait. We have to take action. So thank you. Let's try to make it happen.
All right, brother.
Thank you.
Bitcoiners, welcome back to Bitcoin 2023. This is the Bitcoin magazine live
desk sponsored by Marathon. I am joined by my esteemed co-panelist. At the end,
Ben Asgrin, the mixed martial artist, Chris Cyborg, the grand slam champion,
and then Kenny Florian, former UFC broadcaster. We just listened to Eric
Weinstein and Robert Breedlove give a very big brain gigachat talk.
Definitely something I need to watch a few more times. But in the beginning,
Eric was talking about what's going to hit the ground first, capitalism or
communism. And he said communism obviously hit first. Capitalism is almost
there. And he's a little worried about what's next to come. Is a Bitcoin
standard the next thing to come? I'll kick it over to you, Ben.
Well, I don't see why capitalism and a Bitcoin standard can't coexist. And
one of the things that we think of capitalism is, you know, I was thinking
about this a lot reading Alex Gladstein's book about the IMF. Capitalism
doesn't really exist in its truest form, right? Because the IMF gives a loan
to a poor country in exchange for that country, then hiring some firms, right?
Those firms aren't picking the ones they want to pick. They're picking the
ones they're forced to pick, right? So it's not true capitalism. So I don't
see why a Bitcoin standard and capitalism can't coexist.
Yeah, we definitely have crony capitalism right now. So Eric was calling
Bitcoiners too communistic for me. He said, because we share the same air as
the CCP and basically said we all need our own planets. Chris, what are your
thoughts? Is Bitcoin a communist thing or is Bitcoin a good thing? I'd love
your thoughts, Chris. I believe Bitcoin is a good thing. I believe it's a
freedom for the people and and limitates. I really, I really enjoy having
the Bitcoin. Definitely. It's not enough for a person to think of personal
freedom, but to endow rulers is something that Eric was saying. He said,
but Bitcoin is rules without rulers. Kenny, I'd love your thoughts on basically
Eric's ideology trying to force us to implement rulers. What are your thoughts
on that? He wants to implement rulers over Bitcoin or? Yeah, he was saying
basically that he was like, it's not enough to just like Bitcoin to be on
its own. He's like, this is your opportunity to strike and basically to
implement, I think finance ministers kind of what he was saying. When has it
ever gone wrong when humans get involved? You know, I think that's
brilliant. No, I strongly disagree with that. I mean, listen, we're in the
situation we're in because humans have screwed it all up. And I think that's
what makes Bitcoin so powerful, right? Is we do not have to rely on the
faults of humans to make poor mistakes, to be corrupted by the money itself. It
is ruled by math and and it's absolute and truthful. So yeah, I think this is
why Bitcoin is what it is. I think to inject human humans into the equation,
I think only make it more complicated and more screwed up. Yeah, definitely. He
also mentioned WTF happened in 1971. That is a great website. I recommend
people go checking it out beforehand. But he basically said from 1971 to
about 2020 or 2021. He said we've basically seen 10,000 years of growth.
But he says he believes the next 50 years are going to be more stagnant. But
those of us on a Bitcoin standard, I said this 50 years ago and the next is
going to be huge. Oh, well, yeah, yeah, I think that's what he's implying. But
basically, do you see being on a Bitcoin standard? We're seeing all this growth.
Yeah, maybe the conference has gone down in size, but we've seen a growth in the
network. Yeah, we've seen blocks still keep coming in. Ben, to you. Well, I
want to go back to the the endowing the chairs at economics universities. I
feel like Bitcoin is different and we don't need to play the old game and we
can play our own game. And I think a lot about like what they're doing in El
Salvador. Like that's a script flip. That was naive saying IMF get lost. We're
not playing your game. We're going to play a little bit of a different game. And
I don't see why we can't do that. Like why do we need old institutions to
validate our thoughts that we're having right now? Why can't we do it a little
bit of a different way? And that's still be valid. Yeah, definitely. He was
basically calling out a lot of the media companies that are publishing that
this event has shrunk and calling them have fun getting poor referring to
Bitcoiners. But he says take their criticism and grow the network and
propagate. And this is our time to build in the crypto winter as he called it.
Kenny, your thoughts on that. Yeah, I mean, listen, I think what it comes down
to is we need to build our own ecosystem, build our own thing and get people to
play our game. Kind of like what Ben said. And yeah, I think I think it's a
real possibility. I think that not only game theory will indicate that ultimately
they will do that. But I think people are throughout time are looking for the
best technology and whatever it is. And I think Bitcoin will ultimately prove
that it is the best technology. And I think there's still a lot of education
to happen on that. Definitely. We're about to go back to the Nakamoto stage.
Stick with us after this short break.
Thank you, Miami, for the last three years in this amazing city.
The whole world shut down. But Miami welcomed us with open arms. We want to
show Bitcoin to the whole world. We are taking the conference on the roads to
