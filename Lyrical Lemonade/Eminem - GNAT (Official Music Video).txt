They say these bars are like COVID, you get them right off the bat,
Tracked up with SARS and Corona, like you took a bite off of that,
Then it goes from Martian to Human, that's how the virus attacks,
They come at me with machine guns, trying to bite off a nap,
Still stacking my chiptoes, higher than Shaq on his tiptoes,
Topping higher, state building this shit is like childs, play children,
I will not annihilate, kill them, I fuck around in pile,
8 million dead little juveniles, wait children, I'll await my trial, they tilt in,
Ain't nothing you say could ever trump, Mike Pence will get killed,
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencing the vice president chill,
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill,
That's why I hint when I write in, so put the mic in, Pence will get killed,
And I'm still rider, died for the squad,
So you know which side that I'm on, if the battle lines ever drawn,
But if I get involved, it'll be like canines in a bra,
But not similar to Mike, pick it off, cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight,
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog,
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled in Mike,
And the palms like claws like a swing right for your jaw,
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw, bitch you still on my dick or nah,
If I suck, your wife is a straw, I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth,
Next time that I cough, I see these bars are like COVID,
You get them right off the bat, drink it with SARS and Corona,
Like you took a bite off of that, then it goes from Martian to Human,
That's how the virus attacks, they come at me with machine guns,
Like trying to fight up a nap, yeah, yeah,
NDA got that dopey sense to me, it's like pneumonia symptoms,
They're contracting COVID instantly, which is what separates my flow from there,
So let no one get's even close to this deposer risk to me,
So vocalistically, that's social distancing, yeah,
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped with that life song,
And get way back with that pine song and that Ajax,
Cause this dry car is just like football umpires calling a playback,
Bitch back the fuck up like 15 yards, these rhymes call for a face mask,
Another 14 day quarantine, they're coordinating off everything,
This shit looking like a horror scene, like me metaphorically,
The Zim stay at home order seem like they just keep getting more extreme,
Who knows when this night Marilyn like Monroe,
Norma Jean, still got that heroin, lyrical drip with that morphine,
And that thorazine, cause I'm so fucking dope, and you're a fiend,
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed,
No some semblance of normalcy, but I might need that hydrochloroquine,
Cause I got that, the dark horse, I'm a nightmare,
Mom fed me Valium light air, thought that's why they called it a high chair,
I got a contact like I wear, wait a minute bitch let me lie here,
2029 site in my side mirror, every year you drop the ball like Times Square,
My hair trickle whenever I get an idea, now my name rings out like a SpongeBob,
My trip was a drop in the bucket, so that gunshot,
You just heard just now in that one spot, just came from the 9 mil that I just got,
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded,
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off, and I'm still totally inappropriate,
With an opiate groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy,
I'm hoping a little Cody and he'll give me Odie and whoa,
Everything is slow, I begin to floating, I know that I'm getting loaded,
The pen exploded, Hiroshima with the flows of utopia with the dope,
I'm an OG, I'm like the goat, here to get your goat,
Little bit of soda, you miss the salt, when I'm at the podium,
Bitch I throw holy camoli, I'm in a zone with the shit,
I'm on, get a modi, I'm in a camo, because nobody's even close,
Your petroleum, supertonium, your phony, I'm at the crib,
Bitch I hold, gotta rip the pole like voting,
With no clothing, stripped down to a tori, and here we go with the gloating,
I got my nose in the air like a bow wing,
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her,
So I took a little lick of a gala, I'm pinning dinner,
Then I hit it with the motherfucking ottoman and bitter,
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river,
But I'm probably gonna jump in the water with her with a wad of money,
Cause I got a lot of it, and when it come to dripping,
I be sobbing like a hundred mile an hour, never running out of either one of them,
I gotta get it, cause these bars are like COVID,
You get them right off the bat,
Like it was SARS and Corona,
Like you took a bite off of that,
That's how the virus attacks,
They come at me with machine guns,
Like trying to fight off a nap,
