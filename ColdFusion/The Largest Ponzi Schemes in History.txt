This video was brought to you by Raycon. Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
With all seen and read reports of Ponty scheme scandals getting exposed, the details always
talk about a significant number of people who have lost their savings in these schemes.
But even after investigations, arrests and sentences, new scammers will pop up and keep
doing the same thing over and over again. But what exactly is a Ponty scheme and what
are the signs to look out for and how can you protect yourself? And what are the biggest
Ponty schemes of all time? You might be surprised to find out that the US government might be
running the biggest Ponty scheme in history according to some economists. So stay tuned
until the end of the episode to learn about that one. Let's get into it.
So first of all, what is a Ponty scheme? A Ponty scheme is an investment fraud. The scheme
promises high and sometimes quick returns. But in reality, it's just paying off existing
investors with funds collected from new investors who have also been fooled, fooled by the promise
of a quick buck. Ponty schemes use money from their new investors to pay off old investors
while taking a cut for themselves. Since there is no money being earned by selling a product
or a service, Ponty schemes require a constant flow of new money to sustain. Not surprisingly,
after a time, it becomes increasingly harder to find new investors. And when that happens,
the scheme fails.
A Ponty scheme is not to be confused with a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme requires
recruitment to bring in more people to increase their returns. A Ponty scheme may or may not
need that. For example, a Ponty scheme would be something like BitConnect, a fake cryptocurrency
that promised huge returns from a mysterious AI trading algorithm. But in reality, it used
money from old investors to pay off new investors.
He says this scam, run through a crypto lending program called BitConnect, is believed to
have swindled thousands of people around the world out of more than $2 billion worth of
Bitcoin. Also, offering investors returns as high as 40% per month, but prosecutors
say BitConnect actually operated like a Ponzi scheme, using investor funds to repay other
BitConnect investors. A pyramid scheme, on the other hand, relies heavily on recruiting.
So something like Metabolife, where members would sell supplements and take a cut of the
sales of those who they recruited, forming a pyramid. Now, have you ever wondered why
an unusual word like Ponzi is associated with financial fraud? Its name is as such, because
it's named after a man named Charles Ponzi. So who was Charles Ponzi? Charles Ponzi was
a swindler, known for starting a scheme of this kind in 1920 in Boston. Charles Ponzi
was born in 1882 in Italy. As a young boy, he kept stealing from the church so much that
his family got sick of him and deported him to America in 1903. Charles worked in a restaurant
as a waiter, but continually shortchanged the customers, keeping the difference so he
was fired. In 1907, he moved to Canada and because of his skills with numbers, he got
employed at a bank. Here, he would force the signatures of clients and cash their checks.
He was caught and spent three years in prison. After his release, Charles went back to the
US and started up a scheme to smuggle Italian immigrants from Canada to the US. Again, he
was caught and jailed for two years. This time when he got out, he went to Boston and
in November of 1919, he came across the idea for his grand scheme. Supposedly, this was
achieved by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them
at face value in the US where the currency was much stronger. He promised clients a 50%
profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days. In 1907, an international postal
Congress had agreed to issue postal reply coupons throughout the world. The bearers
could redeem these international coupons for postage stamps in their local country. This
was to address a real problem. Immigrants who came to America could afford to buy stamps,
the relatives who stayed home could not. So this was a way to allow relatives back home
to write back to the family in America. If you went to a European post office with American
dollars and bought postal reply coupons and then brought them to this country and cashed
them in, you got US postage many times more valuable than the US money you spent for them.
Ponzi believed that for every dollar of postal reply coupons purchased, he could earn $5 when
he redeemed them for stamps. With a 400% profit from these initial purchases, Ponzi would buy
additional coupons and redeem them for even more money. It seemed to be a proposition that couldn't
lose. The only issue with this plan was that Ponzi would need to employ people to line up and
collect coupons and stamps, gather them up and ship them overseas. So this would probably cost
more than the money generated from the scheme itself. So Charles Ponzi decided to buy no
coupon stamps at all and just tell people that the scheme would make them rich. Double your
money in three months. America was booming in 1920, so people were all looking for a quick way
to get rich. Wild financial speculation was all the rage, so Ponzi fit right in. He was
charismatic and had a gift for talking, so everyone wanted a piece of the pie and word
quickly spread around. Some people would take out their life savings from a bank to invest with
Ponzi. But the thing was Ponzi would actually pay back investors as promised, so the whole thing
seemed legitimate and people went crazy. By March of 1920, investors had thrown in $400,000,
but Ponzi owed them $600,000 because of the promises of his scheme. Most people trusted him
so much that they kept their money in so they could earn even more. Because of this, Charles
could always make the payments when they came due. Two months later in May, investors had thrown
in $1.6 million. And by July, this had swelled to $41 million. But at this stage, Charles owed $55
million. And that was the problem. The more money Charles Ponzi received, the more in debt he was.
If he promised to double everyone's money, he would just be owing more and more. All of this
didn't matter though, as long as everyone didn't want their money out at once. Soon, Ponzi was
averaging $3.4 million a day. He bought himself a $7 million home with a heated pool and air
conditioning, absolutely unheard of in 1920. He bought the very same shipping firm when he smuggled
Italian immigrants just so he could fire his old boss. Just six months ago, he was broke,
but now he could have anything he wanted. Massive crowds were growing outside of Ponzi's office
and officials got suspicious. Police were called in to investigate, but after they talked to Charles
Ponzi, two of the three officers ended up investing. In fact, a quarter of Boston's police force
were investing with Charles Ponzi. On the 26th of July, a Boston newspaper ran the first critical
story of Ponzi. It's stated, if Ponzi could make 300% profit for his investors, why does he put his
money in the bank where it would only make him 2% or 3%? Why not just invest all the money with
himself? It was a good point. And another article stated that the numbers didn't add up. There would
have to be 160 million of these coupons circulating to amass such profits, but in reality, there's
only about 27,000 of these in the world. And there was also no reports of massive purchases of
coupons. When these news articles broke, there was a massive panic. A riot ensued at Ponzi's office.
27 million dollars were withdrawn in two days, but Ponzi could afford to pay everyone back,
and he did it with a smile while serving people coffee and donuts as they lined up. Nerves were
calmed and people actually reinvested. But it wouldn't last. Government regulators and more bad
press came Ponzi's way, the latter of which stated he was completely bankrupt. It started
another panic and a rush for people to get all of their money out. Over 200 million dollars had
been invested, but Ponzi was short 110 million dollars. Everyone tried to get their money out
at once, and he couldn't pay. By August of 1920, he was all over. Ponzi wasn't dieted on 86 counts
of fraud, and many investors lost everything. It was a massive lesson for them and us to never
just follow the crowd and always do your research before investing. Even though Charles Ponzi got
convicted and jailed for his deceit, it did not deter others from coming up with such schemes.
So why do people keep falling for it? Almost everyone wants to earn easy money and get rich. In
the real world, this usually means that you need to work hard for it, but it's a human tendency to
look for shortcuts. But taking shortcuts often leads to trouble, as is with the case with Ponzi
schemes. But it's not necessarily greed that attracts people towards them. Ponzi schemes are
designed in such a way that they appear legitimate. Investors may genuinely see it as a promising
avenue for investment. Later on in the episode, we'll take a look at some warning signs to watch
out for when deciding if an investment is a Ponzi scheme or not. The organisers of this kind of
fraud usually target those who have spare money or those who need money. Both are looking for quick
and high returns. Usually, the unemployed or those coming from a financially weak background fall
prey to these schemes. Essentially, it all boils down to how convincingly the Ponzi organiser can
fabricate a story, a story of quick and assured success, playing on the ambitions, dreams,
financial situation, and financial literacy of people. Emotions can often overthrow logic,
so people end up believing that they're being helped when they're actually being conned.
So let's take a look at five of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history.
Number one, the $593 million fraud by a Minister of Scientology, Reed Slatkin. Reed Slatkin would
start his scheme in 1986. He would get people, including some very high-profile names and many
other Scientologists, to invest in what was an unlicensed, quote, investment club. He would pay
out large sums of money to investors claiming that his investment were working. But again,
in reality, he was just doing that old method of using new investor funds to pay off the old
investors. He scammed around 800 investors for more than $593 million across 15 years before
being caught. He admitted to fraud in 2002 and was jailed for 14 years.
Number two, the $1.2 billion fraud by Scott Rothstein. Scott Rothstein started inviting
investors into his Ponzi scheme. He claimed to purchase highly confidential legal settlements
using his law firm. Rothstein's legal specialty is suing for sexual harassment,
a down-and-dirty game where defendants pay big money to settle lawsuits quickly and quietly.
Those are usually paid out over a long period of time. Rothstein used wealthy investors to pay
his clients upfront, promising the investors a big return on their money over time. In some
cases, it was a promise of more than 200 percent. I was shown what a confidential settlement agreement
looked like and it had all the information was blacked out. It had the name of the plaintiff,
the name of defendant was blacked out, the attorney was blacked out. Everyone was blacked out. He
wanted me to invest in something that couldn't be verified. I didn't even know if it was real.
In fact, I didn't even think it was real. The idea is a bonanza attracting big money players
like a modern-day gold rush. We three kings be stealing the gold. Scott ran with movie stars,
rock stars, kid rock, Pam Anderson, athletes, superstars, Dan Marino, Alonzo Morning, Sarah
Palin. There was pictures in his office of him shaking hands with Jeb Bush and George Bush.
From forging documents with judge's signatures to making corrupt law enforcement officers to
do his bidding, Scott often went to great lengths to sustain his fraud. People in the community
were always asking, how are they growing so fast? Where does that money come from? And I would always
say, I don't know, but not from the practice of law. We were offered 207 percent return and I
wanted to see how much money you need to invest to get rich. I calculated if you keep in $150,000
for 13 years, that $150,000 turns into $21 trillion. That's enough to pay off the entire
deficit of the United States and have more money beside. He started off with hundreds of
thousands of dollars. He had to return millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions,
so it had to collapse. There was no way to go forward. He ran out of funds to pay investors by
early 2009. He raised an extra $100 million investment, but that still wasn't enough to
keep the scheme afloat. When he knew his time was up, he fled to Morocco, but soon returned to the
U.S. and was arrested at that point. He pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 50 years in jail
in 2010. Number three, the $3.7 billion fraud by Tom Pettis. Businessman Thomas J. Pettis
was convicted of mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy for the operation
of a $3.7 billion Ponzi scheme. Thomas convinced investors that by putting money into his organization,
they would fund the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers
for a profit. However, no such investments were ever made. The funds were diverted for other
purposes, such as paying off those who helped organize the fraud and also financing Scott's
extravagant lifestyle. This is how Pettis was able to manage his scheme at PCI. First,
you need to ask yourself how to store such as Walmart, Costco, Best Buy, and other big-box
retailers sell merchandise so cheaply. One answer is found in a little-known industry
known as diverting or supply chain management. In today's market, many retailers do not like
to keep a large inventory. Instead, they buy products as they have a need to sell. This concept
is called just-in-time retailing. To keep their prices down, they reach out to a middleman.
Pettis was a master diverter. Here is how his program worked. First, he brought on board investors
to finance the deals. Their money was put in a lockbox account for safekeeping. The money was
then funneled through a business called Nationwide, where they would buy merchandise from closeouts
or stores going out of business in bulk for low prices. Eventually, they were able to buy
large lots of inventory directly from the manufacturer. Next, the merchandise was shipped
to a warehouse, where it was held until a deal could be made where it would be sold at a higher
price to a retailer. The retailers would still save money by not having to maintain such large
inventories. Ultimately, the money from the investment would go back to Nationwide, where
they would take their cut, and the investors' money would be put back into the lockbox,
where they would get their return on their investment. This was a very lucrative deal
for everyone involved. The problem was, at some point, Pettis stopped buying merchandise. The
warehouses were empty, and nothing was being sold. All the returns investors were making were coming
from the new investors, with Pettis taking a cut off the top for himself. The scam was reported to
the authorities by one of his co-conspirators in 2008, and he was arrested soon afterwards.
He was convicted in December of 2009 and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.
Number four, the $7 billion fraud by R. Allen Stanford. Allen Stanford was among the wealthiest
men in the US. He built the lavish lifestyle from banking and smooth talk, but his slick sales
pitch turned out to be a lie. Stanford ran one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history.
That isn't until his House of Cards collapsed. R. Allen Stanford, the chairman of Stanford
Financial Group, orchestrated a $7 billion fraud by selling certificates of deposits
via his company's offshore bank in Antigua. He cheated 30,000 investors from a few dozen
countries and pocketed some of the proceeds. He used the money to gamble in business ventures,
acquire dubious real estate deals, and even on cricket tournaments.
He got a little bit friendly with the players' wives and girlfriends.
We can see some pictures of this. The English players not particularly pleased. That's Matt
Pryor's wife sitting on his knee, and there was just a little bit of disquiet amongst the
England players when they saw the behavior of Sir Allen Stanford with their various wives and
girlfriends. The Daily Mail has picked up on this and has that very picture with the
England players' fury at Stanford's antics with the wags, turning into an ego-fueled
fuss, saying the players were gobsmacked. Is it fun being a billionaire? Well,
yes, I have to say it is fun being a billionaire, but it's hard work. But as they say,
behind every great fortune is a great crime. Certificates of deposit were Stanford's bread
and butter. They were like buying a savings bond, and customers thought they were insured.
Stanford became a catchphrase for safe. So what he did was he went out and sold
certificates of deposit to investors. They bought them, he would pay them interest,
and he paid the interest from the new investors. Banks are supposed to take certificate of
deposit money and put it in safe investments, getting a small return, which they then used
to pay their investors. Providing investors with a solid return on their investment.
Stanford didn't do that. He used new investors' money to pay the interest to the old investors.
In other words, a classic Ponzi scheme. So a classic, no real underlying investment that's
making money. And what he did in the meantime was take money out of the bank and spend it on his
lifestyle. Stanford promised approximately 3% higher returns than similar investments sold by
other banks. A profit that made Alan Stanford's certificates of deposit attractive to investors.
Stanford said he could promise those higher returns because his bank was run smarter
and more efficiently than other banks. Employees were not supposed to ask too many questions
about where the money was invested. People say, how in the world has this business of yours grown,
Alan? I say, well, simply because we do things differently, many times we do them the way they
used to do them 20 years ago. But at least one employee, Charles Haslett, did start asking questions.
In fact, every time I brought up anything of meetings, everybody was looking at it and looked
at me very shocked. But do you think people didn't ask questions because the money kept flowing?
Sure. I'm blind ignorant. Very fancy. I didn't see any substance. I talked to the manager of the bank.
He didn't seem to know a lot about banking in general.
On being arrested, Stanford denied all 14 allegations. In March 2011, he was convicted
on 13 of 14 counts and was sentenced to 11 years in prison. And a US judge called Alan
Stanford's operation one of the most egregious criminal frauds ever presented to a trial jury
in federal court. His arrest meant the end of almost two decades of illegal financial activity.
Number five, the $20 billion fraud by Bernie Madoff. Bernie Madoff was the organizer of the
largest realized Ponzi scheme in history. As former chairman of the Nasdaq stock market
and his squeaky clean image of an investment guru, he attracted several high profile clients
such as film director Steven Spielberg. But his fraudulent investments were exposed in 2008.
His Ponzi scheme wiped out people's fortunes and more than 15,400 claims were filed against him.
He became so hated that he had to wear a bulletproof vest to court. In March of 2009,
Madoff pled guilty to the charges and the courts stripped him and his wife of their wealth.
He was sentenced to jail for 150 years, where he passed away in April of 2021.
If you want to see the full story on Bernie Madoff, you can check out the Cold Fusion episode on him.
Okay, I said I'd say five, but here's a bonus one. Number six, the entire US Federal Reserve
system. According to some economists, the entire US Federal Reserve system is a Ponzi scheme.
Here's the oversimplified version. The United States has a huge national debt,
which is owed to foreign countries such as China and Japan. These countries and other investors
loan the US government money in exchange for a stable return. These debts are short term debts,
so the US government has to pay back these investors trillions yearly.
Currently, the United States can't pay because they don't produce and export enough goods to
support their spending. So, whenever the debt expires, the government either creates more money
through the Federal Reserve or borrows more money from new investors to pay off the old debt. In
essence, they're borrowing money from new investors to pay off the old investors, just like Bernie
Madoff. In fact, in jail, Bernie Madoff even said the US government is running the biggest Ponzi
scheme on earth, and he would know a Ponzi scheme if he sees one.
He's not the only one though. Michael Snyder wrote,
the Fed is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of the world, and if the American
people truly understood how it really works, they would be screaming for it to be abolished
immediately. And Michael Lombard stated, quote,
Right now, we are seeing the government hoping investors would keep reinvesting in US bonds
while the Fed picks up the slack. But what happens if they say, we want our money back,
it would make Madoff's Ponzi scheme look like a joke. So, you can take that for what you will.
So, in wrapping up, what are the signs to watch out for to avoid Ponzi schemes?
To avoid falling victim, people should always watch out for returns that seem too good to be
true. A promise of high returns with minimal risk is a sure red flag. Such investments
just don't exist. Usually, with high returns, you should see high risk.
Another red flag could be the consistency of returns. Investments are linked to market conditions,
and that should affect the returns that they bring. If a scheme promises consistent high returns
without being affected by market conditions, there's a good chance that it could be a Ponzi
scheme. As technology evolves, there's going to be new forms of the same old trick. Fake
cryptocurrencies are the new flavour for the decade so far, and the reason being is that
they're poorly understood by many. Very recently, some large YouTubers had taken part in a scam
called Save the Children coin. A coin which promised to help kids in need, but also was
promised to go up in value. The scheme promised to go to the moon. But in reality, it just crashed.
Those who had the knowledge that the whole thing was a scam, got out immediately with a bunch of
money, and everyone else lost everything. So be careful out there. If you're curious, I want to
see more on the Save the Children coin, the YouTube channel CoffeeZilla did a great series on it.
Before we continue, I just want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor,
