On this episode of Marketing Against the Green, we talked to Matt Wolf.
Matt has one of the biggest and best YouTube channels, all about AI, and so we had to talk
to Matt all about apps and tools.
We get into the biggest AI winners, the biggest AI losers, and who are going to be the biggest
AI apps in the future?
Where should you invest your money?
I'm Kieran Flanagan, the CMO at Zapier.
I'm here always with my co-host, Kip Bonner, the CMO at HubSpot.
Let's get into it.
Okay, Matt, it is great to have you on the show.
I've spent a lot of hours watching your YouTube channel, getting all of the latest news, getting
all of the latest apps, so we're really excited to have you on the show.
Yeah, thanks for having me.
I'm excited to nerd out and chat with you guys about this stuff.
We're excited to steal your brain for a minute.
Yeah.
I thought we could start with this, which is how did you start in the YouTube AI space?
How did you end up there?
What was the tipping point?
What were you doing before that?
Just give us a little bit of the context, the background.
Sure, yeah.
I've been doing digital marketing stuff since 2009.
I quit my day job, so to speak, back in 2009, and have been all in on content marketing
ever since.
My YouTube channel started in 2009.
I started blogging in 2009.
And then over the years, I was just testing all sorts of different things.
I had an online course around how to drive traffic.
I've had online courses around podcasting.
My first course that I ever sold was about how to build blogs.
So over the years, I was just testing different courses.
I got really good at affiliate marketing.
Most of my income over the last decade has actually come from affiliate revenue, from
promoting other products in my content.
So I've just been surfing around in the world of digital marketing and course creation and
just playing with whatever would work.
And I had a lot of good months and a lot of bad months where I didn't know how I was going
to pay the bills.
And it was just throwing stuff at the wall all the way up until 2022, when the AI stuff
started to pick up some steam.
So at the time, I had a top 1% podcast with my co-host Joe Fear called Hustle and Flowchart.
He's actually still running that podcast to this day.
But him and I were podcasting and interviewing other digital marketers and things like that.
And we started to have people come on and talk about some of these newer technologies that
were coming out.
You know, one of the first ones we came across was Jasper, which was like an AI copywriting
tool.
At the time, it was called Conversion AI and then it was called something that Marvel
sued him for or wanted to sue him for.
And then it eventually became Jasper.
So I learned about GPT-3 and we actually started making content about GPT-3 and Jasper and
some of these AI tools back in 2021, but nobody was really paying attention to AI back then.
Nobody really cared about it.
And then about mid 2022, I made a video on my YouTube channel about AI art and various
AI art generators.
And this was actually before mid journey came out.
I was talking about Dolly and some of the stable diffusion stuff that was available.
And that video started to do well.
It got a few thousand views and I went, oh, that's better than any of the other videos
I put out.
Maybe I'll do another video on AI.
So I did a video about how to train your own face into the AI using a tool called Dream
Boost.
So you can make AI images with your own likeness.
That video doubled my best video and had 15,000 views and I went, okay, I'm going to keep
going down this AI path.
And then the video that really took off was when Chat GPT was released, I made a video
around Chat GPT.
And then that one, I remember I made that video, I published it at like 10 p.m. on like a Tuesday
or something and then went to bed, woke up the next morning and that video had 60,000
views.
And I went, oh my God, this is the best video I've ever done and in 12 hours it got 60,000
views.
And that video actually went on to do over a million views over the course of the next
like two weeks.
And so that was sort of the pivot point where I went, I'm just going all in on AI.
Every video I make from here on out is going to be about the latest coolest AI tools.
I'm going to make tutorials, I'm going to talk about the news, I'm going to talk about
cool tools that I come across.
And so ever since about October of last year, every video I've released has just been about
the coolest AI stuff that I've built or come across or tutorials or things that I've learned
how to do and just shown it off.
And that's been the last, you know, 10 months of my life of just making that content.
In that same time, I also built a website called Future Tools because I was coming across
all these AI tools and I was struggling to sort of keep my head, like wrap my head around
all these tools.
I was putting them into an Excel spreadsheet, but it got to a point where the Excel spreadsheet
had 100 rows in it and I was kind of losing track of what did what.
So I literally built Future Tools as like a database for myself to kind of wrap my head
around what tools I've come across and what they do.
I shared that on Twitter, that got retweeted, it kind of went viral.
My Future Tools website blew up and now it gets over a million views per month.
And so it's just like the last 10 months have just been a roller coaster after over a decade
of just kind of trying different stuff and having little successes here and there.
And now all of a sudden this is, this is my life now.
That's the lesson for everybody watching, right?
This is the story time and time again, which is it takes years to build a quality of skills
that you can do something well and then find the right fit of topic and audience for yourself
to really break out.
And you know, I think Kieran, when you and I started this podcast, we were like, oh,
it's gonna take us three to five years to make this thing big, real, like everything
we want.
And I think that's the right timeline for anybody to consider.
And the reason most people fail is because they just don't do it long enough.
They don't get into it.
And the other thing they don't do is they don't do what you did, Matt, and pivot when
they get the aha moment.
Like you, you woke up to that video, you had your aha moment and you're like, all right,
I know what I'm doing now and I'm okay leaving that stuff behind and now I'm going in a new
direction.
I think that's a really interesting point.
Like Matt, was it the same YouTube channel you have since 2009?
So you're just grinding away and then pivoted to AI.
The other really important thing is, Matt, because you've been at this like 2009, you
mentioned affiliate, all of these things.
Did you ever hang out in the warrior form?
Back in the glorious, back in the day with the warrior form.
Yep.
Yep.
I actually, one of my first products I ever sold was a WSO in the warrior form.
That's where all the best people came from is the old school shady warrior form days.
Yep.
That's, that's where I originated back.
I was, I remember back in 2007, when I was still working in my day job, I was working
in a manufacturing plant whenever the boss wasn't looking, I was in the warrior form
reading various ways to make money online.
Let's go.
I was in there, getting my Frank Kearns, even page, all the copywriter stuff.
Also.
And so I think, yeah, but I think coming back to Kearns point, people have two
shorter time horizons on what success looks like and they give up before they ever
get started and like getting started is like a couple of years and that's where
they kind of like give up.
I've actually seen studies where you can actually see like a most podcasters,
most people who blog, they kind of give up at a certain point of time and they give
up ever before they've actually even figured out what their thing is, like what
their angle is, what their topic is, what their kind of like area of expertise is
going to be, where their niche is going to be.
And so it's like super cool.
Like you just kept kind of iterating, kept trying to figure out like, what was the
thing that was going to resonate with your audience?
And you got one signal and you went all in.
For sure.
Yeah.
I mean, my, my thing has always kind of been, I nerd out about cool tools, right?
So back in the early days, when I first started my YouTube channel, I was sharing
different WordPress plugins.
I had a WordPress site and I was like, Oh, check out this plug and it does this.
Check out this plug and it did this.
And then the first course that I ever sold was a course on WordPress.
And I was sharing various WordPress plugins.
So like the, the sort of common threads have always been, I love making content
and I love nerding out about cool tools.
It's just in 2022 when AI, all of these new tools started to flood the market.
It was kind of like, I found my home.
These are, these are the tools that like I'm excited about, but also the world
is getting excited about.
It's incredible how much money or what kind of business you can build around cool tools.
Like I remember back in the day when I was like really leaning into search, this
guy was just obsessed by like Apple, Apple products, like MacBooks in particular.
And just built this entire business, search business at the time, like AdSense
was like the cool thing to try to big money through and just own like every
search term you could actually own through like all of these different search
terms around MacBooks and all of the kind of different laptops or computers that
Apple had, that dude brought in like millions, millions every year.
Like just with this site, didn't do anything about it.
So like finding niche, finding the topic is really important.
One thing I wanted to try out on you both is, so Kim and I talk about this all the time.
We, you know, do some investing, talked to a lot of founders, try to find like good
spaces to invest in.
And so one of the things I've been doing on AI is trying to like map out where I
see a lot of the momentum right now, like where I see a lot of the apps, where
I'm having all the conversations.
And so I wanted to kind of map out where I see it, let you all say whether,
whether there's things I'm missing, things that you disagree with.
And then kind of like talk about where do we think the winners or the losers
are going to appear from?
Like there's been basically where are the early winners that we can go through?
Like what the happy winners, but I don't think they're going to be long
term winners and where will the long term winners come from?
The first are just like the, the, the kind of chat LLM models, right?
Chat, GBT, Bardee, Lama.
And you know, I don't know if you saw a Facebook's latest release.
Actually, there's a company, you probably know that's not cause you know
all things about AI tools, but one of my favorite tools is like perplexity AI,
the kind of search engine.
And they released a chat bot based upon Facebook's latest open source model,
which I thought was really cool.
But basically all of the, like on Tropic Claw, all of the different models,
like Poe, the second, so that's like one batch, right?
And it's actually really hard to invest in that batch actually, because you
don't see many of them and like, it's really hard to pick winners, but
we should talk about that batch.
The second is like the creative tools, right?
You mentioned Jasper was one of the very early tools, the writing tools,
the image tools, the video tools, like Runway is an incredible video tool.
Image journey is obviously one of the best image tools.
So that's a whole other space.
The third space for me is like B2B tools.
I don't know if you're seeing them or this kept like, you know, yes, AI CRMs,
AI sales tools, like all of the things you need to do.
A lot of it is actually the AI sales outreach tools, right?
Right now, like sales tools, customer success tools, customer support tools,
like basically how you run a B2B go to market.
The fourth is data analysis, right?
We did a whole episode on code interpreter, but then there's all of these
other plugins that can integrate to Excel, can integrate into Google sheets,
can integrate into your data platform and be able to provide a kind of chat
layer on top of that data.
The fifth is like knowledge work tools.
And so knowledge work tools were the one that I talked a lot about at the
start with UKIPPA is like the hardest thing about fast growth companies is
that people get disconnected from the core information that's important.
Like it just becomes really hard.
Slack, I think is a really incredible tool, but actually makes this much worse
where like it is hard to get a grasp on all of the data churning through a company.
And so you have these kinds of knowledge tools that existing companies like a
glean, like a chief knowledge officer, there's a glean, two of my companies
actually pivoted to try to solve this problem recently.
There's a note taken tools for a zoom, like all of the tools you can have to
like keep a company much more efficient, keep knowledge running through that
company in much more efficient ways.
And then there's all the productivity tools, right?
Like just like how we be more productive.
And so I want to like pause, let you all react to that.
What are categories you think that maybe I've missed or they, they're wrong
categories. What does that send in terms of like how we try to figure out where
to put some money? Matt, tell me where to invest.
Please Matt, please do it.
Well, the listeners get to benefit.
The view, watch the viewers get to benefit.
Where should I put my dollars?
All right, I'll let Matt go first.
He's our guest here.
Yeah.
So when it comes to that kind of stuff, you know, I, I tend to think that the
best place to be is the, you know, the shovel sellers, right?
Like the, the NVIDIAs, the AMDs, the, the companies that are benefiting no
matter where, like what tools you're using.
I think Microsoft has a really, really smart plan, right?
What you just mentioned, Perplexity is using Lama 2, which is Meta's platform.
Well, Meta just partnered with Microsoft to release this Lama 2 platform, right?
Well, Microsoft also is partnered with OpenAI on chat GPT.
So you look at that and they're like, okay, didn't they just partner with two
competing projects?
Well, one's closed source with the chat GPT, one's open source with Lama.
Well, the common denominator between those two is they're both going to be
using Microsoft's Azure servers, right?
So Microsoft is going to get the benefit of people using the open source, the
closed source, because it's all going to be on the Azure servers, right?
And then NVIDIA, right?
NVIDIA makes all of the GPUs, all of the graphic cards, all of the, pretty
much all of these cloud compute systems are using NVIDIA GPUs.
So NVIDIA is going to really benefit AMD is trying to get into the game.
So a lot of those are the types of tools that I would really be wanting to look at.
I think my worry with a lot of the large language models, with a lot of the
image generation tools, even the like new text to speech tools that are coming
out that are really, really, really good is there's open source models, there's
closed source models, there's APIs, there's no real moat on any of them, right?
Like anybody can go and build on top of Lama too and build a competitor to
chat GPT and improve off of it and build something even better.
Anybody can go and use an 11 labs API, which is a text to speech generator
and go and build better and better text to speech tools.
Most of the AI art image generation tools, they're either using stable
diffusion under the hood or they're using Dolly under the hood.
So a lot of these tools, they just don't have that moat and it's just so
easy for so many tools to pop up.
And so I feel like a lot of those platforms, there's going to be a bit
of a race to the bottom where you're going to see companies pop up and make
a cheaper version that does the same thing.
And then another version that's cheaper, that does the same thing and
eventually a version that's completely free, but supported by ads everywhere.
So a lot of the models that are coming out now, I would have a real
concern about the long-term future of them just because of how much
everything seems to be moving to open source and how many available APIs are out there.
Well, look, I like that we're being your investment counsel and we're happy
to be your CIOs today, Kieran.
Maybe you'll actually make some money and your companies won't go out of business.
I mean, that's what's happening, but it's kind of what's happening.
Be but I don't.
But here's my take.
I agree with what's Matt saying in a world of whether you're an investor
or you're a worker who wants to go work at one of these companies
or you're a buyer, you're thinking about buying one of these tools.
I think there are two things to really consider to understand where the big
opportunity long-term is going to be, which is Matt touched on one,
which is distribution.
He touched on the other one, economics.
What is differentiated about this company that's going to allow them
to survive the long term?
AMD and NVIDIA and all of the picks and shovels kind of providers, they're
differentiated because the economics are great because there's going to be constant
demand as the market goes up, their economics are going to improve.
The other thing that they have is they're differentiated because they have
proprietary technology, right?
Like NVIDIA has its own way of manufacturing facilities, everything
of making its GPUs, that's a really hard thing to do.
If you are just writing code on top of somebody else's APIs, that's not very
differentiated and your economics are tough because one, you're at the mercy
of whatever that API access costs and two, it's really hard for you to build
a product that is deep enough, that provides enough value that you don't have
a lot of customer churn issues where you have a lot of customers cancel.
That's what we're seeing in the AI space right now is a lot of customers
canceling a lot of these companies dealing with really massive churn issues,
especially given that the pace of innovation, like Matt is on his YouTube
channel all the time talking about new stuff, which means that like you
could have a plan and a model that's like obsolete.
Pace of innovation is crazy, particularly because it's so much easier to build,
like takes three to five people to build something that historically has taken
like 50 to 60 people.
This is my thesis.
Go picks and shovels, Matt.
I was what's app in here and earlier today about an idea that we're going to
get your take on, which is I think one of the winners are very small businesses.
Because of AI and automation, we're going to have more and more profitable,
more successful one to 10 employee businesses.
And if you are like me and believe that, like, I think, I think there is a
huge opportunity for somebody to raise a venture fund that all they do is
invest in companies that are providing AI, automation and tooling for that
very small business category, because the profitability of that category is
going to improve.
Traditionally, that's been a really hard category to serve because there's a
lot of business going out of business cancellation risk and everything.
I think that's going to change a lot.
The other category that you didn't include Kieran that I would like to add,
and this is a hat tip to our friend Linus, who we had on the show recently.
He talked a lot about models operating on the edge.
So like having personalized models in like on your phone and like the most
one of the most interesting things that's happened this week is Rewind,
which is really awesome app to provide an AI layer across basically everything
you do on your computer, just launched its iPhone app today.
And so now you can have this AI assistant on your iPhone in a really powerful way.
You kind of this personal secure, just your data model operating like on the
edge on your phone.
And I think that is a category where you're not going to have a hundred winners,
but the handful of companies that win are going to win pretty big.
You know, what's one of the wildest thought exercises for the three of us,
just to quickly touch on in relation to this is if you told me like three
months ago, if you look at open AI, you would say, wow, like open AI are going
to be one of the biggest, most profitable, biggest market cap businesses of all time.
Now I think open AI might be one of the most interesting case studies in if
distribution is truly a moat, because actually their core technology is being
eroded pretty rapidly.
I don't know what you think about matter that you agree or not.
If you could like, if you had a hundred thousand to invest, are you putting
that in like open AI today, or you think that their core business is starting
to be eroded by these open source models, by like other companies,
just like replicating what they do.
You know, I think, I think open AI is going to figure it out.
I think open AI has some of the smartest researchers on the planet on their team.
So I do think that they're going to figure out, you know, how to continually
build more of a moat around their platform.
You know, some of the, some of the team that they have there behind the scenes,
I hate to try to pronounce their names, you know, Greg Brockman and some of the
team there are some of the people that are like, you know, founding fathers
of AI that have been doing this for a long time, that are going to figure
this stuff out.
So I do have faith in open AI.
If I had the money, I'd probably be putting it more towards Microsoft
and Nvidia though, because I think that's still the safer bet.
And sound that man is a awesome, incredible founder.
So I think like part of it is the Nvidia founder is an incredible founder.
Like, if you ever read up on that find, yeah, what's really interesting about
open AI, like there was a really good tweet about what Elon's doing at Twitter,
which is Elon is going through the biggest experiment of all time to see if the
only thing that truly matters is like network effects, like, Hey, getting
rid of the brand, getting rid of all of the actual users, getting rid of all
the things that people like, but the thing he still has is network effects.
And if you have network effects, like it's really an incredible
mode and hard to disrupt.
And like open AI has not built network effects into the product just yet.
But I do think part of your mode can just be you have probably the best team
in the industry and you'll figure out how to stay ahead.
But like the pace of evolution, even in the kind of space that they're in,
like, I don't even think I would have seen six months ago, just how many
competitors they have in such a short amount of time.
Yeah.
And open AI too, you know, they're not just chat GPT.
We have to remember, right?
They've also got Dolly.
They also have the GPT 3.5, the GPT for APIs.
I mean, how many thousands and thousands of companies are running with the GPT
for API?
I mean, I get a GPT for API bill every month just from playing around with it
myself.
So, you know, I think that they have a lot more going for them than just chat GPT.
I think the public sees chat GPT and that's sort of what the public
thinks of with open AI, but they've got, you know, that sort of API business
behind the scenes that's powering so many other companies as well.
What do you think happens in the kind of spaces where it's like quick to replicate?
Because there is a need for these kind of like writing tools, image tools,
video tools, the sales outreach tools.
Like they are going to be incredibly important to companies.
I think every company is going to use some form of these tools, but I wonder
like how you win or is there a winner or everyone just uses their own
special flavor?
There's two things here.
There's two things that are part of it.
One of the things that are things part of it is with chat GPT, we're all
getting trained on a chat kind of interface, but more of a chat workflow
where you can have a lot of different types of actions happening in one stream.
And we're going to all want that.
It's a way better experience.
You and I collaborate or collaborated on a chat GPT thread care.
And it was like, awesome, great experience.
We're all going to want to do that more in a world where that's true.
You know, who benefits platforms.
People who have a wide set of use cases that they can bundle into that new
experience and just basically put AI and that chat experience on.
So I think incumbents and platforms are really going to win.
And I think a lot of those point solutions right now, it's going to be a
little bit like dot com bus 3.0 where they're just going like a couple will
make it and the majority will not because what they were doing will get
gobbled up by a lot of the existing incumbents.
Right, Matt.
What tool has like other than like the open AI or the code interpreter.
Me and Kip had a moment.
We were doing like code interpreter code interpreter live.
We were kind of doing stuff analysis for the podcast and RSS.
And I use these tools all the time.
But I hadn't read because I'm like, maybe it's because I don't have any friends.
So I hadn't used the share and function where like I'd shared this analysis
with Kip and my analysis took me two hours.
Like I was going back and forth, getting it to create charts, getting it
to like create tables, join tables and create charts on those join tables.
And I was like, this is like awesome, right?
Like I was like, this is super awesome.
But then I sent it to Kip and Kip, you can just clip, click on the share link.
You, you import that entire chat charts data and then you can just start
like building on top of it.
I didn't actually not, I thought I was sending him like a thread and he could
see it and share it, but I didn't know he could just easily start to like
rapidly iterate on that.
I just blown my mind because now you can just start to share these like
conversations and all this stuff with someone else and they can just build on
that really, really rapidly.
And that was like a bit of mind blown experience.
What's been a tool like that for you, which you're just like, holy smokes.
Like this is a whole new way to do things.
So there's, there's been a couple.
I mean, so, and, and thropics clawed to actually blew me away when they,
they first made it available because of that hundred thousand contact token
context window, meaning that you can essentially upload an entire book and
ask questions of that book, right?
You can, you can copy an entire giant, you know, hundred thousand or 50,000
word article or something, paste it in there, ask questions of it.
So Claude to is really, really impressive.
I've actually started using Claude to almost more than chat GPT, especially
for summarization type stuff and getting bullet points and, you know, helping
me rewrite stuff.
But I think more, you know, since that's sort of similar to chat GPT, I think
the one tool that really blew my mind when I did sort of a demo video on it and
I was sort of playing with it in real time that really, I really went, whoa,
this is, this is really crazy.
It was 11 labs.
When I started playing with 11 labs and I was able to train my own voice into
11 labs on that type in some text and then it spoke back to me.
I actually made a video of it on my YouTube channel where I typed a bunch
of words and had it speak back and I was listening to it and I'm like, yeah,
I don't really think it sounds like me.
And then everybody on my YouTube channel, like all the comments were like, I
wasn't looking at my screen at that point and I didn't realize you stop talking.
Like I had some sort of like cognitive dissonance from it where I like couldn't
I was like, that doesn't sound like me.
And everybody was like, no, that's, that's you.
That's your voice.
And then I started playing with it a little more where I would take like a voice
from somebody from a podcast and train it in there and see if I can replicate
their voice and that was working.
And that to me was really, really mind blowing.
Also scary at the same time, right?
There's been a handful of scams that have popped up where people have, you know,
called somebody's parents and then use somebody else's voice to try to get
money out of the parents.
And so it was one of the things where I played with it for the first time
and I went, this is mind blowing.
This is groundbreaking, but also this scares the hell out of me.
Yeah, I watched that video.
I think it was around the time Kip, I watched up to the Joe Rogan
and Andrew Huberman fake podcast when they actually were doing video
and then they out of the, and then out of the blue advertise, like some
sort of like weight loss pills.
Hey, Joe, what do you think about like, you know, aliens coming down
and then they built the pyramids, like all the crazy stuff he talks about.
Oh, well, what do you think about these weight loss pills?
Oh, they're super dope, but like, but, but like still, wow, like this stuff
is going to come out of us pretty fast in terms of like how rapidly
we're going to be able to do deepfakes and, and spoof people.
Absolutely. Right.
So, so Claude, 11 labs, what else?
What else are your other favorite AI tools of 2023 so far?
So mid-journey, every time mid-journey releases a new update, that just blows my mind.
Except for it's a discord.
You have to, you have to, like, are you, you can't be a fan of the discord
experience, like why get out of the discord?
Yeah, I wait, they are planning on getting out of the discord.
In fact, if you've generated over, I think, 10,000 generations,
they let you use their web user interface, but they are moving to a web
interface, but they're just, they're only letting certain beta
testers use it right now.
So it's getting there.
I also use Leonardo AI a lot, which is another AI image generator
that's really, really solid.
You can actually train your own sort of styles into it.
You can upload a whole bunch of images that you like, and it will
train on those styles, and you can generate more images in that style.
So I like that one a lot.
You know, since I do a lot of YouTube videos, I like to play with a lot
of, like, creative video tools, right?
So I use runway ML a lot.
I use a tool called Kyber a lot, which makes really cool AI image
generations that uses, like, deforum and I think disco diffusion behind the scenes.
I mean, there's just too many tools to list, but there's, I play with a lot
of, like, the visual effects type stuff because I'm constantly experimenting
with what could I make that I can throw into a YouTube video that
make people go, Oh, I need to know how he does that.
The video tools are the ones where you can have an avatar within your,
your kind of go to market.
So you have an avatar on customer support or you have an avatar who's
actually doing your sales and there's a company called air.
They got a lot of traction, but there's other companies doing this,
which is like, I can train it to sound like a human.
They can do the sales.
I can do the customer support.
And it's like, they're like 80% there, but that 80% is nowhere near good
enough, right?
Like it's very monotone.
It's like, you know, the videos are just like, well, this is me.
I am speaking to you now, like here, right?
Like they're just like no, no tone, no personality.
I suspect that I wonder how hard that 20% is going to be.
I wonder if it's like one of those problems where like the 20% is just
like a huge jump up from like where we are today.
Cause video is like one of the, I think most interesting spaces runway has
probably one of the best tools, but one of the ones I'm interested in is
like how rapidly you can just have a person on support 24 seven doing like
your tweenshares, how you can have someone, your entire sales team, like 24 seven.
But it doesn't seem like we're close.
It seems like.
I think the biggest problem with a lot of those tools is honestly just the
latency between when you ask it, the question and when it responds to the question.
Right.
Like you ask the question, there's like a 10 second gap.
And then there's a response.
There are some, some companies that are figuring that out though.
There are some companies that I was talking to the CEO of a company called
convey who they're actually building this technology for video games where you
can go up and speak into your microphone with an NPC character.
And then the character sort of generates random real time conversation.
So every time you play through the game, you're going to have different
conversations with that character.
Right.
So I could go up and ask them a question, one play through the second play through.
If I ask them the exact same question, they're not going to give me the same
response cause it's all generated with AI.
Well, his program actually fixed that latency issue where it actually has
this sort of like a buffer type thing built in where as I'm speaking, while
it's hearing these words, it's already processing the words.
And then when I finally pause, it's already processed the first part of what I
said and is ready to respond.
So they've actually figured out where the gap between what I say and what
they respond with is milliseconds.
So it's, I mean, it's getting really, really close.
And then with tools like 11 labs, I feel like all those tools need to do to
get rid of that sort of robotic response voice is just tie into like an API,
like 11 labs API.
And now you've got a voice that sounds just like a real human that's almost
indistinguishable.
And then, you know, combine that with a tool like Synthesia or something
like that that actually puts that sort of human looking avatar in front of you.
So it looks like they're speaking to you.
And, you know, now we're, now we're crossing that on kind of a valley.
And we've got somebody that, that is having a conversation sounds like a
real voice and is responding in real time.
It's just the technologies all exist.
I haven't just seen one tool pull them all together into a single purpose
built tool for like sales.
Back in my software engineer days, one of the interviews I went for like very
early at a college, the person who was interviewing me, like ran the entire
software development department and he purposely, and he told me like
afterwards, this is part of his interview style.
He purposely waited 20 seconds between asking the question you answering
and him responding.
So he would leave like 20 seconds of uncomfortable silence.
And he said he reason, and he would just sit there like, and he would not
his head for some reason.
They just like, and you're like, oh, I did.
The reason he was like, I do that because it's incredible how people decide
to like fill that 20 seconds.
They just say like, you know, they just say like totally insane stuff.
But I'm like, okay, like, but it's not a normal situation that I'm going to
have to deal with as a software engineer.
We're like, part of me being a great software engineer has been able to deal
with like 20 seconds, specifically 20 seconds of like uncomfortable silence.
So I still think he would actually do pretty well as like an AI avatar or
sales person, sales person.
Yeah, yeah.
I hear they do that on Shark Tank too, just to see how people respond.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah.
Once AI starts playing mental games with us, then we're all screwed.
It's like, oh, come on, man.
I can't, I can't deal with that.
I can barely deal with it from other humans.
Right.
Right.
The last one I want to touch on both of you is this is actually
Paris seems to be a real hub of these kind of companies.
We talked about it, which is it feels like most companies, most large
companies will have a plug and play version of a AI, like an LLM model just for them.
Right.
Like you'll be able to plug in your data.
You'll be able to like customize it for your needs.
And I suspect at some point, like you'll just be able to go any kind of podcast
or any YouTuber can go to a service, pay a couple of bucks, put their RSS feed
and get some like models back and be able to build apps on top of that.
Are you seeing much of that?
Like how do you, how do you feel about that?
How do both of you think that's going to be a pretty big, a big, big important space?
Yeah.
I mean, I'm already seeing that kind of stuff that already exists.
I mean, there's already apps out there that have, you know, scraped the entire
Huberman labs podcast and you can go and have conversations with Andrew Huberman
based on all of the conversations he's had on his podcast already.
That sort of already exists.
There's, there's a tool that I spoke with the founder called personal.ai.
And what that is, is you can actually plug in your own blogs, RSS feed.
You can plug in your Twitter account.
You can, you know, personally journal directly inside of the app.
And what it does is it learns more and more and more about you.
And then you can go in there and have conversations with it.
And based on all of your own data, it will know how you would respond.
Right.
But then you can also go and give a front end user face, user interface to other people.
So people can have a conversation with virtual digital me.
Like that's, that's already out there and there's a handful of tools that do that.
I think we're going to see that more and more.
I mean, I think that's probably more likely the future of customer service, right?
Where you've got these AI models that are trained on all of the, the database
of user documentation, they're trained on all of past customer support
conversations and how the response was handled.
And then over time, these AI bots are going to be able to handle 98.9 percent
of the conversations that come through without ever needing to, you know,
touch a human customer support rep.
So that I think is, is coming really fast.
I think that's, that's sort of the next wave that we're going to see a lot of,
honestly.
Well, yeah.
And it's like, when we talk about customer support, the reason I think this is
important because Kieran, I'm about to bring up one of the AI startups that you
and I are most confused by to get maths take on.
But this, this is me rationalizing why they might exist.
You know, when we talk about, oh, AI is going to solve customer support
or it's going to solve sales, the reality is humans like to interact
with different types of people in those situations.
Like some people want a salesperson who's really to the point.
Others, others want somebody who's just going to be very detail-oriented,
et cetera.
Right.
And that's come, that's where you're not just going to need like one model.
You're going to need very specific versions of a model to solve the audience
you're trying to address.
And maybe, maybe that's why character.ai exists.
I don't really understand character.ai.
This is like what am I missing?
What am I missing?
Like they have raised so much money and like they, it seems like people
are making some weird characters, but like, are we, are we missing
something about character?
This is like, I feel like I'm, I'm, you know, the person watching
these humans act like NPC people on TikTok doing gang gang ice cream,
getting the dollars in like, I feel that way about characters that I know.
Like I'm really into the AI space.
I'm like, I don't, I don't get the, I don't, what, what is this company doing?
Why are they going to be huge success?
Yeah, I, I mean, I'm, I'm with you.
I don't totally understand character.ai.
Here's what I will say though.
I do have two kids, like they're both like sort of preteen age kids and they
for whatever reason, love character.ai.
Like them on their phone or on the desktop, on the phone.
So they've got their, they've got their Chromebooks.
Both my kids have little Chromebooks and they get into character.ai.
And like we have a neighbor across the street that's the same age.
And apparently among like their age kids, like middle school age kids,
they love this sort of like fun digital companion thing.
It's like, it's like the new Tomagachi kind of thing, right?
Like that sort of generation seems to just be obsessed with this digital
companion conversation type app.
That's what I've noticed about it.
That's the only sort of justification I can make towards character.ai.
I've played with it like once or twice and went, all right, I, you know,
I just had a conversation with Mega Man that that was cool.
And I don't know what else to do with this now.
I love Mega Man.
But my kids, like they love it.
They're on character.ai all the time, which is scary.
Hopefully that doesn't ruin, you know, real relationships and real
companionship with humans.
So hopefully it doesn't ruin like social skills and interpersonal skills
and all the things we actually need as a society.
Oh yeah.
That's a whole other rabbit hole that sort of scares me about AI is the whole
digital girlfriend thing that's starting to pop up where people are building
relationships and not feeling the need to have real relationships with, you
know, the opposite sex in real life, because they've got their digital
like, but that's a whole rabbit hole.
That's how population continues to decline.
One billion dollar valuation.
So now we know they've climbed the charts because Mega Man is on there.
I think Mega Man is kind of dope.
So I think that's, I think, I think that's a good case for them.
They're also, and Andres and Harrods back.
Matt, it's been incredible having you on the show.
We're both big fans.
We watch your YouTube channel.
Everyone who's listening to this should go check out your YouTube channel.
Keep up the date with AI every single week.
And we really appreciate you coming on and spending this time with us.
Yeah.
Thanks for having me on.
This has been absolutely a blast.
I've had a good time.
This data is wrong every freaking time.
Have you heard of HubSpot?
HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated.
Whoa.
I can see the clients hold history, calls, support tickets, emails.
And here's a test from three days ago.
I totally missed HubSpot.
Girl better.
