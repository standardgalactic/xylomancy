The
The text that I'm going to be discussing today, Nietzsche's Gay Science, was by his own admission
his most personal book, a text that, more fully than any other, revealed his self-created
persona.
And I say self-created persona advisedly.
Nietzsche was in personality, nothing like the character you would have gotten from the
previous lecture, which quite aptly describes genealogy of morals beyond good and evil.
And from that you get a sense of a sort of philosophic Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The actual Nietzsche was an incredible nerd, an extremely sickly, frail philology professor,
prodigious in his youthful scholarship, but his self-created persona that most accurately
described the way he liked to think of himself was actually less like Arnold Schwarzenegger
than Oscar Wilde.
He was very much a dandy, a very dapper dresser, playful, had a very good sense of humor, at
least in his writings, and I want to try, whenever possible, to give you a sense of that side
of him, because that's what he tries to communicate in Gay Science.
For example, it's a work that's comprised of a series of aphorisms, poems, riddles,
jokes, songs, none of which are more than a few paragraphs long.
The form of the work is Nietzsche's attempt to overcome what he considered the dreary systematic
nature of traditional philosophy, which he felt was hampered with a sort of ponderous,
heavy-handed seriousness as if we were getting deep and getting to the bottom of things.
Rather than be systematic, Nietzsche endeavors to be edifying, playful, to offer wisdom rather
than a lie called truth, and as we'll see, Nietzsche argued that, given the philosophical
conception of truth, there could be no such thing.
The text is, I would urge, a wonderfully beautiful piece of prose.
In fact, it's one of the very few pleasurable reads in all of German philosophy.
Not to say that German philosophy is not rewarding, I mean, reading Kant, reading Hegel is intensely
rewarding, but it is also very much like having your teeth drilled without anesthetics.
And Nietzsche was critically aware of this and was, in fact, revolted by it.
So my presentation, well, as I've mentioned, whenever possible, attempt to capture this
quality of playfulness, good-hearted mischievousness, and what I would call a certain happy-go-lucky
skepticism.
Now, I must confess, in spite of his best efforts, Nietzsche was, unfortunately, a systematic
thinker.
Therefore, I'm afraid, before I can actually delve into the text, and what I plan to do
is actually read you passages and explicate them, I have to present one of his central
doctrines that I believe informs and underlies everything he writes.
And this is a doctrine that's known as perspectivalism, alternately called perspectivism.
In brief, the doctrine holds that all of our concepts, our language, our culture represent
perspectives which we impose on experience.
We put a mask, as it were, over the realm of experience to create a, quote, world.
And since Nietzsche is systematic in all of his theories and theorems and to relate,
I can draw on the last lecture to give you an example of this.
Take morality.
Is morality an absolute reflection of the truth?
Or is morality, as Nietzsche says, perspectival?
In other words, consider the master morality that Professor Suguru has so aptly described.
It is a morality of not of what one does, but what one is.
Right?
From a certain perspective, it has an intuitive sense.
The good man is a man who's good for something.
And one can easily picture the situation.
You're going off into battle with spears and swords against people with spears and swords,
and you have a choice.
You can have on your side either, well, Lawrence Taylor, or you can have on your side Mahatma
Gandhi.
He says, well, this was the master sense of morality.
One of them is good.
Lawrence Taylor.
Why?
Because he's good for something.
When you're in the middle of a battle, you'd rather have Lawrence Taylor by your side.
Mahatma Gandhi is bad because he's useless.
He can't do anything for us.
In the middle of a battle, he's going to sit down and start, you know, eating rice or something
like that.
Perfectly useless.
So that's one perspective.
And then there's the slave perspective, right, that Lawrence Taylor is in fact a bad man
because he's violent.
He's contemptuous of those beneath him.
And Mahatma Gandhi was a good man because he had universal love.
And Nietzsche says, well, which of these are really true?
Neither.
There isn't a real truth to this.
There's just those perspectives.
And you choose the perspective which works best for you.
Now this is not a complete innovation.
That such perspectives are imposed rather than, quote, red off of nature.
We're pointed out, right?
I mean, with this discussion of the Copernican Revolution and conceptual schemes, a lot of
what we, quote, call the world actually arises from our own a priori categories.
Now Hegel had historicized that, right?
He said, you know, it really doesn't come from our a priori categories of mind because
we find different conceptual schemes in different parts of the world and we find conceptual
schemes evolve over time.
Nonetheless, philosophers after Hegel, and certainly before, held that what makes a perspective
true is that it in some sense corresponds to the way the world is, right?
And we might accept Hegel by saying, well, each of our following perspectives comes closer
and closer to an accurate correspondence of the world.
And this is a doctrine called realism, the notion that the world is just like the picture
represented of it by the beliefs we hold or by our language or common sense.
Nietzsche felt this was a piece of pre-Darwinian nonsense, literally a philosophic antique
piece.
Nietzsche says, what if we take Darwin seriously?
What possibly can make a perspective believable except the fact not that it corresponds to
reality, but rather that it empowers us and allows us to cope with reality more effectively.
So the key to evaluating belief as good or bad is not whether it corresponds to reality,
which is a vacuous notion because we never quite get in touch with reality, but rather
whether it fulfills our will to power, right?
Whether it allows us to control nature, to control ourselves, to control our environment
including other humans.
So in short, realism for Nietzsche is dogmatic and unjustifiable, for the world in itself
is nothing like the way we described it.
I want to urge that perspectivalism runs in two disparate directions, one external and
one internal.
Externally, it takes the form of scientific realism, which is the belief that science
accurately depicts the way the world is.
But Nietzsche disagrees.
He says science is just another perspective.
It's certainly the perspective he believes in, hence gay science, but not because it
corresponds to the world, but because it's an extremely useful thing to believe, right?
It actually helps us control nature.
Reality itself is actually just chaos and flux.
Nietzsche does occasionally, I must confess, fall into metaphysics.
These metaphysics are thoroughly Heracletian, which is to say, they are the metaphysics
we found in Heraclitus, the Presocratic philosopher.
Persons for Nietzsche are nothing other than a series of drives and instincts, and this
is a really Darwinian conception, right?
What describes a human is the particular conjury of drives and instincts, and Nietzsche sums
that up with the phrase will to power.
So all of nature, not just humans, are various wills to power.
All the animals are wills to power, trying to dominate their environment, replicate their
genetic code as much as they possibly can, and eat other things lower in the food chain.
That's the notion of will to power.
So science in common sense are just masks that we throw on reality so that we can cope
with it, so that we can manipulate it.
Now Nietzsche accepts the correspondence theory of truth as the only tenable theory
of truth, and it is for that reason he says, there is no truth, right?
Because there is no fixed, final, parsed reality for it to correspond to.
So don't be upset when we find out that everything is a lie, that there is no truth.
It doesn't mean that there's nothing to believe in.
It simply means that there is nothing to correspond to our beliefs, that our beliefs
simply interact with the world causally, rather than correspondentially, that they give us
a handle on the world.
And as I've suggested, therefore grounds for belief have nothing to do with truth, but
rather are all about power over nature and ourselves.
Now, perspectivalism also cuts internally.
It undermines something which we might call the internal realism of the self.
Now we're all aware, at some points in our lives, we wear masks, right?
We present a persona.
When you meet your boss and he looks like an old bald, who knows what?
You don't say, hi, old bald, who know what?
Rather you smile and say, oh, you look so good, I love that tie, that's really charming.
And we wear these masks when we deal with our children and they do something silly which
is dangerous.
We don't laugh and say that silly, we take a stern face and say, why not not do that?
And we put these masks on, and we all do this all the time.
Nonetheless, we have this belief that if we could ever take those masks off, we would
find our real self, the real Professor Staloff as it were.
Nietzsche finds this view embarrassingly dogmatic and stupid.
There is no real self, any more than a real world.
That's an incredibly dogmatic myth.
We create ourselves.
We create ourselves by putting on masks, masks that we build, perhaps on the basis of models
of others, but perhaps on our own.
And in fact, that's the distinction he draws about mask wearing.
Some people are more than satisfied to wear the masks that their culture presupposes.
For Nietzsche, that's dangerous, at least for him.
He says that sort of a person has no terror of being a copy, a replica, one just like
any other cut out of a cookie cutter mold.
The interesting person is like an artist who self-consciously and artistically creates
his own masks.
He may not even do it in his personal life.
He may do it through his works, and that is exactly what Nietzsche's works represent
for him, his own self-created persona, his own self-projected mask.
Now, I want very briefly to say that there are some would-be friends of Nietzsche who
claim that he was not a perspectivalist because that would be his stupid view.
I mean, if it's all just perspective, then one perspective is as good as another.
Well, Nietzsche has a great line.
He says, I wish such disciples on my enemies.
He says that's a cloven-minded thought, the inference limbs.
And the reason it limbs is because such friends assume that the only thing which could count
as truth, as grounds for belief, is correspondence.
When Nietzsche says not at all, there's plenty of reasons to decide that physics is more
true, say, than the belief that I have wings and can fly off this podium.
In fact, the best example of that would be that if I tried it, I'd break my leg.
He says, so that's the grounds for belief.
Perspectivalism isn't undermined by the critique of relativism.
Simply because none of the beliefs are absolutely true doesn't mean we can't choose between
them, which fulfill our purposes better.
Perspectivalism does mean, however, that our views of things are interpretations, not
correspondence readings.
And nowhere is this more true than in reading texts.
Every reading of a text is an interpretation of it.
And in no text is this more obvious than in Nietzsche's, which are disparate, often contradictory,
confusing.
So what I'm going to offer is an interpretation of the gay science, which will take the form
of looking at particular passages which I find edifying and explicating them.
I'll try, of course, because I'm not quite Nietzsche, to cover all the important topics.
But whether I do or not is in no way significant.
Whether I cover two or 200 aphorisms is an important, what is important is that I try
and give you a sense of the style, of the flavor of this text.
So that brings us to the beginning of the text, what is gay science after all?
The allusion, I believe, was to the gay sebert of the Provence troubadours, which were chivalric
knights who created the first love songs and love poems and were destroyed during the middle
of a papal crusade, because obviously they weren't very good Christians, they believed
in adultery.
And the point for Nietzsche, and other thinkers since him, I mean Joseph Campbell, has thought
the same view, is that these were the first people who created individuals, who said,
I will stand against authority, and if the church tells me what I'm doing is a sin,
well, so much for the church, I will fulfill my own path.
And I think that's a fair sense of part of what gay science is about, the creating of
individuals, the cherishing of individuality, as opposed to commonality, universality.
Nietzsche, however, in his preface to the work, refers to his gay science as the result of
a convalescence.
He says, gay science, that signifies the Saturnalia of a spirit who has patiently resisted a terrible
long pressure, patiently, severely, coldly, without submitting, but also without hope.
And it was now, all at once, attacked by hope, the hope for health, and the intoxication
of convalescence.
Is it any wonder that in the process, much that is unreasonable and foolish comes to
light, much playful tenderness that is lavished even on problems that have a prickly hide,
and are not made to be caressed and enticed?
This whole book is nothing but a bit of merry-making, after long privation and powerlessness, the
rejoicing of strength that is returning of a reawakened faith in a tomorrow and the day
after tomorrow.
Well, what is this sickness, or as he calls it, nausea, that he's getting better from?
The nausea, he says, is the result of having an over-large dose of a very unhealthy European
diet called romanticism, which fills us with great aspirations.
Problem with such a conviction is, it only lasts as long as you're scientifically illiterate.
If you read Darwin, you realize that there's no purpose behind our existence.
We are in fact simply the agents of the big actor behind history, Mr. DNA, who's a sort
of viral infection that's infected the planet, and we're its latest strategy for dominating
that infection.
But in a sense, don't worry, it'll die off eventually.
So Nietzsche says that's the sort of thing which can induce Velschmer's, world weariness,
a sense of anxiety and dread over it all, and Nietzsche went through this intense depression,
life is meaningless, there's no purpose, there's no goal, and then he got better.
And as he gets better, he takes on a new perspective.
He's no longer serious and somber, what he would call, oh, too, German.
Now, he's pricklish, he's gay, let me be clear, gay at the time did not have the connotation
of homosexuality that it does today.
But Walter Kaufman has quite persuasively, I think, argued, that it's no coincidence
that homosexuals would have reached for the same term that Nietzsche used to describe
his science, because it suggests a sort of studied superficiality, a sense of the beauty
of mere appearance, a refusal to take serious things seriously, rather take them trivially
and take trivial things seriously, which some of you may recognize as the dictum of Oscar
Wilde.
So this text is, in a sense, then, at least for Nietzsche, a study of his psychological
experience of world weariness and its philosophical results.
And Nietzsche makes an important point, he says, this is not just me, I'm aware of it,
I'm a philosophical psychologist, but every philosopher, if he really is an interpretation
of the body, in a sense, every philosopher feels some sort of psychological tension or
pull and need for meaning or purpose, and in fact he says most of them are misinterpretations
of the body, their tendency to read one's psychic, organic needs into nature.
Given that, Nietzsche says, I will not do that, I will not treat my own projections
as a serious, profound, deep thing that underlies the world, rather, rather than being profound
and deep, we should be, as he says, like the Greeks.
Oh, those Greeks, they knew how to live, what is required for that is to stop courageously
at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words,
and the whole Olympus of appearance, those Greeks were superficial, out of profundity.
And this is, and is not this precisely what we are again coming back to, we dare devils
of the spirit, who have climbed the highest and most dangerous peak of present thought
and looked down from up there, we who have looked down from there, are we not precisely
in this respect, Greeks, adores of forms, of tones of words, and therefore, artists,
and I think that celebration is the realization that, you know, there are some serious questions
that might be raised, which is just indecent for any gentleman to raise, and he tells the
story of, he said, you know, there's this anecdote about this woman who, this young
girl who once asked her mother, is God everywhere? She said, of course, God is everywhere. The
child said, well, that's, I think that's thoroughly indecent. God follows me into the
bathroom. I mean, is God aware, is God there when I'm picking my nose? Oh, that's, that's
horrible. And Nietzsche says, oh, there may be something to that. A wise man knows what
are the fair questions and what sort of questions not to ask. Okay, now we turn to the body
of the text itself. Nietzsche added a sort of introduction, which he called joke, cunning,
and revenge, which will turn out to be the strategies of gay science. And the book introduces
all of the major themes that will be discussed in the text. The very first of these little
poems is called invitation, and it is exactly that. It's an invitation to the text. Take
a chance and try my affair. It will grow on you, I swear. Soon it will taste good to you.
If by then you should want more, all the things I've done before will inspire things quite
new. And the point Nietzsche is making is, if you follow this book and begin to think
dangerous thoughts, you won't follow me. You will create your own. And I think he wonderfully
expresses this in his ninth little poem called My Roses. Yes, my joy wants to amuse. Every
joy wants to amuse. Would you like to pick my roses? You must stoop and stick your noses
between thorns and rocky views and not be afraid of bruises. For my joy enjoys good
teases. For my joy enjoys good roses. Would you like to pick my roses? All of the aphorism
in this book are Nietzsche's roses. He's beckoning us and saying, look, you're going to find
some thorny issues here, some pricklish issues here. But that is the nature of his joy, of
his happiness, of his happy-go-lucky mischievousness. In his fifth little poem, he introduces his
what I would call meta-ethical critique, which is not his ethical doctrine, but his doctrine
about the way we should feel towards ethics. What troubled Nietzsche was how particular
parts of our culture, particularly of our philosophical culture, are claimed to trump
the others. Our moral duties come first. And Nietzsche said, well, morality is fine, of
course. But is it all of life? Must we learn how to morally eat our food? Must we learn
what are the morally correct ways to fold our napkins? Why should our virtues be grave?
We like ours nimble-footed. Even like Homer's verse, they have to come and go. Sometimes
virtue and morality should leave us in peace for a while so we can do something else, like
be creative, do art, do science. Morality is not the measure of all things. And I think
perhaps his most wonderful expression of this is in the text itself, I'm jumping out of
place, I know, called dealing with virtues. In dealing with a virtue, too, one can lack
dignity and fawn. And clearly I think the figure he's responding to here is Kant. Oh,
yes, we must do our duties. Don't you think that's rather bad form, Kant? Don't you think
it's rather bad form to constantly fawn before your duties like they were a sort of surrogate
god? It shows a real lack of taste. Well, he also introduces himself as a problem in
the text. He says in a wonderful passage called Request, the minds of others I know well,
but who I am, I cannot tell. My eye is much too close to me, I am not what I saw and see.
It would be quite a benefit if only I could sometimes sit farther away, but my foes are
too distant, close friends still too far, between my friends and me the middle would
do. My wish? You guess, my riddle. And Nietzsche is making a deep point. If there is no real
self in there, but only masks, perspectives, I'm a little too close to my own mask to see
who I really am. That's your job, the reader, and my job, the reader, the expositor, to
try and figure out Nietzsche and come back to him and tell him who he is. But of course
this has a sort of selfish side to it, too, which Nietzsche is quite aware of, as in for
your consideration. Double pain is easier to bear than single pain. Do you accept my
dare? Try and think my, quote, dangerous thoughts. Okay, and then finally one last theme in this
introduction, and we can turn to the rest of the body of the text, and that is his, what
I would call, tasteful critique of Christianity. He says, in a wonderful little poem called
Cheezy Taste, if it depended on my choice, I think it might be great to have a place
in paradise, better yet, outside the gate. And Nietzsche is making a very deep point
here. He's saying, look, stop being pious for a minute and be honest with me. What do
you think goes on in heaven? Everyone sits in beatific vision, genuflecting towards the
deity. What a particularly boring person he must be. Would you really want to spend time
there? All the interesting people are in hell. Well, they may well be suffering, of course.
We don't want to be in hell. We might want to look at paradise to see that wonderful
splendor. But it's beneath the dignity of a gentleman to waste his time in heaven. And
that's Cheezy Taste. He doesn't want to be part of that, shall we call it, herd? Nietzsche
always does. One more passage about his Cheezy Taste, and then we can leave it behind, and
that is his statement against Christianity, which again is not only sharp and invective,
but actually extremely accurate. Against Christianity, what is now decisive against Christianity
is our taste, no longer our reason. It may seem absurd at first, but go to a college campus
and listen to, especially an elite one, and listen to the young rail against the stupidities
of religion. And you'll notice something. They haven't a good argument among them. Any
sophisticated theologian will persistently best them an argument. And Nietzsche's point
is, but the young won't be convinced. It's not reasons that turn them against Christianity
anymore. It's taste. How thoroughly musty and brown to believe in that sort of heavy-handed,
baroque sort of belief. The youth have developed a higher form of taste, which clearly shows
that that's just, it's too stolid, too, as it were, beef-headed. As he says, mystical explanations
are thought to be profound. The truth is, they're not even superficial. Right? Nietzsche is saying,
look, stop looking at religion from the scales of piety, and look at it literally. And it's
thoroughly absurd. Okay. We now turn to book one, which I would argue constitutes a species
of shock therapy. Nietzsche is, in a certain way, trying to preach what I would call tough
love. We've all been brought up in a culture which has brainwashed us into thinking like,
it wants us to think, thinking like members of a herd. And the only way to break us free
from that and liberate us is to shock us, is to scare us, is to show us the absurdity
of these views in a most harsh fashion. So he begins with his very first aphorism, the
teachers of the purpose of existence. And he says, whether I contemplate men with benevolence
or with an evil eye, I always find them concerned with a single task, all of them and every
one of them in particular, to do what is good for the preservation of the species. Not from
any feeling of love, but merely because nothing in them is older, stronger, more inexorable,
and unconquerable in this instinct, because this instinct constitutes the essence of our
species, our herd. And this is extremely Darwinian point he's making, that if you're kind to
other people, and if you try to help the species, it's not because you've thought about it.
If you have sentences that describe why you do it, you added those lies later. You do it
because you're genetically programmed to do that. That's how Mr. DNA uses us to replicate
ourselves. He goes on to say, if you think about it, hatred, mischievousness, evil, are
all indispensable for the life of the species. They bring out characteristics, noble characteristics
in us, perhaps virtuous and kind characteristics, which would otherwise go rotten if they weren't
occasionally evil people and bad things. In fact, if we look at it scientifically, we
can prove that it has, in fact, preserved the species so far. But Nietzsche's fear is
that we may have reached the point where we can no longer even think bad thoughts, even
think our way outside of the herd. For if one could, one could then respond not with a sort
of vitriolic anger, but with laughter. As he says, to laugh at oneself as one would have
to laugh in order to laugh out of the whole truth, to do that, even the best so far lacks
sufficient genius. Even laughter may yet have a future. I mean, when the proposition the
species is everything, one is always none, has become part of humanity, and this ultimate
liberation and irresponsibility has become accessible to all at all times, perhaps laughter
will then have formed an alliance with wisdom, perhaps only gay science will then be left.
And Nietzsche's referring to what he thinks is an extremely dangerous development in the
late 19th century, which is the growth of humanitarianism, of kindness and gentleness.
It's not against those things in and of themselves, but they're totalitarian. They insist that
everything devolve around them. And he says, you know, there's this weird fruit that's
grown on the tree of the human species in the last few hundred years called the individual,
which doesn't follow the herd. But of course, if we can all become liberals and socialists,
we can stamp that out. It's a sort of happy go lucky totalitarianism.
Then he turns to the real issue, what are the meaning of teachers of the purpose of
existence? Heroes who show up on the stage and tell us, life means this, you must go
out and do your duty. You must save humanity. You must be kind to the poor and the oppressed.
There's something profound about the meaning of life. And he says, well, they actually
have a place. They actually have a function. Right? What they do is tell us there's something
in life that can't be laughed at. There's something serious beneath life, behind life,
underneath life, beware, do not laugh. And he says, well, of course, ultimately all
of these systems get exposed to reason. And the result is always laughter and comedy because
they're all absurd and ridiculous. None of them are provable. But nonetheless, there's
something new that's come out of this. Humans are the only animals that have grown a new
need, a need for a purpose. We feel the need to have a reason to go on living. And he says,
this is fascinating. Dogs don't do that. Has your dog ever come up to you and said,
it's a dog's life. Alpo three times a day. I'm just going to go ahead and do it all.
No, I mean, every animal does how to go on, but we have this other need. And the reason
is because teachers of the purpose of existence offer us cultural narcotics. They somatize
us. They make us, as it were, stoned and happy so that we cannot look at the suffering that
is most of life. And Nietzsche's point then of tough love is, that's the way you break
the addiction. I point out to you that it is all absurd.
Then he turns to the problem of intellectual conscience. I keep having the same experience
and keep resisting it every time. I don't want to believe, although it's palpable, that
the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience. Indeed, it has often seemed to
me as if anyone calling for an intellectual conscience was lonely in the most densely
populated cities as if he were in a desert. Everyone goes right on weighing things in
their scales of good and bad and right and evil. When anyone who cares to take a close
look at that finds that it's absurd, that evil has an indispensable place in the evolution
of the human species. It creates the sort of stormy conditions which make a tree grow
strong and firm. He says, I can't help feeling that deep down inside every single person
has at least the desire for an intellectual conscience. And he says, this is my type of
injustice, which leads directly to the next aphorism, where we're going to find that Nietzsche
is actually a profoundly fair person. This aphorism is called noble and common. He says, there's
a certain confusion. You find that there are people called, quote, normal or noble who
are incredibly unreasonable. They somehow throw their life on the rocks of art or science
or philosophy, squandering their lives for some higher ideal. He says, the common person
looks at that, and the first thing they think is, how's he getting over? How's he going
to turn that into money? I know that's what he's doing. He's going to turn it into money.
Everyone does it, turns it into money. And then after a certain point, when he realizes
this guy's not making any money, he says, well, he's an idiot. He's a dope. He says,
and that's the injustice of the common person. He can't imagine someone who doesn't have
his own straightforward proclivities. He says, on the other hand, there is the noble person
who aspires to higher things. But he too is unjust, because he turns to the common person
and says, well, you too have these aspirations. Why is history so stupid? People live subvenal
lives. And Nietzsche says, that is the injustice of the noble. They assume that everyone is
just like them, and so they don't judge them by the proper standards. So when you find
common people and say, why don't you aspire to higher things, Nietzsche says, that's an
unfair criticism. They're not capable of that. You must judge them by their own standards,
by their own rationality. And in fact, he says, the ultimate noble-mindedness is for
those who are noble to want to be the exception and not the rule. For the bulk of humanity
must be sympathetically understood as common. And that's not a bad thing. That's just
the way they are. They're not to be rebuked for that any more than the noble are for being
profound. Finally, I want to turn to, in this shock treatment, his fifth aphorism, unconditional
duties. All those who feel the need, feel they need the strongest words and sounds, the most
eloquent gestures and postures, in order to be effective at all, such as revolutionary
politicians, socialists, preachers of repentance, with or without Christianity, all of whom
cannot tolerate semi-success, talk of duties and o-a's of duties that are supposed to
be unconditional. And this clearly is a jive, it can't. This point is, oh yes, we have some
moral conviction I want to give you, which I can't prove to you. So all I do is I dress
it up in big words, oh, it's an unconditional duty. It's a categorical imperative. It's the
purpose of human existence. It says, well, you find that because there are certain people,
like, say, Kant, who are too noble, perhaps from their birth, perhaps from an experience
of their education, to be willing to serve as the function of a political party, or to
be someone's personal servant. But they still feel the need to be a function of something.
So they come up with these pompous principles, unconditional duties. And as he states, refined
servility clings to the categorical imperative, and is the mortal enemy of those who wish
to deprive duty of its unconditional character. That is what decency demands of them, and
not only decency. And I think this is a deep point. He's not being an anti-moralist. He's
saying, look, morality has its place. But why can't you tolerate semi-success? Why can't
you tolerate saying, you know, kindness is better than cruelty? Not because I'm certain
about it, but it just seems that way to me. He says, no problem with that. But no, you
have to say, no, I can prove to you that kindness is better than cruelty. He says, well, that's
pathological. I now want to turn to the discussion of the doctrine of feeling of power, one of
the most misunderstood doctrines in all of Nietzsche's writings. As we know, he believes
that we're all full of a will to power. And many people believe that means that he favored
inflection of cruelty and suffering. Nietzsche points out, no, no, no, no. Look, inflicting
suffering and cruelty on people is a form of showing your will to power. But it's the
will to power of a weak man. How much more easy is it to make someone suffer than to
benefit them? In other words, if you want to see who's the real megalomaniac, the one
who's really full of power, look at someone who's kind. What are they showing? I'm so
overflowing with life and power that I have some extra I can give you. And you'll be beholden
to me. That is the real warrior ideal of Nietzsche, not a cruel man, but a kind man. And a kind
man is kind for pathological reasons, because it fulfills his feeling of empowerment to
help people. That is, as he would say, a profound sense of empowerment. But he points out, never
will such a man be kind out of pity. Pity is the most agreeable feeling among those who
have little pride and no prospects of great conquests. Rather, he'll be kind out of a
sense of overflowing greatness. Another issue which Nietzsche has been incredibly misunderstood
about, because he's dialectical and he does say some ugly things on the subject, is women.
But as we'll find out, Nietzsche is a dialectical thinker. He sees two sides of every issue.
For all this misogyny, he has this wonderful little passage called Diverse Desatisfaction,
which he says, you know, the weak and feminine type. What they do when they see a problem
or suffering is they make it more beautiful, more profound. Whereas the masculine and strong
type, it makes things better. It actually improves them. Right, and here we see a little
thing that sounds like it's going to be a great piece of misogyny. But Nietzsche responds
by saying, if this type, the feminine, had not been super abundant in Europe since the
Middle Ages, the celebrated European capacity for constant change might never have come
into existence. China, for example, is a country in which large-scale dissatisfaction and the
capacity for change have become extinct centuries ago. And the socialists would like to bring
that to Europe. But fortunately, Nietzsche is not masculine. Nietzsche is feminine. Don't
make it better. That just makes us stupid like a herd. The feminine is the superior.
We should make it beautiful. We should make it profound. That's what enables change and
dynamism in life.
Okay. Finally, I want to turn to the last part of book one, from which we'll go right
to the end of the text after that, called The Craving for Suffering, which is a wonderfully
liberating text for anyone who spent much time on a college campus, where you will be
surrounded by students who protest injustice and suffering and cruelty in the world. And
Nietzsche is not against protesting suffering and cruelty. He thinks that's barbaric. He
doesn't want barbarians. But he wants to be honest about why they do it. He says, what
you really find is what young people want is suffering to come to them in the form of
a big dragon, this evil thing out there that's objective, so that they can dress up in armor
and be heroes in chivalrous nights and go kill the dragon. So they need suffering. They want
suffering and more and more suffering and suffering with others. Let's save the whales.
Let's save the amoebas. Let's save the plankton. Oh, yes. And he says, and the reason is, of
course, because they're bored with themselves as well as they should be. They don't have
the ability to create their own authentic suffering and then transcend it with art. So they look
to paint suffering on the wall like a big dragon. And he says, they do not know what
to do with themselves and therefore paint the distress of others on the wall. They always
need others and continually other others. Pardon me, my friends. I have ventured to
paint my happiness on the wall. Why must we be obsessed with suffering? It's not going
to go out of the world. The Buddha was right. Life is suffering. So why dwell on it, young
people? Think of the joys of life. Paint your happiness on the wall. Okay, finally now,
I wish to take you to the end of the text. To two important, I think extremely important
aphorisms, one number 340, the dying Socrates, in which he quite rightly points out that when
Socrates is about to take hemlock, he says, Oh, Crito, one of the students, I owe a
Sclepius a rooster. A Sclepius is the god of medicine. And the rooster is obviously a sacrifice
to him. And Nietzsche says, What does this really mean? You give a Sclepius a rooster when he's cured
of disease. What's the disease Nietzsche is being cured of? Life. Nietzsche experienced
life as, excuse me, Socrates experienced life as a weight. And he says, And this is a terrifying
thought. Because Nietzsche, the Socrates, the good soldier who always wore a chipper and
stoical domain on his face in his last dying breath with a sort of vicious vengeance said,
really, life is a disease and I've been cured at last. So he says, Therefore, we must overcome
the Greeks. Now that's a very perspectival point. You needn't read it that way. You could read it
as saying, I've overcome the fear of death. Therefore, give a Sclepius a rooster. But it is,
in its own way, a perfect example of perspectivalism. I now want to turn to a last and most important
aphorism called the greatest weight. The greatest weight is Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal return,
eternal recurrence, which is, I think, originally a Hindu notion, which is that we have cyclical time.
Everything that happens will happen again. 10,000 years from now, we'll all be sitting here
all over again, and I'll be saying the same words to you. And as we know, when the Hindus thought
of that as any sane man would, the first thing that occurred to them is what a nightmare.
90% of my life quit fantasizing. 90% of each of our lives is embarrassment,
humiliation, and stupidity. Who wants to relive their bedwetting? Right? Who wants to relive all
the wrong answers they gave in high school algebra? And all the times they got laughed at. And all
the times they said stupid, dopey things and felt bad about it later. Most of your life is embarrassing
and banal. So the Hindus said, well, we want to get off the life death wheel of karma. We want to
achieve nirvana, which is basically cosmic death. We don't want to be reborn. And Nietzsche said that
that was one of the biggest dangers facing Europe at the time. And it got a wonderful expression
in Schopenhauer's work, who said, we will all have real freedom when all of humanity gets together
on one day and drinks Jim Jane Jones Kool-Aid, Kimitz Collective Suicide. And he really thought
this was liberation. And it was considered a very profound thought. And Nietzsche responds by saying,
no, eternal return is an excellent test of whether you have the possibility of being a quote
ubermensch, which is not a superman, which is not a tyrant, which is an overman, which is the next
stage of man, the man who can see the truth of perspectivalism, the truth of groundlessness,
the truth of purposelessness, the truth of the fact that he might have to live this whole stupid
life over again and still say, yes, I'll take it anyways. Life is not a problem for me. It's full
of delightful possibilities. I can self-create myself in art. I can overcome myself in art.
In fact, it is art that makes perspectival truth bearable by making it beautiful.
So eternal return then becomes a litmus test. If when you think to yourself,
do I have to live my life all over again exactly as I have? If you can say yes to that and say,
with all its stupidity, with all my bedwetting, with all my wrong answers, I want it all over again
just as it is, Nietzsche says, then you are a philosophic soul. You've overcome that narcotic
need for a purpose to your life, and you are the next stage of human cultural development.
And let me be clear about one thing before I finish here. Very often that is depicted as
a sort of Aryan blonde beast in our old Schwarzenegger type. Nietzsche thought,
you can never go back to that. That's just barbarism. The higher form, the ubermensch would,
in fact, be like Nietzsche, a very sensitive soul, who for all his, quote, anti-Semitism,
was really an anti-anti-Semite. He had the very obnoxious habit of saying things like,
you know, because, by the way, I should point out that Germany was intensely anti-Semitic at
this point in something called Christian anti-Semitism. So what he would do is point that
and say, you know, the Old Testament is actually a great book. The sick part is the New Testament.
To read the Old Testament, it's better than Homer. People kill, they rape, they murder,
those were real men. It's the Nazarene that's distorted. And one last point on that subject,
he said, the only people more despicable than the Christians are, of course, the Germans,
who were afflicted with, he called it, racial scabies of the heart, who said,
have you ever noticed a German musician, the moment he creates something beautiful, he blushes?
Right? He has to always have his opera surrounded, and he is clearly referring to Wagner, his ex-friend,
has to have his opera surrounded with great, huge sets and theories. He says, no, no, no,
look at the Italian operas. Those are people who know how to live. Those are Ubermench. Why?
Because they'd be just as happy to have their, their sopranos go up there and go,
for three hours without a single word in it. Because they're not trying to be profound,
they're trying to be beautiful. They don't feel uncomfortable when they say something nice,
or when they say something beautiful, a beautiful phrase? It's not only a German does that.
And his perfect contrast is Beethoven and Goethe. One day they were walking together,
supposedly, and along came a member of the royal family, and Beethoven locked arms with Goethe
and said, we shall walk through, and they'll have to give way. And Goethe broke his arms. He said,
what a barbarian. Please, madam, after you. That is the Ubermench, not some sadistic tyrant,
but a cultivated, refined, refined person who sees laughter in everything and joyfulness in the
truth, who doesn't need a spiritual narcotic to get through life, who is compassionate out of
strength, not out of weakness and pity, and who judges the weak not as inferior, but as common,
by their own standard, not by his. Okay, I've given you a taste of Nietzsche. I think the only
better way to cash in this lecture is to turn to the text yourselves, and I think you'll find it
richly rewarding.
