David Hume is in many ways one of the most
important and I would urge attractive figures in the western philosophical tradition. A
man of great wit, affability, charm. Hume was, by all who knew him, regarded as a admirable
person, a pleasant person, a man who had very few arguments in his life, was very difficult
to ever race his temper. He only once became angry, apparently, and that was against Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, who had stated his house in accused Hume of stealing his ideas. If any of you
have read Rousseau and read Hume, you know that's a sign of Rousseau's paranoid insanity.
Hume and Rousseau could not be more entirely apart in their views. Nonetheless, given this
about Hume, he was, in his own lifetime, a remarkably obscure philosophical figure.
And this was largely the result of, one, the very skeptical nature of his conclusions.
He was thought to be very dreary and uninspiring, and the rather technical precision of his
arguments. He was a very difficult writer. He didn't inspire people. I will argue that
Hume has an inspirational side, but it's very much in keeping with his character. It's very dry.
It's very a dour sort of inspiration. In fact, as a way of illustrating the way people misconceive
Hume, when I first read Hume in college, I immediately assumed, because he's an incredibly
powerful and accurate analytic thinker, that I had a mental picture of the fellow as a very thin,
wiry, school marmish professor, very, very accurate and precise. In fact, the very picture of Emmanuel
Kant. I was much surprised to learn that, in fact, he was a large, robust, rotund,
Scotsman with a heavy, heavy brogue, who could always be counted on for a good joke,
a pint of ale, and a leg of mutton. He was very much a laughing philosopher.
Hume, in many ways, is one of the most challenging figures in the philosophic tradition up to this
point. The only one I could compare him to in this regard is Spinoza. You'll remember that Spinoza
was challenging in that he was the first complete rejecter of the Judeo-Christian ethic, completely
rejected the notion of the immortality of the soul, of freedom of the will, and we will find
Hume shares those beliefs, also his skeptical Judeo-Christian tradition. In a way, he's far
more damaging and challenging than Spinoza, whereas Spinoza is disgusted with that tradition
and finds it a name. Hume, as is his want, is amused by it. He thinks it's absolutely hilarious that
there are people who go to church. He thinks it's wonderful. He thinks it's the absolute quote,
these knees, that people believe that somehow they're not animals. And he thinks this is just
part of the good sport of life, that there are people out there who really believe such
absurd things. He does not want to dissuade them in any sense. He rather wants to laugh
with this small group of esoteric insiders, as it were.
Hume's historical significance is that he brought to full fruition the empiricist epistemology and
phenomenology that really begins with Hobbes, matures with Locke, as we saw is developed by Barclay.
Hume, in a certain way, brings it to a close. He takes it to its logical extremes, to its
point of logical conclusion, and sort of ties it up with a very nice bow.
Although he never made much great fame in his lifetime, afterwards he has become one of the
most important philosophers in the tradition. He had a profound effect on a certain Prussian
philosopher by the name of Immanuel Kant, who claims, I read David Hume, he awoke me from my
dogmatic slumbers. Kant claimed that Hume was, and I think one could say in defense of Kant,
that Kant was the only one who understood Hume in the 18th century with the possible exception
of Adam Smith. He was the only one who realized that this incredibly dry, dull, boring Scotsman
is in fact a wild man, and is in fact on to the deepest critique of the philosophic tradition
we have found yet. Since then, Hume has become a source of inspiration for utilitarian ethics in
the 19th century. We'll see the logical positivist movement of the 19th century, figures like Karnap,
Schick, Ayer, Wittgenstein, all claim that their ancestry runs to David Hume. He's become an
incredibly important thinker after his death. I would urge he was strongly ahead of his time.
Okay, enough sort of background on Hume. Let's then begin with his empiricist phenomenology.
Hume, like Barkley and Locke before him, recognized that all of our mental representations
can be divided into two classes. On the one hand are impressions, and on the other hand are ideas.
Now, Hume is aware that, in fact, beyond aware, Hume's perhaps biggest project as a philosopher
is the avoidance of dogmatism. And so he's aware that it would be dogmatic to say that our impressions
are the result of sense-statem. He wants to suggest that that's provisionally the case,
and that's what we seem to believe in common sense. And Hume, by the way, is a great partisan of
common sense. Presumably then, let us say that our impressions are the result of sense-statem,
but actually the way we distinguish between those and our ideas, copies of impressions,
is by their vivacity. Again, by that phenomenological property. Your visual representation of me,
when you look at me, is far more powerful and profound and sharp than is, say, your recollection
of what I looked like. There's far more detail in the first class. So that's the first class
of our mental representations, impressions, distinguished by their greater vivacity. The
second class are ideas or thoughts, and these are distinguished by their relative lack of force
and internal clarity. Presumably, there are copies of impressions. Again, your notion of,
your mental representation of me, when you close your eyes, is a copy of your actual sense-datum
of me, presumably. And in fact, there's another mark to suggest that one is the copy of the other,
the process of temporal sequence. You never have an idea of what I look like or image of me
before you've actually seen me. If anything, your ideas follow your impressions, and that
temporal sequence is a mark of copying or causality. Okay, now, Hume argued, or claimed,
rather, I should say, on the basis of an introspective and scientific observation,
that there were only three principles with which the mind associated the various ideas,
not impressions, but ideas that it entertains. And again, I want to be clear about something
about Hume. Hume is not arguing for any foundational view of the human mind. He claimed to be the
Newton of the moral sciences. He was going to establish his philosophy on the basis of scientific
observation. He says, from his introspective scientific observation of his own cognitive
states, there are only three principles that associate the various ideas or images we have
in the show between our ears. And the first of those is, of course, resemblance. Right,
we say that the representation you have of me now strongly resembles the representation you had of
me when I was giving perchance to my Barkley lecture. And certain strength of resemblance
leads one to posit identity. Right, but similarly, short of identity, we may say,
there is a stronger resemblance between my appearance and some other member of the audience's
appearance than either of our appearance towards, say, this lectern. And therefore,
we see how we form elementary set theory and elementary sorts of kinds. There's a stronger,
again, resemblance between the idea of me and any of you than between myself and the lectern.
That's the first principle of association. The second is contiguity. Right, all of our ideas
can be related in terms of their spatial relationships or temporal relationships.
So I am, from my perspective, to the right of the lectern presently and behind it. Now,
I'm to the left of the lectern and behind it, again, from my perspective. Similarly,
the sentences I'm pronouncing now follow the sentences I pronounced, say, some one minute
ago. So all of those representations fit into, as it were, spatial configuration and temporal
configuration. That's the other principle, contiguity. Now, we get to the third and foreign away,
the most important. And that is cause and effect. Right, you see me release the watch,
you see the effect of it falling, you attribute a causal agency.
Okay. Now, we have all the principles of association. Let's now talk about our knowledge. And again,
that can be broken down into one of two classes. The first class deals with the relations between
ideas in a purely formal sense. Through whom such knowledge is either intuitively certain
or, if not, it is demonstrable. Okay. So what would be examples? The common examples are the
propositions of mathematics, geometry, algebra, formula logic, are all cases where the association
where the truth of the sentences hinges on the relation between the ideas and that relationship
is purely formal. In other words, a computer can figure out, can formulate true mathematical or
logical propositions. The key for Hume is that such propositions have absolutely no existential
implications. We can accept all of Euclidean geometry as being true. Every proposition,
provable only Euclidean geometry, we can accept is true without their existing such a thing as a
triangle. Similarly, we can accept all the propositions as logic as true without believing
that there exists somewhere in the world a operator called the conditional or the disjunctive.
So that's a key point that that first class of knowledge, the relation between ideas is purely
formal and has no existential implications. It teaches us nothing about the world. It only
teaches us, as it were, a very rigorous sort of vocabulary that we might be able to use in
talking about the world. But in and of itself has nothing to say about existence and things of the
world. Things of the world are discussed in that second class of knowledge, which he calls
matters of fact. Those propositions which concern existential statements are statements of fact.
The first thing to note is that there is no logical basis for all of our knowledge of fact.
And how do we know that? Because counterfactuals are all possible,
which is to say, it is a fact that if I release this watch, it will fall. But it is entirely
logically possible that if I release this watch, it would float up to heaven. It never has,
right? I've never observed that myself. But there is nothing that logically constrains this watch
to either fall down or not to simply remain sustained in the air. Perhaps if I was the
amazing Kresge or something, I could do such a trick. But this point is, since counterfactuals
are all logically possible, right, then there is no logical basis for knowledge of matters of fact.
Well, then that raises, for Hume, the critical epistemological question. How do we know matters
of fact? Specifically, how do we know any matters of fact other than that which you are
presently sensing, right? So you have good sensual evidence to believe that I am up here
walking around. But how do you know, for example, that I really was here earlier talking about
Barkley? How can you infer that? How do you know that if you leave this room, this podium will
still be here? Or this lectern, I should say. And Hume says that the answer is the principle
of cause and effect, right? You see my contiguity moving over from an earlier lecture to this one,
and you assume that there is one agent who is causing all of these changes, similarly with
the lectern, you assume that unless something comes in to move it, its inertial force will
make it remain here. So the only way you can argue beyond your present sense datum, to the fact that
there is a world outside, that there are lights above you producing heat and light, is because of
the principle of cause and effect. That's the fundamental glue, as it were, epistemological glue
of the factual world, because it allows us to infer from sense to uncensed phenomena.
Now cause and effect is not known what we might call a priori, or before the fact, or before experience.
Rather, it only comes from the experience of constant conjunction. So again, back to our
great experiment, you did not know before you ever saw someone release an object that it would fall.
The only way you know that is that every time you've seen an object released, it falls.
That constant conjunction, release, fall, release, fall, is the only evidence you have
of that causal relation. And similarly it is with all the other causal relations. The only
way you know that eating a cheeseburger will satisfy you when you're hungry, if in fact it does,
is because that's happened in the past. It is entirely conceivable that you could eat a cheeseburger
and be three times as hungry afterwards as before. It doesn't happen that way because of the nature
of our constant conjunctions and experience, but all of our causal laws are just that. We see
regularity, constant conjunction, and from that we infer a causal relation.
Well, the implications for science, therefore, are very important. If science gives us causal
explanations, all it does in a way to use the metaphor from the right stuff is it pushes back
at the envelope of ignorance. So when we learn the causal law, what causes this watch to fall?
Well, I release it. Well, what causes it to accelerate at the rate it does? The laws of
gravity. What causes the laws of gravity? Beats me. We don't know yet. Perhaps we will someday.
Perhaps Grand Unified Theory will supply the explanation. But all you do is you push back
that envelope of ignorance one step further. That's an important empiricist and humane point,
is that science never offers absolute truth. It's provisional truth, constantly subject to
revision on the basis of new experience and new formulation. Okay. Back to our big epistemological
fish we want to fry. Given that all our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect,
and that cause and effect is in turn based on experience, the experience of conscious and
conjunctions, what warrants our belief and experience? Right? Well, it can't be reason, can it? Or logic.
That can't warrant our belief and experience, for it's logically possible that the future won't
resemble the past. Right? It's entirely possible that in 15 minutes from now, God will so change
the universe that whenever you release a watch, it will float up to heaven, or it will remain
suspended. You have no logical evidence to suggest that that won't happen. All you have is your past
experience, right? And your present experience. So clearly experience, which is the judgment that
the future in fact will resemble the present, can't be based on reason. And by the way, I should
point out, you could also make that argument retrospectively, as Bertrand Russell does.
How do we know the past doesn't, uh, is not different from the present? How do we in fact
know that once upon a time, you know, the sun really didn't move around the earth, and that the
the Bible didn't have it right, and things have changed since then? And that's, that's the puzzle
that Hume feels is the critical epistemological puzzle that has to be solved. Right? And clearly,
we do not have any recourse to logic or reason in answering this question.
Well, you can't base experience on cause and effect for the obvious reason that cause and
effect is based on experience, right? Our belief in causal laws is based on our experience of
constant conjunction. So you can't use those causal laws then circularly to support the
belief that the future will resemble the present or the past. Because of course, causal laws
presuppose that resemblance. And Hume luxuriates in this riddle for a while because he has a very
obvious answer and an answer which is going to offend all of the high brown intellectuals of
Europe. Why do we believe in cause and effect? It's a habit. It's a custom. There's no rational
basis for it whatsoever. It's not reason that teaches us cause and effect. It's instinct.
You can't dispense with believing in causal laws as you go about the world. When you get hungry or
you're going to say, well, I'm not going to eat for three days. That will fill me up. It's habitual
to believe that as cheeseburgers did me good before, they'll do me well again. So the point is
there's something extra rational which orients our behavior and understanding of the physical world.
It is irrational to believe in experience that the future will resemble the present, but it's
customary and it's in fact inescapable in practical life. Common sense knows better than
philosophic insight. So experience then is warranted by a sort of natural instinct instead of a
rational proof. How can we in fact argue that pervasively? The first thing he points out is
notice simpletons, children, animals all follow causal laws, don't they?
Right? You've all heard the experiment of Pavlov's dog, but can children, simpletons,
and animals do logical proofs? They are all able to observe causal laws and clearly can't rationally
demonstrate anything. So the implication is it must be some sort of instinctual response.
Okay, if all of our knowledge of matters of fact is based on cause and effect, right?
And all matters of cause and effect is based on experience, what is the origin of the
roughly interchangeable metaphysical doctrines of power, force, and necessary connection?
Well, he points out, first of all, there's no logical doctrine of necessary connections in
the world, because as we've seen before, logical proofs have no existential implications.
Right? So if we want to argue that there is force in the world, we can't do so on a logical basis.
Also, force, necessary connection, can't arise from sense. I mean, what color is a necessary
connection? What flavor is it? When do you actually experience a necessary connection?
And he's careful to point out some of the errors that in fact, later thinkers will think are
profound proofs of it. Tolstoy made a lot out of, he said, you want to show,
want me to show you force? Look. Right? I will to lift my arm, and it's up. Force.
And he says, no, no, no. That's in fact the experience of constant conjunction. Every time
you desire to lift your arm, it's gone up. You want to do the proof? Want me to prove it to you?
We'll see if we can't give you palsy somehow. And you'll sit there for the next three hours and
try and lift your arm, and it won't go up. Where'd the force go? Where'd the necessary connection
go? Must have disappeared. Maybe God intervened. So he points out that in fact, all of your sense
of physical force in controlling your bodily actions are entirely on the basis of the constant
conjunction you've had between your will and the movement of your body. And there are times when
you'll be in deliriums or sick, when you won't be able to move them, and you'll try, and you'll fail.
Okay, so then Hugh answers this question finally. Necessary connection, force, energy, all those
metaphysical doctrines, they're just powerful psychological conditions. You've seen constant
conjunctions which are so constant and so sure that your mind just leaves the next step and says,
well, it's necessary. Can't be avoided. But it's just a psychological phenomena.
In fact, since all ideas have their origin and sense, if there's no sensual basis for an idea,
we can say as a fact that there is no, that the notion itself is a chimera, right, is a myth,
is a fantasy. And here's where we turn of course to Barclay's, Hugh's discussion of Barclay.
All right, Barclay had said, well, when do we experience matter, the most sensual experience
of matter? And Hugh, in his wonderful sense of what says, well, of course you're right.
As a brilliant criticism by Barclay, we never do experience matter. Now, what color was a mind
again? And what flavor is your mind? What does it taste like? We never experienced a mind either.
Well, in that case, if you want to get rid of matter, fine, but we'll throw a mind out with it too.
And then all that there'll be in our universe is one damn thing after another.
Right? We just have one representation after another, no mind to hold them,
no matter to project them. And Hugh, of course, is happy with that answer because his point is that
our belief in matter and our belief in mind isn't a result of metaphysical speculation,
it's life. Right? It's a common sense intuition and common sense is more than functional for
getting us through the world. Okay, then Hugh moves on to the discussion of freedom or liberty
and necessity. And again, Hugh, the peacemaker argues quite controversially, you know, no one's
ever really disagreed about this. People think they disagreed, but they didn't. The more you think
about it, all reasonable people know that necessity and causation, which are the essence of determinism,
are simply the experience of constant conjunctions and the belief that the future will resemble the
past. And that's natural to all animals or all higher animals. Right? And if you've got that,
you're happy with determinism. The other side, liberty is simply the absence of external restraint.
No one's tying you down, you are free to stand up and leave at any moment.
Liberty then has nothing to do with some abstruse doctrine of a free and uncaused will,
and it's perfectly consistent with the causally determined universe. So we have liberty,
hopefully if we have libertarian governments, and we have determinism in that certainly all of our
actions follow causal laws. In fact, he says, if our actions had no causal laws, right, if our
actions were not a result or caused by our character, then we would have no basis for moral
evaluation, for punishment or blame. And consider, if I was at this moment to pull out a gun and
shoot someone in this audience, Hume says, you must believe that that was caused by the nature
of my character. If you don't, you think that was a truly free act, that is to say uncaused,
then it is spontaneous. There's no reason for you to believe that I would ever do that again,
since nothing caused me to do it. I did it once, maybe I won't do it again. So then why in heaven's
name would you bother to punish me? Right, certainly won't deter me from doing it again. I'm not
caused to do it. You just point out to me, we wish you wouldn't do that. And then we cart the body
off and I go on with my lecture. Hume says, of course, it's not that way. If I pulled out a gun,
you would infer from that that I'm some sort of psychopathic maniac. And that it's on the basis
of that causal connection between psychopathic maniacism and shooting members of an audience
that you're going to grab a pair of handcuffs and drag me out of here. And if you didn't believe
there was that causal relation, then punishment would only be an act of bizarre vengeance. So we
obviously believe in that sort of causal law in action. And in fact, it's demonstrated in our
interactions with our friends. Francis, we know what our friends are going to do. If I put my hand
out, he's going to grab it and shake it. If I ask him how he is, he's not going to spit in my eye.
I know the fellow nice enough. He's going to give me a stock answer. Fine. How are you?
There's no surprises there. And Hume, of course, has a wonderful little joke. He says,
everyone believes in causal determinacy and behavior and practice. It's only in theory they don't.
Go by, well, he talks about Sharon Cross, but let's say Times Square in New York City.
So to anyone, have you ever noticed that people don't go by Times Square, take out their wallet
and stick it in the middle of the ground and walk away and say, I'll come back for that in an hour?
For some reason or other, they seem to think that people will be costly determined to pick it up
and take the funny green paper out. Right? And Hume says the fact that no one does that proves
that everyone believes in causal determinacy. And that if you put your wallet in the middle
of Times Square and came back for it an hour later, you wouldn't find it. And we all feel fairly
certain of that. Now, Hume now turns to, in his discussion of the inquiry concerning human
understanding, his chance to, for what I would call sort of payback. Hume was a remarkable
prodigy in his youth, wrote a fantastic book at I think the age of 24 called The Treatise
Concerning Human Nature, and applied for a position teaching pneumatic philosophy at the
University of Edinburgh, and was blackballed by the Scottish Calvinist clergy because of his
agnosticism. I think that profoundly affected Hume's beliefs ever since and his motivations in
philosophy, but he certainly realized that the best way of getting back was not to denounce or
scream or be angry, but to laugh, to joke. And that raises his discussion of miracles. He says,
let's first define what do we mean by a miracle? A miracle is simply, by definition, a violation
of the rules of nature, of the laws of nature, which are established through the sum of human
experience, through the sum of our observed constant conjunctions. So miracles are that which
there's no rational basis to believe in. That's the definition of a miracle, something which is
incredibly irrational to believe in. He says, well, notice something. Have you ever noticed how
there are very few miracles that occur in Times Square? Very few miracles occur in the White House
or in NASA labs. Most miracles seem to occur among very primitive peoples, and in very barbaric
situations. We have our Lady of Guadalupe, but we don't seem to have our Lady of Cambridge.
So he says, oh, that's one thing to make you sort of suspicious about miracles to begin with.
Then he goes on to, however, say something, which is, raises the relationship between something
called exoterica and esoterica. And it's one of the forms of free thinking, enlightened humor.
There is, however, a deep, philosophic point to that. There's a deep, philosophic point to
laughter itself. What is the only thing you can't laugh at? The sacred. Everything else can be laughed
at. In effect, then, by laughing at everything, humor is desacralizing everything. Everything
is worthy of laughter. Everything is a jest. And that, he thinks, is a means of human liberation.
Okay. I've gone through skepticism. I should point out one of his interesting arguments
about religion that comes up. He has a mock dialogue in the text with a peccurion who says,
well, actually, morality has nothing to do with religion. We could all be atheists, and we would
still be just as moral as we were before. There's no logical basis from which you can go to a belief
in a God to moral behavior. And Hume says, I think quite wisely, sir, I would acknowledge you to be
a just reasoner, but not a good citizen. You say that because there is no logical reason or argument
from the belief in God to moral behavior, that in fact, no one actually makes that leap from belief
in God to moral behavior. But of course, most people aren't very good reasoners. There are a lot
of people who do believe in God, and it restrains them from the most hideous acts. And therefore,
I would account you a very bad citizen for speaking that argument publicly. And that,
I think, is Hume's considered view. He does not believe in God. He doesn't believe in religion.
He thinks it's absolutely laughable. But he would be extremely upset if anyone were attempt to argue
against it publicly. Right? If there are people who would go out there and commit hideous crimes
if they didn't believe in God, best to keep those sheep in line and stop them from becoming wolves.
And it's very much again that exoterica esoterica notion. There's a small circle of people who are
mature enough and responsible enough to realize that even if God does not exist, they still have
moral duties and responsibilities. For those who do not realize that it's simple, the best thing is
to keep your mouth shut and not tell them anything. All right. We're left, however, with a certain
amount of skepticism from Hume. And Hume is quite direct about skepticism. He says,
if we take the Cartesian problematic seriously and doubt our faculties, there is no way to
think your way out of a paper bag. If you doubt your faculties, there's no solution to skepticism.
And in fact, skepticism is not ever logically refutable. It is entirely logical, logically
possible that each and every one of you are the only thing in existence in the universe.
And everything else is just a dream or delusion.
Well, how then do you refute skepticism? And this is Hume's brilliant answer. You certainly don't
do it philosophically. How do you do it? You get hungry. You may think you're the only thing in
the universe, but when you get hungry, you will go out for a cheeseburger and a Coke.
Practical life is the solution to skepticism. It has no practical consequences.
Why would anyone ever believe in such a doctrine? So skepticism is refuted by common life, and
that's the Humean Scottish School of Common Sense. You want to know how to answer these questions?
Not through abstract reason, through life. What's the point of believing you're the only one in
the world? It's awfully lonely. Wouldn't it be better off to believe we're each other there?
Isn't it practically more fulfilling and hence the importance of practical life?
Okay, well if that extreme skepticism then is simply a joke, and Hume does in fact think it is.
He has a wonderful little passage where he says that our skeptic, who doubts his own existence,
is like a dreamer. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join in the laugh against
himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement and can have no other tendency
than to show the whimsical condition of mankind a most act and reason and believe,
though they are not able, by their most diligent inquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the
foundation of these operations or to remove the objections which may be raised against them.
What's important about that passage is he's saying skepticism, right, is irrefutable,
except for practical life, at which point you realize that all skepticism is just a joke.
It's just a sort of a very dry sense of humor. What have we read so far in this book?
It is filled with skepticism. What kind of a book is this? This is a joke book, Hume is saying.
There's nothing serious in this book. Read this and laugh. That's what you should get out of philosophy.
It's a lot of fun. It's like playing chess. Nothing hangs on it. What hangs on life? Good
mutton. Good ale. Good fellowship. Good humor. That's what's important in life. This, if I've
amused you for 30 minutes, wonderful. You've gotten more than enough out of philosophy. That's
all you could get out of it. But then he does get serious. He says, however, there is a lesson
to be drawn, not from an extreme skepticism, but from a moderate skepticism. And this comes back
to his own personal history. And this is where I think assumes ultimately most liberating project
and one of the reasons why he still is speaks to us today. He tells us
that the great majority of mankind have a tendency to be rather certain of their opinions.
They tend to believe that what they believe is absolutely certain and true. What other people
believe is insane and evil. And yet we can't even show any logical basis for our belief in cause
and effect. So then what do we call that nature of belief? Dogmatism. And that is the humane
project. What do you do with skepticism when you find some dogmatic thinker who tells you, well,
the world is really mind and matter or someone else says, no, it isn't. It's just matter.
You sit them down and you give them a wee small tincture of fear. A wee small tincture of skepticism.
And from that, hopefully they'll learn a little bit about quote hubris before they blackball
someone from a university because he doesn't believe in the right version of Calvinism.
He pointed out to him how impossible it is to demonstrate Calvinism in the first place. And
maybe they'll be a little more open minded. I think this is a topic which is very germane,
not only for our culture and society, but for our high culture today as well and an academy.
Right. I think it's important for us to realize that human is right. The point of skepticism is to
teach us to be a little bit less dogmatic, to realize that even if I think A and you think B,
that doesn't mean that you're stupid or I'm evil. We may just equal have equally tenable views,
or I may think minus slightly more tenable, but it doesn't make you wrong or stupid because
you disagree. There's plenty of room for disagreement short of logical demonstration.
And Hume's point is that the vast bulk of what's important to us is short of logical
demonstration. Therefore, the ultimate virtue that we must have is toleration, is to learn to be
open minded, especially with people we disagree with, to overcome our tendency towards dogmatism.
And I don't think it's coincidental that Hume speaks of those he thinks are worst in the dogmatism.
And he says, if any of the learned, speaking of university professors, if any of the learned
be inclined from their natural temper to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tainture of
perinism, skepticism, might abate their pride by showing them that the few advantages which they
may have attained over their fellows are but inconsiderable if compared with the universal
perplexity and confusion which is inherent in human nature. In general, there is a degree of
doubt and caution and monesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision ought forever to accompany
a just reason. And I can't help feeling that that is in fact the ultimately most fruitful project
of the Enlightenment and Hume represents it. The critique of dogmatism which he associated with
rationalism, he associated with the continental tradition, is the critique of the tendency to
pound the desk. And certainly we've seen that and we'll see it in subsequent thinkers, philosophers
who tells everyone before me was an idiot. All the people who disagree with me are swine.
And Hume's deep point is that nowhere is that more prevalent than among people with PhDs.
They are probably the most dogmatic people on the planet. And Hume I think is actually angry.
His view is of all the people in the world, they are the least excusable for that. For if they could
think their way out of a paper bag they would realize they can't be sure about almost any of
their beliefs except for mathematics and logic. Aside from that everything is provisional.
Then how dare they and I think what he's really concerned about is not just blackballing
you know young professors as we found happened during the McCarthy period but also something worse
perhaps the pedagogical equivalent of eating ones young telling your students that well this is
the truth I'm teaching you now. I know you'll read other books but they're wrong. My opinions those
are the important ones and I can prove it all. And that's what Hume distains. The life of the mind,
the life of education should be cheerful, should be happy, should be open-minded, should be playful,
there's nothing very serious going on here, there's nothing crucial worth killing one another over
or denouncing one another over. We should enjoy ourselves, it should be light, it should be open
minded, it should be just and moderate. I think from this you will get a sense that for all of his
agnosticism Hume is in his own way perhaps the most vocal expression of Jobean secularism.
Right? I mean he in a way does have that Augustinian strain of humility and of piety
and yet he's completely secular. I think that's what's intriguing about that tradition which very
much suffuses in the Anglo-American world is once it becomes secularized that sort of metaphysical
posture has a certain charm and endearing value to it. It is the first time, it is only from that
perspective that tolerance, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion can actually be seen as a
virtue. Right? Well I should point out that Hume dies in 1776, the year of the American Revolution.
America does enact freedom of belief, freedom of speech, but not as a positive good. I mean most
Americans had done it because they had no choice. There were too many sects in North America to
maintain an orthodoxy and so it was a marriage of convenience, they were forced to allow freedom of
belief. In fact it didn't always obtain everywhere. Massachusetts retained an established church
till the 1830s as did Connecticut, as did several colonies. It was only with Hume that it begins
to say that's not a necessary evil at all, that's the essence of the good life. There's nothing so
serious in those churches that can't be laughed at occasionally and there's nothing so serious about
my own work that can't be laughed at and in fact should be laughed at. If you want to know really
moral insight about the world, it's not philosophy texts, maybe it's history. Hume became an historian,
that's one of the other reasons I know he's such a wise man. He realized what was really important.
Finally I want to offer one more reason I think that this Humean liberation, critique of dogmatism
and rationalism is so valuable for us and it's because it's something philosophers call reflexive.
It can be used upon itself. Hume ends his work with a bit of spleen at the rationalist and scholastic
tradition that he felt was oppressive. He says once we know that the only sort of knowledge you can
have, that's certain, demonstratively certain, is logic and mathematics or matters of fact evidence
based on experience. When we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must
we make? If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance,
let us ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain
any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Committed then to the
flames. For it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. How would we reflectively apply
Hume to Hume? We would point that Dave, there's more to religion than that. Religion gives people
spiritual solace. If people need what William James called moral holidays or cosmological holidays,
why deny them? As long as they're not dogmatic, why should you be dogmatic?
And I think that is ultimately when that Humean ethos hits the United States in the late 19th
century and gets its ultimate clarification in William James. That is exactly where it ends.
Hume is turned against himself to say, look, you too must be tolerant of people who believe in
religion and in Christianity. It has its value for those people and you must be open-minded.
