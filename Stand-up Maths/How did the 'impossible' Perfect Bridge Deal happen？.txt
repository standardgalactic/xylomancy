In a recent video I said that the live stream dream could not have been playing an unaltered
version of Minecraft because the probability of them getting the luck that they did was one
in 2.0 times 10 to the 22. I just said there's no way that's ever going to happen and I tried to
put a limit on how often humans could do something and I said if you had 10 billion humans doing the
same thing once a second over and over and over again for a century the 10 billion human second
century is 3.1 times 10 to the 19 a smaller number so anything that actually occurs to a human has
to have odds below one in that and as an example patricia the current world record holder in craps
the chance of her game occurring because it's just pure random luck is 1.6 times 10 to the 12
okay all good but then people have pointed out that in 2011 four senior citizens playing
a card game in warwick shear in england got a perfect bridge deal they all had a full suit
each and the probability of that happening is 2.2 times 10 to the 27 we're talking
nearly a hundred thousand times less likely than what happened to dream and that actually
happened so the question now is do i o dream an apology this video is sponsored by the great
courses plus a subscription service with thousands of factual videos available on demand more about
them and an extra mass question at the end of the video first up what's the deal with a perfect
bridge deal this is where an entire deck of cards is dealt out to four players and then when each
player turns over their hand they see all their cards are from the same suit and this is what
wender ron allen and norman claim happened to them in warwick shear in november 2011 although
technically they were playing wist which was a precursor game to bridge but the deal and all
of this is exactly the same so i'm just going to refer to it as a perfect bridge deal and they're
pretty adamant it happened said ron i would swear all my grandchildren's lives it was not fixed
oh bold statement ron but several newspapers picked it up at the time and most if not all of them
featured this number the 2.2 times 10 to the 27 probability so now we have to work out first of
all is that number correct and secondly what actually happened in their description of what
happened they said it was the first hand of the night so i'm going to use a brand new deck of cards
to recreate what happened okay don't need the advertising cards don't need the two
jokers right well i say recreate what happened of course we're not going to get the perfect deal
but we can still follow along with the steps and keep track of the mathematics of how likely it is
to get that perfect deal now they said that they shuffled the cards a few times so i'll do that
they then dealt the cards out well they cut them and then they dealt them out between the four
players so importantly if you're playing a wist or bridge you deal out the entire deck so i actually
think it's easiest to just keep track of how many possible starting arrangements of the deck would
lead to having a perfect deal and then our probability is that many arrangements out of
the total number of arrangements possible of a deck of cards and that we know it's just 52
factorial because there's 52 cards that could start on top 51 underneath that 50 all the way down
okay so i've now shuffled the cards twice they then cut the cards somewhere like that and they
started dealing so the first card i'm dealing to the first imaginary player that could be any card
in the deck all it's doing is specifying what suit we want this first player to end up with so that
could be any of the 52 i'm holding the next one can be any card that's not the same suit as this
one and there are 13 and that suit so this is any of the remaining 39 possible cards okay this one's
any of the remaining 26 the other two suits that aren't here there's now one suit left for the fourth
player so that's any of the 13 that could be there now the next card going to the first player again
that can be any card that matches whatever suit this one is and so that's any of the 12
outstanding cards from that suit likewise any of the 12 from that suit 12 from that one 12 from
that one and then this one's any of the 11 from this one 11 from this one 11 from this one 11
from this one so apart from the first cards which were 52 39 26 and 13 these next cards
each hand is just 12 factorial so our total number of hands which give you a perfect deal
is 52 times 39 times 26 times 13 times 12 factorial to the power of 4 and then it's all of that out
of the 52 factorial possible combinations you could turn the handle on that to crunch out a number
or you could cancel out a bunch of factors top and bottom whatever you want to do it ends up being
1 in 2 octillion 235 septillion so on all the way down 301 million 560 thousand so there you are
that's where the number comes from obviously what i've dealt out now isn't going to be a perfect
hand so what did the first person get they got oh my goodness they got all spades how did that
happen what about the next person they've got all hearts but you saw me get a new deck of cards
you saw me shuffle it twice we cut the deck and but yet a perfect bridge deal the probability of
this happening is only 2.2 in 10 to the 27 this cannot have just happened for the record i did
actually execute a perfect bridge deal however as you may have noticed from the concentration on
my face when i was shuffling something suspicious was going on suspicious but legitimate right i
legitimately think this is what they did the steps that i just went through i'm going to do it again
because of course i've got more brand new decks of cards i have a lot of these and the first
key bit of information is the order in which the cards start so once you get rid of the advertising
cards and the jokers the rest of the cards in a deck are already clumped by suit this is just how
the deck starts so you can see you got all the hearts all the clubs all the diamonds all the
spades we actually don't care about the ordering within them i mean they do happen to go ace through
king ace through king and then it flips in the middle king through race king through race but
we don't care what order the cards are when the people get them in their hand we just care that
they're all the same suit so all we really care is where the suits are and they're clumped they're
all together there's one suit next suit next suit next suit and if you deal cards in bridge by just
giving the first person the first 13 cards the next person the next 13 this would work but you
don't you give this to the first person second person third person fourth person then back to the
first person so we've got to spread the suits out so every fourth card is the same suit and we
do that with what are called pharaoh shuffles so i did two pharaoh shuffles which is just a fancy
name for a perfect interleaf shuffle so the way this works first of all you put the deck into two
exact halves that's the 26 cards that's 26 cards and then when you push them together they need to
perfectly alternate so you have one from one side then one from the other one from one side
and then one from the other there we go
and then you just push that all the way along and there it is a perfect pharaoh shuffle so you can
see it goes one on this side then one then one then one then one then one and normally a riffle
shuffle they'd be clumped a bit you they would not be singles but this is singles the whole way
this um this is just a pointless little flourish to get all the cards back into a little pack
and now you can see they've been reordered but in a very systematic way you've now got all the
black suits together you got all the red suits together that was a terrible spread uh and then
they alternate within those so we're halfway there they go space clubs space clubs space
clubs all the way along and then you've got diamonds hearts diamonds hearts all the way along
so we're going to do a second pharaoh shuffle i am specifically doing out pharaoh shuffles and
that means that the outermost cards don't change and you achieve that by when i take off the bottom
deck the bottom most card which has always been the ace of spades when i start pushing them together
i make sure that goes on the bottom there it is and then we push all the way along
and now we've got um you can see all the black ones all the red ones and the bottom card is
still the bottom card and actually the top card is still the top card so this is an out pharaoh
shuffle uh now i put all those together and we've got the exact condition required to get a perfect
bridge deal look at that then now the suits uh perfectly alternate later so you get uh all four
suits in each group of four and it goes space diamonds clubs hearts space diamonds clubs hearts
the actual order is not important what is important is every fourth card is the same suit also they
did cut the deck but that actually doesn't make a difference to the the kind of the cycle there in
because cutting the deck you're just taking some off one end you're putting them on the other end
every fourth card is still the same suit so i could cut this as many times as i want like that and
the deal will still work so the first card out happens to be um spades i didn't know what suit
that was going to be because of the cut but i do now know that the next three cards will all be
different suits and then we go back to spades and then we've got hearts and then we've got clubs
then we've got diamonds and then this carries um all the way down so that's my theory because it
was the first hand of the night they started with a new deck of cards uh they shuffled them twice
they accidentally did perfect interleaved shuffles and then when they doubt them out into their fore
hands everyone got a complete suit except that is not the only way it could have happened when i
started playing around this i realized there were other options but before we get to those
we're going to take a closer look at what actually happens when you do a perfect farrow
shuffle and for that purpose i have of course got another brand new deck of cards i'm going to
perfectly out farrow shuffle this eight times in a row we'll speed the footage up
and watch what happens to the order of the cards
so
and that's eight all right i should make it very clear i'm i'm now um video good enough
at doing a perfect farrow shuffle i'm not good enough to do it live on stage but if i'm filming
it and i have the luxury of editing afterwards good enough so now after eight of these you can see
they've returned to exactly the same original starting order but we could have done in shuffles
now i have the cards back in their original order i can conveniently show you a different
type of farrow shuffle so instead of doing the out shuffles like i was doing before i could do
in shuffles which means that the outermost cards move in so the bottom card the ace of spades
doesn't stay on the bottom i move it over slightly so now it starts one in and the knock-on effect
is the top card doesn't stay the top card it's now one over it's slightly uh in as well so you
can see now what was the bottom card is now the second card in same thing goes all the way along
and to what was the top card is now the first card in so that is an in farrow shuffle and if we do
two of those give me a second if i re-split the deck uh that looks like it there no off by one
you know you just got to judge it by eye if they've been properly shuffled it's a bit harder to do
i'm kind of cheating because i know uh what the card should be okay there we are there's my next in
shuffle done and lo and behold i give these a cut and then start dealing and once again
we have exactly the same situation so i had a bit of a think about it went you know what hang on
it doesn't have to be out shuffles you could instead do two in shuffles or you could do any
combination of out and in shuffle so if you do an in and an out or then an out and an in
you still end up with the cards with each suit perfectly spaced out for a perfect deal so that
actually makes it even more likely again they could have started with a brand new deck of cards
done any two types of perfect riffle shuffle it doesn't matter where they started lining up as
long as it's an in or an out two of those any number of cuts anywhere in the deck deal it
and you get the perfect deal um although question now is if if actually this was two in shuffles
that works how many in shuffles would it take before a deck gets right back to where it started
and so um i ran the calculation on it and it turns out 52 so out shuffles if you do eight
out shuffles in a row you get back to where you started if you want to use in shuffles to get
back to where you started 52 i am not going to do 52 in shuffles to show that that works because
i don't think you'd want to see oh wait hang on what am i getting i'm just this is coming in live
now it turns out you would like to see that so i'll tell you what i'll do it live on patreon as a q
and a and so if you're one of my patreon supporters thank you so much all of you who are then you can
watch me do it live and ask me questions as i do it it's going to take a while and i'll then release
the footage on my second channel so everyone can check it out so there you are i will do
52 in shuffles but even that is not the worst case scenario we can take a closer look at what
actually happens if we do out shuffles on a brand new deck of cards the aces at both ends as we know
don't go anywhere my favorite two cards though are the fiver clubs and the fiver diamonds they swap
each time you do an out shuffle they just switch places and they go backwards and forwards in their
own little two cycle okay now the two of hearts it goes to where the three of hearts was three of
hearts moves to where the five of hearts was the five of hearts goes over to where the nine of hearts
was that moves to the four of clubs that moves the seven of diamonds which goes backwards to where
the ace of clubs was that goes to where the king of diamonds is and that goes back to the start
so these eight cards form a cycle and each time you do an out shuffle they all move one around in
fact the rest of the cards form eight cycles there are six of them and for all the cycles
to simultaneously be back where they started you need to do the lowest common multiple of their
lengths of shuffles and thankfully two and one both divide into eight that's why eight shuffles
get you back where you started for in shuffles it's a bit more complicated because all of the cards
form their single cycle of 52 cards so that's why you have to do it 52 times you've just got to
go all the way around this giant cycle if you want to see more about shuffles and cycles the
mathematician and magician Tori Nogas has some fantastic videos going into the maths and the
theory behind it and she does that in far better detail than I could I just got obsessed with how
long I could get the repeating point to be with different combinations of shuffles so we already
know if you do out out out over and over again that's eight in in in gives you 52 I then checked
in out in out and if you keep repeating and alternating between the two 504 504 alternating
shuffles before you get back to where you started and if you start on the out and then alternate
in out in out it's exactly the same from here in it's a bit annoying to have to type them all out
so I'm just going to swap them o's for out eyes for in and I'm going to give you the
fewest number you need to then repeat to get the pattern I started looking at combinations of three
and all of these gave me 60 and I realized these are actually all the same they're all two
ounce followed by an in followed by two ounce then an in you're just starting at different points
in the cycle same as these ones and that doesn't make a difference so I'm only going to give one
example and doesn't matter where you start in that range now I wanted to see if I could find
extremely long and unexpectedly short repeating cycles so if you do out in in out in in in 8,820
before repeats ridiculous those seven shuffles you have to do 8,820 shuffles to get back where
you started these eight only 16 seven out and then a single in you just do all of that twice
and you get right back to where you started now like the fact that this shows us if you do a little
bit of working out that an in followed by seven out followed by an in is the equivalent to doing
a single out and we can actually start to get some interesting equations showing which combinations
the shuffles are equivalent to other ones and when we had that 52 cycle from doing all ins that
tells us that 51 ins is equivalent to an inverse in and we could carry on with this I decided
just to find one more ridiculous long one and call it a day I found this run of 13 out in ins
which doesn't repeat until after 20,000 and 20 shuffles just ridiculous but the point of all
of this where we started is to find out which shuffles set up a perfect deal and we already know
that two out shuffles that works it turns out two in shuffles also works get a new deck two in
shuffles you're ready to go you can actually do an out and then an in that works and you can do it
in and an out that works and there are loads more in fact there are infinitely many if you do 28 ins
that sets you up if you do an in seven out two in seven out and an in and I could keep generating
these without ever running out but the important ones are these which have a realistic chance of
actually happening given any pair of in and out Faro shuffles will order the deck to give you a
perfect deal of course it's way more likely than assuming the deck is always perfectly randomized
and this starting condition of having all the suits together doesn't only happen in a new deck
when you're playing bridge a lot of the time when you're putting a card down it's because the suit
of the card you're playing matches the other cards already down now it's not going to happen
every game but a lot of the time particularly if there's a human picking up the cards who likes
organizing things you will end up accidentally putting the suits together and so it's going to
happen way more often than the naive calculation indicated and when this happened in 2011
peter rollett of the api article went through old newspaper archives and found stories of perfect
bridge deals one per decade including my favorite story from 1929 when it happened again at a game
in London and that story says it had happened five times before that on the record going right back
to a game in 1888 so there you are that's why our senior citizens playing cards are with dream
on the wrong side of the 10 billion human second century assuming that everything was perfectly
fair and correctly shuffled was incorrect in the case of our senior citizens the deck was already
stacked and i maintain the same thing still applies to dream speaking of good luck this video
is sponsored by the great courses plus and i had decided that they could sponsor this video about
the bridge deal before i remembered that my friend art benjamin has done a whole series for them
about magic and math i can probably be excused because i've got over 11 000 videos and i
tend to watch the ones about history i like them because they fall somewhere between a documentary
series and an actual proper course only there's no like uh tests or checks that you're paying
attention you can just enjoy watching the videos and if you want to sign up for a free trial you
can do that and support this channel by going to the great courses plus dot com slash stand up
maths i do recommend starting with art benjamin's series uh episode five is all about perfect shuffles
pretty much what i covered here but in magic you can use in and out shuffles to move the top card
to any position in the deck using binary super interesting and actually a bit of an open question
you can actually use in and out shuffles to move any card to any position and i can say that because
it occurred to me that 52 cycle of in shuffles does that just badly so i have no idea what the most
efficient way of moving any card to any position is but it can definitely be done there you are
didn't expect an open question in the sponsorship message did you there you are i haven't looked
into it if anyone can find out uh let me know if you just want to learn more magic and math i highly
recommend art benjamin's series look at look so many episodes including magic squares there you are
learn to do a magic square how hard can it be so i do head on over to the great courses plus dot
