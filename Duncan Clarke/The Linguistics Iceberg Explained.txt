Language. It's what I'm using to talk to you right now. The thoughts I have in my
brain are being transferred to your brain because I'm making both sounds that you
interpret as symbols of meaning. Today I'll be flipping things in on
themselves and using language to talk about language itself. I'm sure you're
familiar with the iceberg format. I'll be talking about a bunch of different
topics and as the video goes on those topics become increasingly obscure and
strange. Let's go.
Octopi. The unbearable agony of referring to octopus in the plural. I'm a firm
believer that every single English speaker has had a conversation like
this. Yeah man, so I was at the aquarium and there were a bunch of octopuses or is
it octopi? That doesn't sound right either. Who cares? It turns out that the
quote-unquote correct pluralized form is indeed octopuses. This is just one
example of how weird and inconsistent plurals can be in the English language.
The reason this happens has to do with where the words come from. Octopus comes
from Greek rather than Latin and in Greek they would pluralize it to octopodes.
Instead of doing that, English takes the Greek word and gives it a more familiar
English inflection. Octopuses. One of my favorite examples of weird English
plurals is what happens when you use the plural rule of one word on another. You
have one ox, you have many oxen, you have one fox, so you must therefore have many
foxen. But no, you have many foxes. I tend to prefer foxen though.
French silent letters.
102 take two.
Ah, the French champagne. Ah, the French, the wine, the cheese, the baguettes, and the
excessive use of silent letters. Here's a particularly egregious example that
a Tumblr user pointed out. No language should be mocked other than French.
Birds is wazo in French. No letter is pronounced the way it should, and there are seven of them.
It's pronounced wazo, and yes, I will die mad about it. Wazo hits every vowel in the French
alphabet and manages to only be pronounced with two goddamn syllables.
Dearest creature in creation.
There's a famous poem called The Chaos by Gerard Nolst-Trenite,
which is basically just a long rant, making fun of bizarre quirks in English spelling.
Here are some passages. Dearest creature in creation.
Studying English pronunciation.
I will teach you in my verse. Sounds like corpse, core, horse, and worse.
I will keep you, Susie, busy. Make your head with heat. Grow dizzy.
Tear an eye. Your dress you'll tear. So shall I. Oh, hear my prayer.
Pray. Consol your loving poet. Make my coat look new, dear. Sew it.
Just compare heart, beard, and herd. Dyes and diet. Lord and word.
Now I surely will not plague you with such words as vague and agieu,
but be careful how you speak. Say break, steak, but bleak and streak.
Tower of Babel
The Hebrew Babel contains a story called The Tower of Bible.
Wait, the other way around.
Supposedly, the story explains why people speak different languages around the world.
In the beginning, all of humanity was united in one language.
They traveled east to Shinar in South Mesopotamia, where they built a city.
The city contained a tall tower stretching to the top of the sky.
Yahweh saw this tower and was a bit mad about it,
because he figured that it was just a clever attempt to avoid a second flood.
In retaliation, he decided to discombobulate their language,
so they couldn't understand each other, and then scattered everybody around the world.
Duolingo
Duolingo, the edtech app with a cute owl logo, designed to help people learn languages.
Seems like that's a strictly good thing, right?
Well, the problem with learning languages with apps like these
is that their primary focus isn't actually to teach you the language.
As with any other tech company, the goal is to keep you on the app as long as possible.
It doesn't give you any lessons on grammatical rules or structures,
and instead it uses a system where you answer quizzes and repeat patterns
until the penny drops and you eventually get it.
Generally, when you teach people a second language,
you actually show them the grammatical structures first,
before jumping into examples and tests,
so that the learner doesn't have to magically figure it out through trial and error.
If you really want to pick up a second language,
taking a proper course or studying in a more traditional way with books
is probably going to be a much better use of your time.
Even watching a foreign film with subtitles is probably better than Duolingo.
I will say, though, that Duolingo might be useful as a supplementary tool
alongside real studying,
or maybe you're in a situation where you learned a second language a while ago
and just need a refresher.
There's not much else to say about this topic,
aside from some mildly funny memes about how the Duolingo owl is an abusive teacher,
constantly threatening its users to learn languages.
This is a reference to a meme from the Cartoon Network show Dexter's Lab.
In one episode, Dexter is studying for a French test last minute
by learning while he sleeps.
The recording ends up skipping and repeating the phrase,
omlet du fromage, over and over all night.
So when he wakes up, that's all he can say in French.
The phrase means cheese omlet.
If you were ever a child who had recess,
you're probably familiar with this language game.
It involves transforming words by moving the first consonant to the end and adding a.
The goal is usually to be able to speak in a kind of code language.
Adults supposedly can't understand it, so it's kids only.
No adults allowed.
Unbeknownst to the kids,
those adults probably did the exact same thing when they were younger,
and can understand absolutely everything they say.
Time is a flat circle.
Here's an example.
Like and subscribe would turn into
eichle, andier,
obscribesay.
Funnily enough, this fake language actually follows some structural rules.
The easiest words to translate start with consonant sounds.
Coffee becomes offy-kay.
Some other words start with a single sound that is formed by multiple consonants,
or a consonant cluster, if you will.
So the entire sound is shifted.
Squid becomes id-squay.
And finally, some words start with vowels,
so you just add wey or yay at the end.
Like andier.
In 2003, they actually did an analysis of Pig Latin at the Linguistic Society of America.
They ended up finding variation in dialects across different communities of school kids,
which is kind of interesting.
Hardest and easiest language?
A language being easy or hard to learn is pretty subjective,
and really depends on the languages you speak to begin with.
But humans are stubborn, and really love to rank things in a series of tiers.
The Foreign Service Institute in the U.S. created a list
to rank how long it usually takes to learn different languages as an English speaker.
By learn, they mean reaching a specific competency level in speaking and reading,
so it's still sort of objective.
These languages are the easiest, and take 23 to 24 weeks to learn.
The easiest of all of these is apparently Spanish,
according to data from the language learning platform Basu.
Next, German is in a category of its own, taking 30 weeks.
Then we have Indonesian, Malaysian, and Swahili, which each take 36 weeks.
And then we have a colossal list for category 4, which takes 44 weeks.
And includes mostly Eastern European languages.
And finally, we have category 5, taking 88 weeks to learn,
and includes Arabic, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean.
The hardest of these is likely Mandarin, which has over 10,000 characters.
You only really need to know about 3,000 of them to be considered fluent,
but that's still quite a lot.
Mandarin is also what's known as a tonal language,
where the specific tone of your speech changes the meaning of a word.
We have a bit of that in English,
like rising into nation when we ask questions.
For example, the word ma in Mandarin can mean mom,
numb, horse, or to curse, depending on your tone.
American monolingualism
The pervasive meme of the ignorant American,
sheltered monolinguals who refuse to learn any language besides English.
Speak American, God dang it, and so forth.
A New York Times article from 2012 actually challenged this assumption
by looking into how the U.S. census actually works.
Since 1980, the census question about language asked,
does this person speak a language other than English at home?
As of 2009, about 20% of Americans answered yes to this,
which seems kind of low.
But the article argues that this data is misleading,
since asking what someone speaks at home
is not necessarily the same as asking
whether someone can speak more than one language in general.
I'm a fluent French speaker,
thanks to the Canadian French Immersion Program I was part of in school.
But I've only ever spoken English at home.
Loads of people probably have similar circumstances,
like learning a second language for work,
soldiers who might have learned some Arabic while abroad,
or even do a lingo users.
The European Commission census from 2006 had a 56% multilingual rate.
But their question was,
can you have a conversation in a language besides your mother tongue,
which is quite a bit more broad.
So purely based on this data,
we can't say for sure if Americans really are
more likely to be monolingual than the rest of the world.
Cyrillic script is a collection of characters
used in various languages in this area of the world.
Some of the characters look pretty cool,
so sometimes people substitute them
for similar looking letters in Latin script.
This is called faux Cyrillic,
and graphic designers often use it to give off a Soviet vibe.
Some versions of Tetris were spelt like this,
with the backwards R to remind people
about the game's Russian origins.
The movie Borat was also sometimes stylized like this,
with an A swapped out for Cyrillic.
If you're familiar with downloading fonts,
you've probably heard the following sentence.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
This sentence contains every letter in the alphabet.
When you're installing a new font on your computer,
Windows will preview the font for you,
with this sentence to give you an idea
of what all the letters look like.
Old school typewriting handbooks and instruction manuals
also often used it as a typing exercise.
Microsoft Word also used to have a command
to auto type the sentence,
presumably to use it as a font preview.
This kind of sentence is called the pangram,
and there are a few others.
Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
I think the quick brown fox one
is the easiest to remember though,
which is probably why it took off.
There are a lot of memes about German
being a sort of inherently angry sounding language.
I think it's fair to say that a big reason for this
is that a lot of people's first impressions
of the German language
is old footage of Hitler's shouting
angry speeches in school.
Most non-German people never watched kid shows in German,
or relaxing nature documentaries narrated in German.
So their only exposure to it
is the terrifying ramblings of a brutal tyrant.
That would definitely sour the reputation
of that language in your mind.
The phonetics of the German language
also might help explain why it might sound harsh.
Frickatives like the sounds in these clips
are used quite a lot.
These types of sounds might come off as abrasive
because they involve creating a lot of friction in the mouth,
and these sounds also don't appear in English.
So no, German isn't inherently angry.
It just sounds that way because of the associations we have
and the lack of familiarity with some of its sounds.
Along with sounding angry,
German also has the reputation
of having hilariously long words.
The reason for this is pretty simple.
A lot of the time,
German words are just combinations of nouns stuck together.
In English, we usually cluster nouns together as modifiers,
like business computing solution,
or online real-time cloud data management view,
or massively multiplayer online role-playing game.
But in German, there are never any spaces
between the words in this structure.
They're all treated as one word,
like bodyguard or doghouse in English.
The word for glove is handshaw or handshoe.
The longest German word is 63 characters.
In fact, this word is so long
that it automatically shifted to the next line
in the script document I'm writing right now.
The word refers to a food safety law that existed in 2013,
and it's basically a full phrase mashed together in one word,
beef labeling supervision tasks transfer law.
Compare that to one of the longest English words,
anti-disestablishmentarianism, sitting in only 28 characters,
and referring to the opposition
to the separation of church and state.
Separating the church and state is disestablishment,
and someone advocating for that position
is a disestablishmentarian,
so being opposed to them
makes you a believer in anti-disestablishmentarianism.
This entry is also an excuse
to mention some of the funny German words I've encountered.
Birth control pills are called
directly translates to cable salad
and refers to the familiar mess of tangled cables
that you might find under your desk.
Or tooth meat is your gums.
Or doorstander is a bouncer.
A strange feeling of restless boredom
when there's nothing to do on a Sunday afternoon.
A man who sits down to pee
and has the connotation of a wimp,
a face that's in need of a fist,
or in other words, a punchable face,
and no list like this is complete
without taking pleasure in the misfortune of others.
This is a reference to an absurdly long village name in Wales,
the second longest in the world in fact,
behind this place in New Zealand.
I won't attempt to pronounce it,
and instead I'll show you this viral clip from 2015
of a weatherman pronouncing it perfectly.
I'm a big fan of the ampersand,
mostly because it's very satisfying to write out.
Much like the treble clef,
which was my favorite part of music class in elementary school,
because my alto sax technique was pretty weak.
The symbol itself originated with Roman cursive.
Later, during the Renaissance,
the ampersand as we might recognize it today was born.
To denote a, which means and in Latin,
and Romance languages like French and Italian.
For a long time,
the English alphabet actually included the ampersand
as the 27th letter,
and it was taught to children in school.
This is actually where the term ampersand comes from.
Students were taught to end the ABC's rhyme
with x, y, z, and per se and,
which was often slurred to ampersand
by bored children struggling to pay attention in class.
People seem to really love the idea that some foreign words
don't have any equivalent in English.
It's a compelling idea that other languages have ordinary words
for concepts that are so otherworldly to us
that we couldn't even understand them if we tried.
It reinforces this appealing idea that the world is so mysterious
that it's impenetrable to our understanding.
A common example of this is Utepsils,
which is supposedly a Norwegian word for sitting outside on a sunny day
enjoying a beer.
It's a charming thought that they would have an entire word dedicated to this.
Wow, this really seems to reveal something
about their laid-back culture and priorities.
But alas, it's not even a verb.
It's a compound noun of ute outside and pills, beer,
so it just means an outside beer,
which is a lot less evocative.
Another one is Skruib,
a Gaelic word for the itchiness of anticipation
on your upper lip just before taking a sip of whiskey.
The fact that there's a whole word for this in Gaelic,
while in English we need a full phrase to describe it,
surely shows us something about the Gaelic way of life.
They must be such whiskey enthusiasts
since they have full-on words
to describe the minutiae of the whiskey experience.
Unfortunately, the dictionary definition is much less specific
and just means a scratch or a scrape.
The linguist Jeffrey K. Pullum actually wrote a brutal response
to this myth of untranslatable words.
I happen to know a one-syllable word, turd,
for a piece of excrement shaped by its expulsion
from the anal sphincter,
but that doesn't reveal a lot about my ways and priorities.
It is a completely meaningless and useless random factoid
about the lexicon of the language I happen to grow up speaking.
That lexicon also contains scrum, buttercup, ogre, bong, and thorium.
If you try to form an impression of my ways and priorities
from such things, you're a moron.
But it's not all entirely fake.
The word so dad is often described as untranslatable
by Portuguese speakers
and means a nostalgic feeling of missing someone
or something you love.
It may be true that English doesn't have a single word for this concept,
but we also have homesickness,
which communicates a similar sentiment.
And even then, the idea the word is getting at
can still be translated to any language.
No concept is truly unique to any particular language.
Vsauce, the greatest of all time, recently covered this in one of his shorts.
This is a perfectly pronounceable way of spelling fish.
You take the gh sound from enough or tough,
then you add the o sound from women,
and finally the ti sound from nation or motion.
Put it all together and you get fish.
This meme also made an appearance in Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce.
G-E-H-O-T-I smells fish.
As with most of Finnegan's Wake,
it's pretty much impenetrable if you don't know the reference.
Esperanto.
Language barriers.
There are a lot of spoken languages around the world,
and most people only speak one or two of them.
This can lead to problems,
particularly before Google Translate existed.
In 1887, a man by the name of L.L. Zamenhof
tried to fix this by inventing an entirely new language, Esperanto,
which translates into English as One Who Hopes.
Zamenhof was a major language enjoyer.
He spoke Russian, German, French, Polish, Latin, Hebrew, and Greek.
He was frustrated with cultural divides, racism, and nationalism,
and wanted to aspire towards a society with world peace,
where everybody could live and communicate together in harmony.
That was his hope with Esperanto,
that it would act as a universal second language,
that world leaders could use to communicate in a neutral tongue,
without the help of translators,
or relying on one party to speak the other party's language.
If everyone could speak Esperanto,
anyone could communicate with anyone else.
Initially, things were looking pretty good,
and it was almost selected as the official language for the League of Nations,
but it ultimately lost by one vote.
Unfortunately, you could probably tell already
that Zamenhof's dreams never came true,
since chances are you don't speak Esperanto as a second language.
Esperanto ended up getting brutally oppressed in Nazi Germany,
Spain, and the Soviet Union.
Mein Kampf actually specifically describes Esperanto as a threat,
that could be used as part of a Jewish conspiracy.
Esperanto speakers were killed during the Holocaust,
including Zamenhof's family.
In the concentration camps,
there were instances of prisoners teaching each other Esperanto,
and telling the guards that they were just speaking Italian.
The Nazis were cool with that, since they were allied with Italy,
but they were also too dumb to realize that it wasn't actually Italian.
These days, Esperanto is still kicking,
with somewhere around 2 million people around the world who know how to speak it.
Even though it ultimately failed in its mission,
I think Esperanto would have been pretty cool if it took off,
and Zamenhof's original goal was noble, to say the least.
You might have heard a fun fact before,
that northern indigenous groups have a hundred different words for snow.
These groups are sometimes called Eskimo,
but that's often considered a pejorative,
so terms like Inuit or Yupik people are often used instead.
The origin of this idea traces back to work
by the anthropologist Franz Boaz in the early 20th century.
Franz never actually counted the amount of words they had for snow.
It turns out that their languages have about the same amount of root words
that refer to snow as English,
with root words for snowflakes, normal snow, slush, blizzard,
drift, and a few others.
Instead, what Franz pointed out was that their language structures
allowed them to generate way more single words related to snow compared to English.
Some linguists around this time took this as evidence
for the idea that the vocabulary of a given language
is directly connected to the speaker's worldview and way of life,
which is known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis,
which will come up again later.
Over the years, these findings started to become sensationalized,
with the number of words increasing over time,
and culminating in an article from the New York Times from 1984,
describing a tribe that distinguishes a hundred types of snow.
But this is misleading, and the specific numbers are totally made up.
Their language follows a root word structure,
so there are nearly infinite different words
that you can conceivably generate related to snow,
or any other root word for that matter.
In 2003, there was a blog post on Uncle Jazzbo's Gallimoffery,
which went on to become a popular meme among Facebook boomers.
This is the meme.
According to research at Cambridge University,
it doesn't matter what word order the letters in a word are.
The only important thing is that the first and last letters are in the right place.
The rest can be a total mess,
and you can still read it without a problem.
This is because we do not read every letter by itself,
but the word as a whole.
The meme spread quickly across other blogs, live journals,
and a website called Language Hat,
with some people creating versions in French and Portuguese as well.
I wasn't able to find any source on this from the University of Cambridge,
but there is a paper from the University of Edinburgh,
from early 2003 that might have been the inspiration.
Some languages in Africa,
as well as some Aboriginal languages in Northern Australia,
include very rare click consonants.
They might sound very strange when you first hear them,
since very few languages in the world contain these sounds.
English does have the dental click sound in one instance.
We also have the lateral click,
that we use sometimes when we're frustrated.
These types of uses are a bit different though,
since they're used on their own as interjections,
similar to huh, um, ouch, or wow.
Whereas in the African languages that use clicks,
they often use them at the start of a full word.
A language is a dialect with an army and a navy.
This is a witty phrase attributed to the sociolinguist
Max Weinreich, who supposedly heard it from a student at one of his lectures.
Dialects are basically particular types of speech
that can be distinguished from one another,
based on different vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation.
Basically, what this quote is getting at
is that the difference between a dialect
and a fully fledged language is totally arbitrary,
and mostly has to do with the circumstances
of governments and social conditions.
Okay, this is literally 1984.
But seriously, this term does come from the George Orwell novel
that I'm sure all of you have read.
That's why it's so high on the iceberg.
In the book, the totalitarian government
created a new language for the citizens to speak,
which heavily restricts vocabulary,
with the goal of limiting what people can talk about,
including things like self-expression,
self-determination, or even nuance.
The ultimate goal of this system is to prevent people
from having any kind of subversive ideas
that might disrupt the state.
The year is 1799, and you're a French officer
fighting under Napoleon in Egypt and Syria
to defend your people's trade interests or whatever.
You spot a stone slab with a bunch of inscriptions on the side,
and you figure that it might be important,
so you go tell your general Jacques-François Manu,
who happens to be stationed in the port city of Rosetta.
It turned out that those inscriptions
were in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics,
Demotic, and ancient Greek.
So this rock, which went on to be called the Rosetta Stone,
could allow scholars to decipher hieroglyphics for the first time,
since we could still understand ancient Greek.
Up until that time, most people figured
that each hieroglyphic symbol was associated
with a full concept, making it idiographic.
But nowadays, most linguists believe that's unlikely.
The Rosetta Stone is believed
to have been part of the temple further inland.
Around 392 AD, the Roman emperor
ordered all non-Christian temples to be closed.
That temple was probably destroyed,
and its pieces were used as building materials.
I now welcome you to the one and only segment in this video.
Weird sentences.
This is a Chinese poem from the 1930s,
titled Lion Eating Poet in the Stone Den.
Outside of some variation in tone,
every single word in the poem is pronounced shi.
It was written by a linguist, surprise, surprise,
to demonstrate that although it is perfectly grammatical
and coherent, it's impossible to understand
when spoken aloud.
The literal translation is
the story of Mr. Shi eating lions.
James, while John had had had had had had had had had had had
had had a better effect on the teacher.
The following sentence is grammatically correct.
James, while John had had had had had had had had had had had had had had
a better effect on the teacher.
As you might expect,
this is incomprehensible without someone explaining it.
So here's the deal.
There are two guys, James and John.
Their English teacher asks them to write a sentence
about a man who came down with a cold in the past.
John writes,
the man had a cold,
and James writes,
the man had had a cold.
The teacher preferred James' answer,
and marked his is correct.
Here's the sentence again with some punctuation and emphasis.
James, while John had had had had had had had had had had had a
better effect on the teacher.
One thing this sentence shows us,
aside from English being weird sometimes,
is that there's a big difference between using a word,
I had a coffee, and mentioning a word.
I used the word had in the previous sentence.
And also, punctuation is important sometimes.
Noam Chomsky,
the guy introducing all the topics in this video
through the power of AI voice synthesis,
famously said,
colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
He came up with this sentence to show
that you can construct a perfectly grammatical sentence
that is also completely meaningless.
That is, it has no intelligible semantic content.
The subject of the sentence has two adjectives,
colorless and green,
which already contradict each other right off the bat.
And these adjectives are attributes of ideas,
and it doesn't really make sense for an idea
to have a color in the first place.
Next, the predicate sleep furiously is odd too.
Since the adverb furiously doesn't really fit
conceptually with the verb to sleep,
and supposedly this is an activity that ideas are engaging in.
But since ideas are abstract,
it makes no sense to describe them as sleeping or being furious.
If you instead wrote it as,
furiously sleep ideas green colorless.
It's no longer grammatical either.
This can help us make sense of the difference between syntax,
how words and morphemes fit together
to form phrases and sentences,
and semantics,
the way that language is connected to meaning or truth.
Chomsky's sentence is syntactically correct,
but semantically meaningless.
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
Now you're not going to believe this,
but once again, this is a perfectly grammatical sentence.
It was first created by William Rappapour in 1972,
and takes advantage of the different kinds of meanings of the word buffalo.
The first two meanings are pretty familiar.
It's a synonym for bison, and it's also a city in New York.
But a lesser known meaning is that it's also a verb
that means to bully, confuse, or intimidate.
So what does it mean?
Well, there's an extremely confusing diagram on the Wikipedia page,
so I'll explain it using simple colors.
Bison from Buffalo, New York,
who are intimidated by other bison in the community,
also happen to intimidate other bison in the community.
Or in other words,
buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
Buffalo also isn't the only word you can use
to make these kinds of bewildering sentences.
As long as the word is both a plural noun
and a plural form of a transitive verb,
you can use it as well.
For example, dice, fish, right, and smelt all work as well.
And that concludes our segment on weird sentences.
The English language has words like the and a, called articles.
This is a like button.
This is the subscribe button.
Articles in English are gender neutral,
but some languages, like French, German, Spanish,
and loads of others have gendered articles.
Let's talk about French, since that's the one I know best.
The gender that words have in French follow some loose rules,
usually having to do with the way the word ends.
But it's still pretty arbitrary.
For example, trees are masculine, le sapin.
And tables are feminine, la table.
Countries that end in E are feminine, like La France or La Chine.
But countries that end in a different vowel or consonant
are masculine, like Le Canada or Le Japon.
If you're a native speaker of these languages,
this isn't really something you think about,
since it all comes naturally to you.
Of course, trees are boys and tables are girls.
But if you're learning it as a second language,
like I did with French, it's a bit of a headache,
trying to remember which inanimate objects are male or female.
Code switching is a phenomenon where you change the way you speak,
depending on the context you find yourself in,
which can involve speaking different languages entirely,
different dialects, different accents,
or with different grammar and vocabulary.
A famous example of this is Black people
switching between Standard English and African American Vernacular English, or AAVE.
A quick aside about this,
people often talk about the style of English as incorrect or ungrammatical.
Negation might sound like he didn't go nowhere,
or she don't have nothing,
where a double negative doesn't cancel out,
but instead reinforces the negative.
And similar to some non-English languages,
copulas or contractions are sometimes dropped,
like she my mother, instead of she's my mother or she is my mother.
AAVE also has an entire tense that Standard English doesn't have,
the habitual be.
He be working out doesn't translate to he is working out.
It means something like he is in the habit of working out regularly.
Even if he isn't actively working out right now,
that sentence communicates that it's something he does.
It's important to recognize that this is a perfectly legitimate way of speaking English,
and shouldn't be considered incorrect.
It follows its own internally consistent grammatical rules,
and structures exactly like Standard English does.
This will come up later when I talk about linguistic descriptivism versus prescriptivism.
Okay, now back to code switching.
Often, when AAVE speakers are in school,
their teachers expect them to speak and write in Standard English.
So as a solution to this,
they develop a sophisticated system of code switching,
where they continue to speak AAVE to friends, parents, or community members,
and switch to Standard English at school or during job interviews.
An interesting consequence of this is that the challenge of developing this skill
offers the same kind of advantages that bilingual people get
by learning a second language,
like better critical thinking skills or executive function.
Any weebs in the audience are probably familiar with the fact that you read
Manga's backwards, from right to left, since that's how Japanese is written.
But what if I told you there was a style of writing that was both forwards and
backwards at the same time?
That's Bustrophodon.
Each line of text alternates between normal and reversed.
But the reversed part isn't even just right to left.
It's fully mirrored.
This style of writing was used for a while in ancient Greece,
but fell out of fashion during the Hellenistic period.
I alluded to this earlier when I was talking about the myth of 100 words for snow.
This hypothesis suggests that our experience of the world is connected to the language we speak.
The strongest version of this idea is that language literally determines
the types of thoughts we can think,
but most linguists generally don't accept that version these days.
A weaker version states that language just influences the concepts we use,
and therefore the way we talk about things.
You might be familiar with the concept of Schadenfreude that I mentioned earlier,
taking pleasure at the misfortune of others.
But you might not talk about that idea as regularly as a German speaker,
where their language has a whole word for it.
A study by Boroditsky in 2011 looked at languages that have gendered articles,
like the ones I mentioned earlier.
Spanish and German both have gendered language,
but the gender of objects varies.
They asked speakers of each language to describe various objects,
and it turned out that they were more likely to talk about those objects
in ways that were consistent with the gendered article of their language.
So this shows that the gender system of a language
might be connected with how the speakers perceive objects,
which is evidence of language impacting the way we interpret the world.
But it's also important to mention that Boroditsky's study has been heavily criticized,
and the strong conclusions she drew from the studies don't exactly follow the evidence.
The conclusions barely make sense when you consider some weird examples,
like that vagina is masculine in French,
and beard is feminine in Spanish.
Gendered articles generally have more to do with the structure and sound of the words
than they do with the properties of the concept being intrinsically masculine or feminine.
This dichotomy represents two different attitudes with respect to language.
On the one side, we have prescriptivists,
who really love following rules and laws,
and think that there are correct and incorrect ways of using language.
This is often the attitude of teachers or newspaper publishers.
Here's some examples of their draconian rules.
Contractions, like can't or don't, are not proper English.
Double negatives, like I don't disagree, are not proper English.
This one is really annoying,
since it often communicates an entirely different meaning.
Not disagreeing is not the same as agreeing,
and famously, that a sentence should never end in a preposition.
If someone asks you,
which streaming service did you watch Succession on?
That is seen as incorrect,
and instead you should say,
on which streaming service did you watch Succession?
All of these examples might not be appropriate in formal writing,
but that doesn't make them incorrect uses of English by any means.
On the other side, we have descriptivism,
which is the dominant approach in academic linguistics.
Instead of fixating on how language should be spoken,
they instead focus on how language speakers actually use language in real life.
Here's an argument you might have encountered
in a conversation with someone who insists on being pedantic.
You might say,
You've read less books than me.
His face then turns smug, and he says,
Um, actually, I have read fewer books than you.
It's like having less money and fewer dollars.
But if that person were less annoying,
they would realize that people use less all the time in these contexts.
So this phrasing is completely legitimate,
and they also know exactly what you're trying to say.
At some point between the 1400s and 1700s,
the way that English speakers pronounced vowel sounds gradually changed.
Here are some examples of how things shifted.
There are a couple theories for why this happened.
It might have been because a lot of people migrated to South England,
from the eastern and central areas after the Black Death.
So different dialects clashed with each other.
The pretentious London natives wanted to make sure they sounded different
from the immigrants by adjusting the way they talk.
It also could have been because the wars England had with France at the time
might have caused English speakers to overcorrect
by changing their pronunciation to sound less French.
In 2015, there was an argument in the Wikipedia editing section
about an audio recording for the page Bhutanese Passport.
Someone wrote,
The sound file is ridiculous.
For this reason, it has become a meme, albeit a minor one,
and the source of much humor.
The file should be removed until a more appropriate one could be sourced.
Someone replied,
LOL, that was so funny.
I actually lulled so effing hard, ha.
Here's what it sounded like.
Bhutanese Passport.
A Bhutanese Passport is a document which authorizes alpha cells.
Later, someone replied and called this criticism racist
due to the accent of the speaker in the recording.
Removing this audio file only encourages racism.
You don't like it because it doesn't sound like your English dialect.
English is a multicultural language,
and Wikimedia is a multicultural place,
where all dialects can coexist.
If this is removed, it would only aid in the destruction of Wikipedia ideals.
It would only be replaced with something that sounds more white,
but have no change in content.
And now we are at the point where any change in content would only be added
so that this file can be changed.
This is racism, and I won't stand for it.
Someone wrote back saying,
This is no racism.
The guy reading it sounds drunk,
which was met with,
Maybe he has a disability.
You don't know.
Removing is discrimination.
There was a long back and forth with people arguing
whether they should keep the original recording or add a new one.
One person argued that the reader claimed to be a native boutonese,
which resulted in the accent,
but admitted that the sound quality and bizarre auto-tune sound was pretty bad.
One person said,
I can't hear any problem with it.
Sounds fine to me.
Someone else said,
Strong keep, purely for the historical value of the audio in this talk page.
This will eventually get its own mention in the troll article.
Much lulls.
The sound file is a boutonese national treasure,
and we will not have you committing this erasure of their culture.
After a difficult 40 seconds on YouTube,
I was able to find an example of a man and woman from bouton,
speaking English with what must be a bouton accent,
and here it is.
The accent in the file sounds nothing like the accent in this video.
The file to me,
sounds A, like extremely poor quality and or intentional use of effects,
and B, like someone mocking Asian accents.
If this is legitimately the way this person sounds,
then keep it, regardless of how it sounds to other people,
and I will feel awful for having said all this.
But until that is verified,
this seems extremely fishy and possibly racist to me,
especially compared to that YouTube video.
Extremely strong keep.
Wee-oo, wee-oo.
Here comes the fun police.
Eventually, in March of 2015,
the fun police arrived, and it was replaced with a new recording.
In the 19th century, linguists made a huge breakthrough.
They were comparing sounds and words in different languages,
and theorized the existence of a very old, unwritten language
that they called proto-Indo-European.
It turns out that all kinds of languages,
from English to German to Russian to Danish,
and loads of others,
all descended from proto-Indo-European as their common ancestor.
The word bear is particularly interesting
for languages that descended from PIE.
Most of these languages have a word for it,
but it varies quite a lot compared to most words.
Supposedly, speaking about bears was considered taboo in some cultures,
but not in others.
In Latin, bear is ursis,
related to the constellation Ursa Major,
which contains the big dipper.
The French word is urse, which derives from this too.
Other PIE languages also follow a similar origin,
but this pattern doesn't apply to Germanic languages,
like English and German.
Slavic languages, like Russian or Polish,
or Baltic languages, like Lithuanian and Latvian.
English is bear, obviously.
German is bear, Dutch is beer,
and in Danish and Swedish, it's bjorn.
All of these derive from the PIE word for brown, ber.
Ancient people in these areas in the north
tended to encounter bears more often,
but didn't use the common name.
Instead, they called it something to the effect of
the brown one.
As for the Slavic languages,
bears are called medved in both Russian and Czech.
For these languages, it means something like
the one who eats honey.
Some linguists speculate that in these cultures,
using the actual word bear was taboo,
and shouldn't be said explicitly.
Why?
Well, we're not exactly sure.
Perhaps they believed that
speaking the bear's name out loud would summon them,
so they used a Voldemort like
he who must not be named substitute.
All we can say for sure
is that ancient cultures in northern Indo-European areas
did not have the same cozy impression of bears
that celestial seasonings do
in their sleepy-time tea illustration.
Speaking of tea, humans have been drinking
this delicious leaf water for thousands of years,
and it was originally introduced in China.
In fact, tea is the most consumed drink in the world,
second only to water.
The Chinese word for tea is cha.
The English word tea traces back to the Dutch,
who got some tea from Southeast Asia
and had picked up the pronunciation from Min Chinese.
We call some types of tea chai tea,
because the cha pronunciation had moved to Persia,
where it added the Persian suffix ye.
The critical period hypothesis is the idea
that the first few years of our lives
are extremely important for developing language.
If you make it to five years old
without being exposed to language,
you're basically out of luck,
and it would be almost impossible
to learn how to speak successfully.
A famous piece of evidence for this is genie,
a tragic story that I talked about
in my psychological experiment iceberg video.
The story is a bummer,
so I'll save you the details here.
Basically, genie was prevented from speaking
or hearing language for many years
and missed her critical period,
and so she struggled with language for the rest of her life.
Another example of evidence has to do with deaf people.
Deaf people who were never taught sign language as children
are never able to learn it as successfully
as those who learned it at a young age.
Even if they use it daily for as long as 30 years,
they missed the critical period.
This is an interesting mystery.
Sometime in the 17th century, a manuscript turned up.
The earliest known owner was a man
by the name of George Berech,
an alchemist and antique collector.
The weird part is that it's handwritten
in a completely unknown script known as voina cheese.
Carbon dating has shown that it was originally created
sometime in the early 15th century.
It contains a bunch of strange drawings of plants,
astrological signs, and surreal imagery.
These kinds of drawings were pretty normal
for manuscripts written around this time,
but for some strange reason,
none of the plants depicted are actually real.
The book changed hands multiple times.
Some of the owners believed it had some kind of magic powers.
What is this? Why does this exist?
This is magic powers!
It eventually came to light after Wilfred Voynich
presented it publicly in 1915.
Everybody from linguists to World War II code breakers
have attempted to figure out what the manuscript says,
but none of them have been successful
outside of identifying the alphabet.
Another weird aspect is it seems completely legit
as a genuine language, with the same words and phrases,
repeating in patterns that are statistically similar
to real languages.
The writing itself is also in totally steady cursive,
which shows that the writer probably didn't have to stop
and consult a translation system or a code book.
Some people have suspected that it was a hoax,
including Voynich himself,
but the carbon dating definitively proves
it came from the 1400s.
Some other people believe it's a very early example
of a constructed artificial language.
There are some wacky theories too,
that it came from Leonardo da Vinci,
or that it was created by aliens.
What do you think the deal with this manuscript is?
Leave a comment down below.
Tokipona
Tokipona is a constructed language, or conlang,
as the community likes to call them.
It was created in 2001 by the Canadian linguist Sonia Lang.
Out of all the constructed languages,
this one is probably the most popular.
It's known for being very minimalistic
and has less than 200 words.
To actually describe anything complicated,
you need to break it down into much simpler terms.
Sonia Lang wrote,
If English is a thick novel,
then Tokipona is a haiku.
The reason this language was created
and why it's used is also pretty interesting.
It's almost a philosophical language.
Sonia Lang developed it during a period of depression
and used Tokipona to help her through it.
Its simplicity was designed
to help you concentrate on the simple things in life.
As you work through communicating complex ideas
by breaking them down into simpler ideas,
you realize the underlying simplicity
of what you initially thought was complicated.
The Sapir-Warf hypothesis is tied to this, too,
which was that idea I mentioned
that language affects the way we interface with the world.
The structure of Tokipona supposedly influences us
to think more positively.
If you want to learn more,
I would recommend the video series about Tokipona
by the fantastic YouTuber Ion Masali.
This is a wug.
This is a wug.
Now there is another one.
There are two of them.
There are two wugs.
This is a test created in 1958 by John Berko Gleason
to look at how children acquire plural rules in language.
Importantly, wug is not a real word,
so they aren't testing whether children heard
how someone else formed that plural.
The child is forced to infer how the plural should sound,
showing that they understand a basic, more underlying rule.
It turns out that even really young kids
are able to produce these kinds of plurals for pseudo-words,
which demonstrates that they're establishing
a general structure for how language works,
without someone explicitly teaching it to them.
If kids are really, really young,
they can do this with real words, but not pseudo-words,
so children first start by memorizing plurals
before understanding the general pattern.
The popularity of the wug test has also resulted in some memes.
The logo for r slash linguistics is also a wug.
The wug had a surge of interest recently
after a company started selling wug merch
without Gleason's permission.
Gleason replied on Twitter
suggesting that people buy wug merch from her website instead.
The company had originally claimed
that the design was public domain and Gleason disagreed.
This ultimately resulted in a long legal battle full of drama.
If you're interested,
I've linked this medium article
documenting the whole thing in the description.
Have you ever wondered where the expression
blowing a raspberry comes from?
Turns out that it's connected to the cockney accent in England,
mostly in the east end of London,
which has an absolutely ridiculous slang.
It basically involves replacing a word with two words,
where the last word rhymes with the word
you're actually trying to say,
and then usually leaving out the rhyming word.
So unless we intend to do this job in Reno,
we're in Barney.
Barney Rubble.
Trouble.
So if you want a nice cold beverage from the fridge,
you might ask for a Britney,
since Britney Spears rhymes with beers.
If you're calling for your buddy,
you might say, hey, China,
since China Plate rhymes with mate.
If someone isn't telling you the truth,
that's porkies.
Pork pies rhymes with lies.
If you're out late at night with the boys
and have to return to your spouse at home,
you say, I got to get back to the trouble,
since trouble and strife rhymes with wife.
If you're admiring your friend's new chain,
you tell him nice Tom,
since Tom Foolery rhymes with jewelry.
So how about blowing a raspberry?
Well, raspberry tart rhymes with fart.
I can't understand your accent.
Some of them are even more complicated than this.
Someone might call their butt their heiress.
The original rhyme was bottle and glass to rhyme with ass,
but then bottle was rhymed with Aristotle to get heiress.
Piraha is one of the most interesting languages of all time.
It's spoken by an indigenous group of about 700 people
living in the Brazilian jungle.
The first notable fact is that it only has 8 consonants and 3 vowels,
making it one of the most simple sound systems out of any known language.
It also has some of the rarest sounds,
one of which sounds like blowing a raspberry.
But the limited set of sounds isn't a problem,
since it incorporates a lot of different tones
that allow it to be sung,
hummed,
or whistled in conversation.
And here's the big one.
Piraha doesn't have any words for numbers.
It does have words for vague quantities,
like a small size or amount,
or a bit of a larger size or amount,
and a bunch.
So how do they count?
Well, some anthropological evidence seems to suggest
that they simply don't.
At one point, their counting skills were put to a test.
Objects like batteries were placed on a table in a line,
and the Piraha were asked to make a second line just like the first.
This was no problem for them.
Then, a line of objects was created again,
hidden from view,
and they were asked to do the same thing.
They were able to do it accurately
if there were only two or three objects in the set.
But anything above that resulted in a lot of mistakes.
This indicates that they aren't precisely counting at all
during this task,
and instead they're just kind of visually estimating it.
So presumably, counting was never super important for the Piraha,
so they never ended up developing it.
Research from MIT indicates the Pidaha
may be the only culture on Earth without any numeracy.
The Pidaha don't have numbers because they don't need them.
They survive just fine without them.
In a way, this seems like a pretty comfy way to live.
They aren't concerned about their bank balance,
their follower count,
their heart rate,
or how many calories they've eaten.
If they were watching a sports game,
they wouldn't care about the score.
They'd just sit back and enjoy the game.
Volopuk is a constructed language
that was created a few years before Esperanto,
but for very different reasons.
Zamenhof had a dream that an international language
would bring people together
and help strive towards world peace.
But Volopuk's creator, Johan Martin Schleyer,
had a dream where God specifically told him
that his destiny was to create an international language.
Yes, the actual reason was that it was revealed to him in a dream.
He was a Catholic priest, too,
so he decided to go for it.
It picked up some steam for a while,
but slowly started to fade after Esperanto dropped.
By 1890, the community was stuck inflighting,
mostly because Schleyer refused to allow anyone
other than himself to create new words.
Loads of sub-languages were created,
like Nalbino, Balta, Bhopal, Speline, Dill, and Orba,
but they were almost immediately forgotten.
These days, Volopuk is basically dead,
with only around 20 speakers worldwide.
Funnily enough, in Esperanto,
the word Volapukajo, a reference to this language,
means nonsense or gibberish.
If you've ever done any graphic design
or web development before,
you're probably familiar with this famous placeholder text.
Designers use it so that they can get a sense
of what large blocks of text will look like on screen,
without needing to have any actual content.
The text itself comes from Definibus Bonorum Amalorum,
a Socratic dialogue from 45 BCE by Cicero.
But the version you see today was changed.
Words were swapped out, deleted, and added,
so the final version doesn't actually make any sense in Latin.
The first bit, Lauren Ipsum, was originally Dolarum Ipsum,
meaning pain itself,
which is probably a relatable phrase
if you're trying to center a div element on a web page.
I think this one was included because it just sounds funny.
It's a fruit dish from Denmark that means red porridge with cream.
This is a Hawaiian Christmas song that was famously recorded by Bing Crosby.
Since the Hawaiian language doesn't use the same sounds as English,
the pronunciation had to be approximated.
In particular, the R and S sounds had to be adjusted,
so Merry Christmas became Mele Kalikimaka.
This one is just a meme about a difficult to pronounce Eastern European name.
Once again, we're brought back to the Sapir-Warf hypothesis.
In the 1940s, Warf was working on his linguistic theories
and studying a language from the Hopi people,
a Native American group in Arizona.
It seemed to him that their language was missing a key feature.
They didn't seem to have any words or grammar related to time.
He concluded that they have no general notion or intuition of time
as a smooth flowing continuum
in which everything in the universe proceeds at equal rate
out of a future through the present into a past.
If this was true, this would be fantastic news for his hypothesis
since it shows a direct connection between their language and their view of the world.
It was a bit too good to be true though,
and it was later proven wrong by Eckhart Molotki,
who ended up finding tons of examples of words and grammar
in the Hopi language that involved relations across time.
The issue was that while the tense system in English emphasizes past and non-past,
the Hopi language is oriented towards future and non-future.
The myth still lives on though, with smug new-agers
saying that Westerners are too obsessed with time,
always carrying a watch to keep track of it.
Meanwhile, the virtuous Hopi people just go with the flow, man.
If you've seen my video on the philosophy of color,
you're already familiar with this.
If I show you these two shapes, which one would you call Kiki
and which one would you call Bubba?
Strangely enough, almost everyone who has asked this question,
no matter their cultural heritage or language,
calls the spiky shape Kiki and the bulbous shape Bubba.
Some languages seem to resist this effect though,
like Mandarin Chinese, Turkish, and Romanian.
In these cases, there always seems to be a good reason though.
Romanian already has a word that sounds like Bubba,
and it refers to a kind of sharp pain,
which might remind them more of the spiky shape.
Turkish has a word for babies and other cute things,
so this might not fit quite right with the spiky shape.
And in Mandarin Chinese, the syllables in Bubba and Kiki
aren't really found in the language,
so both words might just sound weird.
There are a few ideas for why this phenomenon might be happening.
It could just be related to the way our mouths move
when we say each word.
When we say Bubba, our mouth is forced to be more rounded,
whereas when we say Kiki, it's more angular and tight.
A more wild speculation has to do with the way we evolved
and how sound tends to travel.
If you're in a cave with a really smooth interior surface,
sounds are probably more basing and echoing.
If you're in a cave with a bunch of stalactites and rough surfaces,
sounds are probably a lot thinner and tinny.
This kind of primordial association
might be connected to the Bubba-Kiki thing.
This phenomenon is really interesting for linguists,
since it seems to show that the words we use for things
are not entirely arbitrary.
There might be some connection between the sound of the word
and the thing itself.
You're old.
Ye old tavern. Ye old shop.
These whimsical phrases evoke a quaint medieval village
before the times of strip malls, parking lots,
and concrete healthscapes.
But it turns out old English wasn't actually like this at all.
Old with an E on the end wasn't really used much
until the 19th century.
Instead, it was often spelt in ways like this.
And in older forms of English,
an E was often stuck at the end of words.
So old was used to harken back to that tradition.
And ye has even less basis in history.
It's meant to be a translation of the
and comes from the old English word spelt like this.
But that first character isn't a Y sound.
It's a thorn character that's pronounced like TH.
When this guy introduced the printing press to England
in 1474, it didn't have a thorn character.
So Y was substituted in its place.
Over time, this switcheroo was forgotten
once we started writing TH.
So ye is often remembered as an early version of the.
Loglan
In the 50s, the sci-fi author and sociologist Dr. James Cook Brown
constructed a language called Loglan
and based it on the rules of formal predicate logic
used by analytic philosophers.
The language was designed so that statements
were as unambiguous and clear as possible.
His hope was that if he trained people to speak Loglan,
he might turn them into more logical thinkers,
which might have been a strong piece of evidence
for the superior wharf hypothesis.
As is the case with most constructed languages,
the community of speakers is pretty niche,
and there are probably fewer than 100 people in the world
that use Loglan in some capacity.
Pigeons and Creoles
Language is one of the most diverse and complex human
characteristics, which makes it really interesting to study.
But it also creates a problem.
Oftentimes, we have to talk to people
that don't speak the same language as us.
Without Esperanto or Google Translate,
that's where pigeons come in.
Pigeons are basically what happens
when you smash two different languages together.
It's a simplified combination of the vocabulary
of each language that usually ditches
all the complicated grammar on either side.
These kinds of languages emerged quite a lot
when European settlers started to trade
with other communities of people.
There have also been instances where
pigeons start to develop even further.
In Haiti, a pigeon emerged between French colonists
and enslaved Africans on the plantations,
and over the years, it eventually transformed
into one of Haiti's official languages, Haitian Creole.
During Napoleon's invasion of Germany,
he was served a meal with rye bread.
He hated it so much that he called it
paimpournicole, or bread for Nicole,
Nicole being the name of his horse.
Over time, this eventually turned into paimpournicole.
But here's the thing, none of this actually happened.
This is an example of a folk etymology.
A nice story told over a drink with friends
that explains where a word originated.
Generally, the actual etymology is a bit less exciting.
In paimpournicole's case,
it came from the German word pumpern to break wind,
and nickel for rascal.
So even this origin doesn't seem very kind
to this particular type of bread.
Another example is the word crap,
which supposedly came from Thomas Crapper,
the inventor of the toilet.
It turns out that Crapper did have a toilet business,
but both toilets and the word crap existed
long before he was born.
Emoji is another interesting case.
You might think that it's related to the word emoticon,
but they actually developed totally independently.
Emoji is a portmanteau of emotion and icon,
but emoji comes from a Japanese portmanteau of E,
picture, and emoji, character.
There's also hamburger.
Naturally, you might think this is a combination
of ham and burger,
but this doesn't really make sense
since most hamburgers are made of beef.
Some have speculated,
well, actually, it comes from the German city Hamburg.
But strangely, there isn't any evidence
that this dish originated in Hamburg at all.
The last one I'll mention here involves
the Queen of Scots, Mary, who was sick at one point.
Her maid had said,
Marie est malade, meaning Mary is sick.
So then she was brought preserved fruit
to brighten her spirits.
Hence, marmalade.
But once again, the real story is a bit less evocative.
It actually comes from the Portuguese word marmalada,
referring to a kind of jam.
In La Gomera, one of the Canary Islands in Spain,
speakers there can communicate in a variation of Spanish
composed entirely of whistling.
What?
The reason this language emerged
is because this island is full of huge ravines and valleys.
So by whistling in this way,
you could communicate over distances up to five kilometers
since the sound echoes through the surfaces of the terrain.
This type of whistling language was originally used
by the Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands,
and was picked up by the Spanish settlers.
CCO.
If you've ever heard someone from Spain
speaking Spanish,
you may have noticed that it sounds a bit different
compared to Latin America.
This has been referred to as the Spanish lisp.
Ceceo literally means lisp.
They tend to pronounce the letters Z and C as a th sound,
if it comes before E or I,
while most other Spanish speakers use an S sound.
Cielo versus Cielo.
There's also a widespread myth for why this happened.
The story goes that a Spanish king once had a lisp,
and his fragile ego resulted in him declaring
that the island was a lisp.
Resulted in him declaring that the entire population
ought to speak like he does.
But this doesn't make any sense,
since the lisp only applies situationally.
They don't say Espanja, they say Espanja.
And also, the th sound develops centuries
after the reign of the king with the lisp,
Peter of Castile.
It turns out that the southern Spanish speakers
didn't tend to use this pronunciation,
and that was the variation of Spanish
that was passed on to Latin America.
So it was just the natural evolutionary process of language,
where different systems of pronunciation
emerged in different speaking communities.
Kurgan hypothesis.
So if all these languages descended
from the hypothesized proto-Indo-European language,
where did that language come from?
In the 1950s, the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas
had an idea about this.
She figured that a group of herders
in the grasslands of modern-day Ukraine
were the original speakers of PIE.
These folks had domesticated the horse
and developed early forms of chariots,
which seemed to have helped them expand.
DNA studies from human bones around this time
show that these people's genes
had replaced about three quarters
of the human gene pool in Europe.
So as the theory goes, this cultural expansion
explains why their proto-Indo-European language
became so influential to all the other languages
in this region.
We all know that English is top dog
when it comes to clout on the world stage,
which leads to tons of languages around the world
borrowing English words.
Wasayego is the Japanese version of this.

Here's one you might recognize
Famicom
for Family Computer.
This was the original name of the NES in Japan.
Another one is Pokémon from Pocket Monster.
Some of these terms are portmontos
or phrases that don't exist in English
in the first place
and are described as pseudo-lone words.
This comes from cunning
and is often used in the context of cheating on tests.
This one comes from handle keeper,
meaning designated driver
with the handle referring to the steering wheel.
These lone words are also often used for slang
to speak about taboo topics.
For love hotel.
For car sex.
For happy ending.
I think this one goes without saying.
Sliker is fable.
So at this point in the video,
we know that Proto-Indo-European
was pretty important
for how a lot of languages look today.
And we also have a general idea
of where it probably came from.
But what did it actually look like?
Well, in 1868,
the linguist August Schleicher
reconstructed a full text from Proto-Indo-European
known as The Sheep and the Horses.
This is what it looks like.
Latin wolf taboo.
The word wolf in English
can be traced back to the word Wilkwos
from Proto-Indo-European,
which was then shifted to Wolpaz
in the Germanic languages,
and then Wolfaz.
This led to the Icelandic word Ulfer,
the word Olv in Danish and Norwegian,
Wolf with a U in Old English
in modern German,
and finally Wolf.
But in Swedish,
this pattern is broken.
Despite being a descendant
of Proto-Indo-European
in the Germanic tree,
they use the word Varg.
This comes from the Norse word Varger,
an outcast of society
for murder or oath breaking.
This word also exists
in other descendants of P.I.E.,
like Vragh for enemy in Russian,
or Warg in Old English,
which Tolkien used for the wolf monsters
in The Lord of the Rings.
Similar to the bear taboo,
this is likely the result of a tradition
where wolves were seen as dangerous enemies,
so we ought not to speak their name
to avoid summoning them.
As for the taboo in Latin specifically,
Wilkwos was shifted to Wilpo in Germanic,
which was reversed to form Lupo,
resulting in the Latin word Lupus for wolf.
This is interesting
because it only involves shifting the word around
rather than creating an entirely new word.
This guy Chuck on a linguistics blog
in 1998 speculated,
I deduced that for some reason,
the Old Indo-Europeans were more respectful
of the bear than the wolf,
though they didn't diss the wolf either.
This one was a little tricky to track down,
since googling the term only returns results
related to Shrek.
I couldn't figure out why this was happening
until I realized that the first word
is an anagram of Shrek,
and this green fella is so entrenched in culture
that even anagrams of his name summon him.
It actually seems to be in reference
to another piece of reconstructed proto-Indo-European.
It's gone through a few iterations over the years,
as our understanding of P.I.E. has improved.
This is an Italian song from 1972,
with lyrics that are completely gibberish.
It was written to sound like American English,
from the perspective of someone who doesn't speak the language.
Listening to it as an English speaker
feels like you're having a stroke,
because it really does sound like English,
but the only decipherable words are,
all right.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoes,
and I will hold on.
We don't say in the shoe.
The songwriter, Adriano Silentano,
talked about his goals with the song
in an interview with NPR.
The dialogue is interpreted by a translator.
Ever since I started singing,
I was very influenced by American music,
and everything Americans did,
so at a certain point
since I like American slang
which, for a singer,
is much easier to sing than to sing in italian,
I thought that I would write a song
which would only have, as its theme,
the inability to communicate.
And to do this,
I had to write a song where the lyrics didn't mean anything.
So to make a comparison, it's like what happened at the Tower of Babel.
Everyone wanted to go towards the sky, and they were punished, because God confused
all the languages, and no one understood each other anymore.
This is the reason why I wrote the song.
This song also went on to become a major hit all over Europe, topping the charts in Italy,
France, Germany, Belgium, and Luxembourg.
But as expected, it wasn't a major hit in America.
Edward Sapir, one half of Sapir Warf, had a theory about the best way to figure out where a language originated.
His method was simple.
Find the area where that language has the most diversity.
If one region has tons of different accents and dialects that vary considerably,
it's safe to assume that the language probably originated there,
rather than somewhere with a more homogenous speaking population,
which is presumably the result of migration.
As an example, let's go back to the Spanish list I talked about earlier.
Some areas in northern Spain had the lisp, whereas speakers in the south didn't tend to have it.
When the southern Spanish people migrated to Latin America, they brought over their lack of lisp,
and now that speaking population is a lot more homogenous.
If all the data you have is the higher level of diversity in Spain compared to America,
the migration theory would correctly tell you that the language originated in that area.
This theory isn't 100% guaranteed to work, though.
Imagine a situation where linguistic diversity is completely wiped out by other people migrating in.
So even if the language originated there, it might end up having less diversity than other regions.
The Russian language actually has two separate terms for blue.
Goluboy for light blue, and Cine for dark blue.
This isn't the same as the niche terms we have in English, like cyan blue or navy blue.
They're actually basic color terms, like green or purple.
This scenario was pretty exciting for scientists, because it provided a perfect opportunity to test out the superior warf hypothesis.
They asked Russian speakers to indicate whether two shades of blue were different or the same, as fast as they could.
It turns out that they were much faster when they were presented with Goluboy and Cine,
rather than two shades of Goluboy or two shades of Cine,
whereas English speakers didn't demonstrate the same advantage as the Russians in telling these shades apart.
Then they added a twist.
They wanted to see if this effect was happening specifically because of their language speeding up their perception.
They asked the participants to perform a verbal task at the same time,
with the idea that it would make it harder to use language to help with their perception speed.
And they were right. This completely eliminated the reaction time advantage that the Russian speakers had.
Then they also had them do a spatial task as well, to make sure that language was really the factor at play,
and the reaction time advantage remained.
So all of this is pretty good evidence for the weak version of the superior warf hypothesis.
The structure of language seems to be directly affecting the way we perceive and interact with the world.
The ancient Roman god of the skies, Jupiter, also the name of this planet,
was originally pronounced something like Jupiter.
This word can be traced all the way back to the Proto-Indo-European term,
or Skyfather.
Funnily enough, the analogous Greek god Zeus also comes from the deus part of this.
The original Proto-Indo-European sky daddy was a major figure in the ancient mythology of PIE culture,
and was associated with daylight, the sky, and was all seeing.
So divinity being associated with the sky or the day,
as well as being male and paternal, is a very, very old idea.
But the conception of this god is the number one guy, like Zeus or Jupiter,
along with its association with storms and lightning,
seems to be exclusive to the later conceptions in Mediterranean areas.
If you've ever seen the movie Good Will Hunting,
you've probably noticed that people from Boston often don't pronounce their Rs.
The same is true in some areas of England,
where most speakers in the south don't pronounce the R in words like park,
but speakers in the north and west do.
In 1966, the linguist William LeBov looked into this,
specifically in which cases the R is pronounced before pauses or consonants.
He did a bit of unconventional science to test this out.
He went to a bunch of different department stores in New York City,
each notoriously frequented by different social classes of people.
He went up to random people and asked them,
hey there, where are the women's shoes?
Or what floor is this?
Expecting the answer, fourth floor.
It turned out that staff at the higher end stores were more likely to pronounce the R,
fourth floor, whereas staff at the lower end stores were more likely to leave it out, fourth floor.
In 1942, a Norwegian woman, Astrid,
presenting to the emergency room
with a strange condition, she had spontaneously acquired a foreign accent
that made her sound German or French.
Two years previously, she had been hit with shrapnel during a raid in World War II,
which was the likely cause of her neural problems.
Unfortunately, this accent didn't give her the best reputation,
since the Nazis were occupying Norway
and her German sounding voice made people think she was a spy.
Astrid's story is an example of foreign accent syndrome,
and there have been over 100 other case studies about it.
In 2013, there was an instance of this that went viral.
An Australian woman, Leanne Rowe,
started sounding French after she was in a car accident.
It makes me so angry because I am Australian.
I am not French.
The cognitive scientist Lindsay Nichols
argued that this was the result of changes in the pronunciation of vowels.
The brain damage affected the way her jaw, lips, and tongue were situated.
When someone is speaking in a non-native language,
they often have to make changes in the ways their mouth muscles move,
and are situated,
and the accident in this case resulted in that same kind of adjustment.
So this woman didn't spontaneously develop a French accent,
but instead, the accent's effect on language production
resulted in a way of speaking that reminded people of a French accent.
Etymology of OK is unknown.
OK, so what's the deal with OK?
The word is actually a lot newer than you might expect.
The first known use of OK comes from a joke article in the Boston Morning Post
from 1839, where OK was an abbreviation of all-correct.
The context for this was that it was oddly fashionable
in the early 19th century to deliberately misspell things
and use them as acronyms.
No-go becomes no-go with a K, or KG.
All-right becomes all-right, or OW,
and all-correct becomes all-correct, or OK.
For a long time, people speculated about the linguistic origin of OK,
suggesting Latin, Greek, Scottish, French, or other origins.
One idea is that it came from the Choctaw word OK,
which Andrew Jackson supposedly started using
after hanging out with members of a Choctaw tribe.
Even Woodrow Wilson believed this,
and often wrote OK with an E and an H on official papers
because he claimed that OK was incorrect.
This seems to be a myth, though,
and I also couldn't find any translations of OK in online Choctaw dictionaries.
Generative grammar
Generative grammar is the approach to language that looks at how it's structured.
You've got all the different sounds we use, phonology,
O, A, O, A,
Ya, Ay, Ya,
how individual words work, morphology,
how sentences and phrases are built, syntax,
and what the sentence actually means, semantics.
Generative grammar is also often associated with the idea
that human language is structured around a deeper pattern in our mind
that determines how language is formed.
The strongest version of this theory is Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar,
which is the idea that everyone is born with this basic language faculty in our mind.
There are limits on what types of grammar are possible for a human language,
since all language structure is based on this deeper faculty,
so they all must share certain properties.
For example, no matter what language you grow up speaking,
your brain already knows general patterns about how things like nouns and verbs are supposed to work.
You just need to learn the specific meaning of the nouns and verbs in your native language.
Some stuff still varies, like whether adjectives come before or after nouns,
which you still have to learn, but the basic structure is already present.
There are a number of different arguments for and against Universal Grammar,
but I'll be talking a bit more about this later.
Cocoa Gorilla
Cocoa the gorilla might be the most famous gorilla in the world,
second only to Harambe.
She met the likes of Robin Williams, Leonardo DiCaprio, Sting, Flea, and William Shatner.
In 1972, the San Francisco Zoo started to teach Cocoa sign language when she was only one year old,
and after two years she was moved to Stanford, where they started to rigorously train her for eight and a half hours a day.
In 1979, they published a study about Cocoa in the journal Word, and it was peer reviewed.
As results were staggering, Cocoa was able to use complex sign combinations,
which indicated sophisticated cognition.
She was also supposedly able to sign about objects that weren't currently present in her surroundings,
a type of language used called displacement.
She also signed Good Sign to another gorilla learning sign language,
which is an example of meta-language, using language to speak about language itself.
Also, they claimed that she often used language deceptively,
intentionally signing statements that she knew to be false.
Basically lying.
Unfortunately though, the study has been widely criticized.
Most researchers agree that Cocoa never actually understood the meaning of the signs she used,
and she was basically just making gestures in order to get food.
So it was all just complicated operant conditioning, rather than full-on language learning.
And beyond that, a lot of critics pointed out that all of Cocoa's signing was interpreted by the handler,
who may have been attributing meaningful sign combinations to completely meaningless gestures
in order to make it look like the Cocoa project was successful.
This whole Cocoa scenario is reminiscent of the Clever Hands case.
In the early 20th century, the horse known as Clever Hands was taken from town to town,
and his owner showed people how hands could do math, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing,
and loads of other fancy tasks.
Hands would answer every question by tapping his hoof a bunch of times.
But in reality, hands couldn't actually do any of this.
It turns out hands was actually just responding to very subtle body language cues from the trainer,
and the trainer didn't even realize that they were doing them.
Sometime in the 1960s, in the Atherton Table and Rainforests in Australia,
the linguist Robert M.W. Dixon was studying the Aboriginal languages of Australia
and discovered something really strange.
He came across this guy Albert Bennett, who spoke Mabobarum, a now extinct language,
and started asking him to translate basic words.
One of the first words he asked was dog, and Bennett replied dog.
Dixon was confused and thought that Bennett didn't understand the question,
or maybe he didn't know how to actually speak this language at all.
But surprisingly, the Mabobarum word for dog was actually dog,
and was pronounced in almost the exact same way.
Now you might look at this story and think that Mabobarum in English must be related in some way,
but there's no historical evidence for this.
It's entirely a coincidence, and a pretty weird one too.
Out of all the writing systems currently used in the world,
Chinese characters are the oldest,
and compared to Latin script, it seems really complicated.
Out of all the characters, though,
one of them is thought to be the single most complicated character to write.
The traditional character for Biang takes 58 different strokes to write.
If you're less efficient with your writing, it might even take you more strokes to write it.
Anyway, different strokes for different folks.
The word itself refers to a type of noodle.
The origin of the character is also a mystery.
An article in China Daily claims that it's an automata piea
that comes from the sound it makes when the chef bangs the dough into noodles on the table.
There's also an urban legend about a student who wrote down the Biang character on his bill
at a noodle restaurant to get out of paying it,
and he had totally made it up.
Sol Re Sol.
A lot of the constructed languages I've talked about here, like Esperanto,
create a lot of their vocabulary and grammar based on other languages that already exist.
But this language is different.
Sol Re Sol is based on music.
In 1827, the violinist and music teacher François Soudre
built Sol Re Sol out of the familiar Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do syllables.
The words are built by combining these syllables together,
but since there were so few of them, things could get really complicated really fast.
So Soudre Sol decided to cap it to five syllable words.
If you have good pitch, you can even sing the language based on the notes of each syllable,
but you could also just speak it normally.
In France, Soudre Sol brought his work to the public, and the press covered it extensively.
Even Victor Hugo seemed to think it was a really cool project.
He had spent over three decades working on this language,
but after he died it faded into obscurity.
It's had a bit of a resurgence recently, though, with the internet
and the rise of the constructed language community.
In 1819, near the Singapore River,
some laborers going through the jungle found a large slab of sandstone
with some inscriptions on the side.
The writing is in Kawi script, and it also has some Sanskrit words in there.
By the time it was found, the people who lived on the island couldn't understand what it said,
and to this day, linguists still haven't fully deciphered it.
The stone is believed to be from the 10th to the 14th century.
The stone itself and its physical location also seem to be related to a Malay legend,
the strong man Badang.
The story goes that he was a slave working to clear a forest.
While fishing in the Singapore River, he managed to catch a genie,
who agreed to grant him one wish.
Badang asked to be the strongest man of all time,
since he figured that that would help him be a better slave,
since he could clear the trees faster.
Not a bad wish by any means, but given his circumstances,
I could definitely think of a better one.
In any case, he became very strong and was able to uproot trees effortlessly.
Over time, his feats of strength caught the attention of the king,
who ended up appointing him the commander of the army.
The king of India also reached out and sent a strong man of his own to the Malay archipelago
to compete in a competition to see who was stronger.
The competition involved lifting a large rock.
The other strong man was able to hoist it up before letting it fall,
but Badang picked it up no problem and threw it towards the Singapore River.
As the legend goes, this was the Singapore Stone.
Now let's return to more modern times.
A few decades after the stone turned up, the British colonized the area
and ended up blowing up the Singapore Stone to make room for a fort they wanted to build.
Now only a small fragment remains.
Here's another artifact for you.
In 1639, a golden horn turned up in Denmark with some rune inscriptions on it,
and then about a hundred years passed.
In 1734, they found a very similar golden horn.
It was about 15 meters away from the first one, but it took them a hundred years to find it.
The horns were created around 400 AD, and the runic inscriptions look something like this.
It translates from Norse to I, his name, made the horn.
This is one of the earliest examples of a full sentence in these kinds of runes,
and it's also the earliest preserved line of alliteration with the three H's.
In 1802, the horns were stolen by some goldsmith guy who broke into the storage area with forged keys
and melted them down for gold to sell.
Fortunately, people had made drawings of them, so replicas were made.
That didn't stop the thieves, though.
About 200 years later, in 1993, the copies were stolen
and then promptly thrown away into a nearby forest and recovered by authorities.
And then again in 2007, silver copies were stolen from a different museum,
but recovered again a few days later.
It seems the lesson here is that reverence for ancient artifacts
can always be thwarted by coveting precious metals.
Imagine you had such contempt for the French that you spoke a version of English
with none of the vocabulary that was borrowed from French.
That's English.
In 1966, the term was coined by Paul Jennings in the British satirical magazine Punch,
as part of a series on the 900th anniversary of the Norman conquest of England.
English is the language we should have had if the Normans had been defeated at Hastings.
That's an agence from one of the articles.
Oh, sorry, agence is anglish, for quote.
That's just one like thing of how we have to shift certain common words to miss using anything from the French.
Speaking English is pretty hard, since a pretty huge chunk of English words don't come from Germanic.
It turns out that English is actually part of a pretty long-standing attitude of linguistic purism.
Even some famous writers had this attitude and tried to avoid using foreign words in English prose.
Charles Dickens would sometimes use a kind of English, using gleamon instead of musician,
sicker instead of certainly, or end say for conclusion.
In politics in the English language, George Orwell also criticized the usage of borrowed words
and seemed to think that they were too pretentious.
Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers,
are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones,
and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine,
subacquious, and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their Anglo-Saxon opposite numbers.
Winston Churchill's speech writing technique also involved using primarily Germanic words
with as few syllables as possible to make his speeches punchier and easier to understand.
This whole attitude can be traced back to the famous inkhorn controversy in England
during the 16th and 17th centuries.
At the time, tons of words from Latin and French were starting to get used, mostly by academics.
Some people thought that this was great, and English was being revitalized with all these new words to express new things.
But other people thought that it was just pretentious garbage.
One of the main purists was Sir John Check, who wrote,
I am of the opinion that our tongue should be written clean and pure,
unmixed and unmangled with borrowing of other tongues.
But eventually this debate slowly came to an end.
We kept a lot of terms, like impede, but not others, like exped, which we now use in expedient and expedite.
All of this was basically just a development of English during the Renaissance.
There was a little more fast-paced than usual.
There's nothing anybody can do to slow down the evolution of language, no matter how much they hate the French.
Universal mom and dad.
It makes sense why the words we use for our parents in English is pretty similar to mama and papa in French,
mama and babbo in Italian, and mama and papa in Norwegian,
since all of these languages traced back to proto-Indo-European.
But other languages also have similar-sounding words, too.
Swahili has mama and baba.
Tagalog in the Philippines has nanae and tatay.
And even Mandarin has mama and baba.
So what's going on here?
How do all these completely disconnected languages all have such similar words for our moms and dads?
It actually has to do with how babies start to learn to talk.
The early linguist Roman Jacobson figured out that if you're a baby and randomly babbling,
the easiest vowel to make is ah, because you don't have to put your tongue or lips in any particular shape.
You just open your mouth and make noise.
And naturally, if you're going to switch things up, the first thing you'll try to do is close the lips,
leading to an mmm sound.
Together, that forms mama.
The next step, once you get a bit more creative with your baby mouth,
is to put your lips together and blow out a puff of air,
leading to a sound like p or b.
So naturally, since you spend most of the time as a baby with your mom,
mama is attributed to the mother,
and papa, the more sophisticated version that you learn later,
is attributed to your dad.
Glossolalia
Glossolalia is also known as speaking in tongues,
which itself is also known as a great album by the Talking Heads.
It basically involves uttering utter gibberish that sounds like real speech,
but doesn't mean anything.
It's been used as a religious practice,
notably in Pentecostalism, to achieve a direct experience with God.
This tongue speaking was widely analyzed by the U of T linguist William Samarin in 1972.
It turns out that this kind of speech is pretty similar to human language.
It has an accent, a rhythm, an intonation,
and even pauses to break up speech into individual words.
The sounds the speaker uses also tend to be the sounds found in their native language.
But despite all those similarities,
none of this makes glossolalia a full-on language,
since there's no structure to what any of the sounds mean.
Doord
Doord, noun, physics and chemistry, a abbreviation for density.
This definition was included in the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 1934.
But doord isn't actually a real word.
The story of how this happened is also kind of funny.
The chemistry editor for the dictionary had sent in a slip of paper
to include an abbreviation for density.
It looked like this, D or D, Kant, density.
The intended meaning here was that the letter D, capitalized or uncapitalized,
could be an abbreviation for density.
But the person submitting definitions read D or D as a full word, doord,
and this wasn't caught by proofreaders.
Five years after it was published,
an editor noticed that this word didn't have any etymology
and realized it was a mistake, so it was taken out.
Doord
It's cool.
Natural languages are adequate, but that doesn't mean they're optimal.
That's what John Kajada told The New Yorker in an article about the language he constructed.
In 2004, he set up a web page titled Ithquil,
a philosophical design for a hypothetical language.
And I have to say, it's pretty cool.
This web page was huge, though.
It was nearly 160,000 words describing the grammar, vocabulary, and structure of the language.
The goal of the language was pretty similar to log-lan,
to create a perfect language that lent itself to logical thinking,
emphasized brevity and expressing thoughts,
and avoiding ambiguity as much as possible.
The logical part is cool enough,
but the way it's able to collapse long ideas into bite-sized pieces is astonishing.
This sentence, on the contrary,
I think it may turn out that this rugged mountain range trails off at some point,
turns into this.
And the phrase,
characteristic of a single component among the synergistic amalgamation of things,
is a single adjective, this.
The language started to blow up when a Russian magazine, Computera,
wrote an article about it,
and talked about the language's similarities to a fictional language in the sci-fi novella, Gulf,
written by Robert Heinlein in 1949.
The novella involves this highly advanced society,
who speak a language called speed talk,
which condenses entire sentences into single words.
This allows them to communicate more efficiently,
and eventually conquer the world.
This type of language is also reminiscent of Chinese.
When Westerners were first exposed to it,
they were really excited about the idea that each character
signified a full concept, rather than just a sound.
After the philosopher Lybonus heard about this,
he speculated about a kind of futuristic language
that followed this type of system,
with universal characters representing concepts,
in the same way that Arabic numerals represent quantities.
He wrote,
In 2008, Ithquil was given the Smiley Award
for the best invented language of the year
by David Peterson, the president of the Language Creation Society,
and the inventor of Dothraki,
the fictional language used in Game of Thrones.
The thing with Ithquil is that it was never actually meant to be spoken.
The word Ithquil means
hypothetical representation of a language.
John was trying to create something
that could show what language could be,
conveying deeper levels of meaning as efficiently as possible.
So given that, there aren't really any active speakers of Ithquil.
One linguist wrote that it
has an assumption of efficiency that isn't really efficient,
given how the brain works.
It misses the metaphor stuff,
but the parts that are successful are really non-trivial.
This may be an impossible language,
but if you think of it as a conceptual art project,
I think it's fascinating.
Sometime in the early 17th century,
at an island near Iceland,
a group of Basque speakers from an area near Spain and France
were hanging out to do some whaling,
and they made contact with some of the Icelandic fishermen.
They interacted with them for a while,
and eventually a pigeon formed,
combining aspects of each of their languages.
Most of the phrases they used, as you might expect,
related to whaling and fishing.
Like, if Christ and Mary would give me a whale,
I would give you the tail.
Along with more everyday expressions,
like this, which would translate into
I will give you sponge cake and cider.
You might be wondering why Basque people
had traveled so far to go whaling.
It turns out that they had actually been whaling
since the Middle Ages,
and were one of the first groups of people to do it for profit.
But as time went on,
other cultures started hunting whales
into their territory.
So the Basques spread out to places like Newfoundland
and Iceland, where there was less competition.
The situation was pretty good for both parties for a while.
The Icelandic people didn't really actively hunt whales,
and mostly just took the meat and bones
from whales who had already washed up on the beach.
So the Basques came in,
provided fresher meat that they had hunted,
and even paid taxes.
But this didn't last too long.
In 1615, a group of Basque whalers got shipwrecked
and stranded on the coast for a full winter.
They ran out of food,
and resorted to stealing from the Icelandic people
to survive.
But the Icelandics didn't take too well to this,
so the Basques were massacred.
Iceland even had a law that made it totally legal
to kill Basques on site,
and that law was only repealed in 2015.
Butterfly refers to their poop.
The etymology of butterfly isn't fully known.
One suggestion is that it comes from the buttery yellow color
of the common sulfur butterfly.
Another idea comes from the old German name,
Butterlecker,
and Milk Dieb,
since people in the Middle Ages
might have believed that butterflies went around
stealing milk and butter.
And here's the funny one.
Old Dutch has the term
buttersheet, or buttershit.
This is in reference to the bright yellow poop
called meconium that butterflies produce
after they undergo metamorphosis.
See from Glyff.
There are variations of the ocular O,
which were all included at once.
Even though this specific character
only ever appeared once,
it was part of this larger group of characters
that were fairly common,
so they figured they'd throw this one in too.
If you visit the Paramalana village
in Greece, you'll hear people
speaking a rare type of Greek
called syconica.
It's a 3,000-year-old language,
and descends from the Greek city-state
of Sparta.
These days, it's very rare to find people speaking it,
even among syconians.
Only about 2,000 people speak it,
most of whom also speak Greek,
since that's the official language of the region.
It has a pretty similar alphabet
to modern or ancient Greek,
but it uses a lot more phonetic letters,
and has a fairly different structure and pronunciation.
It's different enough that modern Greek speakers
wouldn't be able to understand it at all.
Because of how few people speak this language
and the fact that most of them are pretty old,
syconian is classified as a critically endangered language.
The proto-world, or the proto-human language,
is the idea that every single language in the world
descended from one single original language.
The basic argument is that all humans around the world
have the capacity to learn any language.
Presumably, earlier humans had this ability too,
so languages today must trace back to some period of time
where only one language was spoken
and spread out and diversified over time.
This isn't entirely clear-cut, though,
since it is possible that ancient humans
had the capacity to use language,
but language still hadn't developed yet,
so the linguistic ability came before language development.
Or maybe language started and stopped
a bunch of different times throughout human history,
meaning that it could start fresh independently
in two different isolated human communities.
In this case, there could be proto-language 1,
proto-language 2, proto-language 3, and so on.
We don't know for sure, though,
and there's no direct evidence for either of these options.
Some linguists have even gone as far as to speculate
what this proto-language might have sounded like
by comparing loads of different languages around the world.
If only we had invented writing tens of thousands of years earlier
than we did, then maybe we'd actually know for sure.
Linear B
In 1900, some clay tablets turned up in Crete,
and nobody could figure out what they said.
It came to be known as Linear B,
and remained a mystery until 1952,
when the British architect and amateur linguist,
Michael Ventress, finally cracked it.
Naturally, he got all the credit,
but as with a lot of scientific achievements,
there was a woman behind it all who got little to no credit.
She was a classicist from the US, Alice Kober,
and before Michael ever took a shot at cracking Linear B,
she was busy working hard on it making progress.
It was she who was working hundreds of hours with a slide rule,
sitting at her dinner table, a cigarette burning at her elbow,
pouring over the few published inscriptions,
looking and looking for patterns.
Rather than trying to make any wild speculations,
she meticulously recorded the frequency of every symbol
and their position in words.
This was long before computers,
so she stored all the information on index cards
made of scrap paper that she held in cigarette cartons.
Ventress started to build on this work, too,
and they even met each other at one point in Oxford.
They didn't exactly hit it off, though.
It seemed like she underestimated him
because he wasn't an academically trained linguist,
and he underestimated her because she was a woman.
Kober was on the precipice of a huge discovery,
and started to notice patterns
with the way that groups of symbols started and ended.
But right before the major breakthrough happened,
she fell ill and died suddenly in 1950.
Ventress picked up where she left off
and eventually cracked Linear B.
Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be an old form of ancient Greek.
Ventress did mention Kober's contributions
thoroughly in talks and stuff, though,
and fully acknowledged her contributions,
so she got some credit, too.
Except at the time nobody actually cared,
and he ended up getting all the credit for himself.
Linear B, as a term, also raises the question,
what about Linear A?
It turns out there is a slab of script
that was found in the same area.
A lot less of it survived, though,
and as of today, it hasn't been deciphered.
This is something I've touched on a bit already
when I was talking about generative grammar.
This is the idea that language is pre-programmed
into our brains when we're born.
We don't pop out of our mothers, speaking English or Mandarin,
but we do pop out with some vague, pre-existing understanding
of how language generally works.
Before this, people like B.F. Skinner, the rat-button guy,
put forward the idea that language learning
is basically just a process of conditioning and reinforcement.
We watch someone point to a dog and say dog,
and then later, we point to a dog and say dog,
and someone tells us, good job, that is a dog. Nice.
This was all tied to his general psychological theory
of behaviorism that saw the human mind
as a basic input-output system.
Later on, Noam Chomsky brutally annihilated Skinner's arguments.
He pointed out that when you actually look
at how children learn language,
they don't learn from people telling them
that they used the right word or grammar.
They learn by watching TV or listening
to other people talk around them.
Children can also construct sentences
that they've never heard before.
The way language is used is a lot more complicated
than, you used the right sentence there. Nice.
Or, you didn't use the right sentence there. What are you doing?
It seems unlikely that language learning
is similar to a rat learning to press a button to get food.
This new idea from Chomsky was pretty huge at the time,
since the dominant view was that basically
all forms of learning were reinforcement-based.
Psychologists couldn't continue to look at the mind
as a black box, only focusing on input and output.
They had to try to understand what was actually going on
inside the black box.
Another interesting piece of evidence for innateness
came up more recently.
You might remember earlier when I talked about pigeons.
Hodgepodge languages built out of combinations
of two existing languages
to allow two communities to communicate
and how they can transform into creoles over time
when children learn those pigeons as their native language.
Steven Pinker has argued that this
creolization is only possible
because the innate language structures
these children have allows them
to add complexity to the pigeons
and slowly develop them into fully-fledged languages.
This isn't just the kids learning how to communicate
with people using their pigeons,
but it's them taking that pigeon
and applying the linguistic universals they're born with.
It's important to mention that language
innateness has been criticized as well.
Some have argued that the fact that languages
all have similar structures is perfectly normal,
and we shouldn't have to appeal
to an underlying mental structure to account for it.
English is a pigeon.
There are two things I think this entry might be referring to.
The first is a theory about how English came about.
When you look at Old English and Middle English,
they're really different.
It could be that all the French influence
in the German conquest of England
resulted in a creolization process
that smushed together the two languages,
which eventually developed into modern English.
But some scholars have also argued
that this smushing together
was a lot less comprehensive than originally thought,
and it was basically just some borrowing of words,
rather than a full-on adjustment
of morphology and syntax,
and that the other Germanic languages
experienced similar innovations around the same time.
The other possible meaning of this entry
is that the meme-maker is doing a bit.
The entry might be suggesting that English is a pigeon,
and that it's the way people communicate with each other
when they have no language in common.
Antonio Gramsci talked about how language
was always tied to the enlargement of the governing class,
the relationships between the governing groups,
and the national popular mass,
and the fight over cultural hegemony.
If language is a war,
it looks like English is winning,
with about 1.5 billion speakers
and accounting for 60% of internet content.
Loads of modern words that come from English
are co-opted by other languages,
sometimes begrudgingly,
like French people starting to refer to
Le Wocchisme.
In Europe,
nearly every single student studies English at some point.
In France specifically,
young students are required to study
one of eight foreign languages,
and 90% of them choose English.
In Tunisia,
employees who know how to speak fluent English
earn 5% more,
and in Iraq they earn 200% more.
When world leaders speak to each other,
English is often the common language,
even if neither of them speak it as their native tongue.
So against all odds,
English,
with its wealth of exceptions,
bizarre characteristics,
and frankly weird sound,
it has become the great equalizer
in politics and culture.
This is the ultimate Joe Rogan idea.
It checks all the boxes,
wild speculation,
vaguely scientific sounding,
psychedelics,
and apes.
It comes from Terrence McKenna,
who was an outspoken advocate
for responsible psychedelic use,
and held lectures discussing mysticism,
philosophy,
and insights from the psychedelic experience.
He was a pretty big deal
in the 80s and 90s counterculture scene
in California,
and his lectures
have blown up on YouTube after his death.
One of his more bizarre ideas
is the so-called Stoned Ape Theory.
He speculated that ancient humans,
who tracked cattle herds while hunting,
probably ended up ingesting magic mushrooms
that grow on cow dung.
The reason they decided to eat the revolting stuff
was because it would have improved visual acuity
to help with hunting.
In larger doses,
it would increase energy
and help with social bonding,
and all this stuff
would have been evolutionarily useful.
The trips they experienced on these drugs
also might have accelerated their cultural evolution,
giving rise to early forms of religion
and spirituality,
the arts.
And most importantly, language.
Generally, this idea isn't widely accepted,
but there are parts of it that might be plausible.
It's totally conceivable
that early humans consumed psychedelic drugs,
and those experiences
might have impacted their culture.
But the strong version of the Stoned Ape Theory
goes as far as to say that this psychedelic use
altered the actual genetics of the early humans
and directly caused the beginning of language,
which seems unlikely.
I didn't find it persuasive,
and in fact,
if you press Terence McCann,
he didn't find it entirely persuasive.
It's an interesting speculation.
It's kind of a mind game.
I can see how psychedelics would influence the mind
and create new ideas, new memes,
and might contribute to language.
But how does it get into the genes?
I see psychedelics as having had a profound effect
at the level of cultural evolution,
that there are lots of interesting innovations
that people who had psychedelic experience
introduced to our culture.
Sun Language
A bizarre take on the whole proto-world
original language question
came from an unlikely place,
Turkish ultra-nationalists.
The Sun Language is a pseudo-linguistic,
pseudo-scientific pseudo-theory
from Turkey around the mid-1930s
that basically states that
the first human language started in Turkey.
The rationale has to do with the idea
that all languages started out as hieroglyphics
and script in the Sumerian civilization.
The Turkish linguists believed
that the Sumerian culture had Turkish origins,
so therefore, Turkey was the cradle of language.
The first president of Turkey was a big supporter of this theory,
and given his influence, was able to popularize the idea.
This was politically convenient, too,
since it really aligned with the whole nationalist
Turkey number one thing.
As the story goes, primitive humans in Turkey
were so struck by the effects of the sun,
they built a spirituality around a sun deity.
As they developed language,
the first word they assigned was ag, for the sun.
And from there, the rest of language was built.
Some linguists have suggested that this whole theory
was basically just political cope.
At the time, the Turkish language had a bunch of loanwords
from Arabic and Persian
that the authorities were trying to get rid of,
but the public didn't seem to be adopting
their new Turkish replacements.
They just assumed that all languages ended up starting in Turkey.
These loanwords could still be considered Turkish, in a way,
so they could still maintain this nationalist vibe
without having to change the language.
This one is pretty wacky.
In the early 2000s, an amateur linguist
posted a number of long, sprawling web pages
with bizarre ramblings about his linguistic theories.
The whole project was apparently a hobby he took up during retirement.
He never studied linguistics or philology at all.
In fact, he had a BA in forestry.
He wrote,
Now, why would someone with formal training
in forest and land administration
surveying aerial photo interpretation,
wildlife suppression, forest ecology, botany, etc.,
venturing to fields as remote as linguistics,
Homeric studies,
Irish ogum inscription translation,
pre-Christian religion, and archaeology?
Here was obviously a wide-open and interesting field of study,
which for centuries had attracted many non-academic outsiders,
who made great contributions to the science they chose to work on.
So notably, he believed that the Basque language
was the one and only original language,
and the whole idea of how languages work,
according to other linguists, is total bullshit.
For him, every language besides Basque is fake,
and was invented by the Benedictine monks.
He suggested that people weren't buying the whole Tower of Babel story,
since everyone around only spoke Basque.
So the monks invented a bunch of other languages
and spread them around the world, so that the myth made sense.
It was in Babel that the Lord confused the language of all the earth,
and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the earth.
Could all the Indo-European languages
be the product of highly skilled religious linguists?
It may be hard to believe, but that is exactly what happened.
There have been a few forum threads of people laughing at this guy's crazy theories,
and some of his made-up Basque etymologies.
One person wrote,
I'd highly recommend spending some time scrolling through this guy's webpage,
or some of the forum threads about him if you find this as funny as I do.
One of the defining features of Italian culture
is the widespread use of hand gestures alongside speech.
The origin of the unique use of hand gestures in Italy is still an open question,
but some scholars have speculated that it comes from the Romans,
who used what's called Chironomia, a system of hand gestures to communicate.
Here's some examples of some of the basic ones that you can add to your repertoire
if you want a role play as the godfather or a fancy Italian chef.
Pinched fingers pointing up means what or what do you mean?
Prayer hands means please or could you do this for me?
The okay hand is perfect.
Kissing all your fingers and extending your arm away means delicious.
Putting your index and middle finger in a V shape and bringing it to your mouth
means to ask for a cigarette.
So this one you gotta be careful with.
Bend your arm in an L shape with your fist pointing up
and slap your bicep as you raise your arm up.
This means fuck you and is similar to giving the finger.
Humans love patterns.
Patterns are great.
Always need patterns.
Can never have enough patterns.
We always need to be making arbitrary associations between concepts.
It's very important.
One such association is in Afghanistan with the number 39.
Can you give me pattern-seeking brain?
To avoid predators?
Yes.
Actually develops arbitrary association between the number 39, curse, shame, and prostitution.
People caught with the 39 on their license plate
are met with other drivers flashing their lights,
honking their horns, and pointing at them.
People have even started painting over their license plates to change the 9 to an 8.
Traffic commission workers are receiving bribes of upwards of $230
to issue different plates.
And people trying to sell cars with the 39 plate
have to discount it by $2,000.
Selling an apartment with unit number 39 is also pretty much impossible.
It's unclear exactly why this association emerged,
but it seems to be having very real consequences.
One suggestion is that it comes from an infamous Afghan pimp
who went by the name 39 since his car had a 39 plate
and he lived in apartment number 39.
But that story could be totally fake,
and it could just be flat-out corruption.
Police officials might have spread this myth
so they can get bribes to have people's plate names changed.
And car dealers might have been in on this too,
since they could buy 39 plate cars at a discount,
change the plates, and then resell for a profit.
Codex seraphineanus.
I present you with this bizarre illustration of a procreating couple
who slowly animorph into a crocodile.
This is from the Codex seraphineanus by Luigi Seraphini,
which has been appreciated by literary giants
like Umberto Eco, Roland Barth, and Italo Calvino.
It basically consists of a bunch of general encyclopedic topics
like flora and fauna, physics and chemistry,
machines and gizmos, history, culture, and other things,
but all in a super surreal style.
Luigi started on this project in the 70s,
and as this insider article reads,
was possibly under the influence of psychedelics
or other worldly forces.
Originally, Luigi wanted this book to be published completely anonymously
because he was fascinated with the Voynick manuscript
and its mysterious origins.
But eventually he compromised,
and it was published under the name Seraphinianus
to give his own name a Latin-sounding mystique.
The relevant part of this bewildering work
is that it's written in a completely imaginary language.
The script looks familiar to Western writing,
being read and left to write rows,
with uppercase and lowercase letters.
In 2009, Luigi claimed that the writing in the Codex
doesn't actually have any meaning at all,
and his goal was to create that childlike sense you get
when you look at text as a small child that you can't understand,
but you assume that adults know what it means.
When you look at sign language around the world,
a lot of them are related to each other in these large families.
But Nicaraguan sign language is an exception.
It developed almost entirely in isolation.
Deaf children in Nicaragua were generally isolated from the other kids,
and were never taught writing or signing.
So in 1977, when school for the deaf opened up,
the kids ended up inventing a language of their own,
with later generations building on what they learned from the older kids.
Linguists were absolutely stoked about this language
when they heard about it,
since it's a rare example of an entirely new language
developing from the beginning.
Linguists have been stuck analyzing creoles,
combinations of two existing languages,
but they've never been able to witness something this unique.
In particular, they were really excited about the fact
that it was children creating the language, rather than adults.
Things like verb agreement and grammar conventions
emerged naturally, without anyone teaching the kids about it beforehand.
All of this can be seen as proof of the whole
language and nateness thing,
since these kids seem to have
that built-in understanding of language structure.
This is the final word in the musical guide,
It turns out that this word isn't real at all.
It might have been a tongue-in-cheek joke with the translation of conclusion as the
final word in the Encyclopedia.
As it turns out, Meori doesn't have the kind of consonant clusters found in this word,
like two zeds followed by an x, or even a ss or sh sound.
Meori dictionaries do actually have words for drum in conclusion, but they look nothing
like zshonwa or shaw.
A strange disk was discovered in a basement cell in Crete by the Italian archaeologist
Luigi Pernier in 1908.
Different Luigi from last time, though.
The disk is pretty interesting, and there are loads of wild ideas of what it says.
Some think it's an astronomical calendar, an ancient computer, a board game, or even
pre-Homeric poetry.
It's also believed to be the very first printed document in the world, existing over 3,000
years before the Gutenberg Bible.
It's absolutely clear that the characters on the disk were punched or stamped in, rather
than individually carved out.
This is weird for a couple reasons.
Why was this printed when basically every other document at the time was manually inscribed?
Egyptian hieroglyphs and Mesopotamian cuneiform were inscribed in stone or clay, and linear
A and B, which were found in the same area, were inscribed as well.
This could mean that printing was invented at one point, and then disappeared for thousands
of years before being invented again.
But there's something a little suspicious about this disk.
Nobody wants to actually check to see how old it is.
The mystique surrounding the disk made it a national icon in Greece, and the main attraction
at a museum.
Some scholars have requested to get it thermoluminescence tested to figure out how old it is, but
the Greek authorities keep denying them.
This raises a question.
Is this all just a big hoax that was made up in 1908?
As of now, linguists have still tried to decipher the disk, but progress is looking grim.
They did determine that it's probably structured similarly to linear A and B, where each sign
represents a full syllable, since there are 45 different kinds of characters.
And that's way bigger than any alphabet, where characters represent individual vowels
or consonants.
But there isn't much text to work with, given how many characters there are, which means
they won't be able to decode it without more samples from around this time.
It would be pretty cool if the Greek authorities let them test its age, to see if the linguists
are just wasting their time.
But for now, it remains a mystery.
The Swedish word for yes is shop.
But in some northern communities, they use a sound that makes you think they're gasping
for air.
That's it.
That's the entire entry.
Now you know.
As the story goes, in 1170, the ruler of a kingdom in what is now Wales died, and his
sons engaged in an epic King Lear-type succession battle that resulted in a civil war.
One of his sons, Madag, thought all the fighting was too annoying and decided to leave.
He sailed west and ended up finding America, where he built a settlement with some of his
crew, and then promptly left.
So according to this story, it wasn't Christopher Columbus in the Spanish who took credit for
discovering the land that indigenous people in North America already inhabited, but it
was actually the Welsh.
In the 17th century, there were a lot of rumors about encounters with these so-called Welsh
Indians.
They usually involved the Welshmen being taken prisoner by indigenous Americans and set
up to be executed.
At this point, the Welshmen would start protesting or praying in Welsh, and his captors recognized
that he's speaking the same language as them and decided to release him.
These later, once the British explorers had arrived, they decided to investigate to see
if the stories of the Welsh Indians were true.
In 1791, this guy wrote,
Some of this ended up ringing true.
Both languages have the words barah for bread and crosso for welcome.
But these folks conveniently ignored the fact that almost every single other word had an
unrecognizable translation.
Part of the reason these rumors started is simple racism.
The historian Samuel Eliot Morrison wrote that
Uneducated travelers were apt to regard every Indian language as gibberish, and so compared
it with some known languages such as Welsh, Basque, Hebrew, or Finnish that was also gibberish
to them.
Everyone wanted the credit for being the brave explorers who discovered America, venturing
into lands never before touched by humans.
But instead, it was actually the indigenous people of that land who traveled there from
Siberia, long before these explorers ventured anywhere.
But unfortunately for them, the Europeans stormed in, slaughtered a bunch of them, systematically
worked to destroy their culture, and claimed it as their own.
This Egyptian hieroglyph is part of a carving in an ancient temple, and looks suspiciously
like a helicopter.
Were the ancient Egyptians a lot more technologically advanced than we thought?
Did people travel back in time and tell them about modern flying vehicles?
Did aliens make contact with them?
Unfortunately not.
The real reason is a lot less fun.
It turns out that this stone had actually been reused.
Initially, it said, he who repulses the nine.
Years later it was filled in, and re-carved, to say, he who protects Egypt and overthrows
the foreign countries.
The plaster they used to fill it had eroded away over the past 3,000 or so years.
So both the inscriptions are partly visible simultaneously, which resulted in this strange
helicopter shape, which isn't an actual Egyptian hieroglyph at all.
A little known fact is that an ancient Hebrew tribe actually sailed all the way to Japan
and influenced their writing system.
Just look at all these similarities in their characters, except none of this actually happened.
It's widely believed that katakana is based on Chinese kanji, and was developed over a
thousand years ago by Japanese monks to annotate Chinese Buddhist texts.
The characters in this image are a very tiny subset of Japanese characters that just happen
to look similar to some Hebrew characters.
In Proto-Indo-European, nine is noon, which is pretty similar to the word new.
There's an interesting theory for why this might be the case.
Some linguists suspect that early Proto-Europeans counted with eight fingers, leaving out the
thumbs.
So when they get to nine, they needed a new set of fingers, which explains why this word
is similar to new.
It turns out that the Neanderthals had a hyoid bone, this thing in their necks, that is one
of the main structures humans use to produce speech.
And computer modeling studies have shown that they use it in a similar way to how we do.
For non-human primates that can't talk, their hyoid bone is situated differently, so it
isn't in the proper position to make vocalizations like speech possible.
Now, this doesn't definitively prove that Neanderthals used language, but it does show
that they definitely might have.
And that fact alone is pretty fascinating.
Language is often seen as one of the defining features of humanity.
It's what makes us human, but this might suggest that it's not unique to us.
As dumb as it sounds, there is some evidence showing that you can help your language learning
by listening to tapes while you sleep.
Some Swiss researchers had a group of German-speaking participants, and gave them a bunch of Dutch
words to learn at 10 p.m. one night.
They split them up into two groups.
The first group was told to go to sleep, while the other groups stayed awake.
And all of them listened to audio of the word pairs they learned.
At 2 a.m., everybody was tested to see how many words they could remember.
It turned out that the group that slept ended up remembering significantly more words.
It's important to remember, though, that this only works because they were exposed
to the words already when they were awake.
If you put on an audiobook in Spanish while you sleep, without doing any work when you're
awake, you're probably not going to wake up speaking fluent Spanish, especially if
the record skips.
I'm saving the money, though, because I'm playing trips to Spain, so I bought an album
that teaches you the language.
You put the album on, you put headphones on, you learn the language while you're sleeping.
During the night, the record skipped.
I get up the next day, I can only stutter in Spanish.
This has been the Linguistics Iceberg.
I'd like to thank the Reddit user Dragonor for creating this iceberg meme.
If you had this video on for background noise, and you're now scrambling to find something
else to quiet your thoughts, I'd recommend checking out my other iceberg videos, on
Philosophy and Psychological Experiments.
Thank you for watching or listening.
Have a great rest of your day.
