Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me on the show again.
This week, we're talking once again about climate change. See, a couple weeks ago,
I had Dr. Hannah Ritchie on the show, and she made the case that if you look at all these different
indices, emissions per capita, the price of renewable energy, deforestation, a lot of things
are moving in the right direction, and that that is cause for hope. Now, I expressed some skepticism
about this and a lot of you did as well in the comments below the episode. And that's because,
you know, we have made some progress, but the progress we have made is clearly insufficient.
And even though we've made progress on some solutions that have leveraged the power of
capitalism to say, make one kind of energy cheaper than another, sell electric cars and stuff like
that, well, that's kind of the easy solution, isn't it? To sell clean energy when it's just as cheap
as fossil fuels. But getting people, or God forbid, massive corporations to give up fossil fuels is
hard. So how do we push powerful interest in governments to overlook short-term profit for
the long-term benefits of having a planet that's, you know, habitable? I ask how because clearly,
we haven't done it yet. Climate change is only partially a problem of technology. Primarily,
it's a social problem that our entire society caused. And it's an open question whether our
collective decision-making institutions are advanced enough to deal with that problem. I mean,
it's much easier to make a cheaper solar cell than it is to get all world governments to agree
to decarbonize. But mass decarbonization is what we actually need, right? So if we want to look at
how society can change, we need to look at more than just technological fixes. We have to look
at the science behind what causes social change and institutional transformation that is a huge
and hard problem. And you can't figure it out just by looking at the atmosphere or brand new
awesome clean technologies. You need to talk to a sociologist. Well, guess what? On the show this
week, we in fact have a sociologist who has written an incredible new book about how we can
actually create the massive social change we need to fight climate change in the face of corporate
opposition to that change. I know you are going to love this interview, but before we get to it,

And now let's get to today's guest. I am so excited to introduce you to Dr. Dana Fisher.
She's a sociologist and she's the director of the Center for Environment, Community and Equity
and a professor in the School of International Service at American University. She's been following
the politics and sociology of climate change for decades. And her new book is called Saving
Ourselves from Climate Shocks to Climate Action. Please welcome Dr. Dana Fisher.
Dana, thank you so much for being on the show. Thank you for having me, Adam.
So we talk about climate change a lot on this show. Normally I'm talking to climate scientists,
technologists, people like that. You are a sociologist. You have written a book about the
climate crisis. From a social perspective, why is that? Why is that such an important lens to use?
Well, I mean, at this point, everybody recognizes that the climate crisis is actually a social
problem, right? We created the problem. We society. And the only way to solve it is actually through
us. Like society is going to have to solve it. It's not like the planet is going to save itself,
right? We got to do it because we got to fix the problem we created. So sociology makes a lot of
sense as a place to look for that because we study social processes. Right. Like we can learn
as much as we want about the atmosphere or about clean energy technology. But if we don't understand
the people who are actually going to implement those things or do something about it, then we're
going to be a chitzkrieg, right? Right. I mean, I think it's worth noting here that there are a lot
of natural scientists and atmospheric scientists who have started talking about policy, have started
talking about the social side because they are social beings and that's great. But there are
those of us who are trained and have PhDs specifically in actually studying the social
processes and how they work and have spent our lives and our careers doing that. And I'm one of
them. And so we're, I mean, I think that we provide a lot of opportunity to think through based on
research how social systems work and what will be opening opportunities and what will probably
not work. Great. Well, let's zoom out and start using that lens. A lot of people have a lot of
different stances on climate change. People are techno optimists, whatever. You told me before we
started recording, you would describe yourself as an apocalyptic optimist. I want to know what
that means and how do you frame the problem of climate change like most broadly? Okay. So I'm an
apocalyptic optimist. That means that I believe that we are in trouble and that bad things are
coming and that it is bad. It's getting worse and nothing we've done so far is going to solve
the problem yet. But I am optimistic because while it's bad and it's getting worse,
I believe that we have the capacity to save ourselves and I talked through the book
how we're going to do that. But it's all going to come from us, right? It is not going to be
like the technology that's going to fall from the sky and everything. Oh, I thought that was going
to be bad, but it's okay. It's not going to work that way. It's rather that it's going to involve
struggle and work and we're going to have to all get angry to do it. With regard to understanding
the climate crisis and what it is, basically in the broadest way, it is the fact that the
entire world, the entire industrial system is run on burning fossil fuels, which is basically
having the unintended consequence of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. The one that
we talk about the most is carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is changing the way that our
planet absorbs heat. And also, that is then having an effect on all sorts of environmental
systems and climate systems and the oceans and the poles and the ice caps, etc., and so forth.
So everything's changing thanks to these concentrations that have built up over decades now.
Stopping burning fossil fuels basically means that, I mean, I don't know if this is solar,
but I'm assuming it's not. So all of the electricity that we run our lives, our businesses,
most of our transportation, all of that has to change. I mean, carbon comes from a whole bunch
of things. Methane emitted by cows' asses. Yes, exactly. The ruminants, all the ruminants emit
methane. It's just that cows get most of the attention. You know, goats do it too. So there you
have it. If you're into goat cheese, you know. If you're getting birria tacos, like you are also
emitting methane. So sorry, but please go on. Anyway, so the problem is really tricky because
we have to change the entire system that we are running our economies on, basically. I mean,
there are a couple of countries that have done relatively well because they have the capacity
for clean energy. Some countries, like Norway, for example, dammed their rivers early on so that
99% of all their electricity is actually coming from clean energy because it's hydropower.
And there were very few people except for indigenous folks who lived up there. So they
were able to do it really easily. We don't have that capacity here in the United States.
Most countries don't have that capacity. Isn't Norway also a huge oil driller? Like,
don't they have a gigantic sovereign wealth fund that comes from oil reserves?
They absolutely do. And in fact, one of the things that's kind of ironic about it is they are using
those resources to incentivize people within the country to switch to electric vehicles, right?
But they're still making money. They're still opening up areas for extraction,
but then they're selling the oil to other countries.
Yeah, see, this is a little bit of a tangent, but I went to Norway a couple of years ago,
and lovely country, one of those countries where you go and you're like, why can't everything be
like, oh, they got solar panels, they got wind, oh, everything's so nice here. Oh, my, everyone's
so polite. Oh, they got public transportation. Everything's good. And then I look around for a
while. What's funding it? This kind of feels like I'm going to my, like a rich kid's house,
you know, like, like I live, like I'm in a neighborhood, I'm middle class, but oh, come
over to my house. This guy, this kid's got a Super Nintendo. They got like a fridge with a nice
dispenser. What's going on? Oh, what does his dad's do for a living? Right? Like this is,
this is wealth that I'm looking at. And where does the wealth come from? They have a gigantic
nationalized oil reserves that they're selling to other countries. So it's a little bit of,
like underneath the surface, there is a dark participation in the same system that we're
all a part of. Absolutely. I mean, and what's interesting is that when folks talk about countries
addressing climate change, a lot of them are talking just about what they're doing within
their borders, right? But a lot of countries, including the United States, has considered
basically addressing climate change internally, but then continuing to self also feels abroad,
right? So for example, in the United States, there's a big push to talk about how we could sell
our natural gas to other countries because, you know, it's cleaner. And, you know, and our labor
practices are better, which, you know, may very well be somewhat true, but it really doesn't
solve the problem. So anyway, going back to the question. So the climate crisis is a,
it's a really tricky one because it basically involves shifting everything and all the ways
that we have industrialized and the ways that we live our lives. And that's one of the reasons that
nothing really has been done in the past 25 years or 30 years since the climate regime began,
which is the international kind of efforts to address climate change. But I think with regard
to techno optimism, the reason I'm no longer a techno optimist is because I have, you know,
I have supported and been excited by a number of different fads. In fact, I was just had a friend
of mine who reached out and was like, oh yeah, clean hydrogen. Green, or sorry, they're calling
it green hydrogen now. Green hydrogen, that's the answer, right? And the deal is that when I
was in college, which was in the 1990s, we went through a whole period of time where we were like,
hydrogen is going to be the future, right? I mean, it's like, and that was a long time ago now,
I recognize that. It's just that we, if we keep counting on technology that's not here yet,
we're running out of time. I mean,
Hey, something's five years away that's going to fix everything.
Right. I know. And then you have to have diffusion of the technology. I mean,
it's just, it's not going to solve the problem if you want to save large portions of the world
that are basically, I mean, some of them are already going to be lost, right?
Lots of small island states are going to be lost. Lots of coastal areas are going to be lost.
Lots of developing countries are going to have to shift their populations to areas that are cooler
or have the resources because a lot of folks are becoming, areas are becoming resource scarce
because of the climate crisis in terms of like water, in terms of food. And as a result of all
of that, we're going to basically have to think about how we address it and leaning into this
idea that don't worry, the technology is almost here, right? Is just extremely dangerous. And
it's not just dangerous globally, but it's dangerous for us here in the United States. I mean,
look at Arizona. I mean, look at some parts of California this past summer and this coming
summer is going to be even worse. Yeah. So you said that nothing has been done or very little
has been done for the past few decades. A number of weeks ago, we had a wonderful guest on named
Hannah Richie who wrote a book called Not the End of the World, a lot of the thesis of the,
and by listening to the episode, if you haven't, it was a wonderful conversation.
It's a great conversation. I listened to it yesterday.
Oh, okay. Great. So I'd like to put you in dialogue with that because I think it'll be
really interesting. Now, her take is, you know, I think a lot of people feel as I did, you know,
I grew up in the Captain Planet era. We have to save the planet. Well, it needs to happen.
And then, you know, here I am 25 years later, right? I'm like,
we didn't do it. We didn't save the planet. Things sure seem to be getting worse. What the
fuck, right? And a lot of Hannah's argument is like, actually, a lot of progress has been made.
If we look at these charts and look at these graphs, we can see a lot of shocking, surprising
progress has been made. And we need to continue that and increase it.
She's often described by people as a techno-optimist. Certainly people were in the comments of our
post on YouTube calling her that. So I'm curious how you engage with that argument. What do you
think that argument gets right? And what do you think it gets wrong with all respect?
Yeah. I mean, so I would just say that, you know, the analysis is legitimate in that it is true that
a number of environmental problems have improved over the years. The problem with climate change,
however, I mean, and climate change is the issue that I have focused basically my whole career
the past 25 years on, is that climate change is a political issue. In fact, it's a social problem
in that we have caused the problem and we, as a society, are going to have to solve it.
And to date, the most valuable measure of success of our efforts to address climate change would be
concentrations of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And if you
look at every one of those charts, it's like a straight slope, right? So it's not tapering off.
It's not like flattening at all. No, I mean, there was a blip during COVID and we are back
on track just like we were before. So yes, there has been a lot of efforts. There have been efforts
globally through multiple efforts through treaties. I actually studied a bunch of them. So I mean,
I started out my dissertation was on the Kyoto Protocol, which was like a lifetime ago, which
was one of the efforts to address climate change. It was not successful for a number of reasons.
More recently, we have the Paris Agreement where most countries have not yet met
and are not going to meet their commitments that they made back in 2015, right? So the thing about
the argument is that while things are getting better and we are per person maybe emitting less,
we're still emitting more. And concentrations of the atmosphere are continuing to go up.
And that is the only thing that the Earth cares about. The Earth doesn't care about if each person
is emitting less. I mean, sure, that's better. But the population is going up too, right? So I mean,
and so for me, I'm looking at the bottom line and I also am looking at the politics of it, right?
The other thing that a lot of people talk about is how we do have policies, right? We have a policy
in place here in the United States now finally after years. And I have studied all of the failed
policies before. So I was delighted to be able to write a paper about a successful policy in the
Inflation Reduction Act. But still, we continue to emit more greenhouse gases every year and
temperatures are going up and we got a problem. So it's been going on for decades. They've been
having these big conferences and everyone's optimistic, right? Right afterwards. I remember
I did an episode of Adam Ruins Everything right after the Paris Agreement. And we covered it as
it was covered by basically everyone at the time. This is the largest step that's ever been taken.
It shows international cooperation on a scale we've never seen before.
There's such reason for optimism, etc. Or this is the best reason for optimism that we have.
And here we are sitting here, what, seven years, eight years later, just sort of casually describing
it as, well, none of them are going to meet the targets, right? So what are the impediments to
when all of the people at these conferences and all the people running the most important countries,
US, European countries, China all agree about the problem, right? They're certainly not ignorant
about it. Why is progress not being made? Well, I mean, before we before we talk about progress
not being made, I just want to say, I mean, one of the things that's interesting is that so they
do they have these meetings every year, and people fly all over the world to go to them. And the
participation at these events has exploded over the past few years. And I mean, this past year,
they had this wonderful diagram of all the people who took private planes in and came in.
And I mean, including some well known folks here in the United States who showed up in their private
planes, they didn't even carpool. They just they all took their own private planes showed up.
And then like, we're like, oh, climate change, bad, we have to do something about climate change.
But they're not actually practicing what they preach now. So I just want to make these individuals
are so important that, of course, their travel is worth, you know, it's a little extra carbon,
but you know, Bill Gates, he's got to be here and there, right? He's got to be if he doesn't get
from Lisbon to Buenos Aires in whatever 20 minutes, then people are going to die, right?
I mean, I would just say like, let's just start with carpooling or whatever you call it when
it's airpooling. I don't know what the word is, right? I mean, I like, let's just start that.
Let's just say a warm buffet. You want to hit your ride? Like we're going the same way. We can
save gas. And they can join Taylor, right? I mean, she flies all over. She's flying constantly. I mean,
they're doing a big move around here. You should just have the climate conference where the Taylor
Swift concert is happening, right? That would save a lot of carbon emissions. I mean, I would just
say that I also would love it if she would think about maybe cutting down the pyrotechnics a little.
I don't know if you've been to a Taylor Swift concert. I have kids. I've been to many Taylor
Swift concerts. You're there with like an air quality sensor going like, uh, guys were in the
purple. Like she said. Don't breathe in. Everybody hold your breath now. I mean, but it's also,
you know, it's very consumptive. Let's just put it that way. But okay, going back to your question,
yes, I can remember what your question was. Oh, why is it not working? Is that the question? Okay,
so the reason it's not working is that all of these countries are symbolically gesturing that
they care about climate change. I mean, everybody, everybody cares about climate change now, except
for a very small proportion of people in the United States, but that's different from actually
acting on it because acting on it is not easy. Like we talked about before. So to act on it means
basically committing to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuels are a huge part of economies of
many industrialized nations. We just talked about Norway, the United States, number one natural gas
exporter and oil exporter right now. So yay us. But I mean, that means that for us to actually
follow through on commitment to phase out fossil fuels means there's going to be a lot of folks
who have what we call privileged access to resources in the form of access to fossil fuel
resources, they're subsidized, right? So they get subsidized access to our federal lands to drill
and take what they can. They also have privileged access to power. And they get that because they
basically contribute to campaigns. And it's not just Republicans, it's folks across the aisle
who take that money. And research shows us that when you take money from the fossil fuel
interests, even if you run on a climate sensitive platform where you say you care about climate
change, you want to do something about climate change, when you're asked to vote, you will vote
with the people who fund you. And so that happens all over the world. But United States is a great
example of it. So there is a very, very strong concentrated interest in maintaining the status
quo. And so fossil fuel interests that run countries, run companies, run our industries,
they are basically pushing back. I mean, I was a contributing author for the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for the most recent round, the most recent assessment.
And we call that the IPCC. And so I actually, I wrote this section on civic activism and engagement
for working group three, which is on mitigation. So that's the folks who are talking about how to
reduce the carbon that goes into the atmosphere. And, you know, I was so excited to be asked to
do this. This is the first time they ever asked people to talk about activism and engagement.
That's what we individuals and those people who are not in the government and not in business
is what we can do about the problem. So I was very excited to write that. I wrote this, you know,
I contributed, I've contributed like 10 pages, it took three paragraphs, which is how these things
work, right? But when they go from, you know, the contribution to what ends up going to the
countries, what goes to the countries is what's called the summary for policymakers, right?
Where they do, it's like the Cliff Notes version, right? So my chapter was over 100 pages long.
I think it ended up being like 20 pages, maybe. I got two sentences in there.
But countries get to approve what goes in there and they took out all reference to fossil fuels.
Wow. So, I mean, and so because countries, all countries get a say and countries that extract
a lot of oil don't want anybody to know. So this was a summary that was put up by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Yes. And they took out references to fossil fuels
when they were summarizing, which is the part that that's what like Biden, everyone else is
reading, they're reading the summary, they're not reading the full version. Oh, sure. Yeah. I mean,
and so what they did is we had to change it from fossil fuel interests to what they're called
vested interests. And the thing is that this was a huge success that vested interest got in.
And so we were supposed to be like, oh, yay, we're so lucky. I mean, so in, if you read the
chapter, you'll see the references to the role that fossil fuel interests play. And it's extremely
well documented. I mean, nobody at this point recognized, like nobody believes that fossil
fuels are not playing a big role in contributing to climate change. Of course not. If you are honest
about understanding the science, right? Yeah. But you still can't say it. I mean, and also,
I mean, look at what happened at the most recent round of the climate negotiations.
There were a bunch of countries that were pushing to get the countries to agree to phase out fossil
fuels, right? And it ended up dragging on and on and on and a bunch of petrol states that extract
a whole bunch of fossil fuels pushed back against it. So it ended up being this mealy
mouth we should think about at some point, phasing out, you know, maybe fossil fuels, you know,
I mean, that was the end. I mean, and everybody was like, yay. I mean, and all of these people
in policy, all these people in the media were like, finally, we actually kind of said the
quiet part out loud, kind of, but we still didn't. I mean, that's the thing that's crazy about. And
so that's the same thing with the science is that when you have politics and science combined,
the way you do for this, because this is specifically like a scientific assessment that's
designed for the policy community and is coordinated through the different states.
When you do that, and you have a bunch of countries that are basically controlled by fossil fuel
interests, you know, it's not surprising that we see this kind of tricky situation.
But it means, I mean, and the more we know that a systemic shift away from fossil fuel energy
towards renewable clean energy is what is needed, the more these interests are going to like,
claw and just try to control the dialogue as much as they can, so that everyday people don't recognize
that when fossil fuel companies give money to candidates who are running for office,
like in this election that we have coming up, those people, whether or not they say they care
about climate change are absolutely not going to do anything about it.
Yeah, because their incentive is not to. But what you're talking about, what you talked about
three different pieces of that story is politics, right? Like you, when you are writing and trying
to get the right language into the report, that's part of the political process as is fossil fuels,
companies giving money to candidates as is entire countries who are basically bent to the well of
the fossil fuel makers. But what do we do about that? Because a lot of folks when confronted with
the existence of politics will just say, oh, fuck, I can't believe politics got in here.
Oh, no, there's people, there's corruption. There's people giving money. Oh, the people are
who are given money to do something, do the thing that they're given the money to do. Oh,
the people who have the most power get to call the shots, right? But unfortunately, politics is just
part of the human condition. Politics simply is, you know, humans in large groups having to make
decisions together. And yeah, and unfortunately, people with power get more say, and that's just
how the fucking world works. And if you want to do something about it, you have to reckon with
the political social system that you live in and figure out how to bend it to your will to do the
thing that needs to be done. So, you know, I don't want this to be one of those episodes where we
sit around go, I can't believe the fossil fuel companies are like, have their finger on the
scale, they should stop it because they're not going to. No, they're not. What do we do about
that problem? Well, I mean, I just want to say, though, that what you're just pointing out here
is exactly why we can't just say everything's going to get better if we ignore politics because
that's the way decision making happens. And if you ignore the politics and just assume technology
is going to fix everything, well, then you're just going to be really, really sad in like 20 years
or even less, right? Guess who's going to be in control of the technology, the people with
the political power. And if you didn't ignore politics, or if you didn't pay attention to
politics, then you're allowing those people to like continue steering the ship. 100%. So what's
going to happen now? Or what do we need to do right now? I mean, this is what I lay out in the
book is that the beginning of the book is all about how we cannot count on decision makers
to do what is needed, even though they recognize the problem exists. And the reason that that's
the case is that we see these interests that have captured decision making and have this
privileged access to resource and power. So that's not the case. And at the other side of it,
businesses, some of which are really excited about technological innovation,
they're not going to save us either because many businesses are pushing for a clean energy
transition. We have a bunch of other businesses are clawing their way into extracting as much
as possible fossil fuels as they can because they know that eventually they're going to have to stop.
And so there's this bipolar pressure between these two. So it's not like we have this
monolith of, oh, business is really excited about this technological innovation because
they're not. So given that that's the situation, the place where we have to go to get hope is from
everyday citizens, you and me, and the way that we ourselves are recognizing how the world is
changing, how our lives are changing, and how we have to reclaim power. And one of the beauties
of being an American and being in the United States is we still do have a democracy, at least for
now. And we should be taking advantage of it because a democracy means that we all have power.
We have an imperfect fucked up democracy, but occasionally the will of the people does win.
The will of the people can still win, but it's up to us. And that's, I mean, that's the whole
argument on my book is that as unfair as it seems, because we didn't really cause the problem and we
are like trapped in a system that is unfair, but we can still take power back. And that's
absolutely what we have to do. And so that's the optimistic part of my apocalyptic optimism.
So how do we do that? Because again, a captive planet generation, I grew up with, turn the lights
off, buy the better thing, maybe feel a little bit guilty when you fly on a plane or whatever,
maybe get a Prius, those sorts of things. I've covered extensively in my work why that sort of
consumer approach to fighting climate changes, at the very least not going to get us out of the
problem all by itself. So yeah, what do we actually do? So what we need to do at this
point is we need to lean into activism and engagement. I mean, and I talk about the reason
why even though all of these individual efforts like you were talking about can play a role in
addressing climate change, given that it's a systemic problem, that's not enough, right? Because
anyway, you're going to turn on the lights. And unless you are completely off the grid or you're
in a very small proportion of the United States where you're on clean energy, you're basically
then tapping into the same system, right? There is a really interesting study that I talk about
in the book where some students at MIT tried to map out carbon consumption of everyday people
and they ended up mapping out the carbon consumption of an unhoused person in Boston,
right? So somebody who was homeless, who was living on the streets, but was also going to
shelters, right? And they found this person who has no like very few earthly belongings, right?
And who is living in a shelter actually has the carbon consumption level of well above
most of the developing world, right? Because of the system. So it is a systemic problem.
So this is if you were to divest yourself of every single energy consuming thing that you have as
an American or a Canadian or someone else living in our part of the world or part of the socioeconomic
ladder, you literally were living on the street, you would still not be able to get your individual
level down to make people elsewhere in the world. Well, you could live in a bunker and go like
completely off the grid, like you can do that. And then you personally will not contribute to
the climate crisis, but the system will continue, right? Yeah, exactly. But I mean, but if you just
just like if you try everything like for example, we at home, we have electric cars, we have solar
panels. But whenever I go to work, I turn on the lights and my computer runs on the system.
And so even though the electricity at home is clean, yeah, it's not clean everywhere else.
You're in control of like the cloud servers that Apple is using to store your emails and
what power they were like, you're part of a system. Yeah. And my Alexa that is tracking
everything I say, I even go there. And every once in a while, she just speaks up and says,
I hear that you are interested in games to play with your children. Can I suggest some? And
it's like, shit, no, I don't want you to suggest. And she's burning fossil fuels every
time she listens to you. Well, she at home, she's burning solar. So at least, so at least I have
that. Yeah, but the servers. Oh, yeah. But when she backs out, she backs up absolutely with like
probably coal. So, you know, the dirtiest of them all. Anyway, so the question that you asked
was about how we take power back. So I was just saying, so individually, we can't do it alone.
We need to work collectively. Right. And one of the beautiful things about the United States is
that we have a really long history of social movements and activism. So one of the things
I do in my book is I basically build off of some of the things that we learn from the civil
rights movement, which is the most studied movement ever in the history of the world.
So we know a lot about it. Yeah. But basically, what we can do is join
collectives and get engaged in our communities, get engaged in climate activism, climate engagement
to help to push for social change. I mean, one of the things that I think is most important
is to push for social change from our communities up. So we don't just decide, I mean, and this
is something that my students and I are always kind of discussing. I think I've won them over
because like in the semesters in like two weeks, which is that you can't really do this all by
just going on TikTok. And I think a lot of young people and a lot of students learn that the sad
hard way with the decision that the Biden administration made around the Willow project,
which is this huge fossil fuel infrastructure project that has been approved by the administration
in Alaska. And all of these young people went online and went on TikTok. It was this huge
mobilization on TikTok. There was like millions of online signatures onto a petition on change.org.
There was a whole bunch of people posting videos about stopping the Willow project,
but there was no in-person action or there's very little in-person action. And unfortunately,
as a result, or not as a result, but unfortunately, the Willow project moved forward, right? So they're
building that out. And a lot of young people are recognizing, I hope they're recognizing and
learning that you can't just go online and do this. You need to actually work with people. And
the best way to do it is to do it in your community. Well, a lot of people make this argument about
online activism. And I see that myself as well, that people tweet and hope it's going to do something.
But I also recognize that the reason a lot of people resort to that is they
do not have other systems in their lives where they feel like they can express themselves.
They're not, you know, there isn't a mass movement organization in their area, or they just feel,
you know, they feel profoundly alienated from their community. A lot of folks, you know,
are don't have other outlets. So, you know, that's a real problem that people face. How can people
get connected? Especially because I just want to add to this that my own experience, you know,
following the climate movement is that we have had attempts at mass movement organizations,
you know, those organizations, I believe 350.org is at the name of one. The Sunrise Movement,
which was doing, I think, incredible work for a couple of years, but in the last couple of years,
sort of gone, where are they? You know, no offense to my Sunrise Movement people, right? Like,
there's people out there carrying the torch. But, you know, we have not seen, I mean, a year or two
ago, there was a giant climate, you know, mass climate march, I think in multiple cities, barely
covered in the press, you know. And so, there's been an attempt to build this mass movement
akin to the civil rights movement. And yet, it has, you know, for at least a decade, and yet it
has not really paid off. So, why is that? And how can we change that? You're like, you're like,
in my sweet spot right now. So, thank you very much. Oh, I'm so happy to set up a guest.
Thank you so much, okay. So, first and foremost, let me just say that this is completely to be
expected. Anybody who remembers the period of the Trump administration, there was this huge
resistance to the Trump administration as policies. Anybody who's interested, I wrote a book called
American Resistance that was all about it. It was a mass mobilization. It was the largest
sustained period where people were in the streets and people were active and engaged,
that we have seen since the civil rights period and the anti-war period. So,
that was like the 1960s, 1970s, right? So, since then, this was like remarkable. Everybody,
the Washington Post did this survey and they said that like, what was it?
One in four people had been to a protest in, you know, during the first two years of the Trump
administration. It was multiple types of protests. It was the women's march. It was the wake of the
murder of George Floyd. It was like a bunch of things over a span of years. Yeah, yeah. So,
it was a span of the whole Trump administration. So, the resistance was amazing and people were
the most civically engaged they have been in decades, right? But so, what happens when a Democrat
takes office is frequently we see the left kind of sitting back and I actually wrote,
I wrote a few, we can take a load off. Oh boy, what's on TV? I gotta, you know, I finally,
I can catch up on my reading. Where's my new, where's my ad pageant book? Reading. Okay,
maybe like, I hope so. Reading is good thing. So, it was not surprising, but I mean, and I
actually wrote a piece that was like, you know, Biden's success is the death of the resistance
and the resistance, the resistance did die. So, you mentioned a couple of different organizations.
I mean, 350.org is still around. They do great work. Sunrise is still around. They do great work.
But these groups have a lot less capacity to mobilize people because the general public on the
left, when there's a Democrat in the White House, they're like, all right, I think we're good.
I'm going to take a load off. I'm going to pay attention to my kids. I'm going to catch up
on my Netflix. Maybe they're going to read. I hope they're going to read, but you know,
I think maybe they'll read your book. Maybe they'll read my book. Maybe that'll get them
back out in the streets. But I mean, so that's all to be expected. And that's what I talk about.
My book is that we know that, first of all, that activism is cyclical and people are going to
need something that motivates them to get out in the streets and to connect collectively,
especially because most people don't have what we call like organizational infrastructure, which is
connections to organizations that are in their communities that help them get active. And we
know that organizations play a very important role in channeling people's concerns, their anger,
their outrage into action. So we need that. So how does that then happen? And what I talk about
in the book is that it's going to come from the experience of climate shocks. And I can give you
some evidence around this is that the largest climate march that we've seen since Biden took
office. So since, you know, in years now was the March 10 fossil fuels, which happened last fall
in New York City. And it was right before the UN meeting where the secretary general said,
you have to actually have some sort of commitment or you're not allowed to come to my meeting. And
so a bunch of countries, I believe the United States even were not invited. So it was a very
interesting. Yeah, it was very interesting. Didn't really do anything. A real Regina George move.
Yeah, but he was trying. I mean, he was really trying. Anyway, so so 75,000 people marched in
the streets of New York City. And one of the things I do is I survey protesters. So I went out with a
team of researchers, students who were working with me, and we did what what we call like a
a field approximation of a random sample. So we basically went through teams throughout the whole
crowd and surveyed people to get information on who they were, why they were there, etc. and so
forth sociology. Yeah, I'm a sociologist. Yes. But this is something this is like a lens that
the climate crisis is not often looked at through. It is unfortunately the case. I mean,
so it is increasingly looked at through sociological or social scientific lens.
But one of the things that's really unfortunate is that while we know a whole lot about how
the world is warming and how a little bit more carbon in the atmosphere will affect warming
and will affect hurricanes and etc. and so forth, you know, always more accuracy is necessary.
We know a heck of a lot less about the people who will respond and what we will do and how it
will matter. Yeah. And so one of my hills that I'm going to die on is saying that we need more
research funding to support that because social scientists get like pennies on the on the dollar.
Right. We spend so much money researching the hard sciences. We spend so little on researching
the people who need to implement who we need to implement what the hard sciences come up with,
right? Well, I would say it's even worse than that. It's the people who are causing the problem,
right? As well as the people who are going to have to solve the problem, right? So we know
so little about that. And that was one of the reasons that like when I wrote for the IPCC,
I am, you know, the rules of the IPCC are you need to be able to prove how whatever you're
looking at is associated with carbon, right? So people march in the streets. Well, how does that
affect carbon emissions or decisions around carbon emissions? And there's a lot, there's not
that much research. There's a lot more we need to know about that. So I mean, it would be really
great for me to be able to say, okay, if you go into a museum and you throw soup on a covering of
a painting, it equals this much carbon, right? I mean, they want me to be able to say that. I
would love to be able to answer that. I mean, are you going to, are you going to have better
effects in terms of reducing carbon emissions? If you throw soup on a painting, you glue yourself
to a door or you sit in the middle of the highway, right? But I mean, it's, but it's an important
question. And how much, I mean, so the reason that folks are doing that kind of activism, which is a
lot of what I talk about in the book is because they're trying to get media attention. So it's
really like, it's like a boomerang, right? It's an indirect process. So you do those things,
you're going to be in the media. And a bunch of people are going to say, he sucks for doing it.
And then other people are going to say, he has a point, I should join a movement. And so they
will very rarely be like, I'm going to throw soup. No, they're going to say, I'm going to go work with
like a more, you know, a more benign, kinder, gentler group. So I may join like a league of
conservation voters or Sierra Club or I may do something around my local elections or something
to do, you know, to do something around weatherization in my community, something like
that, right? So you may get involved in that. But the question is all of that, like,
how does that then end up with carbon? Yeah, it would be amazing if we could say,
so often folks are presented with a statistic, oh, if you switch to an electric car, you'll save
this many trees, this many tons of carbon, whatever. And that's supposedly a hard calculation,
even though there's a lot of assumptions and, and all that, and all that. But you could,
wouldn't it be wonderful if you could tell people, hey, if you were to join a local chapter of
the sunrise movement in your area and go to one meeting a month, it would save this many tons
of carbon. We could do that. Yeah. We just need to be able to develop the models and run them.
But those models are, let me just say like those models are a lot simpler than the models that
are being funded right now to talk about how sandstorms over in Africa are contributing to
hurricanes. And there are people doing that research. And it's important. I am not saying
it's not important. I think everybody should be funded. But I think that, you know, those of us
who are trying to answer these questions, we need to understand that. I mean, and we need to be able
to think about that, right? So if I were talking to like the general public, and you want to do
something, is it better for you to support a candidate who won't take fossil fuel money and
is running for office locally in terms of your carbon? Or is it better for you to get electric
school buses into your schools? Or is it better for you to go and try to get your local school,
you know, universities to divest from fossil fuels? Or is it better for you to throw soup on
something and or crazy glue your foot to something and get a bunch of media attention so that
everybody starts, you know, complaining about you, but talking about the climate crisis because it
absolutely works that way. Yeah. And I mean, we could do those things. And I'm hoping, you know,
there are a couple of us who actually wrote a piece for Nature magazine that came out right
before the last climate negotiation. So in the fall, where we basically talked about all the
things that we could study and we know a little bit about, but we need to know so much more about.
And unfortunately, so far, we haven't gotten $1 to do that work, but we know that work is
necessary. Eventually, we will do the work, but I hope it won't be too late because people need
to know now what's the best way to get involved. But the take home message of the book is that
anything that anybody that anybody is willing to do is what you should do because we are in
all hands on deck moment. People need to get involved. They need to get connected. They
should do it in their communities. Oh, I mean, one of the, well, I was gonna, like I wish I had
said, you know, one of the other things that we really valuable to do is to like do the modeling
to say, if you do something on TikTok versus you do something in your own community, which,
what's the carbon there? And you and I both know how that carbon is going to lay out, right? Because
just, you know, the question of how much posting on TikTok actually leads to reductions in carbon
or more consumption could be, right? Hey, everybody, you know how much I value

you said, is going to mobilize people. Because you said, actually, let's return to something even
earlier. And I didn't even, and I didn't finish talking about what I found. You dropped so many
ideas on us. We're going to go through them one by one, Daniel. Okay, cool. Because this is,
you're an incredible interviewee. So you talked about organizations. Organizations are really
important to get people, you know, mobilized to make things happen. Something I've talked about
before in my work that my wonderful research producer, Sam Roundman, is constantly reminding me,
the reason that NRA is very powerful is not actually the gun lobby's money. It's the fact
that it's a mass, I mean, the lobby, the money is important, right? But is it's a mass membership
organization that like millions of people are members, and they actually get something out of
the membership, they take firearms training, they, you know, whatever, they get a discount at the
local gun store. And they make friends. I mean, that's the other thing is it's not just that they
get something out of it, but it creates social bonds. And that builds reciprocity so that if
they're like, Hey, the library wants to have this, you know, book, you should do something. Oh, yeah,
I'm going to come out because it's a real membership organization that people feel like
they're a part of. That's also part of why in my own personal experience, unions are so powerful
because it is, it's an organization that actually matters to your life. It's about your workplace.
It's your workplace connections. You can, you know, exercise power and really feel it. It like
is really vital in your life. Churches are really important to people for those reasons.
The social bonds, I think some of the problem with organizations like a 350.org like, Hey,
why don't you join the climate movement and, you know, come to a thing is it's like what
immediate relevance does that have to people in their lives, right? Okay, I signed up for a
mailing list. You know, maybe they send me some mailers and stuff like that, but it is lacking
that like immediacy of this is an organization that I am a part of and that it interacts with my
life in multiple ways. So one of the things that I talk about a lot in my last book in American
Resistance is the way that there has been this shift in the past like decade or so as
social media and technology has diffused more, where a lot of organizations decided,
particularly on the left, decided to do the shortcut where they no longer have members,
but they have email lists, right? And as a result, individuals will be, you know,
members or connected to many different organizations simultaneously, because it's a very easy ask,
but they don't get anything out of it. They don't meet in person. They don't actually
feel any bonds to anybody else. And actually in my last book, I talked about how I am,
my sister and I went and volunteered with Swing Left during the 2018 election. That was like the
last chapter of the book where we went out and we decided we were going to go to, you know,
an area in Virginia and we were going to like, see, I was like, let's experience this,
how this is working, because this was like a big resistance group that had emerged during the
Trump administration to try to push back and to try to help take power back. And so I was like,
okay, so my sister and I decided we would do it together. And we went there and while we ended
up meeting Terry McAuliffe, who was the former governor and actually ended up running for governor,
but did not win in Virginia. So we got to meet him and have a conversation with him.
We met nobody else the entire time that we did our work with this organization,
and we walked away having done stuff. I got one email saying, hey, you guys knocked on this many
doors this day. And it was amazing because it was like, it was, it was crazy because people were
like blocking the street parking to do this in this one area of Virginia to work on this election,
but nobody met anybody. So I felt no contact, no connection to this organization afterwards,
there's no reciprocity there. What if they had at the end of that said, hey, let's go out for beers,
hey, here's Pete, you know, and then you make friends, like, which is something that I've
experienced in the labor movement, right, that, that I have, I have new friends and new colleagues,
right? You know, I'm literally going to go to a labor conference later this year because I want to
meet more people, et cetera, et cetera. I mean, I would say that it's also valuable, like in a
youth and people are very connected because it's connected to your work and to your life. Exactly.
I mean, one of the things that a lot of people have asked me out of the new book is I talk about
how we create social reciprocity and how we create resilience in our communities,
which is absolutely necessary, right? And so when we think about climate change, and I know
we're going to talk about climate shocks in a minute, but when we think about climate change,
we know that communities are going to be hit with extreme events, right, which we call,
which I call climate shocks. But we need to address them in terms of thinking about how we
environmentally prepare, but we also need to socially prepare. And that's where these kinds
of organizations can also play a very important role because as you get hit with an extreme, like
an atmospheric river here or a tornado or a hurricane or a drought or a flood or, you know,
the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately, the communities are going to have to respond and
having those connections matter a lot. And one of the things that I've been thinking about and a
lot of people have been asking me is where do we get those connections? Because we have many
fewer of them on the left, which is what you were pointing out originally. And so we know churches,
we know other religious groups, we know schools provide that. I mean, certainly one of the ways
that Sunrise was so successful is by building hubs within schools, right? But another place,
and this is something that I'm actually starting to do research on and work with in my team at
American University, is we're looking at libraries. Libraries are in communities around,
in all communities, right? Everybody has a library or almost everybody has a library,
thankfully. And they provide information and access to books and knowledge, right? And they
could also provide a lot of other things. For example, I mean, I'm assuming here in California,
too, libraries help to distribute COVID test kits, right? Yep. And they provided a lot of other
resources. They provide a lot of social services. Exactly. And they could provide even more. And
in fact, one of the things that we're looking into is the way that they might be able to provide
information around climate change that is relevant for specific communities based on what
the demographics or the community are, as well as the kinds of risks that they're facing.
Yeah. When you talk about these shocks causing, okay, these organizations to grow and maybe
have a closer relationship with the public, which is what we need. We need climate organizations
that people feel connected to in a more real way so that they can actually ask something of people,
hey, show up and do something. And people go, hell, yeah, I will, because I'm a member of this
organization. A climate shock, I can see how that might help that happen. Because if your town is
flooding, it's suddenly realer to you and you need the help of an organization more. Maybe you'll
get more involved in the same way that when, if you're being fucked over at work and a union
comes to your workplace, you'll feel like you're a member of that union. That's really real. However,
if the shocks are happening, doesn't that mean it's kind of late?
No, it is a very late hour already for climate change and for the world. And as a result,
there's no question that people are going to lose lives and people are going to lose homes.
I mean, we're already seeing it. I mean, insurance companies are pulling out of parts of all over
the United States. And then that doesn't even consider developing countries which have contributed
the least to the climate crisis, but they're being hit even more and they have much less social
support. Certain small island nations are flooding. Australia is taking in people who are
climate refugees, basically. And that's going to happen more and more. But so it is a very late hour,
but it's not too late for most of us to save ourselves. And that's why I start in the beginning
of the book by saying, I hope to see you all on the other side. Because as much as it sounds
kind of glib, I mean, it's absolutely true and we are not taking seriously the threat.
And as one of the reasons that a lot of climate scientists I know are starting, these are like
the natural scientists, the atmospheric scientists are becoming activists because they're like,
we're done doing research. We're going to scream at the top of our lungs because what the hell else
are we going to do? You guys have to listen to us. But nobody's listening to the dire message
coming from the scientists. But so with regard to climate shocks, what I think is really important
to recognize is that there's a lot of research that talks about how after disasters, windows of
opportunity open. And we can see it after Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Sandy. I
know a lot of my examples are hurricanes after the wildfires that hit here in California.
There are these moments where all of a sudden people can do things in policy making shifts
a lot. And this is what I call an anthra shift in the book. And in that moment, what we see is
the social system shift to be able to support people because they know that the people need
the help. And that is when we can see the types of systemic changes that are so needed
actually happening. Unfortunately, at this point, we don't have examples of that kind of
lasting change. And I talk in the book a lot about the example of the pandemic and the way that all
of a sudden when people started feeling the risk themselves, like the risk, oh my gosh,
I could die. My kids could die. I could pass on this deadly disease to somebody older in my family.
People supported the idea that the world shut down. We stayed home. We homeschooled, which
was really fun. We baked bread. We created gardens. We did all of these things at home. We stayed
inside for a long time. We wore masks. And people got mad after a while, but especially for the
first couple of months, people were really on board. People were vigilant. And our government
changed. It supported us. It gave out more resources. It gave loans. It stopped people from
getting evicted. It did all of these things. That was an anthra shift. But over time, when the risk
level went down and people started being like, oh, I already got it. Wasn't that big deal? Or I got
vaccinated? Or it's not worth this? They went back out and we're basically back to normal. And I
frequently, when I talk about this, and I'm giving like I'm doing my book tour now and I'm talking
to crowds and I'm like, and I see zero people in the audience wearing a mask. Even though the
pandemic continues, right? That shows that the shift, we went back. Like it's multi-directional
and we can go back. And that tells us how bad it has to get before we're really going to mobilize.
I mean, one of the hopeful things just going back to my surveying people in the crowd, back to
sociology for a moment. So I surveyed all of these activists in the streets in New York City, 75,000
people in September last year. And I asked them for the first time I asked, one, did you experience
a climate shock? And I didn't say climate shock. I listed a whole bunch of things that we know are
climate shocks. Wildfire and smoke from wildfire, extreme weather, extreme events, sea level rise,
flooding, right? And what was amazing is over 85% of the people in the crowd reported experiencing
at least one climate shock in the past six months. Wow. I mean, in a lot of it, so we were on the
East Coast, a lot of it was wildfire and smoke from wildfire, but also sea level rise, flooding,
and extreme heat, right? So this is, I mean, so the people who are mobilizing are experiencing
climate shocks. And the other thing that I asked them is there's been a lot of talk about emotions
and people feeling like climate anxiety or feeling so despondent from the crisis that
they're not doing anything. And so one of the things I wanted to do is see what people in the
streets were feeling, what is motivating them to get out in the streets and get off their sofas,
right? And the top emotions for people in the crowd were sadness, makes sense, right?
And anger. No hope. People in the streets were not particularly hopeful. They were there because
they were pissed off. Yeah. And there is like historical precedent that we know that people
who join social movements and like are willing to take a stand, they usually are angry. So.
You know, come to think of it, hope, especially in the Obama era, got such a big, big reputation.
Oh, hope, hope. That's why we're out there. Well, hold on a second. If you have hope,
maybe you'll just sit at home and be like, yeah, hope things will get better. Like,
things will probably turn around. Exactly. Don't worry about it. But if you're pissed off,
you might take to the streets and like, you know, start shaking your fist and throwing things.
Absolutely. And you might be willing to glue yourself or get arrested, right? I mean,
a good piece of evidence on that point is that while we did the survey in the streets,
I also worked with a team of folks who did a nationally representative sample of people who
were not in the streets at the same time to see how much they experienced climate shocks and what
emotions they were feeling. And so they had a lot less experience personally with climate shocks
and they were hopeful about the climate change. So people who were not in the streets are hopeful
and less angry and people who are in the streets less hopeful, angry, but they're there.
That is so fascinating because I have taken as a thesis for a long time that, look,
there's such a vibe out there of the world is ending, right? It's all over. If you scroll on
TikTok, you'll see a lot of people who feel that way. Well, hey, I'm a member of the last
generation. So why even bother? And I always sort of took it as a given that part of, you know,
what I should try to do is let people know that there's always going to be a world tomorrow
and you always have the opportunity to make a better tomorrow and shit is being done and you
can be a part of that and to try to fight against defeatism, which I think is part of hope and to
try to cultivate a bit of hope. Things are really bad. I want us to be real realists, but hey,
if we can do it, what you are maybe saying is that maybe that's the wrong approach.
Maybe we should just say, nah, shit's fucked. Get mad. Get out there.
I don't think that they're that different. Because I actually think when I hear you talking about it,
I mean, you kind of sound like an apocalyptic optimist too, right? I mean, that's the realistic
stance, right? If you want to be realistic about the climate crisis, you need to acknowledge what
the natural scientists are saying. I mean, I'm not a natural scientist. I'm not an atmospheric
scientist. We got a lot of my colleagues who are who are saying, we are standing at the precipice
and we are looking into it. And some of us are saying, who cares? And others of us are saying,
holy shit, I mean, and those people are doing something about it. And in, you know,
in the case of the general public, I think it's important to recognize that so that when we hit
like summer 2024 is going to suck. It is going to suck across the country and anybody who says
differently, oh, and then it's going to go into fall 2024. And they are predicting the worst
hurricane system, the worst hurricane season ever. Wow. I mean, and the old, I mean, if anybody's
wondering about why we know that, look at the temperature, ocean temperatures now, ocean
temperatures are statistically significantly off the charts from any historical record.
I've seen this. And that, and that leads to hurricanes, right? So it's energy in the ocean
that leads to energy in the storm system. Yeah. I mean, basically the storm, it's like suck up
the water and the warmer the water is, the more water they suck up. And so while the
hurricanes, the wind may not be any stronger, it is not the wind that destroys homes and destroys
communities. It is how much rain falls. I mean, you guys know that here, right? It's all about
rainfall and how much your land can actually absorb, right? And that, and that is going to be
absolutely decimating this coming year. So we need to be realistic about that, right? And I,
I mean, I don't do that research, but I believe my colleagues who do do that research. And so
the question is, what do we do about it? And I do think we should be hopeful. I mean, I'm hopeful,
but the reason I'm hopeful is because I'm angry. And because I know so many people are angry. And
I think that people should not sit with it and be like, you know, you should be like, wow,
this sucks. And it's getting worse. But we should also think, and fuck it, I'm going to do something
about it. And that's what everybody needs to do. People need to rise up and they need to,
they need to embrace the anchor and embrace the fact that this is not fair. And it is not fair
that it is our responsibility to do something about it. The only way that our government will
do what is needed is if we demand it and we force them to. Otherwise, we will continue on this
incremental path to policymaking that will do something, but absolutely not enough to address
the climate crisis. And basically you may as well kiss like half of Florida goodbye. You may as well
kiss most of the coast, you know, goodbye. And anybody who lives in areas that get extreme heat,
like, you know, the whole Southwest, anybody who works outside there, anybody who can't afford to
have air conditioning, they'll be moving. And, you know, then we're going to be experiencing not just
internal migration, but, you know, within the United States, but we're going to be seeing all
these people from other parts of the world who can't, you know, can't live where they are,
who have no access to water, it's too hot, they can't survive, and they're going to be pushing in.
And of course, that makes for a really fun story, because as we know, we're not doing so well with
migration already. Now imagine all the people who are going to be coming. And the political
strife that will come as a result when people freak out about that and the humanitarian crisis
that will happen. And my God. But don't get despondent, get angry. That's a great message.
No, no, seriously, I'm the angry sociologist. That's a wonderful message and a wonderful
speech that you gave. I hope you could speak to my own darkest thought, which is that, you know,
on some level, humanity, like our social technology, our social ability to recognize
what's happening as a system of humans. And honestly, our individual ability to do so
is sort of outstripped by what is happening. You know, something that stuck with me for a
long time. I read this maybe a year ago. Can't remember whose blog post this was. So apologies
to the blogger who wrote this. But it was that, you know, Obama had bought a beachfront home on
Martha's, Martha's Village. Martha's Vineyard. Martha's Vineyard. Thank you, the island, right?
That he loves so much. You are a west coaster. No, no, no, I'm not a prop. No, I grew up in New
York. God damn it. But I just forgot what it was. Oh, you could, yeah, I have a tan now. Okay,
fuck it. I mean, I live in California. Anyway, so he had bought a he had bought a house on
Martha's Vineyard and whatever reporter or blogger this was looked up like, you know, the
government's climate change predictions. It was like, this house is going to be unlivable or
unsellable inside of 20 years, right? That this is like a terrible investment. Forget livable.
It's a bad investment. And literally, I know people, I grew up on Long Island, I know people who
have had that problem where it's like their house has gone down in value because, you know, it's so
close to the coast that people don't want to buy it because they know about climate change.
After Hurricane Sandy, there were communities that had to be relocated.
I mean, yeah. So the point of this piece was that Barack Obama, who certainly should be in a
better position than anyone else to know about climate change, very smart man reads a giant
briefing book every every weekend, you know, he's not ignorant of the problem. And yet when it came
to his own personal choice, he made a choice that was ignorant because our own ability to
sort of see the future in this case and think about how it affects us is limited, right? It's
like a human limitation. And I could list, I don't want to just be like, Obama's a piece of
shit. That's not the point. The point is that like all of us do this to an extent, right? Like,
we have trouble thinking about the future in this way and making adjustments in our lives. And then
multiply that by, you know, 8 billion. And, you know, you've got a real motherfucker of a problem.
And this is just going to be something we're 200 years from now. The remnants of humanity are looking
back going, this was just outstripped our ability to do something as a species.
Well, okay. So first and foremost, yes, I think there's a real risk of that. But second, I do
want to, I want to talk about the Obama issue and the example for a second to just say that, well,
well, Obama should have known better. However, he is, I mean, he's a super privileged man,
right? He's a former president of the United States. He has lots of resources. His, you know,
Michelle has made a lot of money on selling books, right? So they are not suffering at all. Okay.
So they can afford it. I mean, the people who can afford it, I mean, they may take a loss on
the house. They can afford to take a loss. And at this point, I mean, it's unclear what will
happen with insurance on Martha's Vineyard and in, you know, in Massachusetts, if they were in
Florida, they would no longer have insurance. And you know, what someone's going to buy this house,
even if it's like floating in the ocean, someone's going to be like, you know,
President Obama used to live there, someone's going to pay too much for it. I mean, what is
maybe, but I mean, what's happening right now is that there are certain communities and there was
this really interesting story that was done in Washington Post recently about communities in
the Outer Banks of North Carolina, where there were the summer houses that basically had, you know,
where Outer Banks are like these border islands, right? And they had been so taken over by sea
level rise that they basically were no longer able to get access to water, sewage, or electricity,
right? Because that all came underground and all got washed away. So the National Park Service
paid the owners, and I believe it was $800,000 a house, to take them back and demolish them.
Wow.
And which is, that's just like, that's not sustainable. It's outrageous a little bit. And,
you know, they, and those people like, I know they took a loss, but you know, hey, that's not so
bad. I mean, we should all hope that we get that kind of bailout. That's not, we should not expect
that to happen. But so, I mean, so I would just say like, I think, you know, those people who can
afford summer homes and stuff like that, and I mean, more and more, they're going to buy homes
without being able to get insurance, because that's what's happening is the insurance companies are on
the forefront or the Vanguard in terms of thinking about this, because it's their pocketbook that's
going back to cover. And the people in that position of privilege are the ones who are calling
the shots. They're the ones who are running the oil companies. They're the ones who are senators,
and et cetera, right? Right. I mean, for now, I mean, the nice, you know,
that's one of the things that's nice about our country is you could actually run for office and
hold office and not come from like oil companies. But, you know, people have to support, but it's
much more difficult. I saw a stat recently from, I believe, more perfect union that like a very
small percentage of people in office are from working class backgrounds. Most of them are well
paid lawyers and things like that. They're from the upper crust. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, let me
share. So those, I mean, and those people are going to have the least, they're the least at
risk from the climate crisis, right? They are not part of frontline communities. They are not,
most of them don't come from communities of color either. And that means that they have like some
distance from experiencing this. But I mean, but I think that the other point that you made in this,
the example around Obama that I think is really important to think about is that because of the
way climate change works, which is right, right now, we emit CO2, carbon, greenhouse gases,
they go into the atmosphere and they build up there. And it is the process of them getting up
there and sitting up there that then affects thermal radiation coming from the sun and how
much actually gets back out. And that's the greenhouse effect, right? That's how it works.
And that then has this effect on all these patterns, etc., that the natural scientists are
talking about. It is a slow process, right? We know, for example, if tomorrow everybody stopped
burning fossil fuels and everybody, you know, everybody just turned off the lights,
we would not see an effect in terms of all of the effects of climate change. The climate shocks
would not stop immediately. So given that delay, it makes it even harder. Not only is that we've
got these folks in positions of power who are controlling all the resources that are making
decisions, making slow, but it's also that it's like, there's a delay there. And that means that
this is such a tricky problem that there is just no question in my mind that we are going to have
to get a lot more apocalyptic before we're going to get to the optimistic side. Because we need
people to experience this firsthand to get angry enough to make those kinds of decisions
to change their behaviors. And a lot of those decisions and those changes,
they're not going to be fun. I mean, some people will be able to buy a Rivian. Congratulations
to you, right? But most people were talking about having to take public transit and hope
that it becomes electrified. And that is having tried to get around public transit here in LA.
I can tell you, it sucks. I do it every day. Oh, well, it's look. If you planned it that way,
right? You planned it that way. I planned it that way. I've molded my life around public
transit in LA and go to a major city in Texas and tell me that public transit in LA sucks. At
least we fucking have it here. I'm serious. Fair enough. Los Angeles has second highest public
transit ridership in the country, because there are buses. A lot of cities in America
do not have them at all. But, you know, I saw speed. I know about the buses.
Well taken that like you, it is the system is simultaneously, you know, to, to spread out
buses run too rarely, too uncomfortable, not enough shade, speaking of climate change.
You know, there are all these problems with the system. And they're not electric.
Yeah. And they're not electric. It makes it far more uncomfortable and unpleasant and inconvenient
to ride than it should be, despite the fact that it's a better option than many, than many people,
you know, in this city think that it is. But, so you, but it almost seems like you end up
not rooting for the shocks, but saying like, Hey, things are going to get worse. But in a way,
that's a good thing because it may finally cause the societal response that we need where people
are really fucking getting out there and getting angry and saying, protect us because we are actively
dying. Right. I mean, and that, but that unfortunately, that process is the only way I see it working.
Right. Wow. Because the government's not going to step in and save us because they're basically
going to lose, I mean, the folks in power are going to lose those funders who fund their campaigns.
And that's how our political system works, unfortunately, but that is how the system works,
right? So that's not going to change. The business is some of the business are going to push for
clean energy, but a whole bunch of businesses are going to say, Hey, we can, maybe we can extract
more natural gas and send it to other countries and make money on that. So they're going to do
anything they can to stay, stay the course. So systemic change is hard. We're going to have
to push for it. And it is true that we're going to need to have, I mean, I'm not rooting for
climate shocks. I am being just realistic about what's coming. I mean, I just hope there are some
people, some scholars who are talking about these like cascading effects and not knowing how it's
going to have huge effects on the, in terms of thinking about how weather patterns will change,
how the different ocean currents will change. And I mean, this is all people who do stuff that I do
not do and I don't know a lot about, but I read when I see the story, the pieces come out in top
journals, those things could really change the whole way that weather and temperature and climate
works all over the world. And we don't know. I mean, it could mean like droughts happen in places
that never were dry before and floods, you know, and places are inundated in ways that were never
before. But we should expect that these kinds of things are coming. So I just, my feeling is we
just should take whatever is predicted and assume that it could be as bad as that. And we can hope
it won't be. But that is where people are going to start to get angry because it's when you have
the personal experience of the risk that gets us mad and gets us motivated. And then we work
through the organizations that exist or build our own organizations to put pressure on those in power.
And it's only when those in power actually feel at risk of losing power that they finally make a
difference and they make the changes that are needed. And that means we learn this from the
civil rights movement. Those are perfect examples there. I mean, you actually are giving me hope
that it's weird. You give me a weird kind of hope that like as things get worse, that creates the
conditions for things to get better, that there's a natural sort of countervailing force. And that
honestly sounds more plausible to me than like, Hey, you know, the price of solar is going to get
so cheap that eventually the problem is going to solve itself. Like I can, I can hold that a
little bit of hope there too. But also, you know, I think things are getting a little bit worse.
But the idea that that is going to, you know, cause change and cause a mass uprising of the
sort that we need is believable. And it seems to be, you know, born out by history that, you know,
it's when people are under the most intense pressure that, I mean, look at the labor movement,
right? That like the labor movement was born out of the incredible depravity of the late 19th
century, the incredible misery forced people to stand up and fight back. And then, you know, we,
the labor movement worked and, you know, in, you know, starting in the middle part of the
century or the last century, we had the rise of the middle class and like safety protections and
the 40 hour work week and all these things. And then everybody got comfy and the company started
fucking everybody again. And now people are rising up again. Like this is kind of how it works a
little bit. And so, you know, we're starting to have the fact that the climate crisis is actually
happening is waking people up, perhaps. Well, yeah, certainly. I mean, there's no question
that the labor movement is also reemerging after recognizing how the extension and expansion of
inequality in our country is basically leaving so many people behind, right? So that that's
happening simultaneous. And one of the things that simultaneously, one of the things I talk
about in the book, though, is that historically, labor and the climate movement have not worked
well together. I mean, in fact, part of that is because much of the clean energy transition so
far has been peopled by non union labor. And that means that folks in unions are like, no, no, no,
no, no, we would like to stick with our fossil fuel expansion project because that is unionized.
And there have been some, I won't, I won't call them out, but there's been a couple unions I know
here in Southern California that have been like against, you know, different climate change
regulations. Hey, let's electrify. Well, hold on a second. If you work in the gas industry,
maybe you don't like that so much. Of course. And that's, it's understandable. But it is,
you know, it is against, it's people following their incentives as one does, but it is bad in
the overall. The good news is things are shifting. I mean, for example, there was one, there's one
really interesting case that happened recently where so for people who build cars that are
fossil fuel burning cars, most of those factories are union labor, right? Yeah. The folks who build
the batteries for electric cars historically have not been union labor. And so if you want to push
for more EVs, you're pushing away from using union labor. But there is, there are now efforts,
and there's some really good people who are working on trying to, you know, work together to
unionize consistently so that that is not, you know, that is not the challenge of the worker,
because it's not really fair. And because that is really necessary to help to merge these movements
together. And a far-sighted union leader would need to see that as I think some in the auto industry
are finally. Yeah, they're finally starting to do that. And I think that's going to continue. I mean,
I would just say that, you know, the other reason that we don't, we shouldn't have a lot of hope
so far about the clean energy transition is that so far we've seen an expansion in consumption
of clean energy in the United States, thanks to a lot of federal funding from the Inflation
Reduction Act, et cetera. And the price of, you know, renewable and clean energy has gone down
quite a bit. But what's happened is actually our overall energy consumption has just grown.
Yeah. So we continue to still burn and consume as much fossil fuels, but more, there's more.
The percentage is better, but the actual, a literal amount of fossil fuels being burned has
not gone down. And that's why the carbon concentrations continue to go up.
So you said earlier, it was almost a good way to end the podcast, but I had more I wanted to ask
you. You remember before when you were like, get angry and get out there, right? How should people
do that? Like how should people, you know, join the movement if we would like to make sure we don't
need quite so many climate shocks before we do something, right? We want to get started early
so that we have to go through less of those. What do people do? Yeah, that's exactly the argument
that I make is that the more people reclaim their power and mobilize and start working together,
the less climate shocks will happen and the less people will, you know, lose life and lose like
their livelihoods, right? Because that's basically where we're going. So, I mean, the book ends with
three points. Three things that we can all do to save ourselves. And two of them are for people
who want to be activists. And one is for, you know, your everyday people. So I'll just talk to the
activists first. I'm first and foremost, and this is actually building off of what we were just talking
about. Activists need to create community and true solidarity. And the solidarity needs to come
across movements, across different issues. I mean, we need to see more intersectionality. We need to
see more people coming from all different identities and orientations, engaging in climate
activism. Historically, the climate movement which spun off of the environmental movement was
really quite privileged. And as such, we did not see a lot of people of color or people coming
from working class backgrounds involved in it. We still don't enough, but we need to see that
happen more. And one of the things in terms of thinking about creating community and building
community within the movement, I think is really interesting, is I talk about in the book a lot,
lessons from the civil rights movement. And one of the things, and I talk a lot in the book about
kind of this growing radical flank of folks who are starting to be more aggressive, even though
it's like air quote aggressive at this point, in that they're being confrontational,
throwing soup on plastic covers and gluing themselves to things or disrupting the US
open and then getting carted away in the US open continues. So I mean, sure, it's a nuisance,
but we're not talking like this isn't radical, like the suffragettes who blew up a building a
month at the height of women's suffrage, the struggle for women's suffrage. So it's still
quite tame radical. But when we talk about the radical flank, everybody doesn't have to be involved
in radical flank. When we think about creating community, one of the things that's a really
interesting lesson from the civil rights movement is that during the civil rights struggle, a radical
flank also emerged where people were becoming more confrontational and they engaged in sit-ins and
they engaged in blockades and it continues from there. Everybody probably knows some of the stories
about that. What was very interesting about it is that as the radical flank, which was mostly
young people during the civil rights period, emerged a lot of the elders who were active in
the movement were not happy with these young people who were starting to be more radical,
breaking laws. They were risking themselves also because there was a lot of racism in our country.
Even then there was racism, right? Let me say that differently. Back then there was racism,
but it's worth noting that racism continues today in our country. Even though the elders were not
happy with this, the black churches created a home for these activists and created a space for them
to organize and created resources to bail people out of jail, etc. It is that kind of community
that created support and this kind of organizational infrastructure for activists, no matter whether
they were doing more legally oriented work and focusing on trying to get the vote through
institutional channels or they were out in the streets causing good trouble, right?
It's what people call a diversity of tactics. There was solidarity between all the people
who were pursuing that, hey, I don't know if I like what you were doing, but you know what,
I'll bail you out of jail or I'll make sure we're on the same side still.
They were on the same side. I mean, they were still like the solidarity was, there was solidarity,
but they argued. I mean, certainly, and there were factions and they didn't agree all the time
and everybody had their opinion, right? So it was an uncomfortable coalition to some degree,
but it was also all rooted in the black community and within the black churches.
And so they really had a lot more organizational infrastructure than the groups do today. And
as we were talking about, that is really necessary and important. So building that through community
and solidarity is valuable. That was number one. Number two is taking advantage of moral shocks
and capitalizing on violence against activists. And this is really, we haven't talked that much
about civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is becoming a more common tactic among activists.
I mean, I, well, I'm going to just say like everybody has heard of Greta Thunberg and Greta
just got arrested again in the Netherlands last week. She is a perfect example. And I talk about
her quite a bit in the book because she started out doing this very kind of very, you know,
simple tactic where she was just sitting on the parliament steps, right, holding her sign
and skipping school, right? It was not confrontational. And she has become increasingly
confrontational and she has basically become part of the radical flank of the climate movement.
So her personal trajectory is like a really good example because we're seeing that
for activists around the country and around the world, right? But what's interesting is that many
people then say, oh, these activists, they're going to get violent. There's very little reason
to believe they're going to get violent. What is much more likely, and I talk at length about this
in the book, is that people are going to get violent against them. They are going to be repressed by
law enforcement. I mean, we're seeing that, we, we've seen a little bit of that in the United
States. We're seeing that more and more around the world. But we also should expect that there
are going to be counter movements that will rise up and be aggressive and violent against the activists.
And it is an unfortunate reality.
This is what happened during the George Floyd movement, where you had the police
violently attacking protesters and then you had vigilantes showing up with guns and shooting people
and saying, oh, that's because the protesters are violent.
Exactly. So that is, that's a wonderful example. I mean, the other thing worth noting here is,
and I talk in the book about the moment when President Trump basically had all of these
peaceful protesters tear gassed in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C., you know, for his photo
opportunity. But the thing is that, and this is a perfect example of how activists can capitalize
on violence, is that, you know, these were nonviolent protesters and members of the media
who got tear gassed and they were, you know, they were harmed physically and they drew attention to
this and the protests the next day was like twice the size. And that is how it works,
capitalizing on these moral shocks and the violence. I mean, and there are other examples
from the civil rights movement where we saw, you know, dogs called on activists, people beaten up,
et cetera. And so for that just list goes on. Those are the iconic moments of that movement.
Exactly. And those were the moments when people who were sympathizers to the movement
mobilized in solidarity. And it is those moments of solidarity. I mean, the George Floyd,
the moment when we saw the protests after George Floyd was murdered were moments of solidarity.
And one of the reasons we saw so many people, white people in the crowd and people who were
coming out because of their intersectional motivations is because they were not willing
to sit down after observing and witnessing an unarmed black man being murdered by a policeman
on social media, right? So that was like a moral shock that motivated people and they got angry,
right? Yeah. But so that's number two and number three. And finally, and this is for people who
don't want to do activism. You do not have to be an activist to help us save ourselves, right?
You can be just an everyday citizen. And that's the final one, which is about cultivating resilience.
And as I said before, when I talk about resilience, this is about building our
communities so that they can withstand the climate shocks that are coming and come they will, right?
So we know they're coming. And depending on where you live, you know what you're in for,
but whether it is extreme heat or extreme weather, atmospheric rivers, tornadoes,
etc. When those things hit, first of all, we need to rebuild in ways that we can handle that more,
because we know they're going to keep coming places that experience sea level rise. You need to make
sure that your community is capable of handling flooding, the kind of flooding that's going to
become regular. I mean, and hopefully the flooding that will, you know, will not overpower your
community. But still, there are things you can do. So you need to be environmentally resilient,
but more importantly, I would say we need to be socially resilient. I mean, I've been talking
with a lot of groups that are working on disasters, and they keep telling me about how
what they basically have been funded to do mostly is what they call disaster response.
And that is the number one thing that a disaster response is, is it's mucking and gutting,
which is really, really not glamorous work at all, right? Mucking and gutting out after floods,
after fires, etc. That is the response. But the problem is that you need to also think about
the recovery, right? And recovery is rebuilding in a way where your community is more resilient.
And when you do that, you really need people to be connected to one another, so that those who get
unhoused have support. Those who need food, those who need resources, etc., those who need jobs,
because their place of work no longer exists, because it gets just washed away or burnt down.
And so the resilience is really important. And that's something that we can all do by getting
more connected and embedded in our communities, be it through our local unions, be it through our,
whatever religious groups there are, or our schools, or our libraries, right?
I mean, I love it. It's such a holistic vision of how we can...
Save ourselves.
Save ourselves, the title of your book. I mean, it's a huge task, but that's all we can
fucking do, is to do this. We have to do it.
We have to do it. We will do it. I'm an optimist, right? We will do it. The question is,
how bad is it going to get before we do it? And hopefully it won't be too late for most of us.
I mean, I really believe, I believe in people power. I believe we can do it, but I believe we
need to all embrace the anger and get involved. I mean, people power got us here, right? Literally,
fossil fuels are people power. It's a kind of power that we fucking came up with. We created the
problem. We have the power to fix it. We are the only ones who are going to fix it. And we're the,
you know, that kind of power you're talking about is the only kind of power that's ever done
fucking anything. Yeah. I mean, and as I say, the last line of the book is actually, as unfair as
it seems, nobody's coming to save us. We're going to have to save ourselves. And so this is the
opportunity, but this is the moment now where it still can really matter. It will matter in the
end, but it'll matter more now. And that's such an opportunity. I mean, look, I'm as angry as
anybody. I can't believe we have to fucking, you know, Greta Thunberg going like, I'm a child.
I'm a child. Like, yeah, no, we get it. But yet, you know, this is the position that we are in,
and we can see it as an opportunity to have a huge effect on the world around us by stepping up
and doing these things. Absolutely. I mean, one final thing I would just say is that, you know,
there are lots of young people who are just angry and upset and, you know, feel the same way that
Greta did. And she did that in that iconic speech, right? One thing that I think is really nice to
see, though, is that we see all of these, what we're calling them, like the climate elders,
the climate grannies who are coming out and are basically setting an example and are providing
support for young people and working in, you know, working with them in, you know, solidarity. We've
got the like rocking chair rebellion. We've got all of these amazing elders who are also joining
