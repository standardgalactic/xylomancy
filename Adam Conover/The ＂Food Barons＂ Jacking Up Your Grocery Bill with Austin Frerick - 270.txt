Hello and welcome to Factually. I'm Adam Conover. Thank you so much for joining me again. You know,
if you're like me, you like to eat. In fact, you have to eat or you'll die. And you might have
noticed that food has been getting a lot more expensive. Although inflation for food has slowed
relative to 2022, you have to remember that the effects of inflation are cumulative. And recent
numbers showed increased prices for everything from frozen juice to ground beef. Eating out is
more expensive than last year. And even vending machine prices are up. It sucks. Again, we all
have to eat. And for most of us, living off the grid and growing our own meat and potatoes is not
an option. So ideally, we'd have a world where different food companies compete to get us the
lowest price, right? Well, unfortunately, just as with industries like newspapers, internet
advertising, airlines and athletic shoes, that competition doesn't exist anymore at all. Instead,
our food system is run by monopolies. And those monopolies have the power to screw us,
whether we're their customers, their workers or citizens living in places where they exert unfair
and undemocratic influence over our lives. I mean, I can't believe I have to say this, but food
is simply one of the necessities of life, which means it's a bad thing that only a few people
in this country have control over that necessity. You simply cannot explain how we get our beef,
pork, grain, how grocery stores work, why prices are higher than ever,
without understanding the influence of these massive and manipulative companies.
And luckily on the show today, we have a guest who knows everything about it. And not only that,
is from one of the very regions that produces our essential foodstuffs. He not only knows about this,
he has lived it himself. And I cannot wait for you to hear this interview. But before we get to

He's an expert on agriculture and antitrust policy. He's a fellow at Yale, and he is born
and currently lives in Iowa right here in the United States. His fantastic new book
is called Barons, Money, Power, and the Corruption of America's Food Industry. Please welcome Austin
Frerick. Austin, thank you so much for being on the show, man. Thanks for having me on, Adam.
Okay, so tell me, what is so fucked up about America's food system?
How radical it's become. You have one man in Iowa as the most powerful political person
in the state, and he does five million hogs a year. I mean, not alone, that one of the examples.
He does five million hogs a year. What do you mean by he does them? That could mean a lot
of things, some of which I don't want a picture. Yes, so he owns, so he has about 7,000 workers,
employees at this point. A lot of them are contractors, so you got to be careful with the
word workers. But he owns five million hogs. He has other people grow them, but he maintains
the ownership as they grow them out. But his operation produces five million hogs a year.
And how much of the American pork supply is that? So he's the fourth largest pork producer in America.
Basically, in my lifetime, you've seen the hog family farmer die, where you have the 10 largest
entities do about 70% of the hog market, control it, including the largest owner of hogs is actually
Chinese multinational, Smithfield. Is there a reason you're saying, by the way, hogs and not pigs?
I'm just very curious. Oh, no, I use them interchangeably.
Oh, okay. I was like, is pigs wrong? Should I not be saying pigs? Do I look like a city folk,
if I'm saying pigs? Okay. Well, and so why is that a problem to have that be so monopolized
in so few hands that one person is doing so many hogs?
So let's just say hogs or not. So my book opens with a hog baron, this hog guy.
I know, isn't that first of all? I'm sorry. The hog baron is just, what a great image.
It sounds like an anime character or something like that. I imagine a guy with like a top hat
and there's like a little snout on the front. He's got some goggles and he's like,
hello and the hog baron oink oink. Like that's, what a great guy.
You got to put a little bit more Florida on him. So my hog baron has like a Florida twist to him.
First of all, I find this campy. That's kind of why I like this framework is it,
you don't feel powerlessness because it's so morally ridiculous. And this whole thing started
because of him. I literally was in a bar in Des Moines 2018 where someone, a political person
was complaining. I didn't know at the time, but like Iowa doesn't have campaign contribution limits.
So he had given the governor $300,000 for her campaign.
Wow. And the thing that caught my eye was, it was not even that, it was,
he has a home in the rich suburb of Des Moines. He has a home down in Naples, Florida,
which says something, but he has a private jet that he flies back and forth between the two.
Wow. And I was like, that's power. That is like, that imagery says everything.
How did Iowa fall apart in my lifetime? And how do I tell this bigger structural story with this
little like trashy Florida man? So there used to be such a thing as a family hog farmer. Now we
have a hog baron, but there used to be a hog peasant or a hog, a small landowner, right? A hog family
farmer. Yeah. And now those people now are low wage workers for this baron. And instead of like,
you know, having a really ship of the animal, your job now is about 10% of the pigs die inside
these metal sheds. So you're paid to go in there, haul the dead bodies to throw them into a dumpster.
Wow. I mean, that is, that is where we are now.
But that's also like for those people in erosion in the middle class, right? Because if you
previously, I assume, were a hog farmer, you had some ownership of some land of the animals,
of your production pipeline, you were a producer selling to somebody. And I imagine that that
you're able to make more money that way than when you're just a surf working for the hog baron.
Yeah. And you're spending your money locally, you're paying taxes, you're sending your kids to
school, and that's an all gone. You see the massive consolidation of power. And honestly,
the guy's probably taking his money down the floor to knowing how this game works.
And what happens is it's key, it's they call it, it's basically modern day sharecropping.
It really comes from chicken. They call it chickenization. And it's happened across the food
system. And it happened to pork. He saw that coming where I kid you not a century ago, when
they wrote the regulations to tackle the main monopolies in response to Upton's and Claire's
the jungle. When they wrote the regulations, they didn't write chicken into it, because there weren't
commercial chicken slaughterhouses. You just butchered a chicken in your backyard. So down south,
corporations took that model to black farmers that a sharecropping model plighted the chicken.
And then what you see is USDA didn't step in saying chicken, you can't behave that way.
And you see the chickenization of everything else.
Wait, so let's get a little bit of a bird's eye view of the history of American food production.
Because you started talking about, you dropped so many little historical bombs there, sharecropping,
the regulations in the Upton Sinclair era. So take us to the moment before Upton Sinclair,
what did things look like? Why did the regulations come in? And then what did we live in? What world
of food did we live in after those regulations up until the present day?
Yeah, so I think actually meatpacking is a single best way to like talk about all this stuff,
because it shows what the system could be and how it all falls apart. But let me also first start
with the notion that I want to be very careful about romanticizing the past and the food system,
because in the day, it's rooted in genocide and slavery. Yeah.
But we did make progress. We really did. And you saw the meatpacking where we as a society
were mad and angry at what we saw in the jungle, the meat quality we were getting,
and we made policy choices to break up these meat companies, to empower the workers,
and they got power. That became a solid middle class job. People on both sides of my family did
that for a living. And then what we've seen since the election of President Reagan is
systematic assault on that industry, massive consolidation, where even in my book, I have
a slaughtering baron, the secret super corrupt Brazilian family, where I would actually argue
they're the closest thing to have to a criminal organization in modern day corporate America,
which is saying a lot, but they actually pled guilty to bribing their way to monopoly level
status. And I'm not talking campaign bribes, I'm talking bribery. But they're now the largest
meatpacker in America. They're the largest meatpacker in the world's ever seen. And that's why we
see rampant use of child labor. We see all these bad things we tackled, this regulatory system
collapsed. And we shouldn't be shocked that Robert Barons are filling that void.
So you said members of your family did this kind of work in maybe not the good old days,
but decades ago and made a living that way. So what did their lives look like compared to what
it looks like now? Yeah, I mean, my grandfather, my grandfather was kind of like my idol. He worked
at a hog plant town, the old Wilson's. They bought a home out in the country. He had a little acreage
I grew up. That's kind of actually why I love farming and gardening is I grew up working his
plot with him. He owns his house. And nowadays, I mean, just even where I live, a lot of immigrants
and they live in Section 8 housing, they're usually Sudanese and they work at either in
Tame or Waterloo, Iowa. They live two or three families to a two bedroom. You know what I mean?
My grandfather could buy a house, lived an American dream and now these people are barely
getting by and where they live is actually most highly impoverished school district, sorry, school,
elementary in the city. It's just, it says so much of where we've become and it's incredibly
dangerous. And you add the whole layer on top of it. A lot of these workers here are undocumented
or on the marginal thing of there's just so much abuse going on that we just don't even know about.
So how did this transition take place? How do we go from the world that your grandfather lived
into the world that these folks now inhabit? I mean, I just think we're living in a second
gilded age, just another Lazi Farah thing. And it's such a simple thing. But I realized sitting
in a business school class a few years ago, the goal of any corporate executive is monopoly.
Period. And so you saw what they did, regulatory capture. In the election of Reagan was such a
game changer. I know you had Lena Kahn on. I mean, that's like to me this best way of hope right
now is we're moving away from that model. But it allowed massive consolidation to occur where
my coffee baron in my book is a secret German family that now sells more coffee than Starbucks
but didn't even sell it being a coffee in America until 2012. They bought Panera.
Wow. Caribou coffee, Ironsigns bagels,
Burgers bagels, Curricups, Stumptown, Talgentsia, Krispy Kreme. You name it.
But they bought all of the worst bagel chains as a lifelong New Yorker. They bought all the bagel
chains I would never fucking eat at in my life. They have spongy bagels. They toast every single
one of them. And along with all these other chains as well. So that's right. Go on, please.
No, I was just laughing because that's like a hot point in my marriage. My husband agrees with
you. I love Panera bread, Semina Crunch bagel. My husband's from New York City, so.
It's fine if you got to eat in a mall. It's completely fine. I get it. But yeah, please,
please go on. Yeah, how did this occur?
Robert Bork. I mean, there's always going to be hatchet men for industry. I mean,
there's always going to be academics doing the bidding of the rich. And he basically
flipped America's antitrust laws upside down. We had all these guard royals. Like,
what the coffee baron did could not have been done just a few decades ago. You couldn't come
in and roll up a competitive industry. But when these guard royals came away where they came
both with this kind of junk science where consumer welfare standards, what they call it, where you
could show that prices go lower. For consumers, you can buy a company. You can hire any economist to
produce those numbers. And so you see massive consolidation in the meatpacking, in coffee,
in grain, in all these different industries. I actually think food is the most concentrated
industry in America because it's that illusion of choice. You know what I mean? Like, if you
look at the peanut butter area, there's actually one company has about a 60% market share in peanut
butter, but they have all these different brands. Wow. 60% market share in peanut butter. Like,
so Laura Scudder is not a real person. That's what you're telling me. She's just part of some
bigger conglomerate. She's actually owned by that company. I think it's Smuckers.
Smuckers invented Laura Scudder. I thought her name too conveniently rhymed with peanut butter.
I was looking at Laura Scudder, peanut butter. There's no way that this lady was like, you know
what? My name sounds like peanut butter. Let me start an independent peanut butter company.
There's a fake lady. This is why my mom hates grocery shopping with me because I love telling
her these little factoids when we shop. Yeah, in the same way. I think we would have a good
time at the grocery store together. We spent about three hours there and never buy anything. We'd
just be pointing at stuff going, oh, you know what's fucked up about this? About this maple syrup
or whatever. I mean, even my favorite is probably my favorite chapter to write was a grocery chapter
because I love them, but I had a grocery guy tell me, you got to think of a grocery store as
modern-day mafioso capitalism because even the shelf space, there is so much shenanigans going
on what you see at the eye level, like the whole slotting fees, all these games going on. It's
incredible. Yeah. Yeah. So what happens? I know about the consumer welfare standard.
Robert Bork puts out a very influential paper called, I believe, the Antitrust Paradox,
making the argument that all the antitrust enforcement that we had for decades and decades
in America that broke up monopolies and made sure monopolies couldn't form actually was bad
and that we shouldn't be applying it. And instead, we should only break up a monopoly
when the price is going to go up for consumers. If the price goes down, it's okay. Yes. And then
that has the advantage of being very easy for judges to adjudicate. You just get an economist
before a judge and the economist says, oh, here's some numbers that say the prices go down. Well,
the judge isn't an economist. They're listening to, they're like, oh, you're an economist. All
right. So if you say the prices go down, I guess they'll go down. That's good enough for me. I'm
just some fucking judge and bangs the gavel and they allow the mergers to go through. And that's
happened in so many different industries. It's happened in my industry, the entertainment industry,
so many others. But 60% of peanut butter or all these coffee chains, that's a huge amount of
consolidation. That would be illegal if not for the sea change and antitrust enforcement.
It's actually probably higher than 60% because a lot of times they do the store label and you
only know as usually when there's a peanut recall. Okay. You're totally, I mean, when you're
explaining that whole Robert Bork framework is to me, that's the hallmark of this era is
big words to hide. I mean, you're using complex language to keep people out to really hide
shenanigans. Like consumer welfare at standard, those words mean nothing, but they sound really
smart and it plays into people's intellectual insecurity because they don't want you to know
what they're doing. That's all that is. Yeah. The consumer welfare standard is like, oh,
that sounds like a big, important legal doctrine that very important, smart people came up with
and you shouldn't argue with it and it gives the decision, the era of legitimacy. When in fact,
to what? It's much simpler. They're just saying, hey, let's let the mergers go through.
It's junk science, masking moral judgments. In the day, how many logs one man should own?
That's a moral question we should wrestle with as a democracy. Excel can't tell you that answer,
but we pretend to do it. Well, so give me more examples about why this is such a big problem
in food. Again, I know this is a larger economic problem, but what makes it so bad in the food
system? The workers, the workers are the ones being squeezed here the most. I mean, that is
the one that shocks people the most. My book is My Berry Baron, Driscoll's.
You're Berry Baron. Oh, Driscoll's. Driscoll's is in. Driscoll's is in my supermarket. I buy
Driscoll's all the time. They sell one in three berries in America, but they don't grow a single
berry, Adam. They sell one in three berries, but they grow zero berries. Is that what you said?
Yes. How is that possible? Chicken. They chickenized the berry industry.
And it's like a combination of Silicon Valley meets chicken. So they took the Silicon Valley
model of owning the IP. So they own the IP of the berry, and then they contract out production.
And part of that chapter is I wanted to tell people a lot of the produce you consume now
is moved offshore because of these trade agreements where you can exploit labor,
exploit the environment. So, you know what I mean? How can you compete on price against
a 12 year old picking berries in like Baja, Mexico?
Okay. Now I have to dwell on the question of IP. You said there's IP in the berries,
intellectual property. Now I'm used to that in Hollywood, right? Like Batman is IP,
you know? And so if I want to write a Batman movie, well, guess what? I got to get permission.
And also I'm not that important as the screenwriter or the director. Batman's the star, right? Even
the actor isn't that important. So IP is a real problem where I work. What is the IP for the berry?
Is the IP the name Driscoll's? Is it the, or is it the berry itself? What the fuck are you talking
about? Both. Because they want a branded product. I mean, Driscoll's is kind of the first branded
produce thing. Like you can't think of like, name a branded Apple company. You really can't.
But on top of it, I can name Apple varieties. You're right. I can't, and I know some of those
are proprietary, but I can't name a company. I can name Chiquita Banana. That's one that
I can think of that's maybe older. But the key thing is, is it's really about durability.
What's really fascinating about Driscoll is that it's really, you almost kind of have to blame
Walmart. Like Walmart is the king of kings and the creation of one robber baron makes other
robber barons where Driscoll's saw the rise of Walmart coming and realized Walmart wants one
company to do four berries year round for 4,000 stores. And so that berry is not engineered for
taste. So they patent, they make special types of berries that either sometimes they're going to
Morocco, sometimes in Baja, sometimes in Chile, but it's all about durability. How can you make
that berry last as long as possible as it goes from Chile up to Vermont? Right. And those Driscoll's
berries, like they taste not great. I mean, I was lucky enough, my parents' garden when I was a
kid and we would have strawberries fresh from the garden. They taste so strawberry either,
incredible. Driscoll's berries are like, you're like, I'm getting a hint of strawberry.
I wafed it, a wafting under my nose when I bite into this watery pink white berry, you know,
it's better than nothing. It's okay on corn flakes, but it's not like a berry berry, right?
But that's the story of the food system is nothing tastes good anymore. I mean, that is like
writing this chapter. I did little tastings like, so I love milk, shocking.
No, no, no, no, you look like a milk drinker. You look like a milk guy. I'm sorry.
Yeah, of course I'm going to love my milk. But like inputs matter. Like inputs matter and like
cow and pasture is going to make a very different tasting milk than like an
industrial cow inside a metal shed or in baker's field, you know, eating corn all day.
And that's a story across the food system. And on top of it, industry will love to say this
makes cheap food. That's not factually true. That's like maybe my favorite little factoid
writing in this book is, oh, these are concentrated markets, concentrated markets gouge. That's what
they do. And we see rampant gouging across the food system. So we're paying more for garbage.
That is what blows my mind. Yeah, those just goes berries are not like cheap.
They're still, you know, berries are expensive to buy in the grocery store still.
You don't get many, you know, you pay, I don't know, like eight bucks a little tiny thing of
blueberries. Last year, you know, a smoothie and a half. You know, it's not.
And it's just like, I mean, but the thing is, this system is done by design. Like my, maybe
the hardest chapter, right, but one of my second favorites is my farm by
grain bearing chapter about the farm bill. The farm bill heavily subsidizes grains.
So it makes highly processed food cheap. But if you grow produce, you don't get anything.
And it also pushes people to grow grains and not produce. So it pushed produce off the shore of
America to other countries. And when supply chains get long, transparency collapses. Like,
it's so stupid. But like, part of the reason why I wrote that was I read an article 15 years ago
where 70% of apple juice in America comes from China. Really? 70% of apple juice
in America comes from China. But I mean, American apple farming is still big. There's,
like America makes a lot of apples. I get them in the grocery store. Many of them are good.
So why would the apple juice be produced in China when we're growing apples here?
Because then the biggest part of apples is labor. It's cheaper to hire someone over
there, ship liquid across the world. I mean, we still produce a lot of apples, but not as
much as you think. I mean, it's kind of, if you go to Trader Joe's, look at the back of every
juice. You'll notice a lot of them will say, Turkey, pick your country. It's a labor component.
As we rave standards of living for farm workers here, it undermines, it kind of pushes people
off. And even in Iowa, most of the orchards are gone that I grew up with, but they're not
subdivisions. They're just more corn and soybeans because that's where more of the subsidies are
going to. And I've known for a while that, we covered on my Netflix show, The G Word, the fact
that we subsidize certain foods and not others and that we subsidize these grains. And the story
that we presented is that it's somewhat of a historical accident that we subsidize
those particular grains as opposed to any other crops. And we don't subsidize healthy fruits and
vegetables. This is a very simple story. We told it on television, so it had to be sort of simple
and quick. It's one I've read elsewhere. I did not realize that that story though meant that
we were, I thought we were just producing less vegetables, not that it was getting pushed
offshore. That's wild. Like if I'm buying broccoli or whatever, it's like more likely now to come
from a different country entirely. Yes. It took me a while to kind of, I love,
do you know what they're like the census for people? Well, USA does its own agriculture
census and every seven years they do it. And you start pulling to the data and you just notice,
oh, there's some weird trend lines going on here. And even something simple as,
during the New Deal, one of the things they did, the Workers Progress Administration,
is they commissioned state guides, they called them. I almost think of Wikipedia mixed with
like travel. I was reading the Iowa one and I was reading about all these different regional
food productions. You're like, wait, there used to be tons of peaches in Iowa. There used to be
tons of onions. Like food supply chains used to be much more regional. And part of it is,
to be fair, part of it is refrigeration. Refrigeration was a game changer. It extended supply chains,
but what this system does is it really pushes people to specialize, but it makes them incredibly
fragile. So like, that's what happens is like you used to just see like Del Mar Peninsula,
used to do a lot of the produce for the East Coast. The Delta used to do some produce for the South.
Now, ever all your strawberries in America used to come from California. Well, now it's starting
to shift away to Baja. You know what I mean? Like, California is increasingly nuts because that's
just pure capital intensive. Right. Like, sorry, when you say California is nuts, you're not referring
to the craziness of life in California, which I can vouch to. Let me be clear. Things are pretty
wild here in the state of which I live. Now, you're talking about in California, which is a huge
agricultural state, they are now mostly growing nuts. And part of that is because nuts are easily
like financialized. Like you can ship them really easily. They're worth a lot of months. Like almonds
are very, they're calorie dense. They are also money dense per unit of almond, right? Yep,
totally. And then it's easy to harvest. You don't really need people. They just have machines
that can do a lot of the work. So you don't need to pay someone to go up there and pull it down the
fruit. But that means that, you know, a state like mine that used to have, you know, used farming,
used to be a big part of its economy that people actually worked in. And that, you know, there's
the famous farm worker unionization efforts of the last century, you know, like it's part of the
history of the state, the fucking dust bowl migration, all this shit. This is like part of
what California is. Now, it's just, you know, the same amount of land, but it's being used
with these giant machines to farm almonds just for a couple of people to profit at the top,
rather than something that's benefiting everybody in the economy. Yeah, in California,
speaking of not so, it's just, it's a different food system. And it took me as a Midwesterner
a while to get my head around. Like there's a lot of problems with like the homestead act and stuff,
but it established like de-concentrated power, especially in the land holdings. California,
on the other hand, has always been colonial. Like you drive the central valleys, you don't see farm
houses in the fields. And like, right, you start, I mean, you write a book like this, there's so
much stuff that ends up in the cutting room floor. I got obsessed with the water stuff in
California, like the whole Imperial Valley makes no sense to me. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's crazy
the way water has been redirected across the state, specifically to the most populous state in the
country. And by the way, I live in the most populous county in the country as well, which is
enormously thirsty of water, constantly in a drought state. But part of that is because so
much the water is directed to these farms that are owned again by one or two people as their sort of
personal wealth creation. Do you cover the, you cover the Resnicks in the book? So I knew you're
going to say that. I have a whole B list of Barons that didn't make the cut. There's already been a
lot of good. You're calling the Resnicks B list Barons, the almond and pomegranate Barons of
California. You're calling them B list. Hey, screw you, man. These are great. These are some of the
greatest robber Barons in the American economy. Stuart Resnick and his wife, whose name I forget,
they steal water from all across the state. They're like making huge amounts of almond milk.
Caliphia almond milk is them. Palm wonderful is them. They've created company towns across of like
where they, you know, force people to live like on their property, right? They're horrible people.
And, uh, I can't believe they didn't make your list. I'm insulted as someone who lives in California.
You want to hear the Resnick on your list? Have you seen my ass? Have you seen their new product?
What is their new product? Seedless lemons. Seedless lemons? Because Americans,
they're too lazy. They don't like the seed and their lemons. So like, there's something evil.
This is the weirdest thing to say. Some of these Barons, you have to kind of
admire like the bullshit of it all. Like, that's kind of brilliant. And it's, um,
I mean, that's the funny thing about writing this book. Sorry, I shouldn't say funny, but, um,
people tell me, oh, you got, when I was in Minnesota, like, you got, let me tell you
about this potato baron. When I was in Indianapolis, they told me about this carrot baron.
You're just like, it's so ridiculous that we have this. I mean, the Resnicks are,
it sounds weird when I wrote, when I structured this book, I wanted to mix up the narrative.
So I have trashy money. Then I go aristocratic money than trashy. You know what I mean? Like,
you don't want to do the same story over and over. The Resnicks kind of have this, um,
they're like Cargill to me. They have this like Greenwich, like they understand image construction
in a way that my hogberry doesn't give a fuck about. Yeah. Yeah, they're very, uh, they make
themselves look good, right? They, they, there's a lot of, they do a lot of donations and things
like that. They, uh, they make themselves look like upstanding pillars of the community.
Even in the products themselves, I mean, these people are one of the pioneers of almond milk.
And, you know, almond milk is wildly popular and it is, uh, not great environmentally, right?
Cause the, the almonds take so much water to make. It's like, you know, a bunch of almond,
but then I just, it's just almond plus water and it took water to grow the almonds.
But they, they have like the, the, you know, the Caliphia almond bottle. It looks so wholesome and
happy. Oh, there's no, there's no cows involved. So it's good for me. Like it's gotta, it's got
a halo to it. Oh, my favorite. I mean, their best product is obviously Fiji water.
Oh, their Fiji water as well. I forgot about that. Let's ship water from halfway across the world
and branded as bougie and like sell people for like, you know, that's, that's where we are right now.
Hey folks, this week's sponsor is one of my favorites on this show. I endorse them whole
heartedly. And in fact, I have been using their product since long before this podcast even existed.
That's right. I'm talking about delete me. You know, you might not want to hear this,
but it has got to be said, your data is out there. There is a whole thriving ecosystem of data
brokers, people who collect, buy and sell our personal information on the internet right now.
That means your name, your phone number, your home address, the names of your relatives,
and your friends is almost certainly out there waiting to be snapped up by anyone with an
internet connection. These sites are real. I have been to them myself and I've seen my own
information on them. And I've talked before about how exposed I felt when I realized that people
were literally buying my home phone number from these data brokers. And frankly, I wouldn't wish
that feeling on anyone. It was after that incident that I signed up for delete me and I have not
regretted it even for an instant ever since. But since then, the prevalence of harassment and online
bullying has only seemed to escalate. It seems like every single week I hear a story about a real life
incident that began as an argument or interaction between two strangers on the internet or about
some kind of stalking that began online. You deserve to feel secure and anonymous on the internet
and not have to be anxious about scammers finding your phone number, phishing attempts being sent
to your email or strangers knowing how to find your front doorstep. So for that reason, I urge
you to check out delete me, not just for your security, but for your friends and family too.
Their teams of experts scour the internet. They remove your and your family's information from
those data broker sites. They send you a report every single 90 days. It really works. I can tell
you it is true. Okay. And get this, you can get 20% off your delete me plan when you go to join

That's the sound of you mastering a new language with Babel. Learning a new language can be one
of the toughest yet most rewarding challenges out there. So if you are ready to dive in,
make sure you're using the right tools to get the job done. A lot of language apps are really just
kind of games that are dressed up to make you feel like you're learning. Babel is different though.
It is the real deal. Lessons in Babel are crafted by real people for real conversation.
They're approachable with tips and tools that are all based in real life and framed around
conversation based teaching. From minute one, Babel is concerned with helping you get out there
and put a new language into practice in the real world. I mean, look, I've lived in Los Angeles
for years and a ton of people here speak Spanish and starting Spanish with Babel has been rewarding
to me in ways that I didn't even anticipate. I mean, sure it's made chatting with neighbors and
ordering food and enjoying cultural events easier to do. But more importantly, it's also just
enriched my experience of living in Los Angeles and has made me feel more connected to my community
in a way I didn't expect. It makes me excited to learn more and see what else it opens up for me.
Now, that's just my experience. But studies from Yale, Michigan State University and others
have shown that Babel is effective. One study even found that using Babel for 15 hours is
equivalent to a full semester of a college language course. And look, I can't promise
that it'll be easy, but I can promise you'll be glad you did it. And get this, here is a
special limited time deal for factually listeners. Right now, you can get up to 60% off your Babel
subscription, but only for our listeners at babel.com slash factually. That's right,

rules and restrictions may apply. Yeah. And speaking of shipping, you know, these liquids
halfway across the world, I mean, it's ridiculous to be shipping so much food
across the country or across the world in in cargo containers, right? In like, why,
I think about this every time I drink a Pellegrino and I like a Pellegrino makes me feel classy,
you know, to have a sparkling water at dinner. But I'm like, a LaCroix just comes from Wisconsin.
Why do I need it shipped from Italy? Right? That's a lot more fossil fuels to have just like
water brought from one place to another. There's water here, motherfuckers. Like,
why do I need it to come on a boat? And the same thing has to be true of apple juice and all
these other products as well, right? Yeah, because it's all about exploiting labor. I mean, it's
this whole neoliberal trade stuff. I mean, that is the trade component to the food system has
been really underappreciated. I mean, even if you go back to Baja and the berries, these are like,
it's hard to use these words like almost like plantations because people don't live in Baja.
It's very sparsely populated. It gets as much rain as Death Valley three inches a year.
Wow. They bring in indigenous workers from Oaxaca. It's so dangerous to go report this to be a
journalist down there. They're plantations, you know what I mean? They build desolidation plants
on the ocean. They pull up the water. They drain the aquifers. The people there don't eat the berries.
They're for rich, you know, they're for upper class Americans at Costco. Wow. So they're literally,
they're almost like terraforming, like they're doing it on the surface of Mars or something.
I mean, Baja's, Baja, California is a wonderful place, but it's not suited this kind of agriculture.
They're just like, oh, here's some cheap land with some cheap people. Let's just like get some
water from somewhere else or drain it out of the aquifer and we can grow our cash crop.
Yeah. It's that finance, financialization, short term private equity kind of thing where,
I mean, you have massive amount of pig production in the Oklahoma Panhandle.
We're like the dust bowl took place and pigs are thirsty or even you go to fucking,
sorry, you go to baker's field and it's like massive amount of dairy, dairy going on there.
And you're like, this doesn't make sense. I see an oil rig next to a dairy cow standing in sand in
the desert. Yeah. I mean, every time, you know, drive that freeway route from LA to San Francisco,
it's like the most, it's the weirdest part of the whole drive. You go through that sea of cows
and it was like something is not right here. And also the air smells bad.
Yeah. I mean, like, but people don't realize that is dairy existed in Vermont,
Wisconsin, upstate New York for a reason. It made environmental logical sense.
When you put it in the desert, like New Mexico does three times more dairy than Vermont now.
And it's all over on the eastern side by Texas near Clover. And it's just,
these are industrial feedlots. And I mean, dairy is really scary because these guys are
kind of like feudal lords too, because they employ, it takes a lot of undocumented men to
run these empires. They're usually also the landlords. So they're both the employer and the
landlords are usually the largest employer in the county. I talked about my dairy bearing,
created that milk fair life. I don't know if you've ever seen, it's like that branded milk in
the grocery store. Coke just bought it for him. It's twice the cost, half the volume of normal
milk, because it has high protein content. So young men love it. That's where we are.
And when you say that, let's talk more about the financialization, like that this is driven by the
market, driven by private equity. But how much is that the case? Is it, yeah, describe how that
process might work? I mean, part of it is, so like, intellectual, I came at this of you,
to me, I really believe you have to understand how someone amassed power to deconstruct it.
And like, there's this, the simple stupid story is, oh, this was efficiency. This was technology.
But when you actually step back and you dig into it, you're like, no, this is the old-fashioned
story of a combination of regulatory capture and access to cheap capital. My hog Baron,
he saw the industrial model taking hold. He was building some of those metal sheds. He got some
Wall Street money, and he was able to essentially get big when you saw market changing. And then
he established his market dominance. And then with that dominance, he's able to essentially
set the regulatory structure. Like, he's given that money to the governor of Iowa, that much money,
because his whole empire is Iowa, he needs to control Iowa. Because the second you regulate
hog manure, like human manure, his model's no longer economically viable. Like, I can't say
that this fact blows my mind where like, I was 25 million hogs now, and a hog defecates three times
more than us. That's the manure of 75 million people. That's California, Texas, Illinois combined,
and that regulatory structure is gutted. Like, there's- How many people live in Iowa?
Three. Three million. Three million. So you got three million people doing three million pounds
of people shit, and then you've got 25 million hogs doing the equivalent of 75 million pounds of
people shit. Yes. So you're saying Iowa is something like, what, like, like, like, seven eighths
shit? Yes. Excuse me, excuse me, Iowans, but like, the math there is boggling my mind.
It's waterways in Iowa and open to her. Wow. No, I was just gonna say like,
seven percent of the waterways are too toxic to go into. You see these, there's manure lagoons
underneath them, and they occasionally leak, and you're like, no city would occasionally
leak human manure everywhere. And you know what I mean? It's such a fact of life.
Yeah. And so you say that the hog manure, despite there being many times more, we're
talking 20 times more of it than there is a human manure. Human shit is regulated. It can
only be put certain places. It has to be treated certain ways, not the case with hog shit.
Yes. I mean, my favorite little example of this is I go to, I fly a lot. It's like these coasts
for like different stuff. And there's no straight flight out of Iowa, shocking. And when I do that
flight between Cedar Rapids and Chicago, you're flying over, like especially in the winter,
you fly over snow fields, fields covered in snow, and you'll just see hog shit. Because what they
do is they, every few months you have to drain it, and you're not really supposed to drain it and
put it on snow in the winter. Because then when the snow melts, it goes straight into the water.
They do it. It's not, everyone knows they do it, and they don't get fine for it. It's an open secret.
But the worst one's actually in North Carolina, because this is where the hog model comes out of,
was a state center deregulated this industry in the eighties first. And he did it in the poor black
areas. And because of the water table in North Carolina and Iowa, they injected it into the
soil they put on top of it. In North Carolina, they spray it into the air, the manure. So
there's all these stories. They spray it into the air. Like they're watering the land. Wow.
And so there's stories of, yeah, stories of these poor black churches having to repaint their
steeples every few years because they turn brown. Jesus Christ. Just turn brown from the hog shit.
Yeah. You can't. I mean, it's, people don't realize how much destructive the quality of life is. And
the way these things, these states are so captured, you can't stop the construction of these
confinements when they go up. So your home is your everything in America. It's your wealth.
If one of those metal sheds full of piggies get built, you're fucked. You can't do anything
about it. And it just destroys your wealth, destroys your quality of life. It traps you inside.
And one thing that really strikes me is how invisible this has become to mainstream America.
Because you've got the destruction of the family farmer. That means that, well, you've got like
one guy owning an entire part of the food system. And then everyone working for him,
as you say, is an undocumented immigrant, someone with, you know, who's maybe here short term,
or maybe they don't speak English. They're, you know, they're not able to vote. They're not,
or they're living on some sort of weird company town, often, you know, the Central Valley of
California or Baja California. Well, that's a different, different country. But you get my
point. And the people eating the food have no visibility because there's been this,
like, disconnect between the people making it and the people eating it. Is that, does that sound
right to you? Totally. I mean, like, to me, the bigger tooth, just to add on to that is like one,
you have local news collapse in these, in places like Iowa. I mean, the one where I sure got gutted
by private equity, Sinclair Owens, most of the TV stations. So these stories aren't being told.
They're not being reported out. So then the Robert Barron essentially creates his own narrative.
Like, I kind of think of Iowa, rural America, now is like an extraction colony,
where the, like, the colonizers set the narrative. Right. So these stories aren't told. And on top
of that, you have a lot of news outlets in New York City want to talk about what's the new high-end
restaurant. Like, there's not these structural undercurrent stories. It's like, what's the new
vegan restaurant in Brooklyn, you know? Yeah, that's food journalism. Yeah. Yes. But it's easy.
It's cheap. And on top of it, my hog baron has his own spokeswoman. So like, there's this whole
propaganda apparatus that just licks him up and down all day. And I mean, my favorite, sorry,
my favorite little, my husband, I have these gay little sassy lines in the book that I kind of love.
And in my hog baron chapter, Mike, Mike Rowe did a dirty jobs episode on my hog, my dairy baron.
Uh-huh. I love that. By the way, you keep saying my hog baron, my dairy baron. You're really attached
to these people. You love them. I feel like you're, I just imagine you in your home, like,
just with their pictures on the wall, like little shrines to them everywhere. Like,
you love these people. Oh, I'm upset. Like, I had a, actually, a writer buddy of mine called me out
on that a few months ago, too, because it's, I had, I mean, I spent five years on this and I read
thousands of articles just to kind of get my head around it. Yeah. You get a vibe. You get a flavor
of them. You just kind of get to know what type of person they are. Like, I know, I know that type
of guy, my dairy barons, I call them Bubba's, just that arrogant white guy that thinks they build
everything. I mean, so many of these guys cosplay as farmers, but they're really capital asset
managers. And like, he goes on dirty jobs, sells his narrative of being a farmer. And then I dig
into it and you're like, Oh, you actually claim residency at the Ritz Carlton, Puerto Rico,
probably to evade capital income taxes. And then like, and then my line on that,
my line is Mike Rowe sold his narrative. Like he used to sell products on QVC.
Cause it's just like, yeah, Mike Rowe, the guy from dirty jobs famously, if people don't know,
you know, part of the, the right wing information machine, like he's, you know,
been funded for years by all the biggest right wing billionaires and, you know, pushing,
has always pushed a really pro corporate message on that show and on his other products, which is,
you know, that's his right to do as a, as a communicator. I push a narrative that I find
more true, uh, than that, but that is, that is his ideological and historical role in the world.
Yeah. I mean, I did your thing. I didn't know that though. I just, I was in the, I could, you
know, in Oklahoma watching, uh, Top Gun a few years ago, I was like there for something. I was
at a theater and he cut an ad before the movie. He's in how great fracking was for Oklahoma,
but it was like the most delusional ad I've ever seen. And you're like, cause he's one of those
people, my parents always have them on like, it's like storage or just kind of on in the background.
Yeah. It's a good show. It's got this hidden ideological message that, uh, that, that people
don't usually appreciate that. And like, to me, the truth was so obvious. That's what actually
bothered me the most about the dairy bearing is they, they got a lot of press for how environmental
sustainable they were. And you just go to their operation. It's about an hour south of Gary,
Indiana, and it's just so obviously wrong. Like, um, I've never seen a Midwest cornfield with
canals around it. You're like, wait, what's going on here? And you Wikipedia, literally Wikipedia,
and this was an old wetlands. It was Everglades at the North. Teddy Roosevelt used to go hunting
here. This shouldn't be in row cropping production. And to do intensive dairy work, dairy cows,
we talk about hogs maneuvering a lot. Dairy cows do an insane amount more where his,
that dairy operation he's a part of has about 35,000 cows. Those cows do as much manure in a
day as the city of Austin, Texas. Wow. He's doing that in a wetland. I mean, well, so let's talk
again about the, though, the people who are doing the work for these guys. Because look,
I mean, Trump is out there right now saying he's going to deport every undocumented immigrant
in America, but that's his policy. He wants to deport all of them. And Biden has moved far to
the right on immigration. There's, there's almost a growing consensus about like deportation.
At the same time, our food system is built entirely on the backs of these undocumented
workers who are doing work that no, you know, middle-class American would ever agree to do
at the wages that are being paid. And part of like the work was basically invented for
undocumented people to be underpaid doing, right? And so like, how does that interact with our
politics? I mean, just tell me about that piece of it. It seems insane to talk about deporting
these people when like, where would you get your fucking driscals? You know?
That, I mean, that, that is the irony of it all. I mean, my Dairy Baron gave a massive
trek to Trump right after, you know, the excess Hollywood tape came out. But it's like, dude,
your old empire is undocumented workers. I mean, even writing this book, I discovered a worker
died in his manure pit. Wow. It was a Honduras man, had three children. It was never reported.
It took me like two, three years to get the death records on him because the power he wields in
the county. That's the irony of it all. I mean, that's a thing I wrestled with writing in the
coffee chapter was, and I think this has been lost history is the role monopolist play in
financing fascist. And I danced around that in the book where Tim Wu had this good book called
Curse of Bigness, where he kind of mentioned it. Yeah, the book's incredible. Yeah. That's where
I got a bunch of the argument that I told you about Robert Bork from. Yeah. Yeah. And so he,
but he had this little nugget in there that I dug more into. After World War II, a big part
of America's reconstruction in Japan and Europe was trust busting. Like Congress commissioned a
report and they're like, how did this happen? One of the key findings were monopolist finance
fascist. Hitler's largest owner was a company called IG Farben. IG Farben was a chemical company.
Hitler comes into a room and goes, oh, I'll help you sell more chemicals, whatever. I don't mean
all the crazy rhetoric. They caught him at check. They still had him in chemicals, including chemicals
using gas chambers. That company's broken up into seven. One of the modern day companies that was
broken up into is, is a Bermont Santo. I just think that history is so important, especially now. And
I think because I'm from Iowa, I kind of saw where it all fell apart. Like Iowa should be the
Italy in North America. It should be the Napa. It should be where you go for food tourism. Yet,
as a second highest cancer rate in America, it's one of the most obese states, the politics of
rage have filled the void of what used to be a solid middle class place of what used to be a
purple state. And we don't have to go down this path, but this is the path we're on. And like,
that is a goal I really wanted to have with this book is here's an honest conversation
where we are, but what we could do too. That's amazing how these barons have inflamed our politics
while keeping all the attention away from them, right? Like the public, a lot of the public is
so angry about illegal immigration and undocumented immigrants. But like, why are undocumented
immigrants taking those jobs? Because these barons have created a job that only an undocumented
immigrant would take that that is so poor and has done so by fucking with the food system of
the food that we eat. And so this is a problem that's entirely created by them. And yet the public
is angry at the victims, at the people who are dying in the manure pits, so that we can eat
worse food, all so that these guys on top can make more money. It's insane. The bearing that
it's the scariest is because how unknown they are is actually Cargill. So Cargill is owned by
the largest private company in America. They're bigger than the Koch brothers, but
no one knows who they are. I mean, I didn't even have them in my business. Like when I laid out
the book and I grew up around Cargill. I was born next to a Cargill plant, like soccer next to a
Cargill plant. I church was next to a Cargill plant. And they're all about owning the middle
because they're not consumer-facing. You don't know who they are, but they have so much money
and power. And what they do is they engage, like I call it, they use middleman. So they never do
things overly. They pay these DC groups to do their bidding so they can play, you know,
the ignorant. You don't mean to plead, you know, plead, what's the word I'm looking for, innocent.
But it's currently dark. I mean, that is the fear of concentrated economic power is
you just assume it corrupts the local system. Yeah. Well, let's talk more about how this affects
the food that we actually eat in so many ways. Like the financialization, the monopolization
has actually altered the food itself, right? I mean, if I can give you a personal example of this.
Last year was in upstate New York. I was on a college campus. The college campus had some apple
trees. It was like a historic apple orchard on it. And so they had some apples out like in the
cafeteria and they were like, oh, you can have some, here's a Macintosh apple. And I took the
Macintosh apple and I bit it and I was like, this tastes nothing like a Macintosh apple I've ever
had in my life. It was like crisp and juicy and had like a, had a complexity of flavor. It makes
me sound like a food nerd. I'm not trying to be snobby about it. There was literally something
going on with this apple I had not tasted before. Whereas every other Macintosh, one of the most
popular apple varieties in America I had had before had tasted almost exactly the same.
And, you know, I'm sure this apple was fresher because it was local and dah, dah, dah. But also,
I was like something about the genetics seemed different. Something like everything about this
apple was different to me. And it made me just reflect on, there are all these ways that the
mechanized, financialized food system changes what we actually eat without us realizing it,
until we finally have the counter example. I mean, but that's, I'm obsessed with owning
the middle with this book is how radical the system has become. And like part of owning the
middle and like what we're talking about these reforms are like, oh my God, animals should
be on the land. What a radical concept. Oh, food should be grown near you. Food should taste good.
People should get a decent living wage. We've gone so far off track and I will say,
as dark as this can be, what gives me hope is everyone's seeing it's not working.
Like the biggest, the thing that's kind of shocked me the most is how much the business
traveler has taken to my book. It's like a cliche from upper class Americans to go,
oh, I went to Italy, I ate better food, I lost weight, you know, it's cheaper.
Yeah. I mean, everyone's just kind of seeing it. It's not working. And yeah, that is like,
I mean, I, I went on Glenn Beck's TV network recently. I mean, there's like this weird,
there's this whole weird thing going to on the, on the right right now over food. I mean, it's a
little raw, melky RFK. Yeah, no, but they've gotten it's sort of like the crunchy, you know,
California hippies who got kind of right wing have influenced the rest of the right wingers
to get a little bit more crunchy. And now they are really obsessed with
the food system in a surprising way. I realized this when I did a segment about for Adam ruins
everything. And it was a pretty light segment. It was just like, Hey, you can eat bugs if you
want it, you know, like bugs are not that bad for you. A lot of cultures eat bugs. There's
bugs in the food you already eat. It's a good source of protein, just like a fun light segment.
And a bunch of right wingers, a bunch of right wing blogs freaked out and we're like,
Adam Conover says you should eat bugs. And I realized that they have some sort of
like meme about how in the future we'll all be forced to eat. Like we're on the
snowpiercer train or something and we're going to be forced to eat, you know,
soylent green or whatever. Like they're like, they have like an apocalyptic future in mind.
And I accidentally like triggered them and their fear of being forced to eat bugs.
And I wasn't aware of that until that moment. I've seen ever since that was me five years ago,
I've seen more and more of this throughout the right wing. They're like obsession with
the food system and purity and back to the land and that kind of thing.
Oh, I mean, just two things add on to that. One, I laughed because cargo's get into the
bug industry. They're trying to as a protein source to feed industrial animals. So they want
as like soy, they kind of replace soybeans and corn is just all feed up will feed the pigs inside
these metal sheds bugs, which is like a whole new separate thing. But that's actually why I
like book talks to your point because you it's pattern recognition. You're like, why am I getting
a lot of questions about raw milk? Why am I getting a lot? Because people come up to you,
they have this conversation one on one, you're testing your rhetoric. I mean, that's actually
where I get the best probably gossip for the book or like tips. It's just people like, oh,
you should really look over here. Like I did a book event in the hometown of my hog Baron.
And it was the one time I was actually scared shitless. I put the tracking on my phone.
You're scared shitless even because there was so much shit surrounding you. You were ankle deep
in shit. That's why you were scared shitless. Or I could be floating in the next day, you know,
like some little Chinatown thing goes down. Please go on. But I was just that night I was
the scariest I've been in the book tour because like, I didn't expect doing this book tour was
every place an old lady would always ask me, are you worried about your safety? And honestly,
I'm not in that I can say that it's honestly the beauty of America is I can write a book like
this and not be worried about my safety. That said, that town is like, I'm going into the heart
of the beast. I'm going to a town of 5000 people and I was to do a book talk. I was shocked. We had
50 people show up and to get 50 people at a book talk in 2024 is a big deal. It was just people
pissed off. And they were about more than half the room came up to me afterwards. Oh, I knew,
I knew Jeff and they promised me this, they did that. They did, you know, you could just see
the anger and the sadness in people's face. And like that's also something I've internalized
writing this book as there's a degree of Stockholm syndrome in real America that I don't think
urban America appreciates. A lot of people fought power and they lost. And like, you can't afford
to leave. It's too depressing to really grapple with this material. There's still some fighters.
I opened with a book of a pissed off old woman fighting it. Usually the fighters still are
pissed off old ladies in rural areas, but it's hard. But it's a weird, these people are barely
getting by and you can just feel the pain. I don't know. I don't know how to describe that,
but it's just something I've noticed. Yeah. Well, I think we have all felt that that there's
something is deeply wrong with our food system. And, you know, we had, you know, when we cover on
the show, what has happened to us health wise because of food, the blame and to me always falls
on the food system, on the capitalist food system that has, you know, given us all of these foods
that are very delicious to us, but are extremely unhealthy. But more importantly, even the foods
that are healthy have gotten less healthy, right? All the meats have gotten, they're produced less
healthily for the people who produce them, but also for us, do you have any particular examples
of that? And do you think that the process that you're talking about here, this baronization,
this chickenization of the food system is to blame for our poor health outcomes?
Oh, 100%. I mean, it takes money now to be healthy in America.
Yeah. One of the hardest sections, or I was actually the obesity section
in my Green Barons chapter, where it goes back to corn and chicken, I joke. But like,
before corn syrup really took hold in America, we didn't have, I mean, sugar was hard to do.
Sugarcane has a very limited production region like Louisiana and Florida,
and sugar beets actually has this weird new DL supply management system where it's like
there's quotas basically on how much you can produce. And but then the creation of corn syrup
in the 70s and 80s and the highly, the amount of subsidies going into it just exploded the use
of sugar. Julia Guthman is an academic at the University of Santa Cruz, has done a lot of
scholarship on this and really drove that point home. But I mean, I, I see, I mean,
that's why I love going to grocery stores because you can just see the price points. You see,
you walk down the pop aisle and you're like, a two liters of buck 50, but if I want carrot juice
at $6, like you're pushing people into it. And I don't want an interview for this book that got
junked. And it's because like there's this elitism amongst certain people where they blame
the Lorencan person for their obesity. And I was like, you don't get it. You don't get what it's
like to work two jobs, have kids, and this food is easy. It's easy to cook a frozen pizza. I mean,
I, I grew up on that stuff. I mean, it's, it's hard. It takes money to eat healthy and it takes time
when people are barely getting by. Also, keep in mind, this stuff is, if you had a rough day,
who is happy after like a box of cheez-its, you know? Right. And well, there's, there's a place
for that, right? And, you know, the, there's a lot of concern that this sort of argument leads to a
continual shaming of people eating, you know, processed foods, et cetera. There's a place for
processed foods in the world, but there is also something clearly very wrong with our food system
that is like hurting people and that is doing something bad to their health. And you think it's
this is what it, this is the culprit. Oh, 100%. I mean, the, the Farm Bill is a reflection of
moral values and our Farm Bill is now designed for Wall Street. It's designed for PepsiCo
to make chips and pop as cheap as possible at the expense of everything else. So as chips got cheaper,
you know, fresh stuff, stuff got more expensive. And yeah, it's, I mean, also these supply chain
lines, you know, it's even in like a lot of vegetables used to be grown in Iowa and that's
gone. Um, and also when things, my husband and I were just talking about carrots today,
how awful baby carrots taste. So like private equity is one of the largest grower carrots in
America. Yeah. I mean, it's really funny. I've had conversations with people before, because,
you know, I'm the kind of guy, I just look stuff up when I'm interacting with it. And I like looked
up baby carrots once and you probably know better than me. But the story that I read was that one
enterprising carrot company figured out, well, if we take the ugly carrots and we whittle them down
into little carrot nubs, then, you know, that's like reproducible. The carrot doesn't need to be
pretty, right? We can do that with any carrot. And then we can take the shavings and we can,
you know, turn it into sugar and use it as an additive and things. Um, and when I try to tell
people this, I'm like, baby carrots are like whittled carrots. Like people will say to me in
my life, they'll go, no, they're, they're baby carrots. They're like little, they're like the
carrot is a baby. They picked it while it was still a little child. I'm eating a carrot toddler.
No, motherfucker. It's a whittled carrot. Somebody put that on a lathe, you know, and it turned it
real fast to like shrink the carrot down. You're eating a mass produced, like carrot chunk.
I'm embarrassed to say, Adam, I thought that until very recently.
They don't even look like baby carrots. They look like a piece of carpentry. They look like
something you'd use to join two, two by fours. I just didn't think we'd be that wasteful. I mean,
that's why I just couldn't believe we would shave down a carrot. And then here's the thing,
it makes a bad product. And so like, you turn away from it. You're like, like,
melons is the other one I noticed about. You gotta put so much hummus on a baby carrot for it
to taste like anything. It's like the saddest experience to eat a baby carrot. Yes. And so
like it pushes, you're like, oh, produce isn't that good anymore. These Driscoll berries don't
taste that good. So then you start eating more, well, who isn't, you know, Oreos and stuff. And then
on top of it, you go into these grocery stores and like, you're not seeing innovation. You're not
seeing new products because like these stores, they don't want to deal with some local person doing
what you only do two stores at Walmart. They want to deal in the bisco that can do 4,000
stores. So that's why when you go into a store now, you just see a new kind of Oreo. You don't see
new products. You don't see quality stuff. And it's on top of it, it's, it skews the system so
much where, I mean, so much of that neoliberal framework of like, change the system with your
fork to bifurcate the system even more. You have like, whatever that fancy LA one's called Aragon
for like the rich. Arawan, yeah. Arawan. And then, then you have like,
Walmart is massive. Walmart sells one in three groceries. Their market share grocery is the
same as the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth combined. That is an insane amount of
market power. And as you say, one baron creates more barons because Walmart wants all the food.
They want to buy it in huge tranches. They want to get all their food from one supplier. And so
that privileges the one supplier who's able to grow the exact same thing in huge quantities
to sell to every Walmart store simultaneously. And that causes them to buy each other up or for one,
like if, if Walmart's selling one out of three groceries, then pretty soon you're going to have
one person selling one out of three berries and then probably even more than that. You said
melons though. What's the problem with melons? I wanted to hear it. I mean, after spending all
this time, I mean, I feel sorry for my husband because I just vomit this information I had on
all day. And so we got married two years ago. I'll replace him. I'll marry you. I love hearing
this stuff. He doesn't want to hear it anymore. Okay. Propose. I'm down. One year anniversary. We
went to like, like France and Italy. And I'm just, I got to see a food system that worked. And
I hate cantaloupe. I just, I see it in the fruit bowl. I think it tastes awful.
But then like, they had it, they had it over there and you're like, wait, this is actually
really good. They would sell it on the side of the road. You pull over, you buy a good cantaloupe
and you're like, it's just, it's kind of like, um, when you cut corner so much at some point,
you're cutting bone. Like there's, there's no efficiencies again. You're, you're cutting quality
and it's just so right. And especially private equity people don't, they don't understand how
it is to run a business. I mean, the reason, the best grocery stores in America are actually
still privately owned, like HGB in Texas, Hy-Vee in Iowa, Wegmans on the East coast. You know what
I mean? There's not this Wall Street financialization because like some boy who went to Harvard MBA,
who's never worked a grocery store job in his life, doesn't understand the nuances of this,
of these marketplaces. And it's also, it's a profession. There's a craftsmanship to
merchandising. My dad used to be a beer merchandiser. So like, I noticed that when I go into like,
you go into like a Wegmans or whatever, fancy growth, like, sorry, those type of grocery stores,
the merchandise, they care. They're, it's homecoming weekend. It's going to be a bunch of
homecoming stuff. You go into Walmart and they just throw the pallet on the shelf and you have to
dig for it. Yep. Well, what can, what can be done about this, right? You had said that maybe there's
a positive sign in Lena Kahn's leadership at the FTC. We'll see how long she's there based on what's
happening, what's going to happen in November. I kind of don't think Trump will keep her on if he
wins. But you know, we have seen a sea change in antitrust enforcement, at least on the Democratic
side. And there are occasionally some Republicans who will join in on an antitrust fight here or
there. They do occasionally have an ally. And you're saying that, you know, the, the right, right
side of the aisle is becoming more and more obsessed with food. So is there a growing appetite
for change in our food system? Yeah, I mean, I think what Lena is really fascinating is,
I actually think she's one of President Biden's best of local pointy appointments.
Yeah. What says so much was earlier this year, Matt Gaetz went to the Wall Street Journal and
praised her. Wow. That is, they're such a, I'm a big fan of outflanking like Republicans will
talk this big game about me backing, be right there with Josh Hawley does a lot of this outflank
Republicans here because it's such a hold, hold their feet to the fire. I mean, it's also kind of,
I'm a big believer too that weird things happen in America when unique coalitions come together.
But what gives me the big, most hope and what we can do are like three things that come to my
mind. One is the death of ethanol. The Biden administration has been incredibly aggressive
at transitioning America out of flake to EVs and hybrids. And people don't realize,
but the largest use of corn now in America is ethanol. And it's really, which is used for what?
Burning, burning corn in your cars. Like it's truly. Wow. It is the museum a failure included
ethanol and it's an exhibit. I, anyone that thinks ethanol is good for the climate thinks
rolled us flat in 2024. Also, I think in food, you see one of President Biden's worst political
appointments, Secretary Vilsack. Secretary Vilsack of USDA is a former industrial dairy lobbyist.
His solution to climate change right now is but ethanol in the airplanes. Wow.
And by the way, this is a crazy thing to do because like fossil fuels are bad enough
because you're taking energy out of the ground, putting into the atmosphere, right? Stored energy
out of the ground into the atmosphere. That's bad. That warms the earth de facto, right?
But if you're taking energy from the sun and putting it into the atmosphere, right? Like the
sun is hitting the corn, making the corn grow. And then you're burning that you're releasing.
That's a whole new source of energy to put into the atmosphere to heat the planet up.
It's even worse than that because you have to use fossil fuels to help grow the corn.
And like, right, of course you do a fertilizer and et cetera. Yeah.
And the other appreciated thing is Koch brothers actually massive in fertilizer. They have a
massive holding in nitrogen fertilizer. So like there's this whole weird marriage between big
ag and big fossil fuel oil that hasn't fully, I don't think people realize, but it's just
delusional. But you know what? It's like watching Miley Coady chase that bird off the cliff right
now. Ethanol is going to die. I don't care what the industry says. It's going to meet its maker.
And my big moment, to me, what are we going to do at that moment?
I want to put animals back on land. That is like truly one of my biggest things because it's like,
it takes the temperature down. It makes, who doesn't want more farmers? Like,
here's like most grain production is going to be robotics. That's not a bad thing.
You go to a farm show now, these tractors dry themselves, but there's only so many dairy cow
one man or one person could look after. Better for these rural areas, it's more jobs.
Yeah. So you want to go to a small scale version of dairy farming again, like having,
having like, like breaking it up. And rather than one farmer, one quote farmer owning huge
numbers of cows, you've got small scale farms again. You think that's a massive improvement?
I just want to go back to that family farmer model. And it's also, it's also what it does to
it's, I mean, there's theories weird where actually this industrial dairy model is actually even
worse for the climate because when a cow is on pasture, when she defecates, she's,
you know, she's fertilizing her feet. When you put them indoors, first of all,
you have to use fossil fuels to grow her feet. But when you pull her manure, when it breaks
down, it creates additional methane that is not produced when she defecates on land.
So it creates additional fossil fuel gas. So like that Bakersfield dairy production model is
actually incredibly more destructive for the environment than, you know, some dairy cow in
Wisconsin. So like Bill Sack comes out of that world. So that's why he has his like,
bullshit kind of mentality there. But do you think there is an emerging politics that is,
you know, like more populist food politics, right, where we can sort of go across partisan lines?
And I mean, because if you're looking for, you know, rural America is largely red, right?
And, you know, Republican politicians tend to have pro-corporate policies. So do Democrats,
but, you know, it's, these are trends we're talking about. It does seem like this is an issue
that could break some of our political logjam. If you have, you know, politicians from rural
areas say, no, actually, I want to fight for the, you know, the chicken farmer, the hog farmer,
the small scale pork farmer, like these, and, you know, actually help their folks.
Oh, totally. I mean, keep in mind, I also want to broaden the conversation because it's not just
about the farmer. It's about those who pick it, process it, transport it, cook it, serve it.
Of course. People like my mom and dad. That's one in 10 of Americans. And like, we're obsessed
with such a small part of the pie. And once you talk about one in 10,
you folk, you center that on labor, that's what really matters. And it's the dirty secret of
big ag is it hollowed out its voter base. You know, you used to have thousands of Iowa hog
farms, and now you just have, you know, fewer harbor barons, and no one's called bluff on like,
Denver has no clothes now, and no one's called it. And that's also like my big thing now is I
think we should junk the farm bill. The farm bill picks favorites. It heavily subsidizes grains.
It's destructive for the climate. It's, um, rewards this incentive, this destructive model.
On top of it, you have the whole heritage coke, sorry, heritage, Kato Institute,
they hate that model too. They hate the farm bill. And like, I think that's a, there's, to me,
there's no reason why Democrats should support the modern day farm bill. Like the best example of
how rotten the farm bills gotten is actually crop insurance, because when people hear crop
insurance, they think it's for like a hurricane or rain or whatever. It's not, it's insurance for
low prices, where 60% of the premium is paid for by the taxpayer. And there's no cap at them. So
like, people don't realize Bill Gates has won the largest owner of farmland in America. If you
want to talk about like a little baron. So he can get as much crop insurance as he wants to
row as much corn as he wants. And so, you know what I mean? It's, it's so, I just, I've been
telling reformers, don't play like the system is so broken. Why back that? Like let's, let's move
away from the system. At the same time, use school meals as like the positive structural
change vehicle. Who doesn't want all dairy served in Wisconsin come from, you know,
pasture family dairy farms instead of like industrial beef in the Brazilian rainforest.
Like it's good politics. It's good tasting. You keep your money local and you're building up a new
system as you phase out an old one. Because I mean, school food's a joke. We all know that.
Yeah, but the problem is the farm bill is one of those bills that, you know, no matter how divided
Congress is, it flies through every time because it has so many parts of the society are dependent
on it, right? Like it's got something for everybody or it's got something for the voters
in or the constituents or the money constituents in every area, you know, gives,
gives subsidies to the cities to, to purchase food, give subsidies to the, you know, to the
barons in the, in the red areas to, to grow the food. Is there really a chance that it could be,
you know, junked as you say? I mean, it's, it's, it's actually kind of falling apart. I mean,
they couldn't pass them. They tried to do basically a copy paste bill and they had to punt it. So
like the rumor on the street is going to start. No, no. Then I'm not up on what's happened. That's
amazing. No, it's part, but it's this weird thing where, so even Republicans find crop
insurance too gluttonous. Like they want more crop insurance. You're right though. I mean,
there's this weird coalition of like, it's food stamps in the farm entitlement programs. I'll
be frank. I think you can break those apart. Food stamps are going to be okay because Walmart
depends on food stamps. Walmart is the richest family in America. Some days it's the richest
family in the world. So much of their employee and customer base depends on food stamps. It's a
weight subsidy. So much of corporate America needs that. I'm feeling comfortable. No one's
going to touch that. I mean, first of all, you just need all Democrats and 10 Republicans to
save that. You take away the crop insurance. Like you do farm bills standalone. Half Republicans
will flake on that. And then if Democrats don't support it, these, these, um, my hog baron,
you know what I mean? Like they don't have a constituency. They're massive amount of welfare
they get. It's just also that coalition was formed in 1960s America. The suburbs were
not a part of that coalition. Right. Like rural America's, there's some things. I left the suburbs
out of the story. And I mean, this election will come down to a few suburbs in the Midwest states.
Yeah. What can the public do about this? If there hasn't sensed about this as I am to take us out?
The big thing is I always tell people, um, buy what you can, buy your values, whatever. But the
other thing too is help connect your farmers doing a right with your schools, with your colleges.
Those procurement contracts really stabilize them. Like a lot of farmers will tell you privately,
they don't like doing the farmers market. They get rained out, whatever. It's not consistent.
You get that contract with the UC school system, your local school. It's just such a good
stabilizer and you, you want to build up the people doing it right. Cause writing this book
over five years is, yes, I focus on a few bad people, but most people are good. They're trying
to do the right thing. They're just struggling. And so how do you rep? How do you copy and paste
them and help them, you know, not decay, but like actually grow and, and cause it's also,
there's no positive vision here. That's why I realized writing this book. No, no, neither party
is articulating that positive vision, especially for rural America. And I actually think people
crave a positiveness. Like they want the opposite of what they have right now. And the positiveness
is inspiring. You're like, okay, it gives people that power to rush the gates to get to that better
system. Like that's what, that's what gives me hope, I should say. Yeah. And it sort of seems
like all we need is a politician to, or a leader to really run on that stuff, you know, and to say,
you know, to find the way that this affects everybody and to speak to people who haven't
been spoken to. It literally is a pinata saying, hit me, hit me. I mean, look, the meatpacking
especially breaking up the meat companies, like these aren't, these are comically corrupt companies.
By the way, they're not even American. They're like these weird state-backed monopolies.
Yeah. Smithfield's quasi, there's this weird Chinese relationship there. A lot of the beef
companies are Brazilian. So it's like, there's good politics there. It's just somebody needs to,
you're waiting for the right person for the whole courage to take a swing of that pinata.
Well, God willing, somebody will. And I can't thank you enough for coming on here to make
