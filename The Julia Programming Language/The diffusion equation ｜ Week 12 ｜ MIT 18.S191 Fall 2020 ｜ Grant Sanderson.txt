This week, as we continue into the climate module,
in the main lecture, one thing that you're going to see
is something known as the diffusion equation,
which is a differential equation.
In fact, it's a partial differential equation.
And what I wanted to do for this supplemental lecture
was show you where this particular equation comes from.
So the diffusion equation describes how things spread.
For example, in other contexts, it's
known as the heat equation.
And it can tell you how temperature
flows from hot areas to cool areas.
So if I were to bring together some kind of hot rod,
let's say it was 90 degrees, with a cooler rod,
let's say 10 degrees, you can know
that the temperature will generally
flow from the hot portion to the cool portion.
Over time, that left half gets colder,
and that right half gets warmer.
But how specifically does this happen?
How long is it going to take?
If we take a freeze frame at a given point in time,
what's the shape of that temperature distribution
across the pair of rods going to be?
And what's nice is the same equation that
describes heat flow like this also describes
all sorts of other diffusion.
So for example, in this lecture, we're
going to focus on the idea of molecular diffusion, where
you might interpret the same graph as instead describing
the density of a gas.
If you were to have a room where that density was really
high in one part and really low in another part,
over time, the gas particles will
tend to move from the high density part
towards the low density part on average.
So the exact ways that molecules interact with each other
like this can be incredibly complicated to model.
And if you tried to get into that
with all of the different forces at play
and all the different momentum interactions,
I mean, you can try it, but you're
going to get at something that's dramatically more
complicated than what we're going for here.
But what we can do is say, on the whole,
the way that these molecules interact,
we're going to model it as a kind of random walk.
So if you were to follow any individual molecule
and then just see what path it traces out over time
and treat that as a random walk, and then we say,
ignore the other molecular interactions.
Pretend they do this random walk,
but then don't account for how they interact with each other.
That's what's going to get us this diffusion equation.
So in particular, I should emphasize,
we're not modeling things like pressure, where
if you have a high density gas, part of what's making it move
towards the low density region is the increased number
of collisions and the increased number of interactions
happening in that high density part.
Here, we're just going to describe
why that spread happens from the statistics alone of what
a random walk would give you.
We're going to start by thinking of each particle
as living in a pixelated, very discrete space,
where at each time step, where time is also
going to be treated discreetly, it's
going to randomly hop to one of its neighbors.
So it might hop up or down or left or right.
And as time plays out, according to these random hops
that happen, its overall trajectory will be a random walk.
And then what we'll do is we'll say
what happens as this time step gets smaller and smaller,
and as the spatial step gets smaller and smaller,
so that we see how the discrete model gives rise
to a continuous model.
So just to see what this looks like,
let me play out that same animation,
but with 100 different dots instead of just the one.
So here, I have 100 dots sitting in that middle.
And if I let it play out where with each time step,
they randomly, I think in this case,
they either stay where they are or they take a random step
to one of their neighbors.
Then over time, you see this kind of spread
of the molecules across space.
And the more we have, the more this
looks like something that could be
treated with a continuous function.
So let's say instead, we were looking at 10,000 dots starting
at that middle, and we let it play out where, again,
each time step, each individual one
is following this relatively simple rule.
Then over time, we get this spread across space.
And what we want to know is, how can we
describe that spread with a function,
or an equation that we can solve to get
some kind of relevant function?
So modeling it with random walks and discretizing space,
this is all in the spirit of getting the simplest possible
thing we can that's going to give rise to this equation.
And we're actually going to go one step simpler and say,
it's easier to think about things
if they just move in one dimension rather than two.
So with each given particle, let's say at each time step,
there's a 50% chance that it hops one unit to the right,
and a 50% chance that it hops one unit to the left.
So as time plays out, it simply hops around at random like this.
For example, we could use this to model
a discrete version of the high density and low density graph
that we saw just a moment ago.
So here, I'm going to graph how many different particles
are at each one of our discrete units of space.
So in this case, everything on the left
has, it looks like, about 750 particles.
And then I'll let each one of these molecules
move according to the rule that I just described.
And what we're going to see is a diffusion
from the dense part to the lesser dense part.
So for example, after one time step,
about half of the ones on the right edge
move to the right.
And then after another time step, another half of those,
or I guess based on the random statistics of here,
a little more than half, moved one more step there.
And all in all, as this thing plays out,
we see a general tendency to flow from the left to the right.
Now, because this is a discrete model
and because there's randomness at play,
we see all this kind of statistical noise.
But the thought is, as you get the time step smaller
and smaller, the number of molecules
that play larger and larger, and the spatial step
smaller and smaller, this flow can
be described with a nice continuous equation.
One thing I should emphasize is that you often
need to have a separate rule for what
happens at the boundary.
So in this context, whereas usually,
each molecule has a 50% chance of moving to the left,
50% chance of moving to the right,
the way I have it coded here is that if it's at the bound,
then it can't move off the edge.
The other 50% goes to staying still.
But you might want other boundary conditions.
In this context, when there's only
a finite number of molecules, you
might want to just let them flow out
into the infinitude of space.
Or maybe you treat it periodically
or all sorts of other things.
But in the back of your mind, know
that whenever there's differential equations
or the kinds of setups from which differential equations
arise, you do often have to think
especially about the boundary.
So with all of that as a setup, let's go ahead and pull up
some paper and actually describe this a little bit more
mathematically.
So in this setup, we're thinking of space very discretely,
almost as if it was divided into these different cells.
And each cell has some number of particles in it.
And the rule is that at every time step,
so after some time step delta t, half of the particles,
or maybe we should say each particle with 50% probability,
will move one unit to the left.
And then each particle with 50% probability
will move one unit, sorry, to the right, excuse me.
And then the other half move one unit to the left.
Sometimes based on the statistics of it,
maybe it's more than half that go one direction
or less than half that go to the other,
but those are the probabilities at play.
And each one of these units of space
has some number of particles in it.
And I want you to think of these as a density,
which we'll denote with the Greek letter rho.
So rho sub one is the density at this point in space,
the number of particles in this cell,
rho sub two is the density at this point in space,
and so on.
So the question for us is, how does this density
change with each time step if this is our rule?
And in particular, how does it change
if we know all of the densities at a given point in time?
Can we express that change in terms of, you know,
the densities of all of its neighbors?
And this is not too hard to think about,
but let's go ahead and write it out.
It'll be pretty elucidating.
So this change, which in the back of our minds
we're thinking of as something that happens
because of time, as you take a step forward in time.
Well, let's also say this is a change at a particular index.
So maybe we're thinking of rho sub five.
Well, the things adding to it are those coming
from the right and coming from the left.
So half of the particles to its right,
about half of them are gonna be coming into it.
So whatever the density at rho n plus one,
the n plus one cell, half of those go into it.
While those are coming in,
about half of the ones in your current cell are going out.
So we're subtracting off half of the density
at the current cell.
And then the other half of the density
of the current cell is also being subtracted off,
but it's going in the other direction,
which is worth writing separately here.
But we're recovering some based on whatever cell
is to its left.
So we're adding one half of rho n minus one.
Now, when we've written it out like this,
we can go ahead and factor things out.
And then I wanna express it as a difference of differences.
So if we just kind of grouped certain terms together,
rho sub n plus one minus rho sub n.
And then we're subtracting off,
rho sub n minus rho sub n minus one.
And you can kind of think of what each of these terms mean.
This one here, rho sub n plus one minus rho sub n,
is telling us the difference in density
across this barrier.
That difference is determining the flux
of particles between them.
And then what we subtract off
is the difference in density on the left boundary.
So it's kind of like we're taking a look
at the flux on the right and the flux on the left.
That's what's determining the net change of particles
in this particular cell.
And because this expression is a kind of difference
of differences, I'm gonna go ahead and write it
with a funny little standard notation here,
where I'm gonna call it delta, delta rho around n.
If you look at the change in density
across this right barrier,
and then look at the change in density
across this left barrier,
the difference between those two changes
is the term that we want.
But there's an ambiguity in the notation here,
because over here I'm describing a change in density
with respect to time.
So maybe I should put a little subscript on that delta.
But here we're describing changes in density
with respect to space.
So I'll put a little subscript x there for those.
So this right here is the core idea
that the change in density for each unit time,
for each time step is proportional
to this kind of second order change as we move spatially.
Now ultimately we want to consider what happens
as this tiny time step approaches zero,
and as the steps in our discrete units of space
also approach zero.
Which is to say we want to understand
what does this rule look like in a continuous context.
But for that we have to start talking about rates
instead of absolute differences.
So what we really want to look at
is something like the change over time
for this density divided by the size of that time step.
That way we can take its limit
and get some kind of derivative.
And then similarly, on the other side,
what we want to see is not just the second order change
of delta, delta, rho,
but we want to know that second order change
divided by the spatial step.
But it should properly be the size
of that spatial step squared.
Because if we take a second order difference like this,
then as we shrink down our spatial steps,
the size of the second order change
will be roughly proportional to the square
of the size of that difference.
One way you might think about this
is if you were to take just the change across space of rho
divided by the size of those spatial steps,
this will approach a derivative of density
with respect to space.
And then if we did the same thing to that term,
we said, hey, how much do you change
as we take little steps in space
divided by the size of those steps?
This whole thing will now approach
a kind of second derivative.
But of course, if we're going to be adding these new terms,
like the size of our time step
or the size of our spatial step to the equation,
we've got to balance things out.
So we might say this whole thing
should be multiplied by size of delta x squared
all divided by delta t.
But let's go ahead and just wrap up all of this
and also that one half as a constant.
So if we've got our change in density
with respect to time,
this is going to equal some constant
that I'll call d times this second order change.
With respect to space.
So this constant d is called the diffusivity.
And by definition in this context at least,
it'll be equal to one half times the step size
for our particle squared
divided by the time steps that we have.
So if our particles were taking larger steps
with each one of these rules,
then this diffusivity constant would be larger.
It would actually grow quadratically with that.
And similarly, if we had smaller and smaller time steps,
meaning the amount of time that it takes
for each one of these jumps to happen was smaller,
that would also increase this diffusivity.
So this is a constant that kind of wraps up the idea
of how quickly are these particles moving.
But the benefit of wrapping all this up nicely
and having that constant out there
is now we can say as we consider
smaller and smaller time steps,
so delta t goes to zero,
and smaller and smaller spatial steps,
delta x goes to zero,
but we do it in such a way
that this term d stays constant.
So there's a relationship to how our time steps
and our spatial steps are going to zero.
Then in the limit, we can think of these
as derivatives of a continuous density function.
So on the left-hand side,
we would have the partial derivative of density
with respect to t.
So the reason we're talking with partial derivatives here
is because there's multiple different variables
that can affect density.
It's a function both of where we are in space,
but also where we are in time.
So you specify with respect to time.
And this is gonna be proportional
with this proportionality constant of diffusivity
to the second partial derivative of our density
with respect to space.
So this expression is what's known as the diffusion equation.
And despite having a fair bit of fancy symbols in it,
the idea is that it can arise
from a very, very simple context.
In this case, just a random walk model
with particles stepping either to the left
or to the right with 50% probability.
And moreover, this has a really nice readable meaning
once we start thinking of it with a continuous function.
And for that, it might be best
to turn back to some of the animations.
For any of you who haven't come across
partial differential equations that much before,
it can be really nice to think of
in terms of the graph of one of these functions.
So like I said, the same equation
that's describing molecular diffusion,
like we were just thinking about,
can also describe temperature diffusion.
So here I have a graph of temperature
with respect both to space in one dimension and time.
So on the one hand, you can think of this temperature
as changing in time.
And you might have a little change to that temperature,
del t, that's caused by a change in time.
Del, you know, lowercase t, confusion of t terms here.
And the ratio between those, or more specifically,
the limit of that ratio,
as you take smaller and smaller time steps,
gives us this partial derivative with respect to time,
which is the slope of this graph
in one particular direction.
But we could also take its slope in a different direction
and consider the change to our function
as it's caused by tiny steps in the spatial direction.
Look at the ratio between those to get us a kind of slope
and then ask again, what's the limit
as we take smaller and smaller spatial steps.
So what's neat about a partial differential equation
is it's giving you this kind of puzzle.
It says the way that things change in one dimension
is inextricably linked with the way
that it's changing in another direction.
So in particular, let's go ahead and kind of read off
what it is that our diffusion equation is telling us.
The second partial derivative term
with respect to space,
describes the curvature of this function.
Points where that second derivative are negative
tend to be curving down,
meaning their points where the neighbors
are lower than what they are.
So it makes sense that the molecules
are gonna tend to diffuse away
or the heat will diffuse away.
Points where that second derivative are higher
are points where this curves up.
So you can read this equation as saying
the way that each point is gonna tend to change in time
is proportional to the curvature at that point.
And as you think about that for a given function,
that's actually kind of intuitive.
And it has this nice effect
when you imagine it playing out of smoothing out the function
because wherever there's curvature,
especially sharp curves,
those are the ones that change the most quickly.
So over time, the heat distribution
or the molecular distribution, whatever it might be,
tends to get smoother over time.
That's a consequence of this equation.
Now you might wonder how this whole setup changes
if instead of thinking of one dimensional motion,
we start thinking of two or three dimensional motion.
And the nice part is it actually
hardly changes at all.
So if our cell, instead of having neighbors
just to the left and to the right,
also had some neighbors to the top and the bottom,
well, we've already talked about how
this second partial derivative with respect to x term
comes from looking at the change in the flux
across the right barrier
to the flux across the left barrier.
The difference between those two
is what gives us this net change
to the density in that cell.
Well, it ends up just being the same thing,
but in another dimension.
You look at the flux between our cell and the top one,
the difference in density between those,
and then you look at the difference in density
a little bit below that.
And that difference of differences
is gonna tell us the net flux of particles
from its neighbors in the top and the bottom.
So all that does to our equation,
if we walk through the same idea
of the difference of differences
and dividing by the spatial unit,
it ends up just meaning that we add
a second derivative of our density function
with respect to y term.
So in that context, we'd be thinking of a density function
that is a function of three different variables
of where you are in the x direction,
where you are in the y direction,
and where you are in time.
So using partial derivatives here
is just a way to kind of tip your hat at the fact
that there are multiple different things
that might change that row.
And then very similarly,
if we were doing this in three dimensions,
you would also have to consider the change in flux
across the boundaries kind of in and out of space
as you go.
And this idea here of adding together
a bunch of second derivative terms
actually comes up commonly enough
that there's compact notation for it.
We write it as a upside down triangle squared
of our density function, row.
And the reason we write it that way
is because you can also think of it as being the divergence,
so kind of this upside down triangle dot
of the gradient of row.
And even though it's kind of a mouthful to say
and even a lot to write down,
this entire expression is essentially saying
how different is a given point in space from its neighbors?
If the value of row at neighboring points of space
tends to be higher than it is
at a particular point in space,
that's when this Laplacian,
this sum of second partial derivatives
in all the directions is gonna tend to be positive.
And in the context of the diffusion equation,
that could kind of make sense.
If all of your neighbors
tend to have more particles than you do,
your rate of change of density is gonna be positive.
You're gonna be gaining more from your neighbors
than you're losing to them.
And again, there's kind of a nice way
to visualize all of this.
This operator where we're adding up
all of the different second partial derivative terms
is known as the Laplacian.
And here's one way that you can think about it
in terms of the graph of a function.
So here I've got a function
where the input is two dimensional.
It's got X and Y coordinates.
And then the output is just a number.
So we're graphing it above.
And one way to think about this Laplacian
is to say, look at all of the neighboring points
around a given point.
Consider the value of the function
at those neighboring points.
And if the average value of the function
at those neighboring points
tends to be higher than the center point,
that's when the Laplacian is positive.
And on the flip side, if that average value
tends to be lower, that's where the Laplacian is negative.
And again, in talking about something like diffusion,
it should make sense that an operator like this
would arise because if at a given point,
things are more dense around you,
you'll tend to become more dense.
But if they're less dense around you,
then you'll tend to become less dense.
Okay, so there are a couple of last things
that I wanna bring up before wrapping things up here.
First of all, this effect that I've described
of the molecular diffusion that's based
just on the random walks of the molecules themselves
and the statistics at play there
is actually a relatively small effect
when it comes to looking at the overall diffusion
in a gas.
Most of it ends up coming from larger scale phenomena,
like the turbulent flows that you'll get.
And that's the kind of thing that arises
once you start considering how these molecules
interact with each other and all of the really hairy
nonlinear complexities that are involved in that.
But the main thing I actually wanna highlight
is this kind of interesting dual nature
to the interplay between discrete models
and continuous models.
So here I showed how we can get this continuous model
for diffusion that arises from a really simple
discrete setup.
But what's funny is then when we go
and we actually use this diffusion equation
to model things like climate or whatever else,
we find ourselves using computers to discretize
what was originally described continuously.
So a simple equation like this one,
you actually can solve it exactly.
You can get into Fourier series and stuff like that
to get a nice perfect exact solution
to the continuous setup.
But most differential equations,
especially partial differential equations,
you can't solve directly.
So what you do is you get the computer
to discretize space and to discretize time
and just take different steps changing the function
according to the rule described by the differential equation,
which leaves us with this kind of funny situation
where we have something that we took pains
to take the discrete setup
and then turn it into a continuous one.
And then by the time we actually start doing something
meaningful and physical with it,
we just turn it right back into a discrete one.
You'll see the details for how this plays out
in the main lecture today.
But the final thought that I just wanna leave you with
is that when you're thinking of these discretizations
of a differential equation,
pixelating it, approximating it,
it's not just a matter of giving us
better conceptual understanding,
but it also directly maps onto the way
that these differential equations
are often handled in practice
once you get to the computational aspect of it.
