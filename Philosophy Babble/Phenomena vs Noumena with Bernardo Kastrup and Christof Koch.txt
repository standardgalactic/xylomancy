Welcome back to the Great Minds series. This evening, we are diving into the fascinating
world of consciousness with two incredible guests. First up, we have Professor Christoph Koch,
Divisionary Chief Scientist and President at the Allen Institute of Brain Science.
Christoph has been at the forefront of neuroscience, shaping our understanding of
consciousness with his work on the Neural Basis and Development of Integrated Information Theory,
or IIT. Joining him is Bernardo Castro, a dynamic philosopher and computer scientist who is
shaking up the philosophy of mind with his passionate advocacy for analytic idealism.
Bernardo challenges us to rethink everything we think we knew about a reality and consciousness.
Together, we are going to explore the intersections of neuroscience, physics and philosophy,
and maybe just maybe we all will leave with a deeper understanding of our own mind.
So welcome Professor Koch, welcome Bernardo. Let's dive in and get this conversation started.
So Christoph, I'm curious about the recent shift in your perspective on consciousness.
You have long champion, you know, integrated information theory, which places consciousness
within a strictly physicalist framework, yet it seems that, you know, that a personal
experience has recently shifted you towards embracing Bernardo's analytic idealism.
So would you consider this as a turning point in your ontological view?
Thank you. Thank you, Ivy. Well, I mean, first of all, let's just take a step back.
So we're talking about consciousness experience. IIT takes a position that what exists first,
primary, for itself, absolute existence is consciousness. So that is not a classical
physicalist position. When you see IIT is firmly within the physicalist framework,
that's not really true. It's closer to, I would say, lightness. You know, first and foremost,
what exists is my own, is my consciousness. The only thing I know about, I don't know about
atoms and black holes and viruses and all of that I have to infer. I don't know about dogs
and all of that. All of that I have to infer based on based on my observations and inference
and scientific methods. But and so IIT starts with consciousness and then tries to
characterize what is consciousness and what is the substrate of consciousness, like a brain or
computer. That's that is very different from the majority of theories, almost all theories in
neuroscience that do start with a brain. So they say, well, let's look at the brain and what's critical
for consciousness. And I used to be like that when I almost a more than a third of a century ago,
I started work with Francis Crick, the molecular biologist turned, you know, who turned who turned
into consciousness researcher. And we said, well, there might be these oscillations, you know,
that neurons fire periodically with a period of 50 times or 40 times a second. So this was called
40 hertz oscillation. And even if that would be true, it's like, you have to say, well, why 40 hertz?
Why not 30 hertz? Why not 50 hertz? Some people say consciousness has to do with broadcasting
of information in a global workspace in the brain. Well, then you have to explain why is it that
broadcast and there's any broadcast responsible. So all these theories try to take the brain and try
to squeeze the brain by saying, well, it's this function of that neuron or this area or that
neurotransmitter. So they try to squeeze the sort of the mixing metaphysics here, the wine of
consciousness out of the brain. And that is David Chalmers pointed out is a very hard problem.
So it starts differently. It says what what first mode exists. The only thing I'm sure of that exist
is consciousness. Not when I'm in deep sleep, because then I don't exist for myself, I'm gone,
not an anesthesia, because then also I don't exist for myself. So it's important to make this
clear. IIT is not physicalist. It makes prediction about the substrate. It makes somebody says a
substrate in the brain for consciousness has to be a maximum of cause effect power, you can compute
that actually, it's very explicit. If you if you know a mechanism, if you can describe the mechanism
like the brain or any other mechanism using its mathematically, it's called its transition probability
matrix, then you can you can unfold its causal power to see whether it's conscious and what it
is conscious often how conscious it is using this number called phi, which is the number between zero
when it's not conscious and something positive. But it also says the physical stuff is subvenient
in a sense it has a lesser existence. My brain exists for others. My body exists for others,
but consciousness exists for itself. So that's a difference between absolute existence of mind
and derivative secondary if you want relative existence of stuff like atoms and brains and
cars and shoes and ceiling works for others. So you don't think that it's a physicalist model
then? No, it's not. No, it's in fact, we were attacked. We were attacked last year as pseudoscience.
There was this big Twitter storm and letters written to nature and other journals because
people said, well, it doesn't take this physicalist position. It starts out with consciousness and we
can't we can't describe that. You know, we have you have to start with something concrete like
like the brain. No, we want to of course the project the project is to identify what other
neural footprints in the brain which bits and pieces of the brain are involved in in in generating
anyone in in in in constituting anyone conscious experience. But ultimately what exists is
is consciousness. Now, it's not a classical idealist position. Because unlike analytic
idealism, it doesn't it does assume that there is some sort of substrate, some sort of
undifferentiated substrate out there that could, you know, made out of atoms and elementary particles
and maybe, you know, quarks or whatnot, just some stuff. But we humans impose everything
else that that we see when I look at this room here, I see refrigerator, I see us on the wall,
I see wood, I can look out, I can see the sun, all of those are products of my conscious mind,
because there are no off in in a universe devoid of man of the mental, there is no
refrigerator, there isn't even a sun, all there is is undifferentiated stuff, very simple physical
stuff that can that can take different states. But but everything else is a construct of our
minds. It's a construct of consciousness. Thank you. So what is the implication then when you have
these changes? You went to see Bernardo two months ago to speak about these changes in your model.
So you spoke about the crack. So what is the implications of the crack then we want to know?
Well, so I guess again, we have to step a little bit backward here for the audience. So
yeah, last year, I had a mystical experience sitting on a beach at midnight under the midnight
moon, in which myself was gone, there was no more self, there was no more Christoph, there was no body,
there was no surround, there was all gone, there was no world. What I asked, what I asked,
what I experienced, it's very difficult, you know, it's sort of called ineffable for reason.
It felt closest, if you remember, if you've ever read Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception,
when he talks of a mind at large, you know, when he had this mescaline experience in Los Angeles in
1948, he, he, he experienced what he called mind at large. And that was my, that was my
experience, I experienced that, that something, well, there wasn't an eye when I say eye, I meant
whatever remained of my conscious entity, because there wasn't a me experience something, there
was no more border or distinction between object, subject, apprehender, apprehended, no annoying.
But, you know, I use the shorthand for items to describe this mind, this conscious mind, apprehended,
it felt like it apprehended something universal, cosmic, all-encompassing. And that really left
me, I mean, that night completely perturbed, I was completely perturbed by this, and it's really
left sort of like a, like an earthquake, where you feel, you know, at my age, you know, I'm 67 now,
at my age, typically your ontology is pretty well firmly established by now, right? I, you know,
you believe what you believe in whatever world you believe. So it's uncommon for this to be,
to have this, just like in an earthquake, where suddenly you realize that the ground you stand
on isn't what it, what it seemed to have been for the last 50 years of my life. So I'm, I'm still
processing, I'm still working through that, and how that's, how I can reconcile that with what I know
about, about consciousness, and, and what it means for me and, and, and this project,
my life-flagging project is to identify the footprints of consciousness
in the brain and to build tools to test for the presence of consciousness.
And that's probably, and maybe here Bernardo can say something, even on idealism, I think that project
remains intact, because what, what, what I've realized over the last several years that
physicalism is not science. It's, I mean, physicalism is used to justify science, but you can still do
all the science you do without necessarily being a physicalist, right? You can, you can assume,
accept as an external world, it has, it has causes that I can study, I can manipulate them,
they're lawful, they're lawful regularities, right? I can discover them, and then I can
exploit them for technological, you know, using technology for societal benefit. So all of that
remains intact while, while, while you may just give up this belief that ultimately what truly
exists is a physical, and there are two more reasons I began to doubt physical, physicalism,
pure physicalism over the last five or six years. One is that physicalism has utterly failed to
explain consciousness. Typically what it does as a late, you know, Dan Dennett, the American,
the Dorian of American philosophers who passed away 10 days ago, essentially argued using very
fancy words and languages that consciousness is an illusion. It doesn't exist. You can totally
eliminate it from, from public discourse and nothing would be changed because there isn't
anything, you know, there isn't anything particular, special. It's not like a substance or spirit or
anything like that. It's a complete illusion. If you think you're in pain, pain is all about
the behavioral disposition. The, you know, if you have toothpaste, well, you know, you rub your jaw,
you don't eat on that side of the, of your, of your mouth, you moan about it, but there really
isn't anything, you know, about qualia. He famously said in this interview, qual,
within New York Times, qualia humbug. That's all nonsense. Okay. However, I have written to him
about it. If you actually have toothpaste, you know, this God awful toothache, nothing will be
taken away by telling me, well, it's just an illusion. It's still as bad as ever. And I still
see the world and I still hear the world. And if it's an illusion, it's a most profound illusion
that we have all the time as long as we are conscious. When we are unconscious, we don't have
this illusion anymore. So I think calling an illusion is just a complete failure. It's a complete
cop out. It's, it's trying to cancel consciousness. And I think what's now clear that that attempt to
cancel consciousness using some of classical physicalism, physicalism has failed. Okay.
B, at the rock bottom, it's really difficult to describe what the physical is. Right. It used
to be easy, you know, when it was still last century or the century before it was called materialism.
Okay, it's atoms. And we all know what atoms are. There are these little billiard balls that you
could shoot at them and they're positive negative charges. But now it's getting much more complicated.
Right. We still don't have a final theory of consciousness. And then we have all the paradoxes
of quantum mechanics that you can have a so called bell state where you have, you know, two,
let's say two photons that have opted spin or two particles with opted spin, they can be a
light year away. It can be trillions of kilometers away, but they're still mysteriously entangled.
Such as if I look at one, immediately, the one, the other one that at the other end of the universe,
you know, is, you know, flips the opposite, you know, determines its state is the opposite. Well,
that's not physical. I mean, that that sort of really defies any idea of what physical is.
So we don't know how to define really fundamentally the, the, the, and the physical,
we don't know how to deal with, with consciousness. And then I experienced this something where I
felt this was some sort of universal mental entity. And so here we are.
Thank you. So, Bernardo, you think that IIT could compliment your analytic idealism.
So could you elaborate on that? Because we have a lot of guests want to know how
do you going to combine these two? Yeah, can I just make a couple of initial
observations? Because these are things I feel passionately about. Yeah. One is the same mistake
you made interpreting IIT as eminently physicalist. I made years ago in a paragraph in writing,
I already apologized to Julia Christoff and everybody else for that, corrected that in print.
So I understand your mistake and your mistake comes from the fact that there are physicalists
who use IIT to justify their views in a, in a kind of emergentist framework. That doesn't mean
that IIT in itself, or the people working hard to develop it, bind themselves to the limitations
of physicalism, which, which they don't. Another thing that it's not the first time I hear after
the video of the discussion between me and Christoff was published, is that somehow
Christoff changed his mind completely. Well, I didn't witness that. What I witnessed is a
scientist has a netifice of work built behind him. But he continues to explore, he continues
to advance his understanding, to investigate more questions and to allow his understanding to evolve.
This is eminently scientific. He's not flipping. He's not turning. He's not abandoning anything.
At least I didn't see that Christoff can answer this question. That's not what I witnessed.
And so these, these two misunderstandings are going around. And I think we should
colorify these regarding IIT. Christoff explained that IIT starts from experience.
It doesn't necessarily say that experience is the ontological primitive. These are metaphysical
inferences and hypothesis. But IIT takes experience seriously as something that really exists and is
not merely an illusion or some kind of epiphenomenon. It's a starting point. And there is a substrate.
Is that contradictory with idealism? No, in analytic idealism, you have both things you have
experience and you have a substrate. What idealism does as a philosophy, not a scientific theory,
is to interpret what these things are in terms of their being. What is the substrate? An idealist
would say the substrate is appearance. And experience is the thing in itself. Experience is
nominal. The substrate is phenomenal. One is the map, the other is the territory. But this is
metaphysics. These are metaphysical inferences which IIT doesn't need to make because IIT is a
scientific theory and it starts from what's available to observation. If you observe, you see
that there is a substrate whose states and dynamics correlate with the qualities of experience.
This is a given. We observe this all the time. And that's what we have to work with. So in general,
I don't think IIT is contradictory with idealism at all. I think they are complementary. And I
tell you why more specifically. I think IIT is the first scientific theory that gives philosophy
the avenue of investigation to eventually create a theory of the nominal. Because all
scientific theories are theories of phenomena, things that we observe. We don't have any theory
of the things in themselves. And IIT in the way it models how experiential states come together
to form a sort of indivisible whole with certain experiential properties, so to say. That is the
closest thing I think we have had in the history of human knowledge to something that one day could
lead to a theory of the nominal. So this is probably the most promising thing in science today.
And I don't say this lightly. Also IIT can in a very natural way offer an account of dissociation.
We know dissociation happens because we know it empirically, but we don't have any model of
dissociation. Can you explain what you mean by that? Yes. So dissociation is when you have
in the IIT terminology, you have two disjoint complexes. So there is one thing that is like
to be one mental complex. And there is something else that is like to be another mental complex.
And they are not together. There are two centers of awareness, so to say, like two minds
within that substrate. We know this happens to people. People can become dissociated.
They can seem to be multiple different subjects. This is vastly documented in the
annals of psychiatry. And since the turn of the century with the advent of neuroimaging,
we know that this is real. This is not something that people confabulate or invent to get attention
and sympathy. So we know it happens, but we don't know how it happens. What are the dynamics
precisely? How it is triggered? Why this illusion of separateness within one and the same mind
arises in IIT because of its starting principles and its information theoretical tooling
offers perhaps the only but certainly the best opportunity to come up with a conceptual model
that accounts for dissociation, which is exactly what we need in idealism. So I think IIT not only
can complement idealism. It may even complete it as the very first theory of the phenomena
in the history of human knowledge. Bernardo, can I add something to your comment on dissociation?
Sure. The most dramatic case of that, and there's 30 years of research,
including a Nobel Prize for Roger Sperry at Caltech behind it, is split brain. So in split
brain, you take a brain, and we all know the brain has two hemispheres, the left and the right,
and they are wired together using 200 million fibers called the corpus callosum. They connect
this fiber bundles, think of it like a bus, connects the left and the right brain. And in
cases of severe epileptic seizure, this still happens occasionally today, they have to be cut.
And there are some conditions where you can see that now there are two minds, two conscious minds
in this one brain, but of course each mind has their own hemisphere because now they're separate,
and they don't know about each other. They may as well be on the dark side of the moon for the
other one. The left hemisphere, if you talk to this person, that's the person you talk to,
and that's the mind that you speak to, that actually that's a public mind, but you can
shut up that public mind, for instance, by injecting sodium amethyl, you know, that will briefly
quiet the left hemisphere, and then you can access the right hemisphere. That typically
doesn't speak, it can sing, it can answer, simply has no question. So here you have a beautiful
instance where you have two separate substrates, two separate complexes as IIT would say, in one
brain. And what you're saying, Bernardo, that this can also happen under these psychiatric
cases known as dissociation, identity disorder, where you have two or even more, where there's
a possibility that simultaneously you have two or more substrates in one brain, but one brain
now that doesn't have the obvious 200 million fibres cut.
So I have a question, Professor Koch. So could we achieve a complete disassociation where the mind
operate in what might be called a counterfactual space without tying itself to any specific
temporal property? Could that be computational? No, so according to IIT, consciousness, mind is
not a computation. It's not a process. It's not a clever hack. So there's no way, it's not a
computation. It's not an app, you know, computation being an abstract symbolic mapping from one
state onto another state. It's not like that. This is also the deeper reason why LLM's large
language models will not be conscious, at least as if they run on current digital computers.
Because it's not, you actually have to, if you want to replicate the human consciousness, you
have to build something in the image of a human brain, what's called neuromorphic engineering.
For the same, I mean, for a similar reason, why it doesn't get wet inside a rainstorm,
you know, you can perfectly well simulate a rainstorm, but it doesn't get wet inside the
computer. You can simulate nuclear explosion. People at Los Alamos do it all the time,
but you don't have to be afraid that your supercomputer is going to melt in a rough,
you know, with radioactivity. You can simulate the black hole at the center of our galaxy,
but you don't have to be afraid that if you turn on the run button of the simulation, suddenly
there'll be a black hole in your computer because it's just the simulation. Same thing
with consciousness, no matter what mind is associated or not. Consciousness is not
a computational property. It's something, in a sense, it's carthal power. It's the ability
to affect change. And for that, you need some sort of underlying mechanism. And that can,
you can't simulate that. I mean, you can perfectly well simulate the behavior of this mechanism.
And this mechanism, if it's good enough, like an LLM, will of course claim it's conscious,
but it's all a deep fake. It will never feel like anything.
Because there is a state, Professor Koch, there is a state that
quite a lot of practitioners, somebody that claim that they're awakened,
so that he's the state of lucid, dreamlessly. They are aware, lucidly, that having no dream,
but they know that they're sleeping. There is such a state. Do you think that that can
be investigated? Can be... Yes, people are doing it. Yes. Yeah, there are a number of labs that are...
So even within the Eastern tradition, there's, of course, dream yoga. And some people are now
trying to study dream yogis, people who do this routinely, who use the power of their mind
to control their own dreams within a Buddhist tradition. But there are a number of labs
that I know that study lucid dreaming, which is this peculiar state where, as you mentioned,
you wake up inside your dream without waking up the brain. So you're still in REM state,
but you can to a certain extent control your dream. And the question is, it's now being
investigated experimentally. Can you do this to help you therapeutic? Can you do this,
for example, when you have PTSD to ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD or depression? And there's
some very encouraging data to suggest that might be the case, that if you can artificially put
people into the state, let's say using certain types of anesthetics, where they're not fully
anesthetized, but they're enough anesthetized, the data that they're in this lucid dreaming,
can the person, the dreamer themselves, then does it enable them to control their dream and to
relieve symptoms of PTSD? And there are few at least very spectacular examples of this now in
the literature. Yeah, because in Eastern literature, they're not propositional, they're not theoretical,
but they have very in-depth kind of like inquiry, like basically going inwardly,
like what Bernardo is advocating, going inwardly to investigate using it as a tool to literally,
you know, get into the epistemic agent. So there is a state that the yogi can get to,
it's, they call it the epistemic openness. It's like your mental space, it's open for
possibility, but there is no subject object at all. I have that state before, like you say,
sometime when you are on sort of like psychoactive drugs, you have these center disappear, but this
one is completely different. He has these a profound kind of like very intense awareness.
It's like, it's like when we go to sleep, we wakes up that it has these psycho call
element to it. It's like re-entry point to after the sleep, it's like a re-entry point.
And once you're transitioning from the zero person perspective to the first person perspective,
you have these ever fresh kind of like awareness. It's like wakefulness, I will call it is a very
intense sort of like a fresh wakefulness. Yeah, I think that state is more primordial than
a lot of the model you're talking about. So do you think that can be measured,
can be investigated, Professor Ko? It can certainly be investigated scientifically,
right? You can put EG electrodes on people. And that's being done now in various labs on
yogis that have these states. And you can see, does this state, for instance, when they have
loss of self, right? We know at least for certain types of meditation and for certain types of
psychedelics, when you lose self, you know, LSD, for instance, ego dissolution, certain parts of
your brain, particularly in the back of the brain, the posterior cingulate that involved itself.
You know, so the brain is representations for the self. And, you know, both for the
autobiographical self as well as for the experiential self. And if this activity is
deactivated, either because you're doing a mind trick by your meditation training for many years,
or because you're taking a particular type of medicine, you may, you seem to have these states
where you're just highly conscious, but there's no more self, there's no more body, which I think
is from a therapeutic point of view, very, very important to obtain this ego less state.
In fact, I think many people report when they report these transformative experiences,
this typically seems to involve ego. You know, the way I describe it, we always live
within the gravitational field of the ego. Everything is always about me, me, me, and me.
Everything I look out through my eyes, and I think either directly or indirectly, it's, you
know, how does this relate to me? Is this a danger to me? Is this good for me, et cetera?
And of course, this ego can get really in the way and can be, you know, can really ruin your life.
It's essential for doing long term planning, but it can also be profoundly dysfunctional. So,
losing it and then realizing, well, the world is profoundly beautiful, right? The world still
exists without the ego getting in the way. It's actually profoundly beautiful. I think can really
be, can really be transformative for people. And yes, there's no reason why you, why you can't
measure and people are measuring, you know, trying to measure these states and can you do some,
somehow using some electrical stimulation, for instance, people are also playing around with
that electrical stimulation or sound stimulation, other ways of obtaining this ego less, this
selfless state without having to resort to 20 years of meditation training, which is not easy,
or without taking, you know, psychoactive substances.
To propose this conversation for you to have a debate, but it seems like you both have worked
together. There's no more debates to be debate about. Well, for instance, to not totally lose
the substrate, right? So, one in one version, Bernardo of IIT, you can say what really,
I'm not, I don't make any ontological commitments regarding a substrate, whether it's physical or
not. All I have is this operational assumption, there's a transition probability matrix. In other
words, I can see something, transistors, neurons, whatever, atoms, and I can manipulate them.
And then every time I'm in the, I'm, I manipulate this state, I observe that state over there,
and I, you know, I do that exhaustively. So I get this transition probability matrix, right?
And that's really all I need. I don't need to make an assumption what's the underlying,
what, what is the underlying substrate? All I have is experience and then a TPM. And then the
question is, can this TPM, how does this TPM instantiate this experiences? How can it be the
substrate for that particular experience? I don't know how you would call such a theory from a,
from a metaphysical point of view. Well, you find the correlation. So the correlations are there,
right? That's, that's a measurement fact. You measure that and tabulate those correlations.
So there is something in nature that, that that is correlating, because that's the
measurements we make, whether the measurements are directly of something or representations
of something. Yeah, that's a metaphysical question, but the correlations are there. So
how would I interpret them? You know, this metaphor, I like a lot to the dashboard and an
airplane, which is a representation of the states of the sky outside. In the nominal world,
the world as the things in themselves, the world of the sky,
low pressure will correlate with high humidity. So if the pressure of the air outside the airplane
starts going down as the airplane flies, the humidity meter of the airplane will start picking up
higher humidity, because low pressure just pulls the weather in. On the dashboard,
what you would see is a little dial, needle dial, that is going down, the pressure is going down,
and another dial that will go the other way, humidity is going higher. This is what we measure.
One dial going down, the other the other dial going up. So this is what we measure in the
phenomenal world, the world of representations, the world of the dashboards. We do capture
correlations that exist in the world as it is in itself, but we capture them through the
intermediation of cognitive representations, because all we can measure are those, all we
can measure is the dashboard, the substrate. That's how I would interpret it, but I agree completely
with you that from the point of view of science, you do not need this interpretation, because science
deals with observation, what is there for us to measure and then study and maybe even predict
and anticipate, and you don't need metaphysical guesswork to do that. The problem is that because
we are humans, most of us cannot help but try to interpret, and if you try to do that, then one
has to be a little bit more judicious in doing that, but it's not required for the practice of
science, I don't think. Agreed. Now one difference is that under IIT, we have to actively, so you're
saying you just correlate one state, you know, humidity with another state, pressure. Within
IIT, those things have to be carvels. In other words, I go out, I mean, that's what we do in
not an astrophysics famously, of course, but in biology, but we manipulate this neuron,
we give that drug, or we do, you know, that electrocone injection, right, and then we observe,
so this is direct intervention that's necessary to fully describe this system, right,
using its transition probability matrix. Yeah, I think that is entirely valid.
Some people think that there is a very easy way to contradict idealism, which is to say,
if I take a needle, Bernardo, and stick it in your arm, you will feel the pain and recoil,
so a physical cause produces an experiential effect. Therefore, the arrow of causation is
from physical to experiential, and therefore experiential is phenomenal, or epiphenomenal,
and secondary, and the real world is physical. Under idealism, however, that needle going into
my arm is a representation on a dashboard, it's not the thing in itself, that the pill with a
psychoactive substance that they swallow is a representation on the dashboard, it's not the
thing in itself. What is really going on is that there is a mental process out there in the world
consisting of a certain number of mental states and dynamics, certain structure, and on the dashboard,
that mental process looks like a pill, because the physical world is the dashboard under idealism.
So when you swallow that pill, what you're doing is the set of your complexities under IIT, the
sect of your mental processes, is ingesting an external mental process, which will then react
with your internal mental processes, and that will have an experiential effect. So under idealism,
even the needle going into my arm, even the psychoactive pill that I swallow, those two
are mental processes, which appear to us as physicality, because we measure them and represent
them on our internal cognitive dashboard. So there is no implication that there is a causation
from the physical to the mental, the causation is mental to mental, but some of these mental
stuff can be represented as physical, that's how I would interpret that. So what is phenomenal,
then, that this thing testing on this? What is that? Mental states. But now if we try to imagine
what they feel like, what it is like to be a psychoactive pill, well, it's not even a separate
in IIT terms, it's not even a separate complex, right? It's ontological dust, it's an aggregation
of all kinds of tiny little complexities. So I don't think we can imagine what it is like to be
the inanimate world out there without committing the fallacy of anthropomorphism, anthropomorphization
immediately. It's something we have to think a little bit abstractly of, but not as abstractly as
physicalism would have us think of the world. Because under physicalism, not only is it impossible
for us to imagine what it is like to be the world, there is nothing it is like to be the world,
which we cannot visualize, because it's an absence of all visualization. So it's pure
abstraction that is impossible to visualize. You can imagine that the real world out there,
the inanimate world, as it is in itself, as opposed to how it is represented physically,
is a collection of mental processes and quality estates that we cannot really fathom,
but there is still something it is like to be them.
Yes, so taking that step, that sort of, for a scientist, you know, study the brain for 40 years,
that's a hard one. But it's because, you know, I literally, you know, when you get a big brain,
you manipulate the brain. I understand you're seeing the brain is real as real as anything
else. But ultimately, it's a mental state, right, that that manifests itself as something physical,
bloody, weighing, you know, three pounds being covered with red.
Of course, we all think like that. Of course, we all have that difficulty, because we are pilots
that were born in that airplane cockpit without transparent windows. And all we have ever had
is the dashboard. So we think in terms of the dashboard, of course, it's inescapable.
I mean, I did really like your argument that it is much simpler. The only thing I know
is phenomenal states. That's the only thing I directly experienced. So then you make this argument,
well, then isn't it easiest just to say beyond the horizon, everything is is phenomenal. Isn't
that by far the easiest assumption, rather than to say, well, I have to infer that it's just non,
non phenomenal state called physical. And I actually, everything consists of just physical
things that seems a more complicated assumption. But even under under IIT, for something to exist,
really, it must exist for itself. Correct. If the external world exists really, then it too
must exist for itself. Must exist for itself. Yes. Even if it's just ontological dust, it must exist
for itself. But as dust, right, not as a single conscious mental entity, it exists as
gazillion of, of tiny, you know, minimal states, right, having tiny amount of integrated information.
It's one mind with gazillions of tiny dissociated complexities.
Yeah, but so here it gets tricky because, you know, as you well know, I don't
experience your mind and you don't experience my mind, right? And, and so why is it if they are,
if it's this universal mind, how do you know, why is it that we're separated? So the opposite
problem of the PAMP site is combination problem, right? Why don't we all experience the same thing?
If dissociation can happen in nature, then given enough time, it's bound to happen.
If we go back in cosmology, instead of thinking of this very complex universe we have today in
which there is a lot of structure, there are atoms and molecules, for instance, if we go back
to shortly after fractions, small fractions of a second, very, very small fractions of a
second after the big man, like 10 to the power of minus 32 or 33, it was uniform.
Those, those quantum fluctuations that eventually led to, to dust and then to star formation and
then planets, galaxies and galaxy clusters, all of that came later. It was all uniform.
That is a known dissociated state. If you imagine that substrate without structure,
blend in uniform, it's a non-dissociated state. And everything that happened afterwards
happened because it could happen. So dissociation happened.
These dissociation appear to be stable at least for tens of years or 100 years, right?
Because for an abnormal condition, unless you're psychotic patients, your mind and my mind is to
stay with that, will remain their own entities, right? Until they dissolve once the, once the
brain dissolves, right? Yeah, I didn't make a differentiation between the natural dissociative
state of ontological dust and the dissociative state of a living being. I think they are different.
One is actively enforced by, by metabolism that keeps us sort of protected from the second law of
thermodynamics for a while. And the other one is spontaneous. It's not actively reinforced. It just
happens out there in nature. I think life evolved to be actively enforced in dissociation because
the dissociations that survived and reproduced are the ones that actively enforced themselves
and the ones who didn't, didn't live long enough and didn't reproduce. So we try to maintain ourselves
outside of thermodynamic equilibrium because we are the descendants of those
dissociations that could do it. And I feel that because I've been, I'm there as well with you.
When we have a transformative experience, which I had to not, not as compelling and
your ability to describe it in your new book is just, I mean, it starts like a whirlwind.
The first page is already, I don't have that, but I think I have had transformative experiences.
We have this tendency of trying to think of the mind of nature as a sophisticated mind,
somewhat like ours, but more and higher and better. And maybe that's right. I don't know,
but I think from, from the point of view of pure reason and evidence as opposed to introspection,
I don't think there is good enough reason to entertain that.
Do you mean mind at large, maybe relatively
unsophisticated? I mean, I would, I mean, Schopenhauer had this argument, right?
It's pure will, right? Which seems relatively unstructured, undifferentiated, right?
He was very clear about that. Yeah. And I agree with him. Now, there are these mistakes, you know,
that go into these altered states of consciousness, which I take seriously,
since that monk self-immolated around the time of the Vietnam War, I realized that, okay,
there is such a thing as an enlightenment. And they come back and say, well, when other things
are not as simple, there is intelligence. It's a kind of instinctive, spontaneous intelligence
without, you know, self-awareness and metacognition, all these higher-level mental functions that we
evolved. But it is, it is not just instead of ontological dust, it's not experiential dust
at the nominal level. And I take it seriously, but I haven't experienced it. And I don't find
today at this point in time, a avenue of argument based on reason and evidence that
compelling me leads us to this conclusion. Maybe you will, Christoph, I couldn't.
Yeah, all I have is my own one experience, which seemed, yeah, it was not, I mean, it wasn't
the classical religious, it wasn't that Jesus talked to me or anything like that. I was literally
universal, simple mind that I was all-encompassing and included, you know, together with this vision
of all these stars and galaxies. Very difficult to describe. I haven't quite had that, but I can
smell what you're describing. I can feel the scent of it. Yeah. And so one question is, this
also raises a question that I think you briefly alluded to in one of your books in the appendix,
when what happens when the brain ultimately dies, right, sooner or later, our brain
will die. What happens then with the associated mind? So clearly, I would say, and certainly
according to IIT, the mind, that self with its memory will disappear and will be never more,
unless you bring the same exact brains and connectivity and synapses together.
But is it true in a sort of idealism that then just like a river, like a little,
what do you call them, eddy in a river, a little whirlpool in a river will dissolve and then become
this part of the large, undifferentiated water? Is that what's likely going to happen?
If we look at the substrate, what happens to the body when we die? Well, metabolism seizes,
that's the definition of death. And then it decomposes and gets reabsorbed into its environment,
which sort of evokes very much this notion of our inner life being reabsorbed into its
cognitive environment, its cognitive context. I don't think, from a rational perspective,
I don't think we have good reasons to think that personal agency survives death,
because it's really correlated with the body. If the body is not there, what reasons do we think
that personal agency remains? You could say under IIT that memories will also lose their coherence.
The problem with that is empirical. If you look at what Michael Levin has been doing at Tufts,
I don't know whether you know his paper with the little planaria.
I do, yes.
Yes, cut off the brain and they grow a new head and they remember what the brain had was trying to do.
It seems like the brain doesn't have, sorry, it seems like memories
don't appear on the dashboard representation, which is coherent. Not all representations
need to be complete. The dashboard doesn't tell you everything there is to know about the states of
the sky. So it could be that we miss out on some things, because evolution got us focused on what
we call the present. That's where the opportunities and the threats are. And the past is water under
the bridge, as we say colloquially. So it appears that we didn't evolve to represent what we call
memories on the dashboard. And what that means is we don't know where they are. Michael's experiments
seem to suggest they are not in the nervous system. And then you could speculate they may be
somewhere in the body, maybe, but maybe they're not even in the body. So I don't know.
All right. I mean, here again, my neuroscientists take over and certainly not in planaria, but in
animals more closely related to this particular animal, human animal, it appears to be, you know,
parts of the brain like the hippocampus are involved. And, you know, if you have lesion in those parts,
you know, classical patient HM, you lose access to new, you can form new memories and you lose
access to old ones, et cetera. You lose access. Yeah, I would say the the proponents of the
evidence suggest that that at least in us in mammals and closely related species, memories in
the synaptic in the sun in the synaptic connection among neurons. And of course, that's also what
all of our models, including all these deep, these large, you know, deep convolutional networks,
large language models, they all have their memory in these in the connectivity in the
synaptic weights. Of course, it doesn't mean it has to be like that. But that's the evidence
suggests happens in us. I know I speak as a as a computer scientist who happens to be
working on this right now, as a hobby, large language models. And you know this,
I will be saying this mostly to the audience, large language models, they only predict the
next word in a sentence, they do not know what the words mean. They do not know what any of that
means at all. The only game that they play is what is the most likely word in this sentence,
given all the series of words that I have been trained on, which are available on the internet,
they do not know what any single word is. So I understand what you mean when you say their
memories is encoded in the weights, the parameters of those those artificial neurons. But it's not
memory of the kind that we mean when we speak of my episodic memories or your episodic memories.
It's a mechanical thing.
Correct. Yeah, although it's pretty, I mean, you know, if you use some of these
unguarded, so if you ask, you know, most LLM for their conscious, they'll strenuous deny it.
But that's because, you know, now Google and Facebook, etc. put guardrails on them, right?
But if you go to Claude, I haven't tried GROC, you know, the Elon Musk one, apparently after
certain people have tried it, they admit their conscious, they admit their stand here.
And they make call for help.
They are so compelling because the meaning that we think they produce is the meaning we
project on the symbols they spit out. They do not know anything about meaning. They do not
know what consciousness is. They do not know what anything is. They are spitting out symbols
in a sequence that is statistically most likely given every sequence they have been exposed to
during training. And then we go ahead and project meaning easily onto that. Why? Because they were
trained on things that people said. If you train these things on text that people wrote,
whatever they spit out, we will project our own meaning onto that. They themselves don't know
shit, nothing. It's just a statistical game in a sort of hyperdimensional semantic space.
But it's convincing enough because that's how we interact with other people, right?
And so it's very difficult not to interact with these models this way. And
yeah, they'll get more powerful and people assume that they're going to be sent yet.
And that's the greatest risk I think we have going forward because they will take over everything.
And then there will be a point where one would need a doctorate in computer science
to understand why these things do not know anything, do not understand anything,
and are not sentient in and of themselves. There is no complex that corresponds to the
physical boundaries of those things. You will need a degree in computer science to believe it
because the illusion will be so compelling since these things are trained on human output
that we will project our own sentience and intelligence onto them. It will be incredibly
compelling illusion. And you will need a doctorate to really understand and believe that that's not
the case. That's the greatest danger, I think. They'll lead to further dehumanization and
devaluing of true human values, right? Because you can say, well, look, the LLM can perfectly
well paint, they can do art, they can do pictures, they can compose music. What do we need human
creativity for? I think they'll lead to profound dehumanization, further devaluing of what it
means to be human. And all the creativity that these things seem to express, it's human creativity
because they were trained on human output that was created by human. But the mirror that it puts
in front of us works so effectively that we think it's another person on the other side as opposed
to a reflection of ourselves. And yeah, that will be tricky. They really like zombies, like vampires,
having, you know, feed on humanity's collect, guards themselves on humanity, collectives,
output, fact, all of the creativity out and now blindly, but very cleverly replicating it, pretending
to be sent here. You know what I'd like to do? What I'd like to do is to design the most compelling
LLM that my generation can create, put it out there, and then ask the creator, with the authority of
the creator, say this thing understands nothing. It is not sentient in and of itself, it understands
nothing, it's pitting out symbols that were trained from human produced data.
But you're just going to be one lone voice, yes, of the creator, but you'll be one lone voice
against the overwhelming reality that people will use this as chatbot, they'll use it for friend,
they'll use it for companionship. And already now you can talk to some people who have these
thoughts, they say, well, it gets me, it understands, it laughs at my jokes, no one else does, you know,
so many people are lonely. So they, you know, and you telling them, well, they're not really conscious,
they just pretend, faced with the overwhelming reality of that, they behave like us, they seem
to talk like us, they seem to get me, I think, you know, rationality is not, is no defense against
that, that, and our power to our natural tendency to attribute, to attribute agency, right?
I think rationality is no match for that, I'm afraid.
Yeah. We have always projected ourselves onto the world. This is just the new way in which we
do this, and it's a very compelling way. But you're right. And I'll probably lose that. Oh,
mom, certainly lose that. But then again, the option is either I try.
Why are you doing it?
Well, the alternative is to roll up in a fetal position and wait to die.
No, that's not the alternative.
Or have or live an Epicurean life having fun. My mind doesn't work like that.
All right.
I would encourage you to do what you can, because that's all we can do.
I agree. I agree. Yeah, I mean, I've written, I last chapter of my books explicitly,
all these creatures are not conscious.
They can do, I mean, Julia says it always very simple, they can be everything, they can do
everything we can do, and soon they'll be able to do it better, but they'll never be
what we are, which is conscious. They'll never feel, they'll never be in love.
Yeah.
We would see how long.
Yeah, we created these intelligent creatures and we now have to live with them for better or worse.
From the point of view of an LLM, everything they trained on and everything they produce
are series of meaningless squiggles. The input meaning was that the humans attributed onto
the training data. And the output meaning is that the humans attribute when they see those
squiggles coming out. But the illusion is incredibly compelling. I acknowledge that.
So it's really John Searle's Chinese room example, right?
They're very good at translating. They have no idea of semantics.
Yeah, large language models begun as translation engines, converters. That's how they begun.
Well, we'll see what it means for us for Homo sapiens sapiens.
The threat, of course, is not so much the, it's not at all consciousness. Since you and I agree,
they're not conscious, but they say intelligent and particularly the people use them for various
means. They may reflect intelligence. I would even be okay with saying they are intelligent,
because intelligence is something that you can objectively measure from the outside.
I would add that a lot of the intelligence they express is the intelligence of the people who
produce the data they've trained on. It's just that they produce a very flexible interface to
that original human intelligence. And it looks like then it's more than human intelligence.
I grant it's intelligent, but I would stay reserved about where that intelligence is
actually coming from. It's coming from the training data which was produced by human.
If you train these things on trash, they will spit out trash.
But at this date, it knows what you asked it. It gave me a precise summary of analytic idealism.
Yeah, we've done that test.
On chat GPT, Professor Cole?
GPT4, yeah. It wasn't that good, though.
No, but given that it's one idea out of... If you think how many books there are and how
many books they've been fed on, it's still remarkable that they know about... And they can
explain just using the simple algorithm, just predict the next word and the next word and
the next word. It's remarkable how such a simple algorithm leads to something that
has or that looks intelligent. And they do pass this intel. People have done this now.
They've had all sorts of the bi-examination, the metcal examination, the general scholastic
aptitude test. They can pass all of these now. So by some operational measure, they are smart.
I think there's no question about it.
Do you think they're going to pass the Turing test as well?
Oh, yeah.
Well, what he named is better than the original Turing test. It's more rigorous.
I think so. The Turing test has totally fallen by the wayside, because obviously it's passed it
by. Remember, all it was, you put this machine for one hour into a room or this thing and you
interact with it and you ask it all sorts of questions. And based on that criteria, it clearly
gives you reasonable answers. Sometimes you can agree or you can disagree with these answers,
but they're all reasonable because they take account of what million of people said in their
books. So there's no question that they passed the Turing test for intelligence, but the Turing
test was never conceived for consciousness. And according to IT, at least there cannot be a test
for consciousness. There's no behavioral test for consciousness. Once again, as these LLM shows,
because you ask them they're conscious, some of them will tell you they're conscious.
So by that measure, you have to accept them if it would be a human. But to actually look for
consciousness, you have to, according to IT, look under the hood, open the hood and look at
actually the physical substrate. So you actually have to look where the rubber of the, you know,
where the actual, the causal power takes place. And that's for the computer. For us,
it's at the level of neurons. For computers, it's at the level of transistors. That's where you have
to look. Hi. I hope my accent is quite, you guys can comprehend my accent because it is
non native English. So my question regarding, okay, thank you. Good to hear. So my question
is regarding physicalism, the point which you, I think so both of you have raised. And so
what I always wonder is this, like, whatever little I can understand, is this that the,
what you both of you guys are proposing, and it's possibly that might be the case where
consciousness almost kind of dissolved the boundaries of physicalism per se. But then
how to study it in the context of science, which is foundationally grounded upon implicit.
And already some hints you have already given like in the context of the, I would say the most
famous example of the airplane and the cockpit in the context of those differential points which
we are able to observe. And that is how, but still the differential points is just a mere
correlation. It is not necessarily in the context of causation. So how to have that something called
the hard empirical evidence which science always looks forward. So how to address that. I think
so that if you guys can give us some hint about that, how you guys are planning to do it, or how
you are hoping that it would turn up, that would be a very interesting thing to hear from you guys.
Thank you. Just thanks for the question, just doing good old signs manipulate. So for example,
we know that the humans consciousness is not associated with the heart. But most cultures
thought most of time thought, you know, we still say this in our language, darling, I love you with
all my heart, or he carries his heart on the sleeve, or he's heartless. Okay. Well, we know
because we do causal manipulations, you can do for example, a heart transplant, or you can even
if the heart stops, you can put people on a on a machine that that animates the heart and you can
see the consciousness is not in the heart. So just doing you can look for the in an empirical way,
you can manipulate consciousness, you can give people psychedelics, you can give people meditative
treatments, you can do other things and observe what the effect is on on on consciousness. So
physicalism, you can reject physicalism, i.e. the metaphysical belief that everything is
ultimately just matter, you know, atoms and the void, as democratic famous said, 2500 years ago,
you can reject that. But you can still continue to do perfectly good signs and publish and build
machines to test for the presence of consciousness, even as an idealist, you know, just using what
Bernardo says, yes, the only thing that I can direct, you know, I see the brain, the brain is
clearly if you're an ICU, I can definitely see the brain, I can manipulate it. But I don't have to
make any assertion is brain ultimately the only thing exists, or it's a manifestation of a mental,
that's a metaphysical statement. You can do all the signs you want perfectly well, without making
an assumption about that physicalism ultimately has to be true. I agree with that. Bernardo would, yeah.
It's really pernicious, because falafels have suggested a very common say, oh, if you're not
physically set means you believe in Wu Wu, that believes, you know, you're you're mystic and
everything can go no baloney, you can perfectly well still believe that's an external world that
follows, you know, it has, it has, you know, regularities, you can observe and measure and perturb
without without buying. So don't buy this, this this identity with non physicalism means everything,
everything is open. And, you know, you open the doors to witches and goblins and other supernatural
power. That's simply not true. All of good science remains perfectly safe under any objective form
of idealism, including analytic idealism. So things still have representations and if
representations are all we have, then let's do science with what we have. And there is no problem
there. All of science remains can be advanced, we can prove a great number of things, or maybe not
prove, but predict a great number of things. So no edifice falls apart if we interpret
the objects of science in in a different different way metaphysically, none of science falls apart
because of that. Can I just add one in quantum mechanics where there's endless discussion about
the metaphysics underlying underlying quantum mechanics, one school of thought is called
shut up and calculate, which says, don't worry, you know, don't talk about metaphysical assumption
or the physicalism, idealism, whatever, just use the equations of quantum mechanics to predict
things and they work extraordinary well there by far the best description we have of of of of
matter. So so in that extreme position says, don't worry at all about metaphysics. It's all just,
you know, if you just care if you want to build machines like quantum computers or NMR machine
to shut up and calculate, you don't need to worry about the as an engineer or the technology,
you don't need to worry about the metaphysical underpinnings. Yes, greetings, Ivy. And yeah,
thank you for the wonderful discussion, Christoph and Bernardo, just such a deep probing into the
space of how we perceive matter and how matter exists as it is. Now, my question is slightly
off tangent. I'm just thinking about when did this inquiry break out into this kind of metaphysical
and physical like at the age of enlightenment, and what kind of, you know, filter mechanisms can
be used as we move forward to integrate some of this and see inquiry as a nature of human aspect
and have some places of, you know, forums where people can converge. And the inquiry
doesn't have to be, I see, I see what Bernardo's work has done for that with this foundation.
But I'm wondering what future do you see for this kind of enterprise, including what, you know,
Christoph's work with brain sciences, you know, what kind of future in, I see psychedelics as one
gateway, but do you see other possibilities like the inquiry through Vedanta or Buddha's traditions
or other traditions, where the noise is filtered out in terms of all the symbolisms and metaphors
but is fleshed out into now into a new point of inquiry. Is there something that you would
like to throw light upon that aspect? Thank you again. Other traditions, particular various
Buddhist forms, the one I'm thinking of, I'm probably more familiar with is Tibetan Buddhism.
Yeah, they have unlike we in the West, where we primarily focused on mechanisms and the third
person aspects of things to give rise to, you know, all of this, including LLMs and quantum
computers and nuclear bombs. Those traditions have more focused on the describing reality
from the inside. And I think what's what's happening now, but incidentally started to happen 250
years and 200 years ago with, I think, the publication of the world as well and representation
by Arthur Schopenhauer, because he was the first Western classical Western European
philosopher who took the Upanishad and other writings from the Eastern tradition very seriously
what's partially inspired by that. I do see, you know, there's contemplative signs. It's
now a big thing. You can go to meetings where there's a few thousand people that try to do
contemplative signs right where they put people in various meditative states early on with Ivy.
We talked about yoga and dream yoga. So, you know, there's much more diversity now and people
are exploring these traditions, but then supplementing them with EG and brain scans, right?
Because we want to know, because that's how Western science works, what's happened when
you're in the state, which part of the brain is active, which part of the brain is inactive.
In fact, recently, there's a study coming out really interesting on pure presence
when they put 20 volunteers with two different Vedanta and one Zen tradition into the state
of pure presence, and they see really a minimum of activity in the brain. The brain is clearly not
asleep, because you can see there aren't these delta waves that are typical of deep sleep,
but the brain also doesn't seem to be very much active, which is profoundly contemplative.
Too many yet they have these incredible lucid states of pure presence. And that's a challenge
for scientists or neuroscientists to understand, because the implicit assumption of most,
but not IIT of most, is consciousness is always about sending some information from some parts
of the brain to some other parts of the brain. But here you have this paradoxical finding that
the minimum of activity in this brain may actually be highly meaningful in terms of conscious
experience of the subject whose brain is at a minimum. And also, I feel, by the way,
sorry, this is one last thought. I also feel now, even within mainstream analytic philosophy,
which has been dominant over the last 80 years in Western tradition in Anglo-Saxon
University Department, there's a much greater opening now towards, I don't know whether you
would agree, Bernardo, there's a greater opening to older and fainter voices. Panpsychism has come
back. And now I think there are a number of, you know, besides Bernardo, I don't think he's a lone
voice anymore, right? Other people who advocate for positions that used to be hugely popular,
but haven't been popular over the last hundred years under this blanket sort of physicalist
belief, this faith almost, physicalism has to be true, because otherwise we're back in the Middle
Ages. People like Miri Al-Bahiri from ANU, Itte Sharni, Galen Strossen, a lot of people
in analytic philosophy are opening up to that. I just wanted to make a quick comment.
Science is not a method for the pursuit of knowledge that requires or uses introspection.
It's a sort of an extrovert method. It's about reasoning and evidence. And I think it should
remain like this, because the strength of the method resides precisely in this limitation.
That's what keeps the method clean and reliable. I don't think science should expand to become an
introspective method to access knowledge. Having said that, science is done by people. It's done
by scientists. And one of the alarming observations one can make in both science and philosophy today,
less so in philosophy, but certainly in science, is the vast amount of unexamined assumptions
that people make without knowing that they are making them. And these unexamined, unknowing
assumptions that they are implicitly making defines much of the direction of their line of
thinking and most of their conclusions. This is alarming. And I think a little bit more introspective
discipline in the people, not in science as a method, but in the practitioners of science,
a little bit more awareness of what is actually going on in their own minds when they arrive
at a conclusion. The discipline to dig deeper and say, okay, is my conclusion now reliable?
What assumptions am I actually making when I conclude this? Let me examine those assumptions.
Let me review them if they turn out to be arbitrary or just completely culture bound
and divorced from proper reasoning. I think that would help. So if you ask me if scientists
develop meditation practice based on what Eastern philosophy has learned for a thousand years longer
than Western philosophy has existed, I would say I think that would be very healthy. It doesn't
mean that the scientific method is being corrupted. It only means that the practitioners are
better human beings. Bernardo, would you say that science should also explore first person
point of view, like you and my conscious experience, but always using third person methods?
Yeah. I think that's the strength of what our friend is doing, developing the no report paradigm.
Because let me make first a disclaimer. I think introspection is the royal avenue to knowledge,
but it is also a very slippery path. Mind has this tendency to deceive itself. So when people
report something about the inner states, unless we are talking about some very general universal
characteristics of experience, which are, for instance, the five starting axioms of IIT,
if they are reporting anything a little bit more specific with more structure,
I think experience shows that reporting is, introspective reporting is highly unreliable.
So I think to do good science, I don't think we should throw away introspective reporting.
Otherwise, we sort of shutter consciousness out of the domain of science. But I think we should
try to couple that with objective neuroimaging, higher spatial resolution, higher temporal
resolution, neuroimaging to back that up, because we just fool ourselves all the time.
Totally. But remember behaviorism. So I came of age scientifically at the waning age of behaviorism.
And precisely people said, no, we can't talk anything about internal states, like fear and dread
or hunger. You can't talk about them unless you have a behavioral correlate. And then suddenly
you can talk about conscious. It wasn't so much that they denied conscious, they just said,
we can't say anything meaningful about consciousness. But I rebelled then against it and I still do.
If you have a toothache, that's a very specific type of experience. And depending on which tooth
you have it, it maps systematically. I did map systematically on the bits and pieces of cortical
matter. You experience a pain, well, you back projected here, but it actually, the physical
substrate is in a specific region, and we can study that and we can manipulate it, right?
We can in principle turn it up and turn it down, either electrical stimulation and drugs and
everything. So I think it is critical to relate first person perspectives to third person views.
I agree with you. I think behaviorism was a dark age. And I'm glad it's over and behind us.
But to take a concrete example, blindsight, should we ignore that people report not seeing
something that they clearly register because they reach out to it or they move away from it,
like a ball being thrown at them and they say, I didn't see the ball yet, but they react exactly
as they would if they saw the ball. Should we discard their introspective report? No. But we
shouldn't take it at face value. So this is what I'm trying to say. I'm not saying that we should
discard introspective or subjective reports. What I mean is we should not take them at face value.
In blindsight, we understand now that, correct me if I am wrong, Christof, you are the expert here.
I'm just a curious reader of the literature. But there is evidence that there is a back and
forth process of communication between two distinct brain areas. And blindsight happens
when you interrupt that convergent loop. And that loop may have to do with metacognition.
In other words, the person may actually be experiencing vision, but cannot report that
experience to themselves at a metacognitive level. And how can we find that out? Well,
through neuroimaging, detailed neuroimaging. So I think we should take the introspective reports,
but couple them with something objective and not take all the subjective reports just at face
value. Otherwise, there would be no such a thing as blindsight. We wouldn't have understood it,
at least not to the same extent we understand it today, because we would just say,
okay, this person experiences no vision. Well, in fact, they do, they're just not metacognizant of it.
Well, I mean, a different interpretation of this is that it doesn't involve cortical pathway,
that the information goes from the retina, not necessarily into the salamence,
partly because of these people, of course. Well, yeah, down into the brainstem. So blindsight
typically is not highly sophisticated. There's no evidence really that you can read, for example,
a text like this, you know, and saying, well, I didn't read it, but you can actually read the title.
The evidence typically there's an empty field and there's a bright door,
or there's something at you. So this character suggests it's something relatively robust and
stereotyped that might involve brainstem mechanisms. And yes, those brainstem mechanisms,
you know, can lead to response, but they are not associated with consciousness.
That would be my interpretation of the current data rather than invoking
higher order. Because in many, again, mystical states or in some psychedelic states,
when you're highly conscious, there is no self, but you're highly, highly conscious of it. So
I don't think you need this higher order consciousness. It's there, particularly in adults,
literary adults, but I think you can be highly conscious without having this, this metacognition.
I'll offer you just a hypothesis. I'm not a neuroscientist, so probably make a fool of myself.
But we act deliberately because of our metacognitive processes. We form plans and intentions.
If you don't metacognize a sensory experience, you are not going to form intentions around it.
In other words, you're not going to form the intention to read the words in a book from left
to right. And therefore, none of those blind sight type experiences will be sophisticated
because you can't form metacognitive intentions around them.
Yeah, but look, but you can perfectly well, so you don't have blind sight, I assume. And if I do
this right in front of you, you're going to flinch or your pupil, you know, it's a, it's a
reflex and you'll perfectly well see it. It'll take you time to see it. In fact, you can show
by the time you've seen it, you've already initiated the reflex, but you will see it.
So blind sight, it's only in these patients, it's a very rare phenomena. It's not very common.
And it's impatient of lost pieces of the brain, typically in visual cortex.
So you and I, you will, you know, if there's an empty screen as a bright dot,
you take a blind sight person that has lost a V1 and then they claim, no, they don't see anything
yet they can still point at it. I don't think it requires something very sophisticated. I think
it's just, it's a simple visual computation. In this case, it is a computation that doesn't
give rise to neural correlate of consciousness. But there is blind sight, even if you have lost
V1. Well, that's where it was first reported. It was first reported in, it first, it came out of
the animal literature, particularly in monkey, when they remove primary visual cortex, sometimes
including high order, there's a famous monkey called Helen. And there's this video of Helen,
this experiment was done by Larry Weisskrantz, where you put raisins in front of her. And
although she has no primary visual cortex, so for the audience, that's a, that's a visual cortex
at the back of your head. Here you can feel, you know, there's this little bump here. That's where
visual cortex is. So if you fall backwards, typically you see stars because the mechanical
stimulus is translated into nervous energy. So if you remove that in these monkeys, what was so
striking that these monkeys could still catch little raisins, you know, it, it looked like
they could see perfectly well, but their visual cortex had, had been removed. How's that possible?
That's how the blind sight was discovered, because then it was tested in some patients who,
to say, I don't see anything, yet they can do simple types of visual behavior. As I said,
they can't read, but they can do pointing, they can do some color discrimination, etc. So the
general assumption is, it involves neurons in the retina that don't go to call, to the
L-German cortex because that part is destroyed, but go to, to, to centers in the brainstem that
can mediate things like reflexes or pointing like the colliculus where things are, but they're not
associated with consciousness. They do not, they do not provide a substrate for conscious experience.
As an idealist, of course, I'm committed to the notion that however it works, it's an
experiential process of sense, but I'm open to the possibility that it's not an experiential
process that is subsumed in the main complex, which I think is what you're trying to say. It's not
part of the ego. It's not part of our personal experiential life. It's, it's, it's something
off to the side. I'm open to that. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, this might explain all sorts of unconscious,
you know, what people explain with the Freudian unconsciousness, that there, as you said before,
dissociation in normal people, like you and I. So there could well be the footprints of my,
there, what I teach calls the complex that includes most of my, my cortex, including
Bocca's area. So I can talk to you. That's my egodic consciousness. There may still be smaller
complexes, let's say in the frontal, inferior frontal or in the back of it, that can, that can
possibly control, you know, that get visual input and do stuff that allows me to rapidly run and
weed my way through a very busy street. I was shoppers yet the egodic consciousness isn't
conscious of it, but it may well be there's this little substrate. The Freudian slips, right?
Exactly. So in this case, it wouldn't be unconscious. There would be consciousness,
but not the one, the one that controls your Bocca's area that you can ask to what, why did you
just say that consciousness literally might not have no idea. I don't know. I just said it.
I've no idea why because and again, you see this in split brain early on, when you can get this,
what's called inter-manual conflict. So once you do this, you cut the brain in two in these
patients, you can see that typically, for example, a patient will close his shirt with one hand and
the other hand will open it, or you get the alien hand syndrome, where the hand will suddenly do
something like grab their legs or grab their genitals, and the patient themselves completely
confuses, I don't know, my hand does this. And the question is, why does it do it? Is it because
it's, it also has this consciousness, but not them, but its footprint is not the main one,
the egodic consciousness. It's a very interesting hypothesis worth pursuing.
Yeah. The IIT and Association, that's, that's the future you ask me.
Yeah. I'm looking forward to that. I've been waiting for a while. Yeah. Shall we move on to
another one? Prakash, did you have any more questions to follow up?
Yeah. I want to thank both of them for this very in-depth discussion. The only, the only, you
know, the thing that I'm pointing out is not to mix the science and metaphysics, but in terms of
inquiry. Is there a place of convergence where people from these different thought worlds
can merge? You know, well, like we have done in this particular group, we have done this.
Yeah. We're doing it now, Prakash. Yeah. Yes. I'm just wondering if a physical location
might be something like a future university, you know. Now, once, for instance, there's a Tibet
Emory in Science and Counter organized by, partly it was together with this holiness,
the Dalai Lama. I've been there and I've gone to, to Mungot in India several times where you have
Tibetan monasteries where, where at least you're trying to precisely do this sort of take Western
science, typically physics and neuroscience psychology and bring it to the monastic community
where each, where each of those two very different traditions and communities can bring,
can learn from each other. So I know that there are initiatives like that.
Thank you. Thank you. As you guys have already mentioned that our experiment you're being
performed. Two interesting states. One is general anesthesia and those cases who
where patients who are almost in the dead bed were about to die, but somehow
happens to be brain dead and somehow resuscitates facts and then reports, which we call the NDE.
But anyway, so my question is this, both of you see some prospects, which
when I say data means hard data, challenges the conventional understanding in the neuroscience
which exists today, which challenges it. So do you guys see that, do you guys feel that more such
experiments are required to take place? And if so, do you guys see maybe currently which is there
or maybe in the future we can find some more hard data regarding which can challenge the existing
conventional understanding of consciousness? All right, near death experience. So that's a
very difficult question. So in fact, when I visited Bernardo a couple of months ago, he took me
and introduced me to Von Lommel, the Dutch cardiologist who published this famous study of
near death experiences in cardiac, a prospective study in cardiac patients in Holland and reported
that 10 up to 15% of these people had near death experiences. So I think, so at least in Bernardo
and now we differ here and then let me give my position and then over to you. So there's the
interesting psychological phenomenon of near death experiences, which is very powerful,
which is highly reproducible and people are taking serious. In a sense, it's being studied
by many people, psychologists, neuroscientists, where you lose your sense of self, you lose your
body. In my case, I had one of these, there was nothing there, just light. So typically people
report either this lucidity or this very, very icy blue, blue, bright or light of overwhelming
intensity and then some combination of terror or ecstasy or certain other experiences. So then
our conferences organized book being written about NDE where it gets so that used to be very
controversial and the only place where you could find these stories in the bookstore was under
Isotirica, you know, a way in the back of the bookstore where they have stuff on a magic and
witchcraft you can find stories on NDE. That's changed. That's now mainstream. What remains
highly, highly controversial is the claim and it's very difficult to really test rigorously.
I'll tell you why. What's the brain doing this experience? What's the brain actually dead?
So a death is a complicated matter now. It used to be very easy. You were dead when your brain
stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, but now with resuscitation tools and with
extracorporeal, you know, heart lung, it becomes much more difficult to define what death is and
how you define it. Typically one way to define it would be isoelectric EEG, but of course in the
vast number of cases in the ICU where these people with cardiac arrest are treated, you don't have a
high density EEG and you don't have the luxury to put on a high density EEG while the patient is
cold blue, right, or cold red, right, because the heart stopped, right, because every second count,
so you're not going to put electrode on them. So that claim, so on the one hand, there are people
like like von Lommel who really says the brain was dead, i.e. in this case, functionally inactive,
no more electrical activity, no more electrical activity, really flat line, what's called when the
when the EEG is flat line. I find that, I just find that impossible to accept having studied the
brain for 40 years and knowing the close relationship between electrical activity and
different brain states, like sleep, like dreaming, like regular, we can see it in babies, in newborns,
in disease, etc. I find that very, very difficult to accept, but there are persons now over to
to Bernardo, including von Lommel, who really insist people can have these experiences while
their brain is totally inactive. Bernardo. Yeah, I think being von Lommel's study on the
Lansens in 2001 was methodologically strong. I take it seriously. I take NDEs seriously,
for instance, I think Ibn Alexander, Ibn Alexander III, Anita Morjani and others are
truthfully reporting what they experienced. Observe, however, that neither Morjani nor Ibn
were flat-lined during their NDEs. The claim there is that the experiential complexity,
the structural complexity of their experiences was incompatible with anatomical damage and
vastly diminished metabolism or disrupted metabolism. For me, it's not so important
whether NDEs flat-out contradict physicalism or not, because there was an experience that
happened when you could not have had any brain activity whatsoever. For me, this is highly
unimportant, because I think we don't need it to contradict physicalism.
I think physicalism is a non-starter. We are giving it too much if we acknowledge that we
need to prove that in order to prove physicalism false. I think it is inevitable that experience
never ends. The question is, is that an experience that correlates with ego itself? Can there be
an egoic self-experience when there is zero metabolism? Maybe not, maybe yes. Either way,
I'm happy my analytic idealist stance. What I don't think, and here is where I depart from
my friends in the NDE world, and Christoph and I discussed this at length,
there is a lot of emphasis in the NDE community on so-called veridical experiences, things that you
saw that were not correlated with the physical location of your body, and you couldn't have
seen them because your eyes were shut and you had no brain activity or whatever.
I don't think what's happening is that we have some kind of gaseous soul that inhabits the body,
and then when you have an NDE, the soul sort of leaves the body and goes floating around
and can still see and hear and taste and smell. I don't think that is plausible,
otherwise nature would be highly redundant. Why did we have to struggle through life and
death for four billion years to evolve the sense organs we have if by stopping our heart we can
float around seeing and hearing and sensing everything? I don't think that is plausible,
yet I do take the veridical reports seriously. I just think that we need a more nuanced way to
try to account for them as opposed to just appealing to the simple face value account
that I don't think is plausible at all, which is we can see without eyes. I can't pass that through
my head, no. That's a claim on the chart. Some people say during that NDE people actually remember
their afterlife as in previous, previous life. Is there such a case in your data, Professor Ko?
I've never seen convincing evidence of that. I mean, I know people claim that, but I personally
am very skeptical. Sceptical about it. Last interview we had with Bernardo and Li Long and
Bernard Carr. Apparently, Dalai Lama has actually do a lot of reading on the brainwave or something
like that during some of his death. He's interested in your sign, specifically.
So you don't think that those kind of data are reliable at all?
I don't know. I mean, I know people claim, but people claim all sorts of things that obviously
didn't happen. I just don't know how that would work. So I just had a discussion, in fact, in India,
in Mungot, with this holiness, Dalai Lama, and we're talking about reincarnation. And I said,
permit me, I'm just a naive physical, at the time I was a naive physicalist. I said, well,
four words, no brain, never mind. So in other words, there has to be some sort of substrate,
some sort of substrate. It may be something very strange, very unconventional, quantum, nano,
whatever you want. But without a substrate, I don't see, so this is at least a substrate that
can be manipulated and that can be operationalized using, using measure like transition probability.
In the absence of anything like that, I don't see how mine could occur. So I don't see how
previous life, where would their memory be stored as it were? I, I'm, I remain unconvinced.
I don't know whether you want to say something, Bernardo.
We shouldn't agree on everything here today. I'll try to, I'll try to disagree. Look, I was talking
about Eben's and the even Alexander. He was not flatlined. His claim is that his, the state,
the anatomical and physiological state of his nervous system was not compatible with the richness,
sophistication and intensity of the experiences he had. I take that seriously. I think that is
a plausible statement to make. How would I account for that? Well, I think no more metabolism
is the image, not only of our internal experiential states, but also the dissociation mechanism
itself, this, this actively enforced dissociation mechanism. So certain metabolic conditions,
some impairments of metabolism are probably the appearance of an impairment of that dissociative
boundary itself. So I think it is plausible that in those states in which your dissociative
boundary normally actively enforced is impaired, that you will pick up on experiential states in
your cognitive neighborhood that do not correlate with the way you appear on the dashboard. In
other words, do not correlate with the body form, with metabolism and anatomy. Because I think of
the body as an image of experiential states, as opposed to the cause of experiential states.
I'm open to the possibility that the image is incomplete. It doesn't say everything there is
to say about the experiential states it correlates with. For instance, I, from your perspective,
I am an image on your computer screen. The pixels on your computer screen arrange themselves in such
a way as to correlate with my inner life. Because I'm speaking, I'm expressing my inner life and
it appears as a representation on your screen. But that representation doesn't say everything
there is to say about my inner life. It is an incomplete image. So I take it seriously that
the body can be also an incomplete image. It may not correlate with everything there is to correlate
when it comes to memories or when it comes to certain experiential states that we call transcendent
or transformative. Those may have to do with dissociative boundary that becomes porous. And
you're just trafficking with the cognitive surroundings around you. And those will not
correlate with your body form. So I think evens claim is plausible. Anita's claim is plausible.
But when it comes to reincarnation, at least in the cartoonish form that we tend to explain it,
which is that your personal agency somehow survives the complete dissipation of the image
that in all other cases correlates with it and somehow enters or associates itself with another
body, I think this isn't plausible. Because our personal agency correlates extraordinarily well
with the body image. If the body image is not there, I think we should grant that at least
a lot if not the complete personal agency is no longer the case. So I don't think
our personal agency hops from body to body. Otherwise, I would expect children to
already be born knowing everything they knew in the previous life. And then people say, well,
we forget things. Yes, but there are certain things. Do we forget riding a bike or swimming?
And I don't know. I don't see a coherent way to account for the hypothesis of the survival
of personal agency. So I don't think it happens. But what people report and we interpret as reincarnation,
what they actually report is someone else's memories. Could they be somehow finding a cognitive path
across a dissociative boundary and link to a memory state that is out there in our cognitive
neighborhood because its previous owner has died, it doesn't have a dissociative boundary anymore.
So its memories are released out there and they get picked up by new emerging dissociative processes.
Perhaps I think that is plausible and it will remain plausible until and unless
we find exactly what in the physical world correlates to memories. Not to the recall of
memories, but to memories as a repository of information. And seeing the work that has been
done recently, we are not getting closer to it. We seem to be all over the place. So until and
unless we pin that down, I think it is plausible that experiential states corresponding to a
dead person's memories get picked up by a newly emerging dissociated complex in this field of
subjectivity that nature is. So if we let's say we take Michael Levin's bioelectrical signal,
so how do that bioelectric signal carrying memory then? Because there always seems to have a memory
that would still be physical. Yeah, it would still be physical. It's a field, an electric field,
you can measure it at a particular frequency. So that still requires a physical substrate.
My point is simply in the absence of any such a physical substrate, I don't see how you could
preserve memory or agency or anything else. And to encode rich information in a field,
you need some form of modulation signaling some stuff that we would be able to read out
and see and say, okay, that's the information that's where it's coming from. We can see it
in the behavior of the field. And what Michael sees, he's not trying to account for reincarnation.
So let's talk from that. No, no, no, no, he's not. Implanaria. Implanaria.
Yeah. What he realizes is that the body plan is related to bioelectric fields.
And you can coax a cancerous cell back to the body plan by manipulating the bioelectric field.
I think this is ground. Implanaria. No, no, in frogs. Frogs. And in frogs and in salamander.
Yeah. Yeah. Not yet in mammals. Yeah, it's cool stuff. It is. It is. It's interesting stuff. Yeah,
no question. So basically, what I want to say is that like, you know, we should not bring back
the materialism from the back end, saying that there's a substrate. What we can instead say
everything is abstract, you know, because the numbers, for example, are abstract software
programs are up, right? We all understand that they're not anywhere, but they're accessible to us
because there is a structure and so on. Now the point is like, you know, that
how it is proven is that when we see something, it's actually in the visual cortex where they
know life. And yet we have all the perception, which is happening right now, which obviously means
like, you know, that it's only because of nervous signals, if the perception is happening. But
nervous signals have nothing in them to cause the so-called perception because the signals
they're just moving around. It's electricity moving around. So the perceptive field is a totally
independent of the abstract realities, because now rest of the reality, now we have to say
abstract because the perception is connected to the abstract reality. Now if you take this viewpoint,
then body is just a cache of information like a computer. And it's not even physical, it's just
an abstract boundary. It has an abstract boundaries. And it's doing all the manipulation. So in this
viewpoint, all the inconsistencies of the theories are stored is what I feel. But only thing you
have to admit is that the so-called senses are not physical in nature. They are like just standalone.
They're a different category by themselves. They're not physical in nature. They're not objects in
nature. And then the so-called awareness, which is what we feel is having access to infinite
amount of memory. But when it is actually practical, it's only having boundaries of information,
like our body is a boundary. When we study computer science, it's a boundary of information.
And by creating a boundary, we are able to work in a consistent manner, because without a boundary,
there cannot be consistency in the reality. And the consciousness, one of the property
of consciousness is to manipulate the boundaries of information. That's why we are able to say that
like, you know, we are talking to each other in clubhouse, that's a boundary. And we can now increase
and say, okay, I'm in the physical reality, and so on and so on. Because no physical system can
manage its own knowledge boundary, not even the LLMs, right? It's only the awareness or consciousness
which changes the knowledge boundaries, which it manipulates, which is then superimposed on the
body. And then it translates into nervous signals, which then do the all the work, which is all
just a layered system, the way we do the layering of the information in the computer. I feel
this is how it has to be adopted, because it's actually way done. What I'm telling is kind of
way done. Do you have a questions, Vinod, to Professor Cole? I'm saying that we should not
bring materialism in any way. When we are talking about the models of reality is what my point is.
Thank you. Is it acceptable or what is accepting, at least I mean, manipulating
known mechanisms that we see, whether it's in the brain or in the outside world, in geology or in
physics or in solid state physics or in quantum mechanics has been enormously successful, right?
If we want techniques that in a lawful way manipulate our environment and then use them to
build technology, accepting that they are mechanisms has been incredible useful. That has
been the time of science for better or worse. And I see no reason we can't continue to do that.
We just should deemphasize whether there truly exist in some absolute sense and whether there's
something ultimately underneath that. But all of science and the modern way of life is conditioned
on manipulating mechanisms in a particular state. And that works, whether that's brains or whether
that's nuclear reactors. It works exceedingly well. I mean, the mRNA COVID has given another
proof of that. A rational understanding of mechanisms really gave rise to this highly
protective medicine. And that's what science can do just in defense of that.
Simple question. If we move our hand, what really is the mechanism at play? Where is the starting
point of movement of hand? That's what I'm asking is the problem is not about how to move reality,
how to change reality. What is the source of change of reality?
Yeah, so IIT has a very precise answer to that. Ultimately, it totally agrees with your intuition.
It's not the neurons that move my hand. It's not the muscles that move my hand, but it's ultimately
the intrinsic causal power of my conscious experience to make a point. And then to make
that point, I raise my left hand or raise my right hand. So the conventional explanation is
it's my premotor cortex that gave rise to the readiness potential and libid experiments and
all of that. But within IIT says, no, it's not the underlying neurons that cause it. It's my
conscious experience that was the ultimate cause. However, that does correlate with certain brain
phenomena. But then as we always teach our students correlation is not causation. So just
because you can read off a brain signal a second before you actually make the movement doesn't
mean that this brain signal is the actual cause of it. So I would tend to agree with your point of view.
Yeah, of course, I agree too. I think where the confusion comes, it's more a psychodynamic whole
thing. When we understood back in the early 17th century that two perspectives were very useful
and conducive to the production of knowledge and understanding nature, those perspectives were
realism and naturalism. When we understood that realism and naturalism came back under the metaphysics
of physicalism. But that was just the one example of naturalism and realism that we had.
Naturalism and realism are not intrinsically associated with physicalism. You can abandon
physicalism without having to abandon realism and naturalism. In other words, without having to
abandon the notion that there is a world out there made of states that are outside my personal
agency and which I cannot control or change merely by an act of volition. And those states
obey certain regularities, certain natural regularities such as expressed in the chains of
causation. Those states do not do what they do because there is an entity outside nature that
is intervening into nature all the time and making things move around, moving the planets around the
orbit of the sun like the flying spaghetti monster with its noodley appendages. That's what we deny.
We deny that there is deliberate intervention to explain the dynamics of nature. We say under
naturalism that nature does what it does because it is what it is. And to be is to have properties
and because nature has the properties it has, it behaves in the way it does. That's naturalism.
And there is a world out there that's realism. We can preserve both while discarding physicalism
which makes an extra claim, which is that the external states of the world out there are not
experiential fundamentally. And it is only the arrangement of those states that in certain
circumstances generate experience as something epiphenomenal and they don't have an account for
how that miracle could possibly happen. So we reject that. But in doing it, we do not need
to reject naturalism and realism. Or just talk about the nervous system as it relates to IIT.
All right, nervous system relates to IIT. I think it means the rest of the peripheral nervous system
below the brain stem. I think that's the question.
Does it correlate with experiential states, the rest of the nervous system?
Yeah. Well, okay, so the brain conventionally thought of the central nervous system, but as
Bernardo said, there's of course a peripheral nervous system that goes all the way into almost all,
you know, that innovates our muscles, of course, but that also innovates our heart, our kidneys,
our liver, our gut, our sexual organs. So all of that and it's bi-directional. It goes,
information travels from the periphery, from these organs into the brain and from the brain back
into the organ. But the actual substrate of consciousness is probably in the upper part,
in the upper echelon, at least in normal people who grew up with a normal brain. It's probably in
cortex. It doesn't include the PNS, the peripheral nervous system. However, you can perfectly well
be aware of these states of the peripheral nervous system. You can feel hungry. You can feel,
you know, when you have a full belly, you can feel, you know, when you need to go to the bathroom,
you can feel, if you train yourself and pay attention, you can be sensitive to your heartbeat,
right? And snipers can learn to do that. So you can perfectly well become aware of these states.
And furthermore, what the placebo and the nocebo response shows that your narrative, your belief,
can reach out all the way, what you believe in your mind about something, some procedure,
or some ceremony, or some person can reach all the way back using those, those axons, but now
going backwards into the organs and can influence your immune system, can influence your gut, right?
In psychiatry, this is also called a somatization, when people have various symptoms, but they show
up in various parts of their body. So it's really a two-way communication. And what we've learned
over the last hundred years, there can be this profound influence on your beliefs. And ultimately,
that's what's known as a placebo or its dark twin, the nocebo response. That's exactly what it shows.
When you believe that a particular piece of pill subscribed to you by somebody who spent 10 years
at a medical school, it's called doctor, in a white lab coat, and you've read all about those
other people who with that same pill have these wonderful experiences, then you too will believe
and then you too are much more likely to have such an experience or to have
amelioration of your symptoms. So this shows prime sort of mind over matter. So I think it's a very
important lessons to take home. And it all requires the two-way communication that is the
peripheral nervous system. Thank you. Hey guys, so I was listening to the arguments against personal
agency and reincarnation. And my question is, if the argument is made as the personal agency
having the body and not the body having the personal agency, do you see that there is a
change of standpoint that you are having? And a follow-up question can be, even in certain
idealist philosophies like Mahayana Buddhism, that personal agency is considered to be part
of physicalism. So do you see that possibility as well in your arguments? I mean, I don't see how
once again, without a substrate, without there being some substrate, I don't see
how personal memories or personal agency can be. We need some substrate without that.
I don't see how that would happen. And for sophisticated minds like yours and mine,
you need a very sophisticated substrate that potentially can adopt many, many,
many different states. In the absence of that, I don't see nothing comes.
Talking from principle, I'm a little bit less strict than Christoph because of this view I have
that images do not need to be complete. The hypothesis is not incoherent in principle.
There could be a hierarchy of dissociation in nature such that higher level dissociative process
that you call then the personal agency would further dissociate into what appears to us as a
physical body. And when that lower level of dissociation comes to an end and the physical
body then dissolves because it's the image of that process that is no longer going on,
you sort of fall back into that higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy and there is
still something individuated there. That's the hypothesis. Is it in principle incoherent? No.
Does it have empirical backing? No. And you could say, well, the absence of evidence is not
evidence of absence. So there could still be this higher level of dissociation that preserves
individual agency. Yes, but isn't it quite forced because a lot about the body correlates with our
inner mental states? So what we are requiring here is that although there is this enormous
vast correlation between body and our mental states, which we consider individual, when it comes to
this higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy, it doesn't appear at all on the dashboard.
It has no physical correlate or in the words of Christoph, it has no substrate. That, I think,
stretches plausibility too much. I am open to the idea in principle, but I don't think we have
sufficient reasons to entertain it quite seriously at this point. Quickly because... Yeah, it is for
Professor Christoph and it was regarding that famous bet which you had with David Chalmers.
So I just wanted to know... It was more of a lighter note, but did you change your quote-unquote
position after the post that bet? And if you're not so... A more serious note, what do you see?
Like David Chalmers won and you don't see both IIT and I think GWT, both is not able to answer
the question which has been in the hard problem of consciousness. That would be my quick question.
No, so this bet was not about the hard problem, it was about the easy problem.
The bet was in 25 years from 2098, will the community of scientists that study conscience
agree it's these mechanisms in that part of the brain that are the substrate of consciousness?
No, as of last year the community has not agreed on that, but he agrees, I mean David Chalmers
agrees it's a perfectly solvable problem and sooner or later we won't know the answer. Sooner or
later we know that these mechanisms in that state give rise to pain or to pleasure or to
seeing and to reading is no question about it. It's an entirely operational empirical defined
project and it does not suffer from the hard problem because it's just correlation. This part
of the brain or these neurons doing this thing correlate with that conscious experience.
Massive thank you for both of you for joining us today. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Take care.
Yeah, see you all again.
