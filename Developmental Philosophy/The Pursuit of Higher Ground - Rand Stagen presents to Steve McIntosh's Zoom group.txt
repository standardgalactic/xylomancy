So should we just jump in?
Raja, are we ready to go?
Yeah, go for it.
So we've got an hour and 15 minutes together.
We're going to make this as interactive as possible.
I consider this a relatively small size group,
so I think this is manageable.
Less than 50 people on Zoom.
I can see all your faces on one screen on my big monitor,
and I'm looking forward to doing a couple things.
Number one, I'm going to provide you
a little bit of background upfront
on the State Leadership Academy,
which we found it 25 years ago this year.
And then I'm going to share with you a piece of content
that we call the pursuit of higher ground
that is our most recent expression
of how to translate developmental theory,
integral theory, spiral dynamics,
and complexity theory for all intents and purposes,
how to translate that into the listening
of a broad audience from traditionalists to progressives.
So this content can be delivered in as short
as a 18-minute keynote speech in front of 1,000 people,
and I do this in large groups all the time.
And the feedback that I have gotten in the last two years
of let's just, I'm still in the experimental phase
with this material is incredibly positive across the board.
And so rather than just share the content
and treat you like a normal audience,
I'm going to treat you as you are, your fellow travelers,
where we're all students of integral theory,
developmental theory, and I see this more
as a peer group than anything else.
So I'll present the material,
I just have a handful of slides,
and that'll be a little didactic, little presentation mode,
and then we'll come out of that,
and instead of waiting until the end of the call for Q&A,
we'll actually start with the Q&A
right after I clear the slides
so that I can use your questions
to continue sharing and presenting.
I am not an academic, I am not a theorist,
we've got the big brains on this call,
Salisman is here and others, and we're practitioners.
As Steve knows, Bert and I, Bert Parley,
who was with Ken Wilbur, who I met through Ken Wilbur
almost 22 years ago, we are in the arena
working with leaders on a daily basis
that are running organizations.
We primarily work with privately held businesses
and executives within those enterprises,
and our sweet spot is the mid-market,
and for people, what does that mean?
That means companies with a couple hundred employees
to a couple thousand employees, that sort of range.
The reason that we don't work by design
with large public companies is we will only work
with an organization if the CEO of that organization
is engaged in their own deep inner work.
If they're not willing to actually look at themselves
and work on themselves, we will not go into
the organization to work with their people.
So yes, we do work with some public companies,
many years of working with Whole Foods
and working with John Mackey and his top 300 leaders
were their partner for the sort of
executive development there,
but that is one of the few big known companies
we work with because John is someone who's willing
to walk the talk and actually work on himself.
But that unfortunately is really rare with CEOs
of typically large fortune 1,000 businesses.
So that's a little context on who we are,
what we're about, as Ken referred to us,
had to have been almost maybe 17 or 18 years ago,
they're the little experiment in Dallas.
Like what's going on in Dallas?
And people will often say, Rand, you guys work with,
we have a physical brick and mortar facility,
a leadership academy in Dallas.
We have our team,
Bert and I just came out of our annual team retreat.
We had 72, not the whole team, but 72 attendees there
just to give you a sense of our size, our faculty.
And as Rajeal said, we work with several thousand leaders
each year across the country that either come to Dallas
or we go to their organizations.
And we are, people will say, why are you in Dallas?
Like it makes no sense.
You're working with Wilbur, you're working with Bob Keegan,
you're working with Bill Torberts,
who's on Corgroire, cutting edge, integral theory.
Like what are you doing in Dallas, Texas?
And the answer is, this is where the work is, right?
This is where the work is, this is where the need is.
So we are in the heartland.
We work extensively in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin.
We work in Oklahoma, Louisiana.
We work really deeply in Kansas.
We work in Ohio, in Illinois.
We go down into Georgia.
We really are in sort of the middle of the country
and a little bit down into the Southeast.
We are not heavily penetrated by design on the coast.
Yes, we have clients in Seattle and New York
and in California, but the mass focus for us
has been heartland and I'll explain that
after I clear the slides.
So that's background context, a segmentation where we focus
and we're not in the entertainment business.
So we don't do any event-based training.
Our shortest program for a new client is a 52 week
practice-based, integrally informed program
where they come to Dallas one day per quarter
in a cohort of 20 liters.
From anywhere in the country
and we will only work with a client if the CEO goes first.
So now let's get to the juicy part, get to the content.
So I have been, along with my team,
trying to figure out how to crack the code
on a skillful means on a translation of spiral dynamics.
We started teaching our leaders, our clients, the spiral.
And we basically did it as a developmental progression
as it is laid out by Don Beck and by Claire Graves' research.
And what would happen is the world views,
the traditional world view, lower down,
was very threatened by the hierarchical nature of the model.
The achievers, the strive-drive kind of orange worldview
would look to figure out how they could
sort of game and climb the ladder.
So they just wanted us to click the slides faster
so they could kind of move through the progression.
The pluralists, the progressives were incredibly offended
by the hierarchical nature of what we were laying out.
So after about five or six years,
we moved from a vertical rendering
and we presented picking four of the colors,
red, blue, orange and green.
And for those that don't know spiral dynamics,
this sort of power mindset or power worldview, red,
the more traditional worldview, blue,
the more achiever worldview, orange,
and the more progressive pluralistic worldview, green.
And we basically laid them out
as we're still doing today in our curriculum
as a little bit more of a horizontal
and saying that there's not one that's better than the other
because in reality, one isn't better than the other.
They all are appropriate in the appropriate context.
And so what's the context is what's best?
And so that has been,
for some people in the integral community,
that was blasphemy.
Like how could you do that?
How could you make this appear to be almost a type system?
And the answer is we're meeting people where they are.
We're not demanding that they meet us where we are
because we're up in the ivory tower from their perspective.
And so it's been an incredibly powerful
and potent strategy, communication strategy
because it works and it's getting people into the game
of understanding the nuances of development.
And then in 2021 with Steve as really a guide to me,
he introduced in an article this idea,
it was just a sentence, right Steve?
It was just a simple sentence saying,
I no longer believing that common ground
is gonna be the fullness of what we need.
We need higher ground, we need more than just common ground.
And I grabbed on that term and said,
there's something really magical about this idea
of higher ground and ultimately was able to build
a new expression, which I'm about to share with you
in the form of what is now a keynote presentation.
I'm gonna send, Raigel, the slides.
It's a small, email-able PowerPoint file.
So if you wanna send it out to everybody
in the spirit of abundance, everyone could have these slides.
And so the move here was how can we actually
put red to the side and really focus on the traditional,
the achiever and the pluralist,
that sort of blue, orange and green worldviews
and bring in yellow in what I hope you will see
as a very creative way of inviting people
into a more of an integrated orientation.
The title of this content is the pursuit of higher ground.
And the word pursuit is incredibly precise
because we don't want anyone to suggest,
like to suggest themselves or to infer
that we, an integral community are up on higher ground
and we're putting our hand down
to help others come up to us.
That would be unskillful and presumptive
and it could come across as arrogant.
And so the frame here is we are all in a place
where we together can pursue higher ground
where we can all look at this slide
in the pursuit of something and a dynamic journey
towards something aspirational and something higher.
And then this image here, as many of you know
from Steve's book of developmental politics,
how America can grow into a better version of itself.
Right now, the version so many of us are experiencing
is hyperpolarization, is this culture war,
is this time in which people are experiencing
incredible confusion and conflict and emotion.
And if we talk to the average American
and ask them what's going on,
they're likely gonna say things like,
well, we have issues with racial issues in America.
We have issues with climate in America
in which there are climate deniers
and people who are not sensitive to what's going on.
We have huge income inequality.
We have all these issues.
Okay, so pick them, race, climate, income inequality
and what we would say from a developmental standpoint
is that those are actually not the real issue.
Those are the symptoms of the real issue.
So if we were to go upstream of the polarization,
we would assert that there's actually a conflict
of worldviews that's showing up with those symptoms.
And so the idea is to introduce
that if we were walking down a street in a major city,
we would be interpreting what was going on in the world.
We would be relating with the world through the lens
that we're wearing through our worldviews.
And we invite, in this case, an audience
to recognize that in many ways,
we don't see the world as it is,
we see the world as we are,
which is a concept I think many of you are familiar with.
We don't see the world as it is objectively.
We are always filtering and we're always interpreting
through the lens at which we're making meaning of the world
and thus the idea of a worldview.
And so then we go in and say, and these are,
I'm bringing you guys behind the curtain a little bit.
I don't normally, you know, pause
and offer up these nuances here,
but please pay attention to the placement
of where these colors are on the screen.
So we start with introducing the idea
that there are three dominant worldviews in America today,
and we introduce this idea of an achiever worldview.
And we talk about how this would be your capitalist crowd,
your business people, and with the achievers,
there's, from this worldview,
there are a lot of healthy contributions
that achievers have made and continue to make to America
and to the world.
And we talk about that as the light
of the achiever worldview,
things like modern medicine
and things like economic development.
And yet, even though there are all these wonderful expressions
and contributions from the achiever worldview,
where there is light, there is also shadow.
There is pathology.
There are these very destructive forces
that come from the achiever worldview,
things like greed and self-dealing and cronyism
and regulatory capture of environmental destruction.
And so it's this capacity
to be able to recognize the light and the shadow,
to be able to say, look at how long we are living
relative to just 100 years ago,
thanks to modern medicine,
look at this incredible economic development
that has allowed so much of humanity to flourish
and coming out of poverty at a continued increasing rate.
And yet, there are these shadows
within the achiever worldview.
And then, we introduce,
notice it's on the right here,
I don't normally say that,
we introduce the traditional worldview.
And we say, those who are operating
with a traditional worldview,
also have light and contributions.
And the traditional worldview brings us family values,
brings us law and order, brings us structure,
brings us so many elements of our society that keep order.
And yet, there is a shadow of traditionalism.
And traditionalist shadows can include things
like bigotry or homophobia or racism,
not at a systemic level, but at an individual level,
like actual racism.
There is a shadow here and things like anti-science,
not believing in science,
which is in conflict with the achiever worldview,
which brings us science.
And then lastly, we introduce this idea
of the progressive worldview.
And the progressive worldview
has incredible contributions,
a multicultural orientation,
a recognition of previously marginalized communities,
a ability to be incredibly sensitive
to the earth and to the natural system
and to the environment.
And yet, where there is light, there is shadow.
And in the shadow of progressivism,
we see things like corrosive identity politics.
And we also see cancel culture.
And we see a form of DEI, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion,
a form of inclusion that says,
you are included as long as you see the world
through a progressive lens.
And so when I talk to my progressive friends
and I talk about what's going on
with diversity, equity and inclusion in America,
they say, we need to heal America.
If you remember the prior slide,
and I say, well, where are the people
who voted for Donald Trump?
And they're like, well, they're not welcome
at this conversation, at this table,
because they voted for Donald Trump.
And it's, there's such a contradiction there
that we stand for inclusion,
but there are conditions with that form of inclusion.
And I want you all to know that I am terrified
by the shadow of all three of these worldviews,
the dark underbelly of all three
are horrific in their most extreme expression.
And I adore the healthy expression of all three.
And so when people say, well, Rand, which one's better?
The answer is, it depends, right?
It depends.
And so now what happens in America,
what is happening, and we all know this
because we're living it every day,
is we're seeing how the parts of our country
that are struggling to make sense of what's happening,
what they start to do is they start to look
for a way to manage their own anxiety.
And they start to look to see which of these camps,
which of these worldviews most resonate with me.
And we call this the easy button,
and they punch the easy button
and subordinate themselves to the narrative
that most resonates with them.
And to make things a little simpler,
because we don't have a large amount of time tonight,
I'm gonna just go to the traditionalist on the right
and the progressives on the left,
and say, okay, if I'm on the traditionalist on the right,
it's Fox, and that's my news channel,
and that's my echo chamber that I'm gonna join.
And I'm gonna read magazines,
and I'm gonna read social media,
and I'm gonna subscribe to that channel, that camp.
But if I'm on the progressive side, I'm on MSNBC,
I'm on CNN, I'm on The View,
I'm gonna actually start to subscribe to those parts
of the worldview echo chambers that most resonate with me.
And the problem, and we all know this,
is when we actually are in a traditionalist camp
criticizing the progressives,
what the traditionalist media is doing
is they're amplifying the shadow of the progressives.
And then what the progressive camps are doing
in their expressions of media,
and the monetization that comes from all of this
with outrage is that the progressives are amplifying
when they criticize the traditionalist,
the shadows of the traditionalist.
So what's happening is the worst of the other
is being amplified and put forth as the other.
And I wanna say this again,
the worst of the other is being put forth
as the totality of the other,
which actually leads Americans to believe
that we are more divided than we actually are.
I genuinely believe that we are being told
that we're divided at a level that's not,
at least my direct experience on the ground,
navigating all three of these camps on a regular basis.
And so what do we do?
What is the path forward?
And so I want, for those of you who know
the idea of the dialectic,
I wanna introduce that here
because it's very useful and it's also very accessible.
So the dialectic would say that there's a thesis
and there's an antithesis to that thesis.
So thesis and antithesis.
And then from the thesis and antithesis,
we actually have a synthesis
that emerges above that, a higher order synthesis.
And so when we take the traditionalist
with part of the achiever on the right
and let's hold them out as the thesis
of American exceptionalism.
And these are people,
and Steve really gave me this particular language,
these are people who wanna protect
what's right with America.
And then on the left, the progressives
and sort of part of the achiever group also,
that is a group that wants to actually fix
what's wrong with America.
And so we have this incredible conflict
between those who wanna protect what's right
and those who wanna fix what's wrong with America
and they're banging into each other like tectonic plates.
And when we ask ourselves,
which one of these groups is quote, right,
the answer is they're both partially right.
There, and when I'm with an audience,
I will literally say,
if you feel like there are things that we need to protect
about America, raise your hand.
And in almost every room, all the hands go up.
And then I say, if you think that there are things
that we need to fix, things that are wrong with America,
raise your hand, almost all the hands go up.
It's not half and half,
almost everyone can relate with both of these orientations.
And so then what we say is,
if we wanna move to a higher order synthesis,
we are not gonna get there simply by finding common ground.
We need common ground.
We need compromise,
which we're not seeing much of these days in our politicians.
So I don't wanna marginalize common ground,
but as Wilbur would say,
common ground is necessary, but not sufficient.
It's not going to get us where we need to go.
So I want you guys to imagine
that we find a common ground among these three worldviews.
And we were able to use that common ground
as a solid ground from which to move upwards
so that we can actually move to what we really need,
which is a higher ground synthesis and integration.
And so here we go to finish out the slides
and then we can get into Q and A.
So higher ground.
And now we're going to say,
at higher ground, we're gonna do everything we can
to actually leave behind the shadows.
We're not gonna be able to leave all of it behind,
but we're gonna try to limit the shadows of all three
and then take the unique contributions,
the light of all three
and move those into an integrated
and synthesized orientation.
And notice, once again, I don't normally say this,
bringing the light of the three worldviews
up to higher ground and making yellow,
which most audiences see as a sun,
happens to coincide with yellow-inspired dynamics
as something that just worked out in a beautiful,
sort of almost unintentional way
when this was first being created as a body of content.
And so then what we say is,
what we need to recognize is that
people think this is idealistic.
They think that, Rand,
what you're trying to bring everyone with you,
what about the bad actors?
And what we say is,
don't throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater
and don't conflate the shadow behaviors
of all three of these worldviews with the human beings.
We want to imagine a circle of compassion,
a circle of inclusion,
and we want to imagine at higher ground
that no one is standing outside that circle.
So we want to be inclusive of the human beings,
but we do not want to be inclusive
of the pathological behaviors.
And there are a tremendous,
a number of behaviors that are happening right now
that we do not want to tolerate.
We want to be intolerant of the pathology,
but we don't want to throw out the human being.
And the example I give when people want an illustration,
I say, imagine when Pope John Paul was shot,
and we may all remember that experience
of watching him almost be killed.
After he healed, he went in and visited with the prisoner
who had been captured as would-be assassin.
And I want you guys to imagine,
you might remember in Life Magazine,
the cover of Life Magazine,
when the Pope was sitting in the corner
with no shackles on the would-be assassin
holding his hands forgiving him.
And so after he forgave his assassin
and he went outside of the jail,
the Pope did not say to the jailers,
now that I've forgiven him,
you need to let him out of prison.
He said, I have forgiven him as a child of God,
but he needs to stay in prison.
And that is an example of discernment.
So we can be non-judgmental of the spirit,
but we can still have discernment
for the consequences of the behavior
and for the potential risk that he poses
to himself or to society if he weren't in prison.
So this move from the lower level to the higher level
is really a move out of being judgmental
and still maintaining our discernment with boundaries
as we move to higher ground,
which can be a very fierce place.
People think, yes, the roomy quote,
which is beautiful and inspiring,
there's a field, right?
There's a field at higher ground.
And beyond right doing, beyond wrong doing,
there is this field, I'll meet you there,
that there's a lot of beautiful poetry
about the idea of higher ground.
And there's an and here,
there needs to also be a fierceness
and a responsibility of leaders at higher ground
to actually make choices in service of the whole,
in service of the system,
to recognize that the system is held together,
especially with very healthy blue.
And when green wants to dismantle
and completely eliminate blue,
defund the police,
pick your attack on blue from green,
that actually is incredibly threatening
to the stability for all of us and for all of this.
And so in, by the way,
when orange wants to exploit
what's going on with the economics of outrage,
that shadow and orange is actually fueling our polarization
because the amount of money that Facebook
and social media companies are making off of the outrage.
Oh, and let's not forget about blue
because blue has all sorts of intolerance
that also need to be recognized.
And so this move here is a move
to recognizing that in many ways,
we have always had a rich diversity in America,
and this is the last slide.
And most of you know our motto as a country,
e pluribus unum, out of many one.
Out of the diversity, there is a unity.
Out of this incredible complexity, there is a diversity.
So there is a tremendous wisdom
that exists at the base, at the foundation
of the United States that we actually are going at stake
and we're going back to renew ourselves,
to revitalize and to reconnect.
And so that's a little peek into some content.
And this isn't being delivered to academics.
This is being delivered to pedestrians,
to people who are struggling day in and day out
and are one prescription when people say,
what can I do?
What can I do?
And what can I do that's actionable?
And my answer is break bread with people
who you would normally never break bread with.
Go and have a dinner, go drink some wine
and sit for three hours with people
who are on the other side of the aisle from you
and actually see that you have much more in common
than you might imagine.
And that's what we're trying to do.
We're trying to get more and more,
not just of our clients, but anyone that we touch
to start getting into dialogue
and start getting into discussion with a greater diversity.
And I'll tell you, I mean, I am in the green world
all the time, I'm in the orange world every day.
I'm in the blue world all the time
from being at dinner with people in Alabama
in places like that on a regular basis,
to being in Boulder, to being in Seattle with progressives.
And so as I learned to navigate these different territories
what I find is people are very open
but they have to actually be met where they are.
And it's a long road ahead.
This is someone said to me recently,
don't worry Rand, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.
And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true.
Things are probably in the next decade
maybe the next two decades, going to get much worse
which is why we need more people stepping
into responsibility to be a part of the solution.
And this is really hard work
and diversity, equity and inclusion.
Unfortunately, the DEI community is not positioned
in my opinion, just to be provocative.
They are not positioned to be helpful.
I talk to CEOs and board members every day.
Big companies that are my friends
that I don't work with as clients
that run Fortune 1000 companies
I'm talking to them all the time.
They are not, the CEOs and the boards
are not doing the work that's necessary
to create a more inclusive organization,
an organization with healthier forms of belonging.
They aren't doing it because they're outsourcing it
to the DEI experts and the DEI, you can't outsource this.
You can outsource a lot of stuff but not adaptive change.
And until the DEI community actually gets
the executive team, the CEO and the board
to start to walk the talk on this
is going to be a bunch of bullshit
and a big charade is what it's going to be.
And guess what?
What camp is the DEI community in?
And we all know the answer, the green camp.
It's the progressive camp.
I love the progressive camp.
I love the light of progressivism
and I also love the light of traditionalism
and I also love the light of the achiever worldview.
And people will say to me, Rand, this comes from Bert,
Rand, are you a conservative?
And my answer is not merely,
well, Rand, that's confusing.
Are you a progressive?
Not merely, at least, but not merely
because I actually identify with the healthy expressions
of all three of these worldviews.
But the DEI community, the practitioners,
the consultants, they're so well-intentioned.
They are coming from a green place
and I talk to these people also.
Some of them are friends and they say to me,
I cannot, out of my own consciousness,
that I just cannot work with people
who are gonna vote for Donald Trump.
Okay, okay, so you're gonna exclude half the country.
So you're gonna stand for healing America
with half the country and the other half the country
of the deplorables, we're just gonna leave them out.
So how are we supposed to move forward?
We will only move forward when we have, dare I say,
an integral approach to diversity and inclusion.
We'll have to drop the E because the E is equity
and equity has become a part of the culture war
and it has been, it's no longer effective.
It has to be gone because the far right and the right
have said equity equals a quality of outcomes and socialism.
So we can't be asking the right of America
to be stepping into equity when that word
has already been defined and there's no going back,
but we can save diversity and inclusion for sure
and we need diversity and inclusion,
but we also have to recognize that the E of equity
is radioactive now.
So let's rumble people, Charlie's here, let's do it.
Let's get into some Q and A and let's get juicy
and provocative and let's challenge each other
and let's actually do what a classical liberal group
would want to do.
Let's offer up respectfully points of view
that actually are challenging to each other
so that we're not all just saying the same thing.
So Mary, you're up first and then we're gonna go
to Michael and then Trudy.
Hi, good afternoon, everyone, wherever you are.
Rand, thank you.
This is a very validating, brilliant introduction
and context setting you've given us.
I am personally continuously tortured by this idea
that we have to choose sides, jump into a bucket,
jump into a very lean and shallow definition of sides,
by the way.
So it's like nobody wants to deal with the complexity,
the deep, rich, multi-layered facets of these kind of
situations, conditions, states of mind, mindsets, et cetera.
And dealing with nuance, it's like I don't think
most people in our society even contemplate
that we are skimming on the top of the surface
as we default and follow the mobs and the voices
and the media.
We lack the ability to absorb and discuss the layers,
the nuance and the complexity of what's really going on.
And I continuously hear this term discernment
being so important, I completely agree with it.
What struck me as you were talking is that most people
have no idea what it means to have discernment
and that what's lacking is some sort of instruction,
awareness piece broadly and scalably available to people
about what we mean when we talk about discernment
and nuance.
And the last thing I'll say is the roomy quote,
which again, roomy, that roomy quote
and all roomy poetry is being spread widely,
but do people really understand,
they feel intuitively a sense of that quote
that you out beyond all ideas of right doing
and wandering there is a space, I will meet you there.
Yep.
And you can feel the essence of that because it's pure,
but do they know what that means on a deeper level
and do they know how to create the conditions
that will allow them to play in that space?
I think that's a big missing piece for a lot of people.
Well, you hit a lot and I want to appreciate
several things that you just shared
and offer up a couple of responses.
So at the highest level, complexity has a PR problem.
You guys get that?
Like complexity has a PR problem
because nuance and the capacity
to actually have the kind of discernment
that Mary's talking about requires development.
So development in developing our capacity
to have a more nuanced and complex way
of relating with the world is a really long
and hard journey.
And it takes, we work with clients for private businesses
where we work with the owners of the businesses
for not just a year or two years or three years.
We have many, many, many clients
that we've worked with for 10, 15, 20 years continuously.
And so we know that development is hard
and it takes a long time.
But the problem is that I just got an email
from a DEI consultant in New York
and the headline was 90 minutes to increasing trust
in the context of diversity and inclusion.
Because what's happening is that the corporations
are demanding these sprints.
You got to go faster.
You got to teach people quicker.
And once again, I'm sorry, but it's just bullshit.
It's a charade and people are pretending
that they're actually doing development
when they're not doing much more than provoking
some new ideas and entertaining people.
Now there's nothing wrong with going to the movies
and being entertained,
but let's not hold that out as development.
How many of you remember James Carville
in the Democratic and the Clinton era?
He said, it's the economy stupid.
Raise your physical hands if you remember that, okay?
A lot of people remember that.
It's the economy stupid.
Here's what we have to say
about the polarization in America,
the race topic just being one of them.
It's development stupid.
Like that's it.
It's development.
We don't have an appetite to actually do the work.
And so we are stagging.
We are very unpopular with public companies
because we have a, which is wonderful.
And I'm so thankful for my team and my clients
that over decades of doing this work,
we have a very strong reputation in corporate America,
in the pockets that we have a presence.
And we have to turn away opportunities every week
because we will not work with an organization
if their CEO is not doing his or her own work.
And I'm not, that's why I say,
probably a couple more decades of it's gonna get worse
because there's just the appetite to do
what Mary's pointing to is really, really rare.
All right, Michael.
And then Trudy, Michael Abramson.
Hi, Rand.
I like very much all that you presented
and it resonates with my understanding of this.
But my question to you is that my impression
that your academy, you mostly focus on business world,
corporate world.
Correct.
But a lot of controversies around this DEI,
they are coming from universities,
they are coming from the government.
So are you trying to do something with them
and what is generally your take on this?
So what is going on at universities?
Well, and also in the media,
which in theory, they should be like objective and biased,
but in practice, it's very rare.
So I'd like to hear your thoughts about this.
Well, I mean, I think for those of us
that are students of integral theory,
what's playing out in universities
is exactly what we would expect is playing out.
I think, Ken Wilber talked about this
as the mean green meme 20 years ago,
and it's just coming on full force.
So so much of this is what we would expect
would be happening as more and more
of a progressive world view is coming online,
as expressed especially in a younger generation,
in which they're being indoctrinated
into an academic world, the academy,
where especially in the liberal arts side of the academy,
where there is a bias to a progressive world view.
And we all know the statistics on this
that at 90% or more of faculty within our universities
across the entire country,
sometimes it's 95, 98% identify as being on the left, politically.
So we don't actually have a good balance in our own faculty.
And so then what would we expect happens to the students?
And so I think that question of what is going on
at universities, I might give Steve a chance
when he talks here at a moment to speak to that,
I wanna really talk about our direct experience.
And yes, we work mostly with business leaders.
We do work with leaders of institutions, nonprofits.
We have had chancellors of universities
go through our programs.
We have had many leaders of large religious organizations,
mega churches, a variety of different denominations,
priests, bishops with the Catholic bishops,
Episcopal bishops that have large regions.
So we work where the leaders are
and where the appetite is to make a difference.
But we do have a bias of working with the money, the power.
Because the way that we're gonna change universities,
one way we're gonna change universities
is by getting pressure from the alumni
who are gonna make demands
of what is gonna need to be changed
if they're gonna continue to make donations.
And so Stagen, we've just picked one part,
which is where capital is, where the money is.
But there's a lot of important work
that's going on in all parts of the system.
So Trudy, and then I'd love you guys
to also try to integrate in a little bit
what other people are asking.
Like, hey, I appreciated that
and I wanna integrate that into what I'm saying.
So it gets a little bit more dialogue-y,
which is hard, but we can try.
So Trudy, you're up.
Yeah, actually, you kind of answered
a lot of the question already.
I was gonna ask how well is this received
in the organizations that you have taught it?
And what's the result?
When you're following up with them,
are they using these principles?
Has it changed their organization in some way?
Have they found better ways of working together?
So address that a little bit, if you would.
Yeah, so I don't wanna make this about any one topic.
Diversity and inclusion is a topic.
Climate change is a topic.
What we find, Trudy, is when we work with a CEO
of an organization or a leader of an organization,
could be a nonprofit.
And that leader spends a year working on herself.
And as a result of working on herself,
will more self-awareness,
a capacity to recognize the wake
that is behind all of her decisions.
We help our leaders realize
that when we make a choice,
that choice is consequential.
I was talking to a leader a few days ago
who runs an organization in Georgia,
a relatively large family business,
thousands of employees.
And we were talking about what he had just communicated
to his executive team and to the top,
let's say a hundred leaders in his business.
He had sent an email and he realized
in the conversation with me
that the email was unnecessarily critical
and harsh in its tone,
and that he likely got the short-term result
that he wanted at the expense of long-term undermining
of trust within the top tier of his organization.
And so what we're trying to do with leaders
is to help them realize, as we become more aware,
we can actually choose differently
because with awareness and choice
comes a responsibility to recognize
that every decision, especially when you're higher up
in organizational life,
the consequences of those decisions ripple out
like the wake of a boat.
And what's so cool about development
and consciousness complexity
is that as a leader becomes better at that current level,
that's skill development, knowledge acquisition,
it increases the likelihood
that they can actually go vertical in their own vertical,
the elevated development.
However, when they move up,
they're gonna relate with relationships
in a more complex nuanced ways,
which means they're gonna relate
with the topic of diversity, equity, inclusion
in a more nuanced way.
And so we don't have to be DEI consultants or trainers,
we just have to continue to focus on human development
because as a human develops to higher levels,
they're actually, that person is going to relate with
and make decisions across a broad spectrum of topics
that are gonna be informed
from a more complex operating system.
And so that's the work.
It's just, it's development, it's development.
How long is this gonna take?
Generations, brand, that's not very inspiring.
Well, it's gonna take generations.
It's gonna take people thinking not in years anymore.
We can't have our leaders continuing to be
in this pathological short-termism of America,
that everything is now, now, now, now, now.
And what we realize is leaders have to start to recognize
what is the progress that we can make in 10-year increments.
Our clients love the Bill Gates quote,
and Bill Gates said,
most people overestimate what they can do in one year
and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.
And so we say to our clients,
how might you be underestimating yourself?
What could you do if you started expanding your sense of time
and started looking at the progress
and look at the long arc of progress?
And yes, there's suffering going on in the world,
but relative to 100 years ago and 200 years ago,
there's a lot less suffering.
So let's put that into context and perspective.
And when we get leaders who are able to just peek into
more of an integral view, they're able to hold that,
but when they're in the lower levels,
and as we all know, even though I talked about
the great diversity between the traditionalist,
the achievers, and the progressives,
the one thing all three of those worldviews have in common,
as integral theory teaches us,
is they think their worldview is the right worldview, right?
I mean, Steve knows that we all know this.
This is like, all three of these worldviews think
their worldview is the right worldview.
That's their commonality among all the other diversity.
And so this is just more,
just more reason that we've got to have more of a commitment
to a higher and more elevated development.
Barbara Brown, take yourself off mute.
What do you got?
You know, you mentioned working in Iowa country,
where I live too.
And not so much on the coast.
Is there, do you think a developmental reason
or a sociological reason why this works better
in middle America than it does on the coast,
just out of curiosity?
Well, yeah, it's a great question.
So it's counterintuitive to a lot of people,
especially integral students.
What we have found, we've been out there for decades,
what we have found is that when we meet a leader
from Kansas City, Kansas,
who may have grown up there,
gone to school somewhere else
and then come back home to raise their family.
And these are people who might have gone to universities
on the coast, they might have gone to a Harvard
or they might have gone to a UCLA, but they go back home.
And they feel a sense of community with Kansas.
And then we show up and we say,
we want to work with you through many decades
to actually become a more conscious leader,
conscious development, so that we can help you be of service
to your stakeholders, to your customers,
to your employees and to your community.
They have, our clients have almost an inherent blue,
like access to healthy blue traditionalism
that has them deeply connecting to stakeholder theory
and to stakeholder management
and to the principles of conscious capitalism.
And I'm being, this is a little bit of an exaggeration,
but when we meet people in New York
and people in, especially in like San Francisco,
and we ask them what their relationship is
with the community, it's almost, there's no geographic,
they're not tethered, there's this orange opportunistic,
I want to get mine, I want to grow my company,
and then we talk about Time Horizon.
And we say, what's your Time Horizon?
And so much of what's happening on the coast
is about the, I want to get rich in five to seven years.
We don't work with private equity.
We don't, none of the short term capital
is works with our model.
And so that would be my answer
is that there's this healthy community orientation
and it just seems like, why do you call it stakeholder theory?
It just seems like that's the right thing to do.
You take care of your employees
and your employees will take care of you.
You take care of your customers
and your customers will stay loyal.
You take care of your vendors
and make sure that they can make enough money,
even though you have to, you know, you have to negotiate,
but you don't want to, you know, squeeze them so hard
that they can't continue to supply you
because then that hurts you long term.
These things that seem so sophisticated in their language,
the Heartland often says,
that just seems like the right way to do business,
if that makes sense to you guys.
This is just, once again, our experience.
Okay, David.
You know, the other thing I see there, Rand,
is less contempt for the working class.
I mean, I was on a call a couple of weeks ago
where somebody studied in all seriousness,
how do we stop working class folks from voting
because they are so ignorant,
they can't make good political decisions.
And I mean, I'm just OMG, right?
I don't even know what to say to that.
And even when people disagree,
still in a lot of that Heartland,
there's that sense of civility that's required
and there's the sense that, you know,
you just don't treat people badly.
And I hate to say it about a lot of the progressive left,
but, you know, they'll treat anybody badly
if they don't agree with them.
And that's pretty pathetic.
Yeah, and Barbara, I wanna share something,
then they'll let David come in.
And Steve really worked with me
and really helped me along with Bert and Jeff
because we had several years during the pandemic
that we were supporting each other on Zoom
and we were sort of locked in our houses.
And what I used to assume is that
I held the spiral in my mind
and I was like, we have to see individuals
in our country go to green so they can go to yellow,
so they can go to integral.
And what Steve helped me to realize is
because there is so much progressive pluralistic green
at a societal and Wilbur's Quadrants lower left space
in the culture of America,
because we have been shaped
and we have been exposed to so much of that,
those means, those value systems
that people who are at an individual level,
their interior structure being more orange-blue
or maybe even blue-orange,
if you think primary and secondary,
that they have enough exposure to the green
to be able to actually make a move up to integral.
And so we're actually saying,
you know, the assumption that I had for years was
the only people we can work with
are people who are already progressive,
who wanna go post-progressive.
And that's not our experience.
Now our experience is we're working with heartland achievers
who are Christians, who have strong faith,
and they're reading Ken Wilbur.
And they're like, we're gonna build an integral company
because they also have a multicultural sensibility
because they also are able to feel into
the healthy parts of green to enough of a degree,
but they don't wanna live there.
They don't wanna go there.
They wanna appreciate the parts that are healthy for them.
And they wanna keep their faith, if they're faith-based.
And not all of our clients are faith-based,
but many of them are.
And they also want to be able
to maintain their healthy orange, their healthy achievement.
And so we're in an experiment of moving people up the spiral
towards yellow, towards an integrated view,
even though it doesn't look like a typical progressive
that's ready to pop to yellow.
So David, you're up.
All right, thank you, Rand.
This is so stimulating.
So my own sense as kind of an outsider to the business world
is that a lot of the DEI stuff is people using green language,
but coming from a sort of blue absolutistic altitude
where we have the truth, almost authoritarian.
So I'm curious to hear in your experience,
what percentage of it is that, if that's right?
And then how do you work with leaders
to try and make fine-grain distinctions
so that they're not sort of dismissing all of progressivism
as just this, just this sort of absolutistic,
because from an orange perspective,
they'd be correctly seeing that as, you know,
regressive and sort of a drag.
So yeah, I'm curious to hear your thoughts
about how you help leaders think through the dynamics,
the complicated dynamics between these different worldviews.
Well, I mean, there's no easy answer for that.
The first thing we do is just help leaders
to recognize that these worldviews exist,
because so many of our clients
have never really thought about this.
They make these assumptions that, you know,
everybody's making meaning the way I'm making meaning.
And so by just starting with the fact
that there are distinctions,
our clients are like, smoke comes out their ears.
And then to bring in the light and shadow.
Oh, so I don't have to conflate the shadow with the person
or the shadow of everyone in that worldview
that everybody is like the shadow because they're not.
And we get them to take responsibility
that there's a shadow where they stand.
And we have to have them do a self-assessment of
where is the shadow of my own worldview?
And so David, what that does is that's destabilizing enough
just to start to get them to start groping into
a more nuanced and complex set of questions.
And we often are, and I'll use a rubber band here,
our clients and the leaders we work with
are problem solvers.
So when they experience tension,
their assumption is that's a problem to be solved.
I gotta solve that.
One of the ways that you actually get rid of tension
is the denial or the avoiding of the conflict.
And so we work with our clients
to build a new relationship with tension
where they can actually be in a creative tension.
And we help them understand that,
yes, there's destructive tension.
If I pulled too hard on this, the rubber band would break.
But if I bring the enough tension where I have energy,
there's energy for transformation and change.
That the generative process of development requires energy.
And we help our clients to realize,
maybe I need to build a new relationship
with tension itself.
And maybe when I'm in the presence,
like I will reveal a couple of weeks ago, I gave a speech.
It was a higher ground speech,
very similar to the slides you just saw.
It got a standing ovation, which my ego loved, okay?
And I'm still in my own work.
The reason I know how far I have to go
is that when I get a standing ovation,
I actually get a hit of like, oh, validation.
And when people are not that enthusiastic after my speech,
I actually feel like I want validation.
So I know I'm still far from being high up
on the developmental progression,
because I get these clues.
But my assumption was the speech was well received.
Two women came up to me after the speech
because I asked for feedback.
I said, if you have feedback, please come find me.
I'd love feedback, especially feedback
that is critical of my presentation.
And these were two black women who were so courageous
and they were so passionate.
And they came to me and they gave me exactly what I asked for.
And they helped me to realize that I,
they told me they did not like my speech.
They told me they were offended by my speech.
They would not introduce themselves by name.
And it was a conference with name badges
and the one woman who was speaking
on behalf of the two of them took her badge off
before she came over to speak to me.
When I put my hand out and introduced myself,
she wouldn't introduce herself and wouldn't shake my hand.
And they came at me hard, guys.
When I say hard, hard, it was aggressive.
And this is what I felt.
And what I wanted to do was walk away, okay?
Because I felt like it was inappropriate
how aggressive they were coming.
But I stayed in it and I took a big deep breath.
And I, and they kept coming and I said to them,
the feedback you're giving me right now is really hard.
I'm really struggling.
I'm super confused and I want you to keep coming.
Don't stop.
And I just, I just, and they just kept coming.
And the more they came at me,
the more I surrendered and stayed in this tension
and just said to myself,
oh, this is me at my growth edge.
This is me actually needing to learn and grow.
And I actually got so, I got so like relaxed,
almost like the idea of surrendering to win
that they calmed down.
And the more the softer I got, the softer they got.
It was like a 10 minute conversation.
And then I said, tell me more, tell me more, tell me more.
And what they were really upset by
is I told a story on that speech
about when George Floyd was murdered
about how disoriented it was, disorienting it was for me.
And I talked about the Tom Peters idea
that if you're not confused, you're not paying attention.
And I said, I was so confused.
And I went to my neighbors and I was outside
a couple of days after George Floyd was killed.
And they said to me, Rand, you don't look good.
And I was like, I hadn't been, I wasn't sleeping.
I was crying. I was super disoriented.
And I said, guys, I'm not good.
Like, what do you mean?
What's wrong with me?
Like, aren't you paying attention like George Floyd?
And they're like, George who?
Cause look, I live in a neighborhood
with a bunch of rich white guys
and they weren't paying attention.
And I was paying attention.
And because I was paying attention, I was confused.
And they weren't confused.
So these women said to me, it took me four years.
I got this feedback two weeks ago.
They said they were offended that I would suggest
that anyone would be confused by that
because if you grew up the way they grew up,
it wasn't confusing at all to them.
And so now I actually am more sensitive to the fact
that when I'm in front of a group of people
and I tell that story, I don't want to tell that story
without also recognizing that other people
from a different life, different color skin
were not confused by that.
But the fact that I didn't have that nuance
really upset them.
And I'm very grateful that I got that feedback.
But guys, oh, oh.
And at the end of the 10 minutes,
the woman put her hand out
and she introduced herself by name.
And so that was my feedback that this worked.
A part of me wanted to like attack them, okay?
A part of me wanted to fight.
Another part of me wanted to run away
because I could have easy said,
hey guys, I don't need this and walk to it.
But this is what we're trying to teach our clients how to do.
How do you stay in the heat?
This is really hard work.
And most people don't want to do this hard work.
They want to outsource this to their diversity consultant.
And they're like, they're looking at their consultant
and the consultant needs to be saying to their client,
you're not going to get stronger watching me do push-ups.
You can't, you can outsource almost everything
if you're successful and you're powerful,
but you can't outsource your own development.
And this is what we need people to do
is to step into their own work.
I don't know, David, if that's helping at all, but...
The story was all you needed.
That was great.
Thank you.
All right, thank you.
John, John, dupe, dupe, dupew.
Dupe.
Dupe.
Dupe, right.
Dupe.
Yeah, and anyway, I just want to thank you for this
and such a healthy, powerful expression of our integral thing
that you're doing, it's really great.
And I almost want to pass
because I don't know how this directly applies
to the work you're doing,
but I would value your opinion on seeking a higher ground.
And for the last, and how this affects the companies
and the populations that you're working with,
for the last 25 years I've watched,
I said, I noted a long time ago that we,
if there wasn't some way to absorb the,
not the immigration, but the migration,
in other words, millions of people crossing borders
of different languages, different cultures,
different developmental levels,
it would lead to the rise of the reactionary right,
neo-fascism, and be a great threat to liberal democracies,
which we see in Hungary, we see in Sweden,
we see in our country,
Russia's weaponizing immigration with Finland.
I mean, Brexit, without that,
it probably wouldn't have happened.
And so, and there's different perspectives
from each of these levels,
the progressive, traditionalists and achievers.
And, you know, there's,
definite problems and there's definite good things.
Like we get this dynamic workforce
and millions of people are willing to work hard
for less than we'd have to pay an American.
I mean, there's good stuff.
And I've worked with a lot of them.
They're very hard-working and have a lot of integrity,
for the most part.
And then again, there's bad people,
as Donald likes to tell us all the time.
But have you seen that pressure
asserting itself in the work that you do?
And have you been able to work with these different perspectives
that each of these different levels bring
and find a higher level of an integral thing
that could really help us successfully deal with this
given fact of the mass migrations all over the world,
of people in, you know, threatening different cultures
and different developmental levels.
Is there any light in your work, in that particular?
I'm smiling because I look at the time
we got eight minutes left.
I'm gonna, you say you were gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass on trying to try to even answer
a really important, beautiful, complex question.
And I'll give a couple of sort of,
like just wondering for myself.
I wonder what the consequences are
of embracing so much immigration and so much diversity
that we lose a shared center.
And if we don't have a center
in which we are able to subordinate ourselves to,
which was at least what I was growing up,
the one thing I felt American shared in common,
especially during the Cold War was a patriotism,
that we were Americans.
Yes, I'm a Texan and someone else is from California
and someone else from New York, but we're Americans.
And if we continue to see the loss of the center
because of this demand for multiculturalism,
and this is counterintuitive again,
the multiculturalism that can exist so
in such a healthy way at the periphery of a society
can only exist if there's a strong center.
And this is why blue is so important going forward.
We must renew and reconnect to what created
at a classical liberal Western values, Judeo-Christian values,
what created the United States
and what created so many European countries
was these foundations that civilizations
are losing touch with.
And so the question is, instead of trying to dismantle,
how do we renew and revitalize?
I'm gonna hand it off to Steve here,
which is a great segue because I believe,
and this is crazy that I say this,
but hey, I get to say this.
And if clients don't wanna work with us, I don't care
because we don't work with big public companies
that have to deal with all the politics
and all the pressure from social media.
We work with people who are business owners.
And we're like, if you don't wanna work with us,
don't work with us, but this is spiritual work.
We are unapologetic.
The work of higher ground is spiritual work.
And we can define spirituality as having a recognition
that I am a part of something bigger than myself.
And I can be an atheist and still be spiritual
because I feel connected to the cosmos,
because I feel connected to nature.
But we've got to start to recognize
that this is not an intellectual journey.
It is a journey that requires a spiritual orientation.
And Steve, give us a few little nuggets of wisdom.
Well, let me just say amen to what you just said.
Yeah, me too, thank you.
Part of your spiritual work, yeah.
Really, really helpful, appreciate it.
So just a comment and then a quick question.
The comment is, I just want everybody
to really appreciate how important it is.
And what an excellent job Rand
and his organization have done at simplifying this, right?
Because it's complex, but in the course of simplifying it,
it's been like a learning lab for the theory.
I mean, the theory has been improved.
So for example, Rand's got their achiever
instead of modernism, right?
Like, well, you got to call it modernity.
That's what it is.
And he tried it out.
I tried it.
I tried it a bit more.
And they just like, we're in tears in the headlight
when you mention that term.
So I appreciate that achiever for the audiences
that you're speaking to is actually much more digestible.
And I think that the simplicity of it is really,
it's illuminated the way I understand there.
We sort of came to that together.
You mentioned it.
That is, the simplest truth is what does development mean,
right?
Everybody, you made it clear that development
is this higher ground
and that everybody should naturally want to aspire to that.
And what does that mean?
It simply means expanding the scope of what you can value.
I mean, you know, there's more to it than that,
but in the spirit of let's get down to the brass taxes
and say it as distinctly and as simply as we can,
that's what you're offering in this excellent presentation
is a way of people thinking about
what it could mean practically to increase the scope
of their value by valuing the light,
you know, of all of these cultural structures.
So that we've learned some things
from your on the ground, you know, development of all this.
The question, we're the arena, as I told Steve,
I said, Steve, I get with Steve, I say, give me some stuff.
And he's like, oh, here's some stuff.
You know, here's a book.
Here's an article that I go into the arena with my team
and we work, we'll work with 3,000 leaders this year
in programs that are 15 weeks to 52 weeks.
I mean, this is deep, deep work with people
and we'll just get beat up and we'll be like,
that didn't work, that didn't work, that didn't work.
This work, let's keep doing that.
And this is how we iterate, rapid prototyping.
And so, yeah, Steve, I know we're gonna,
we only got three minutes, but if you have a question,
I'll do my best to probably.
Okay, well, just the simple question is,
when we, you mentioned our Zoom conversation,
so we started to have like in April of 2020,
right, the pandemic had hit.
And at the time, you know, it was actually
before George Floyd's death.
And then immediately afterwards,
like in the six months between, you know,
July and the end of 2020, diversity, equity, inclusion
within the business community
had become like a day-reger thing.
It's like, like if you didn't have
an accounting department, right?
You have to have a DEI bureaucracy
or you're not, you know, you're a poor business person.
And of course, you know, we've been the gamble,
we've seen it, we see the backlash that is occurring now.
And I'm just wondering whether you see it
having a long curve or whether it's gonna transform
into something that's less green or, you know,
what do you see the future of DEI
from what you've gleaned from your business travels?
I am not optimistic, which is very disappointing.
I feel like the pendulum is swinging
and continues to swing.
I talked to three leaders in the last week
that are shutting down their DEI initiatives.
I talked to a DEI consultant who's changing
his business offering because the demand
for his consulting services is diminishing so fast
that he's now reinventing himself
and doing other kinds of consulting.
I think you're gonna see, I think we're gonna see
a continued rapid decline of DEI.
And I think we're gonna see an emergence of something
that will be, that will be more,
this is the irony, more inclusive.
We've, I went to, I'll end with this,
I went and gave a speech in October to a group
and I put up a big tent.
And I said, we need to have a big tent.
And then I said, we need a tent, a community
that includes black and white, male and female,
LGBTQ ally, LGBTQ critic.
We need people who are fossil fuel executives
and people who are environmental activists
in the same room.
And then I said to them, and they were really freaked out.
I said, you are in a room,
because I knew the room pretty well.
It was about 300 people, 300 CEOs.
I said, you are in a room right now
with half the people in this room
are going to, given the opportunity,
are gonna vote for Donald Trump.
And half the people in this room,
given the opportunity, are gonna vote for Biden.
Look around.
You're in the room with people who are way more diverse
than you may realize from a diversity of viewpoint and thought.
And I think, Steve, that we're gonna have to tackle
the complexity that we've got to.
Now, I don't think it's gonna be under the banner of DEI.
I think we're already seeing a shift to DNI,
diversity and inclusion.
DNI is what it's being called.
And I'm just noticing this,
that the E is just dropping off
with certain more complex organizations
are already leading the way on that.
So I do predict that DNI will be the next iteration
and we'll see what happens.
And I'm committed to being a part
in some small way of the solution.
I wish I could wave a magic wand
and there'd just be the solution out there,
but I have very little hope
that the progressives are gonna solve this.
I think we're gonna have to solve it
by bringing the beauty of green
and the progressive approach to diversity
and the beauty of orange and the beauty of blue
in the conversation.
And so with that, it is 731.
We're already one minute over.
You're gonna get the slides.
You're gonna get, I'm gonna put together,
Nigel, I'm gonna put together a little care package.
I'm gonna put a video link to a Heineken commercial,
which is gonna blow your mind.
It's five minutes and it's gonna blow your mind.
It's the best media I have seen on higher ground
and of the humanity of coming together.
It's so good.
Watch that video.
It's on YouTube, so it's a YouTube link.
I'm gonna put in the follow-up.
I'll give you my slides
and I will include a couple of links.
Nigel, I'll get this done before midnight tonight
and send it to you.
I'll curate a couple of other things
that people who got their curiosity peaked.
Some additional one other video from Reba Wisdom
that took me two years to find this 45 minute interview
with a woman who I actually think from London
has an incredible point of view on diversity.
And another link to a video,
it's 11 minutes of a headmistress in London
who's maybe the best example
of how conservative values
can create a rich multicultural diverse community
out of school that she runs.
And it's mind-boggling what she's doing
with Christian lower C conservative values,
creating the conditions for a thriving diversity,
which doesn't seem like those two go together.
And you guys enjoy your adventures and your journey.
And I hope to come back as a attendee at another one of these
and listen into the wonderful teachers
and guess that you guys get to hear from regularly.
And thank you again for the invitation, Steve
and everyone for being here.
Thank you, Ran.
Ran, thank you so much.
Thanks, Ran.
Thanks, guys.
