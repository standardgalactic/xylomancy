Hi and welcome to my introduction to the compositing notes in Cycle Splendor.
And this is as I said just an introduction so I will go through the basic very briefly
so you know what the compositing can do and then I will have new and other sessions that
we go into the depth of each thing that we can manage in the compositing.
But this is just an overview.
And we could go right into it so you start with Shader 3D View on the Note Editor.
And the Note Editor normally has the shader but we are going to use the compositing so
we are selecting the second one here.
And then you have three options.
Use Notes, Backdrop and Out Render.
And before I go through them we will start creating another windows as well where we
select UV Image Editor.
Okay, use notes, normal as in shader.
When you check it, it gets two default notes here.
And when it comes to compositing, it's about the render layers and you have the composite.
The render layer is the input and the composite is the output.
And then you can of course put a lot of notes between them.
When thinking about the compositing, it's like you have done your 3D Blender object.
You think you are finished and everything is fine.
Then comes the compositing.
You need to do some color adjustments.
You need to perhaps add two images to merge them together, create one image of them, add
some glare or whatever.
In that case you should use the compositing.
And the compositing is also good for things like the camera tracking, doing visual effects
and so on.
Today we are going to add three images and then merge them together using different methods.
But use notes, as we have checked here, we will add the default.
Next thing we can use is backdrop if we want that.
And backdrop is to get the final image behind the note so we can see them.
And out render we do not need that this session.
And that is if you do something in 3D and you do a change on that one and want that
to render again, instead of going up here and select render, you can just press out
render and it will take in every change that you do automatically without your need to
go to render.
The setup will be, as I said, three images and I have written the links for those on
the text below this video.
So you can just click on them.
These are my own image that I did a few years ago and I have not used the compositing on
that at all before this session.
But that one you should download.
And then we have pixels.
Pexels is a great place where you can get a lot of free images that you can use in several
occasions without any license problems at all.
So that's a good site.
We will have a meadow for that one.
And finally, I also found a good image to use as a background.
And all these free images are free to use and can use them as you want to without any
problems.
OK, so download these and then we can start.
Going back to a blender, as I said, this is the render layers and the render layers is
connected to the 3D object that you're doing.
And it says render layers with an S because that you can have several layers when you
do the rendering and separate those in the render part and then merge them together in
the compositing.
But today we're just going to use image.
So we can delete that one and select shift A and input and select an image.
And if I select that image and connect it to the composite and I do a render, you can
see it's still black because we have not opened anything, but we select opened and I select
my images in here and you select your image and I start with my bulb.
And now you can see that I have the result here, the bulbs, and I have the image input
here and the output here, OK?
What I now can do is, of course, add another image, which I will do.
So I will have an input, an image, and in this one I will put the meadow.
So compositing in my case, meadow, and then I have that one here.
And if I select that instead, you will get the meadow here.
If you look at the result, you can see that something is a little bit strange here because
here you have this part of the flower and you'd miss it here and so on.
And that is because of this image size.
It's much bigger than the render size and it just crops everything away that is outside
that range.
So to use this image, we need to adapt the scale for that image to be as the resulting
image.
So there we can select shift A and distort.
And in distort you find scale, so we put the scale in here and change it to render size.
And as soon as you change it to render size, you get the complete image here.
Then you can select if you want to stretch the image or you want to fit it in or crop
the image.
So it's a little bit up to what type of image you're using, how wide it is, and so on.
So you find what you like to have in the parameters here.
So just put distortion and scale and you have that image.
As you could see of the result in the beginning of this session, I will try to put this meadow
behind the bulbs and it will show through the bulbs.
So we will see how we can do that.
So we connect the image again and now you can see the image here and what we now should
do is take and try to take away the white in this.
And one thing that the compositing can do is key things away from an image.
You have a key and a key have different settings for let's say color or for difference between
an image or for something else.
You just need something to look on that you can see.
If you can see a pattern or a color that you can take away, then the key will do that.
So if you take the key in here and put the image into the key color or image and put
that to the image here.
You could see that the bulbs here will now be alpha here.
You will lose all the color.
So you could, if you want to, then just add that image into this as well.
And that you will do using shift A color and alpha over.
Alpha over will put one picture above the other picture and if I now connect this as
the picture in the bottom and I take the other one here at the top and press convert pre-multiply.
Then we have the meadow behind the bulbs here.
Then we of course need to do something to make it look a little bit nicer.
I can make this a little bit bigger like this.
You can see it's very hard edge here and it's not nice at all.
So what can we do?
We have a lot of parameters in keying as you can see.
Pre-blur it's before doing the keying.
We blurred image.
Then we also have post-blur that we will blur the image after.
We also have clipping depending on colors and we have dilute erode which is smoothing
of the edges in that amount that we put in here.
And as you can see it will change when I change things here and you can see it gets smoother
on the edges.
By selecting post-blur like this we could also get as you can see all that white to
go away a little bit since it's blurred away like this.
So you can play with these things and that part making that alpha was because of the
key color here.
So we used the key color white and those were very white.
If I had another color here like this dark one then you could see that instead of all
the white then the dark colors got the alpha instead got the transparency.
But in our case we should use the white so we take this little thing here and select
the white and we are back to this image instead.
So it's not that hard to put in something in the bulbs using the compositor.
Then we also had some effects it was a glowing kind of thing around this and that we can
do in several steps.
So one of those is to add some type of filter and in our case we will use the sunbeam and
we will combine the sunbeam with the result that we have here.
So I just put in the sunbeam from the original image first of all and I can change the ray
length and if I disconnect this one and put in that one you can see a little bit how it
looks.
You will see that now you got these rays going out from each light source and the center is
where it's spread in these parameters so you have the width here so if you move that you
will see that it will change so now the center is a little bit more to the right and then
you have the height here.
I think we could keep it on the center here it will be good and now we should connect
that image with that image that we got here.
So then we just go into shift A again and select color and some mix of that and if we
take it like this then we have mixed it together but now it's one here so we have to take that
one down so let's say that we take it to 0.5 or something like that then you can see now
you see both the bulbs and this shining thing and you can see that you perhaps have to go
a little bit lower than that so just try again like this and finally you think that okay this
value is good and then stop of course.
So something like this and then we also could change perhaps the strength of the colors
the balance of the colors and so on and then you just put a color balance in so just shift
A again and color again and then you have the color balance and that normally you put
in last in the compositing and here could then change the colors to get darker or get brighter
but also to gain some brightness or you see the values you can change the gamma you can
change the gain you can change the lift and so on and now you get a little bit clear picture
here you can go up with the lift of the colors and so on so it's a lot of changing but of
course not just darkness and so you can also change if you want to have some different
colors in there so now you have more yellow since I changed the yellow color here could
also be that they will go even lower on that one to get it out and if I want to have some
extra glare before yeah for this image then I can put it in as well so just filter glare
and I can decide where I want it I can say that I want it here and then change the fresher
lift it's one nothing will change but if it's zero you will see that it will be a quite
different light on these so you can as normal change the value to something that you think
it's okay and then you can decide what type of glare you would like to have so you can
change it to ghost or to yeah whatever and that is just to try and see what what you
like in this case you can see it's getting a nice type of effect it's like almost like a fog
is around these bulbs and yeah you can just play with the values as you want to then as I said I
also would like to have some type of we said free images so I'm to have a background where we have
the ocean so how should we do that we used keying before to get the transparency or the alpha
but another way to do it is use mask so we can mask away things here as well and we will try that so
if you go to this image and change the render image to the bulbs then we have the original image
here and we change view to mask then we can work and create the mask over the image and then we
just select new to get the name for the mask and we can just select it like I don't know sky
some yeah yeah sky and now we should build it and to build the sky just press control and the mouse
click and then you can just create a very easy and we can say we can have it on that or hide
something like this and if you want to connect that point with the first point then you just
hold on alt and c and now you have a mask to change this you can just click on the line
and with control and you get a new
something here now I have three of these and then you can just move them around
so we can get something and
can put them out when you are doing a mask you can always try to put the the points a little bit
outside of the
of the object that you want we like the mask so I will put
I will drag them out just a little bit here
and I will add another point here just hold control down and the mouse
so then you get your another
point where you would like to have it something like this and here I need
one point here I believe here and perhaps a few points here as well to be able to change
things so I can go like this when you press point and then press v like this then you get
different types of modifications that you can use so if I use like this a line single I get this
handle here and then I can take take that handle and I can drag it up and down and move it a little
bit to get a soft corner and I can do I can take another type here if I want to so they are not
connected in any way so that makes that in this way you can make it very very good I will not do
all of these things because it will take some time but you will see now I have some type of mask here
anyway that is called sky and again I'll get back to view it is still saved even you can't see it
and we can put it in here if you want to so I can now shift a input an image
up here somewhere and in that image I will put that ocean picture that we had so compositing
and I think it will do like this and then we have this one and now I have this ocean here
and I would try to put that ocean into my image of course so I then take another mix here
so color mix put them together
and I can do like this you can see the render result when I am working like this okay
and then of course we need the other image as well
and now you can see it's going above each other and we do not like that so
then we can take another input and this time you can use mask and in this little face here
you can select what type of mask you want because now we created one but you can have
as many as you want to and then you put that mask into the factor to decide where you would
like to mask the picture and where it doesn't want to so now you can see now the bulbs are
masked away and if it's getting like that then it's just to invert these and you will then get
the other way around of course so now you can see as I said before I don't I didn't do it
so so very very carefully but you can see now how it's done here it looks like it's cut out
and doesn't look so smooth and so on so how to change that well that you can do by putting in
a feather in here so shift A and in the let's see in the filter you have dilate a road so select
that one and put it in here and select feather and if I take that up like this
you will see now that it will shrink around everything and make a very very nice
round thing here but it is blurry and if I can go a little bit less then will be less
blur of course and that is a little bit how good you have been with the mask now if you have done
something wrong it's not that hard to change the mask again because all you have to do is go back
to the view again and select mask again and as you can see I had some really bad issues here so
then I just changed that and as soon as I change it it will be affected of on here so it will you
can always see how it will look here so then you can fine tune it as much as you want until you are
satisfied with this mask so go back to view again and you can get this as I said a really good result
but you have to work a little bit with your image to make it as good as you want to the distance
could go both ways now we go up and it cuts nearer these bulbs you can also have a negative
number and then it will go the other way around so then it will take from go out instead of go
instead of going in to these bulbs so that is a little bit how that works the only thing I
will show you more this time is how to check the image before it reaches the end because you have
something here that is output viewer and you can have as many viewers as you want to and if you
connect that viewer to something like I connected to the image here or whatever then I get the back
drop here to work and now when I look at my backdrop I can see everything from where I connect this
viewer and now I have it on the ocean I can add another one so shift input sorry output
output viewer and I connected to let's see why not here like that and then the backdrop will be
from this viewer and if I now select that viewer I will be back here so it's very easy if I want to
work with a complicated node to have a lot of viewers and then select whatever view I would
like to see for the moment and to change the size of the backdrop it's very easy yes press V to go
back and then Alt V to zoom in and that is the basic and I will as I said go through everything
that is to know about the compositing also how you do all the effects camera tracking and everything
but that will take in later sessions small steps just so learn and I hope you learned
something this time as well and if you think it's interesting and would like to see more
then just subscribe and have a nice day bye
