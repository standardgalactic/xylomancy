Checking CLEA, Free University of Brussels (VUB)/Anne Dippel： Temporality and Thingness. Towards Manyworlding Futures in⧸of Anthropology.txt
1. Zlatka Hristova, a physicist from Cambridge, discussed the impact of AI and automation on jobs with a group of young professionals and students. She pointed out that while some jobs will inevitably be replaced by software, many others will change rather than disappear. She believes that the future job market will require people to adapt and come up with new ideas.

2. Zlatka also mentioned that in fields like finance, AI can handle most tasks but humans will still be needed to make final decisions because machines cannot yet understand nuanced human needs and ethical considerations.

3. A finance manager in the audience agreed that AI would dominate financial tasks but emphasized that human judgment is irreplaceable when it comes to making strategic financial decisions.

4. The conversation touched on the cultural context of science, including the history of the Large Hadron Collider and the tensions between American and European physicists.

5. Zlatka was asked about the future of anthropology in 100 years, a question she found intriguing but didn't have time to fully address. She suggested this could be a topic for another discussion.

6. The event was well-received, and attendees were encouraged to send any further questions or comments to Zlatka via email, which would be shared on the event's coordination website and possibly uploaded to Claire's YouTube channel.

7. Upcoming events in the series were advertised, with hopes that participants would continue discussions in person, particularly in Brussels.

8. The session concluded with thanks from the organizers, who invited everyone to join future events and continue engaging in these important conversations about the future of work and other fields.

1. **Knowledge Representation in Expert Systems**: The early days of expert systems involved capturing the knowledge of human experts and translating it into logical rules that the system could use to make decisions or diagnoses. However, not all expertise can be easily reduced to a set of rules, especially when it involves complex patterns of influence where some factors are more influential than others.

2. **Backward vs. Forward Reasoning**: Backward reasoning starts with the desired outcome and works backward to determine what steps or conditions are necessary to achieve that outcome. Forward reasoning, on the other hand, starts with known conditions and infers possible outcomes.

3. **Predictive Processing**: This is a theory in neuroscience suggesting that the brain is constantly making predictions about sensory input and updating its model of the world based on the error between its predictions and actual sensory data.

4. **Free Improvisation**: In music or performance arts, free improvisation relies on the performer's intuition and experience to create spontaneous compositions without predefined structures or rules.

5. **Surprise and Equilibria**: The concept of surprise refers to our ability to predict events, and equilibria in systems refers to a state where all variables are in balance. In decision-making, surprising events can lead to reevaluation of the current state of knowledge.

6. **Nonlinear Knowledge**: This is an idea that knowledge isn't always linear or step-by-step, but can be a complex web of interrelated concepts and experiences. It suggests that our intuitions are often based on this nonlinear understanding.

7. **Birthday Celebration**: The session took a short break to celebrate the birthdays of Olivier and Mai Garces, with participants singing "Happy Birthday" to them.

8. **Next Steps**: The group will reconvene at 2:30 PM on Zoom after lunch, ready to continue discussions or activities as planned for the day. Security measures were discussed to ensure that everything is locked up and secure during the break.

1. The conversation revolved around the concept of a cognitive boundary or horizon, as proposed by Francis Heyligers, which represents the extent of an individual's awareness and influence, including their ability to perceive and respond to their environment and make decisions based on that perception.

2. There is an interest in the idea that meaning can be stored in light, such as through quantum phenomena like photon clouds, which could potentially enable communication or connections beyond the cognitive boundary. This topic was discussed in light of recent experiments that hint at such possibilities.

3. The term "prospect" was introduced to describe the notion of the cognitive boundary, which aligns with Francis Heyligers' concept. Prospect encompasses both the potential for positive outcomes (what one can move towards) and the avoidance of negative ones (potential dangers).

4. Teyade Shar's philosophy was mentioned as having intuitions similar to the cognitive boundary or prospect idea, emphasizing complexity, consciousness, and their evolution in conjunction with each other.

5. The importance of interdisciplinary connections was highlighted, particularly in relation to design and the artistic process, where questions about the formation of shapes and the system's knowledge of when it is 'right' are central.

6. The host, Michael, announced a short break for coffee and informed the participants that they would reconvene shortly for the final talk by Massimiliano Santin on transport networks and their modeling, suggesting that current modeling methods might be inadequate.

7. The recording was stopped to allow for the preparation of video content for those attending virtually, with an expectation to resume after a brief intermission.

1. The conversation revolves around the concept of reductionism and its limitations. It's noted that every model or theory is a simplification (reduction) of reality, and while models are useful for prediction and understanding, they should not be confused with the actual complexities of the real world.

2. Reductionism, as mentioned, is a worldview that focuses on explaining phenomena by breaking them down into simpler parts or components, often neglecting the complex interactions between these parts.

3. The speaker emphasizes that reductionism assumes fixed particles with definite properties and laws, which can be limiting and may not capture the full essence of reality.

4. An alternative approach is proposed, which is an "open-unlit model" that does not make strict ontological assumptions about the fundamental nature of reality. Instead, it focuses on conditions and their transformations, recognizing patterns of stability and self-maintenance without being tied to specific mechanisms or timing.

5. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability, enabling the model to change as new insights are gained, thus avoiding the pitfalls of an overly rigid reductionist framework.

6. The speaker acknowledges the importance of communication and the challenge of representing the full complexity of reality through language and symbols, which inherently involve simplification.

7. The session concludes with a thank you to everyone in attendance, both physically present and online, acknowledging their participation and contributions to the discussion.
