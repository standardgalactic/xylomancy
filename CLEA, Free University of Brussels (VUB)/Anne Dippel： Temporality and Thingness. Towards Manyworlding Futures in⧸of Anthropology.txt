So Anne, the floor is yours, we already see your slides.
So put the spotlight on the floor, welcome.
Yeah, thank you very much.
Before I start my talk and dive into,
I just would like to know
what your personal academic background is.
So you do not have to talk too much,
just everybody who's from the STEM field
should please raise her or his or their arms
so that I know whether anybody, okay.
So we have one STEM person, two STEM persons,
three STEM persons, four STEM persons, thank you very much.
And is there anybody of the humanities
and social science background of philosophy also?
Okay, wonderful, okay.
So since there are more people who are
in the STEM background than not,
I will just briefly give in two sentences,
I try to let you know what we are actually doing
as anthropologists, because as I once met a very old physicist
who still has been raised in the tradition of
Werner Heisenbach and others, many people think
anthropology is something that everybody can do,
but actually anthropology is involving also
a huge set of methodology and is a year long training
of doing field work amongst people.
And some people do field work in foreign cultures
to themselves, other do field work
within their home cultures.
And the third people do field work in knowledge cultures.
And I'm an anthropologist of physics and computer science.
That means that I'm actually living with
and have been living with physicists
and computer scientists for the past eight years.
And I'm really diving into the world,
I'm learning their language,
I'm experiencing what they experience,
and experience is also the most central term
of what we're doing as anthropologists.
That means that we already know very much
that what we see is biased by our own observations,
and that of course everything we observed
within the real world can be just described
as approximation by ourselves.
So when we do field work, we have developed
over the past 150 years a tool set
that allows us to differentiate
what is our own perceptual bias.
And on the other hand, what we can see in the field
and where we actually invent the field.
And that's very much important
because there's very often, especially from the STEM field,
the question when we're not working with numbers
and we stop working with statistics predominantly,
we have been and do work with statistics,
we call that mixed methods,
but we predominantly work with interviews,
with language, with listening to the people,
we act with actually experiencing their lives.
And anthropologists therefore is a training
and since we are time bound human deadly beings,
it takes time to become an anthropologist.
So that's what we actually do.
And that allows us to live with the people
and to understand what's their concern.
And what I'm going to do today with you
is to tell you out of my research
that I did in the last years.
And dive into the question of future.
And I think that's very much of importance,
especially when you work within the field
of quantum mechanics, artificial intelligence
and so on and so on,
because these fields are really shaping the digital era
and transforming the whole world
and the whole communities we're living in.
And that's something that's rather my turf.
So I'm looking very much forward also to the discussions
that we have and we will have.
In the last years, I have been, for example,
publishing last year, came out a book first in German,
The Translations in Process,
where I did an ethnography of the computer simulation
of the quantum mechanical double slit experiment
in a single event-based computer simulation
at the research center in Jülich
and compared it with the quantum mechanical double slit
experiments conducted in Vienna today.
And came out with a comparison actually
but about the Schroediger equation on the one hand
and on the other hand, computer simulation.
So different forms of approximating reality
on the one hand based on first principles in mathematics,
on the other hand based on the approximation to truth
by a single event computer simulation.
And these produce different forms of reality
or interpretations of reality,
which doesn't mean that there isn't any truth anymore,
but the problem of course is,
and you're more aware than I am,
that with simulation you can actually show everything
that you want to and then everything
that could be considered as reality
can be put into equality with what is actually
the real reality itself.
And that was quite a challenge and also a lot of fun
because quantum mechanics is something
that is posing all these questions
and shattering the understanding of nature
more than anything else.
Something that wasn't so bizarre to us as anthropologists
because for us the world is in itself always either or
and not neither or but neither nor
and has these kinds of entanglements.
So what we found out in the last years
resonates very well with what quantum mechanics
and other disciplines found out.
And in the last years also I dealt a lot
with anthropology of play and games
with the interrelations of facts and fictions
and how cosmologies are made
and what role science has these days
where fictions are shattering the world of fact making.
In the next 45 minutes,
so I will first of all bring you onto a journey
and in the field of humanities and social sciences
where I'm classically trained,
we very often read written texts.
We are text-based and written hermeneutical disciplines.
We love writing and so please lay back
and bear that it was important to me to write down for you
and what I have been saying
because it mattered so much to me what I wanted to tell you
that I tried to put it into my rusty German English
because more I'm not able to do than rusty German English.
And in this journey,
I will first tell you how I actually ended up at CERN,
how I came to this field work that I did
and that I'm going to present you.
And then I will dive into the question of uncertainty
that stem scientists encounter on all levels
and what we actually as anthropologists can see and observe
how rhythms of mechanical technology and algorithmic
and also human uncertainty are going into an interplay
which transform each individual
that is doing actually science
within an experimental field turns it from an individual
into something that I call intravisual
and how I'm coming to that point
and to describe how this collaboration
of different people doing field work
turning from individuals in entanglement with others
to intravisuals to actually produce science
and to make things happen.
That's something I wanna take you onto a journey with
in the next minutes.
So far, any questions from your side?
Wonderful.
So, field work is a form of memoir making.
Reminds us anthropologist Ruth Behar.
From that perspective, it is a cultural fact-making
of a future yet to come.
Maybe that explains why anthropologists did not focus
on future as a cultural fact
until Arjun Apadurai reminded the discipline.
We were blinded by our own deformation profession
by the obvious movement of our own way of knowledge production
with field notes and recorded interviews
and tempted by collective interests
and individuals need to know where we or they are coming from.
Because as already in Odysseys,
people want to know where they're living
and where they're coming from.
But since the future is uncertain,
that's something we do not actually investigate so much with
because we are not fortune tellers.
But it becomes more and more important
in a time of computer simulation
where you actually have to foresee and you can
and you have tools to foresee and estimate futures
quite precisely.
And that is where anthropology becomes interesting
when you think about the future
and how the future is made.
A long time ago, anthropology was a space bound
and historiography a time bound discipline.
Anthropology deals with futures and realities
and what is happening in the now.
And historiography is looking into the past.
The first anthropology mistrusted by design
how the past is made through archival sources
because who chooses what is going into the archives?
Who chooses the truth of the past?
Why the latter, historiography,
mistrusted any investigations of the contemporary
as already the philosopher Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel summed it up.
The flight of my nervous old is blind in the now.
We cannot understand the now
because we are part of the present.
And it was this Hegel's challenge
encountered by the ethnographer's attempt
to understand what is going on right now
that turned me into an anthropologist
from historiography coming.
And it is this challenge that drives me from now on
to the days that are coming.
I always was drawn to understand
what humans make out of this being in
and beyond space, time and matter.
And that is what I will talk about.
In the following minutes, I want to contribute to the question
how different futures are being practiced,
narrated, placed and made tangible in everyday life worlds.
I'm doing so by reflecting upon ethnographic insights.
I gathered over the past eight years
in the falling empire that discursively
and technically arraigned what Karen Barat,
the philosopher and physicist called
I quote, imperialism of universal space and time.
I'm talking about physics
and to be more precise, high energy physics.
Why I consider this a falling empire
and not a raining empire we can talk about later.
I'm very curious about it.
And I'm also taking up the challenge to discuss this.
I'm telling tales how physicists deal with resistances
of materiality and masculinity.
I'm not aiming to explain to you again
the cosmology and technologies of physics
with the help of feminist science and technology studies
or to retell you how physicists do their job.
I did this elsewhere and I think there are enough people
in this room who know much better
and more about this than I do.
And others actually did this already
like Sharon Traweeg, Karen Knott-Cetina
or the Belgian philosopher Isabel Stengels.
Rather, I try to give an account out of one of the centers
of the ruined and ruinous places of Europe,
this de-scented and misplaced territory of Gaia
as Pernolatur and others would call it.
It is an account of how people deal with uncertainty
out of concern and care for what they love most
which is in this case, an experimental system of physics.
I'm looking for what is a wondrous future to them
which is to understand what constitutes our cosmos,
I quote, from a physical point of view
and collaborate in a common universal enterprise
that includes everything and excludes exclusivity
in the end.
My ethnography is the account of a most cis,
hetero and male white dominant field.
Its origins of organization and community
are dating back to war to the Second World War,
the atom bomb plus alamos.
Physics people did learn to love the bomb
when it just existed as a vague plan.
In fact, they made it up.
These people are Stanley Kubrick's blueprints
and they're not.
For where is normativity and power,
there is resistance and subversion also
and foremost amongst physicists.
And even physicists' identities aren't either all
or especially physicists' identities aren't dualist
but carefully monitored and risk-managed.
Yes, these guys, as even women in the field
often call themselves, are separating nature and culture.
Yes, they seem to be hopeless platonics,
believing and proving mathematics idealism
and helpless Aristotelians observing and measuring nature
making up categories and models.
They mistrust their data and falsify hypothesis.
They pushed ethics into another department
but didn't we as anthropologists in Germany too
when we decided not to be a political discipline
after the Second World War
and what we are actually doing is transforming again
into a political discipline.
And that's very fascinating
but from a decolonial perspective
in times of identity crisis of Europe all over Europe.
You see, I will be talking from a West German
wide middle upper class perspective.
Not of my choice but of discursive attribution.
I like to see from any other point of view
but I come from these privileged worlds
and thus unlearn every day to look
and loosen up conceptions I grew up with.
Thus addicts met us to me on many levels
and rethinking the world from this ruined and ruinous place
employed by the university of Jena
that granted Karl Marx his PhD
and allowed Hegel to write his phenomenology of perception
just pushes me to understand local specificities
and global peculiarities
and ever more solidarity needing world
that craves for togetherness
and a sense of Guyon community
but fragments in small communities of indigeneities
that lose the big picture on the one hand
and in the meantime on the other
Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos battle
for the shuttle service to the moon.
Whatever we learned, no matter what we see,
intraactions and I'm deploying here the term of Karen Barat
that she developed out of the Copenhagen interpretation
of Nils Bohr,
interactions of realities that means phenomena
are emerging out of the interaction within the moment
and aren't pre-disposed.
Interactions of realities build the fundament
of our disciplinary insights.
Experience are not human made alone.
And chance as we all patients,
as well as patients are our most important assets
for doing a good analysis of our own empirical insight.
That's right. Yeah?
They're not basically true.
Excuse me.
Should I continue?
Are you still there?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
All right.
So I rather prefer not to talk about humans anymore
and we as an anthropology and that's also very interesting
our stop and reflect of how to call
actually our new alliances within the world.
And that makes it more even more interesting
because physics is dealing by definition
with what is not living while biology and so on
is dealing with what is alive.
And we are shattering these kind of conceptions
out of different reasons on the one hand
because there are many cosmologies like
Southern American cosmologies
or sub-antarctic cosmologies and people who live
in these regions who would never distinct
between living and unliving.
And on the other hand because
Bruno Latour and many others after the Gaia
development of James Lovelock and so on
come to another perception of understanding
the Earth and humans within the Earth
when they took the perspective out of
the extraterrestrial perspective on Earth
that emerged with the Kodak picture of 1972
of the Apollo Kodak picture of Earth.
So I like the word Terence
which is a new term, a post-humanist term
deployed by Deborah Danowski, Bruno Latour
and Eduardo Vivero Stikastu
for those aware and grounded beings
and things opposing modern just humans
and their objectifications.
And that allows me to understand anthropology
in a new way.
I study Anthropos and its ethnoi
so their people and communities on all scales
but I stopped to think this kind of kinship
that we traditionally had just amongst humans.
There are new modes of kin,
kin with Earth, kin with trees,
other forms of relations and that makes it all interesting.
And from an alien point of view
we are all Earthlings or Terence.
And it seems to me that this message
is the most important one one can share
out of my field of studying
the so-called reasonable physicists
because physicists actually have quite
a similar perception on these things.
And they are on the other hand
gatekeepers of modern humanism,
inventors of the World Wide Web Protocol
and main forces in the development
of computer simulations.
To dare to think from a future's perspective
to turn science fiction
into contemporary every day
was for me one of the most fascinating aspects
I observed at CERN.
CERN is a collaborative digital enterprise.
Each individual is connected to various media
and is transforming into something else.
Not only into a digital divideral
that's the concept that emerged by Marilyn
CERN to understand Papua New Guinea
societies which do not have
people there do not have an individualist concept
as we do have here in Europe.
But actually it seems to me
into something what I want to call
with the help of quantum mechanical
natural philosophy, intra-vigral.
So I'm connecting the intra
and the inner of the individual
on the one hand with the
collectivity and it turns
that in these kind of scientific collaborations
that are based on
digital tools
the solitary
of the single researcher
becomes a solitary being
with all its productive and destructive
forces and dynamics.
And what is really fascinating is that
physicists are all the time
not only trying to deal and resonate
with science fiction as a fixtures metaphor
but really try to think the future
and have to think the future
and how experiments are happening in the future.
I will come to this in the following.
In order to make this point
I get down to earth with you
into the everyday of fictions of science
or how bugs, Martin and
screw and others are intervening
everyday physics and how the biggest
resistance is coming from materiality
and also interestingly enough
a certain type of masculinity
and discursive practice and rights.
Physics can still teach us
especially how to deal with that
what we do not know and yet
how to deal with expectations and power
relations.
But first I want to tell you how I ended up
at CERN and what brought me into this situation
where I'm in right now.
In my first field I was doing research
in Vienna. I was discussing
with local artists and writers in Austria
about the relation of words
and worlds and what to make of it
when it comes to cultural identity politics.
From a German speaking case
that's very fascinating because some of you
might know that Hitler was Austrian
but he became
the leader
of the German
Empire
and after the Second World War the Austrians
had to become actually an own nation state
and they are a good example of successful
nation building. So the successful
creation of a collective identity
and writers played in a very important
role when it came up to deal with
the atrocities committed in the name of the
German people that Austrians tried to
push away from themselves but had to
made aware of course because
anti-Semitism and
everything that went along with the atrocities
committed and the crimes committed in
the name of the German people were also
committed in and by Austrians and from
Austrians too and that fascinated me a
lot and I came
into this field and did this research
and one wonders how do I end up at CERN
and there are many many different reasons why
one of them was actually an epistemic problem
and the epistemic problem was the question
how to deal and understand
what I said in the beginning
how to understand in real time
in the now something that is happening
while I'm part of what is part
of the system
and it was the hottest summer
in Vienna, a steel melting
heat near the New River
and one afternoon the sky
was filled with baroque clouds and rain
about to come and the wind blew
through the streets, I watched it from my window
and it all sounds very poetic
but also I started to think
a tree just beneath the house
waved its crown and I started to watch
the leaves and from the whole
of the leaves I tried to follow the movement
of each one of the leaves, tried to perceive
all different movements of
each leaf of this one tree
waving in the wind back and forth
at the same time
I don't know whether the thought
we as humans are like these leaves
on the Gaia tree or whether the
thousand movements of the tree in the wind
came first but I understood
in that moment why any observer
even the most unentangled sitting
on a window and staring into the streets
or onto this tree is not
able to capture historical time
and its complexity
for this tree is moved by the wind
but the thermodynamics
are transforming each micro area
into another zone and each leaf
is a leaf on its own and left alone
but at the same time connected to the
tree. You see where
I'm going and maybe understand
this allegory why I thought
that I had to head into the world of physics
to give the spatial
concept of ethnographic fields and observer
another temporal dimension.
Since then
I wonder why Bronislav Malinovsky
one of the founding figures of anthropology
who studied physics first
in Kraków did not follow
quantum mechanics and did not
include into his concept of ethnography
at that time the
experimental insights that actually
shattered the world of the 1920s
and 1930s in physics.
It was the tree
in front of my first Yenise field
apartment, Albert Gasse 24,
that led me to a fatal
book choice in my favorite book shop
of that time, Buch Handlung Posch.
I was sitting on a wooden chair
where many famous Austrian
writers said before as the owner
of the shop reminded me as part of his
peculiar Viennese
sales psychology which always
mixes a sense of clients
unwelcoming,
owners entitlement
and traditionality disguised in
ancienité
to give things a value beyond its market
price.
I saw Lisa Randall's book
theoretical physicist warped passages
unraveling the mysteries
of the university's hidden dimensions
and back then
I didn't know that I one day would become
friends with Lisa Randall and climb with her
but I was really surprised
because the way nature
was made in her pop scientific
account and how culture
and cultural ideas were deployed
in a to me
very uncareful way
really just puzzled me
and from that moment I knew I had to get
to know physicists better
because they shape the world
and they have a very strong cosmology
and they use cultural ideas
in a way that really are surprising
for me as a cultural scientist
and it was clear to me where I had to go
after and to learn more
about the culture
after I was studying poets
it was the wind and the tree
that led me into the world of physics
and then I went to CERN
at CERN though
I encountered different ways
of dealing with space and time
and actually what time
as such could be and was did not bother
anybody near Lake Geneva
as Isabel Stengers put it
I quote her
clearly a certain type
of prophetic physics exists today
but if we must speak of physics
wouldn't it be preferable
to approach it from the viewpoint
of the new undertaking
known as big science
international financing
the construction of large-scale instruments
management of an experiment
over a period of several years
the organization of large
numbers of colleagues
the division of labor
these are the kind of practical questions
that preoccupied cutting edge
physicists today far more
than the ideal questions
of physicists vocation
and so today
I want to share with you what we can learn
from contemporary physics
when it comes to deal with the futures
in anthropology as well
and this encompasses foremost
a way of dealing with uncertainties
of all kinds focusing on hardware
software and dealing
with a certain type of
practiced masculinity
it means of transformation
of individualist perspective
into an intra-visualist vision
I owe these insights
to my field
and especially to the women in physics
some of them became friends of mine
male and female and I'm very glad about that
before I entered
people were warning me that
I should not ask the gender question
end of quotation
that it is the quote death question
end of quotation
and I never had to ask it
it was always answered
without asking me for it
since it is such an important
topic to talk about themselves
that I even
put it up
but
before I'm diving into the gender question
I want to
show you some of those
levels of uncertainty
that exists at CERN
and why actually thinking the future
and rules are so important
at this research site
the pictures that you see are either
taken by myself
on the website of the CERN collaboration
multiple agents
weave the fabric of uncertainty
in a data driven workspace
at the same time orchestrating the ubiquitous
phantasma of certainty
in an ever more unstable economical
political global reality
in this talk I will look at the current condition
going beyond the entanglement
of hardware, software, algorithm
and infrastructure as it has been done already
what interests me is how humans
interact with one another when interacting
with machines in liberal structures
of patriarchy so fundamental
in the shaping of the data driven world
I put a particular emphasis
on the rhythms of doing things
by investigating the importance
of cuts and ruptures
disturbing and destabilizing
seemingly stable infrastructures
because when actually
the infrastructure falls apart
some hidden structures become visible
and that is something that fascinates me
I talked about the subversion for example initially
I will briefly mention
uncertainties of hardware and materialities
as well as software
to come to the main point of this talk
dealing with reasonable humans in power
one of the most political ones in times
of so-called gender wars
and heated discussions about identity
politics versus cultural dominations
where the realms of universality
and exclusivity
are renegotiated
I will end my talk with the introduction
of another neologism, the individual
that I already introduced to you
and reflect upon anthropologists
as trailblazing pathfinders
of futures beyond the standard now
because that is what actually makes us so
special amongst the humanities and social sciences
we're really able to
to take a little piece of the future
and
just talk about it and drag it into
what's actually going on
because we're listening carefully to the people
I'm interested today especially
about the implications of human relations to one another
within such apparatuses
regarding gender and race politics
as dominant aspect of what is about to come
how does the servant
manipulate the master to frame it
Hegel like
interning from an individual to something I call
intra-vigil, a concerned being
that foresees the future and plots
in companionship with an agent multiplicity
this is where
subaltern studies in complex flat
hierarchies lead
it prides itself to have flat hierarchies
but in fact
no hierarchy is flat
when white males and their tools are on the run
to assert risk management
and why does this matter again
why do I put up this whole question
because high energy physics
relies on big data interpreted
and calculated using methods
like those implemented in assessing
stock market value
the constant flow of knowledge and human
resources from the scientific
institution to the financial sector
is one of the arguments
legitimizing the existence of CERN
and the big bank companies
of Geneva of course
are profiting from the flow
of PhD grad students
that are flowing from CERN
directly into the banking system
or to Google and so on and so on
the human factor is the most crucial element
to understand uncertainty in a data-driven world
the future of our
economic system is bound to research
and sciences of many sorts
it does not only matter with whom we are
thinking thoughts but how we learn
to responsibly use media and tools
when it comes to what will happen
uncertainty is the eternal constant
of humanity's concern
uncertainty is encountered
on all levels of experimental research
from planning over construction
and coding to measuring nature
a few questions remain
what and how do people learn
to act socially when dealing with data
in computing environments
and what kind of uncertainties are they
exposed to in data-driven spaces
the hardware is always uncertain
those who follow the developments of
grand scientific experiments might remember
that the start of the Large Hadron Collider
in 2008
the world's biggest physics experiment
had been delayed by one year because of a loose screw
and here you see the picture of
the explosion that was
just happening because
one screw wasn't tightened well enough
a tiny physical object
caused a gargantuan obstacle
to the machine whose maintenance
costs exceed 1 billion euros
per year and each citizen
of the European Union by the way
pays 5 euros per year
to CERN when you take your tax money
meanwhile all the
algorithms when this happens did still
and a tiny seemingly
unimportant object shattered magnets
and with them the dreams of the first data
harvest of the Higgs boson
for those of you who are not champs in Big Bang
theory at school the Higgs boson
is a particle within the standard model
which gives mass to other particles
and helps to explain why our universe
is not just made out of light and energy
the Higgs of course
is much smaller than the screw
and unlike the screw it is invisible
to the human eye
paradoxically this screw
was neither seen
nor foreseen
and that it would break
delaying the experiment by one year
while the Higgs on the other hand was foreseen
simulated and calculated
long before the digital experimental
system actually
the whole Large Hadron Collider is a big bet
that was made up in the 1960s
when Peter Higgs came up
with his theory
with the help of pseudo
random Monte Carlo simulations
and incorporating and
unthinking and ontologically
consolidating random
to put it bluntly physics
is actually creating
futurist imaginaries through its theories
and physicists are serving
as modern future tellers
fortune tellers
like historians
physicists interpret
temporal traces
but and this is called a histogram
as most of you know
so histogram
it is a grammatics of the history
of the Higgs particle that you can see here
and the events actually that were
piling up to show the existence
of the Higgs particle that's something that physicists
work with not with the beautiful images
we know from the Higgs boson maybe
so like historians
physicists interpret temporal
traces but unlike historians
they simulate the events beforehand
and check afterwards what might have happened
to say it with Leopoldranke
high energy physics
is a security driven world
investigating nature which on the one hand
is determined by laws and on the other
characterized by random behaviors
the uncertainty
the drive to make data on measurements
as certain as possible exerts an influence
on how information is perceived
this road to scientific
certainty however
is paved with present uncertainties of all kinds
I have written about
incidents like the one of the screw
elsewhere and if you're interested I'm happy to send
you a copy of this article which deals
not only with the screw screwed
the start of the Higgs but also how a martin
a bird, bugs
and finally the physical resistance of matter reality
itself are constant factors
to deal with when planning and dealing with an experiment
that will run for decades
I came to the conclusion that
physicists are unconsciously acting out
like the most prolific or historiographic
theorists of like for example Reinhard Kozellik
envisioning humans
beings in historicity on the one hand
hermeneutically tracing patterns of the
past by simulating it beforehand
and on the other by constantly pushing
the space of experience into horizons
of expectation
physicists love to think
of the future I sometimes wonder
whether ever and if but in addition
of anthropology today
in 2123
of for example anthropology would look like
but physics today exists
and that is really fascinating
physicists are giving up
or writing
journals
and wonder how physics in 100 years
would look like, anthropologists
I couldn't imagine
any of our discipline
being that
bold to actually envision
anthropology in 100 years
the second degree of uncertainty
after the materiality that I just presented
to you with a screw may be found in
software not only loose
screws pose danger to the stability of
experimental infrastructure but also bugs
those of the digital kind needless
to say
the software used at CERN needs to be programmed
but more importantly constantly maintained
this daily care
defines the work rhythms of high energy
physicists who spend most of their time
hunting down bugs and keeping
digital storage in order
individual human visions need to be aligned
to reach a common goal
the gathered data on particles
stored on farms all over the world is
analyzed by collaborations with
the help of a network called grid
which spans the globe
it guarantees that heaps of data can be
processed since machine
learning algorithms help to analyze
the pattern recognition of physical events
feeding the nodes with the right
input is crucial to the frame
to the most surveilled uncertainty
with the current informatics apparatus
the X4 factor
brought out into the game through artificial
intelligence is of utmost importance
and interest is something I think
some of you are dealing with in person
also in your work
each human task is registered
by the so-called ticket on github
a software development and management
platform the memory
of the task will be gone
as soon as the ticket on github
is solved and resolved
if the code is working
computers do not need to keep
the memory of humans actions
do not need to have a trace of hystericity
how a failure came into being
and was resolved
in that sense bugs produce a certain
form of casualty
which happens from case to case
casuality
not causality from case to case
from one solve ticket to the other
once the chain of problem is solved
however there are no casual traces left
and so the origins of the bug
are forgotten
to keep the otherwise lost socio-technical memory
physicists keep personal
lab books, make notes not unlike
anthropologists keep field diaries
scheming capital M guy
while some people are great
in solving bug problems
others seem to be much better in coding bugs
into the system
and being held accountable for the mistakes
or causing a pile of additional work
by misinterpreting
the work schedule
the first ones
are usually devoted graduate
students who solve the problems
and the latter ones
often long time ago grads
older politically experienced
predominantly white male members
of the collaboration
even in the cosmopolitan experimental group
such as the Large Hadron Collider of CERN
hierarchies are largely flat
age, gender, experience and national
allegiance matter and people reflect
upon this all the time as I will show now
in hierarchical
environments of highly specialized
and distributed work spheres
where complex problems need to be solved
in short bursts of time and goals reached
human often need to plot
not only scientific diagrams
but also intrigues of all kinds
politics as you all know
who work at the university matter most
this often happens
because leading positions are occupied
by older physicists, elderlies
who are politically experienced
but not anymore up to date
with the most recent applied work
like programming itself
Anna Tsing
anthropologist refers to the representatives
of these groups as the so called
capital man guy, capital M
big M guy
at CERN the capital M guys
are predominantly
another Harvard professor of particle physics
a female reasonable European man
adding
that she could not breathe at CERN
because of their omnipresence
the data driven world
is full of capital M guys
to deal with the amount of
uncertainty they create
an armament of strategic tools
need to be brought in to manipulate
those experienced power
driven manipulators it would have
even impressed military strategists
such as Sun Tzu
or Karl von Klausowitz
the trick is to play the game
with closed cards but along the rules
at the same time weaving alliances
behind their back and winning the right
authorities figures over
so I'm going to show you now
how actually what kind of subversive
strategies people, PhD students
grad students deploy
to come to and
reach their goals although they are not
in the power positions
the PhD students at CERN
learn to play those double games along
within the mastery of code at the same time
the social skills
then they are wandering into and these
social skills and that's fascinating are wandering
into the financially
and into the financial end into the technical
sectors so they take what they learn
at CERN and bring this kind of work
culture into the other work cultures
which are not anymore in science
and at the university
I assume each workspace
generates its own terroir
of scheming but CERN
can be I quote a true vipers nest
as physicists with years
of experience once said to me
or a cock association
as a female grad student said to another
when listening to her latest
disastrous meeting experience I quote
interestingly when I'm talking
to male grad students they are all seen
not to experience such incidents but all
females have had the same experience
how can you measure something that can't be
nailed through worlds asks me a Ferrari
one of my closest interlocutors
who turned into a friend of mine
later
in supremacist environments
cunningness is the most important virtue
documenting is documenting
is key and social
engineering is an everyday common that
starts even before the moments when the
gates to the research sites are
crossed
the case of Claire
I had the chance to record
a small episode demonstrating this
daily phenomenon with the help of Claire
covet a grad student from North America
I promised her to
be as vague as possible about the
technicalities of a workgroup since the
specific community is small
and covet was a quote on the market
this fall and graduating next year
when I conducted the interview
Claire is working on the upgrade of one of the
LHC detectors when I met her
and had to guarantee its efficiency
for the third season in the game of
Jones as some serenies love to call
it when energy and luminosity
is about to be increased during the next
run of the LHC which started last
year in 2022
in her work Claire discovered
that some calculations had not been made
correctly under the guidance
of the team leader of her group
he is known for losing his temper
and not able to admit a mistake
as a result
she needs to prove the correctness
of her calculations and falsify
the statements of her peer
but she's not the one that makes the
meeting schedules her main goal
was therefore to make space for her
cause during the precious online
meetings because she wanted that the system
is running that the experimental system will work
at the end
to discuss her case I met covet in the
upper section of the central community building
at CERN in an area that is
quite enough for recording and
interview and remote enough for
not being overheard by anyone
she chose the spot and whenever
someone who looked familiar to her seemed to
come closer she would tone down
I quote
usually
oh that's the wrong
usually you can do it privately
usually you do not need to do this
this particular guy is
known for being difficult
even now his strategy in the meeting was
to essentially force the issue offline
which we knew would happen
I already talked to the coordinators
to get the relevant data to the team in the US
so that they could do the calculations
and send them back as quickly as
possible to this other guy
solving problems
informally and offline means that there are
no official records of how and
if things are done
the off the record space is
a dangerous and difficult territory for
those who are not having a say
without heavy weights in the collaboration
nothing can be moved
but it's certainly not less dangerous
as any other on the record
turf Claire argues
that her boss is someone who needs to be addressed
indirectly in a way that she describes
as I quote backstage work
I knew I had to call out
this guy and his team I had
opinions on him from the various people
I know from heart rate so they
could say what kind of play we had
to mate I made sure
when to send the slides out and I did
not invite him to the meeting but the authorities
figures did
the activity coordinators made sure
that he would come to the meeting
that describes precisely
how she had to weave alliances
winning authority figures
the whole plotting took time in consideration
that she might have used more effectively
for technical problems
I quote
I spread it about a period over two weeks
and it took me maybe
five hours of work but it is built
on something we have been talking
about the coordinate system problem actually
a year I went back into
the stack of my notebooks I flipped back
to find the relative facts and I started
tracking this problem explicitly in detail
on February 14th 2017
presented it on February
14th 2018
so one year today I made
my first measurements of the problem
in December 2016 and we
had been talking about it since February
2017 so that's the period of
time it actually takes
to win over
when you're coming from the other side
in a
language that oscillates between theater
American football
and computer game vernacular
Claire describes her social engineering
in order to solve a technical problem
she ends the episode by emphasizing
that the whole issue has been caused because
everyone has so many things to do
nevertheless explaining not without pride
how she attracted long-term attention
becoming a respectable member
of the team despite being a woman
it is less an issue of breakdown
and communication and more an issue
of priority people have
so many things to do all the time
that unless you put something on top of their priority
list things will not work I caused
a scene now it's in the meeting notes
it has memories so they
will not forget a young female graduate
student calling out a senior member
of the community that's ball
scene so in doing that I reminded
people what happened and I gave
the touchdowns
it got to people's memories
and next time we will have the meeting
they will ask what has been done with this
that's her workplace
the place of Claire Kovetsk
chose for telling me the story
the constant control that exercised
to check whether we were potentially spotted
in the moment later on her cleaner
to be too precise about her work
the environment shows in the first place
the uncertainty young graduate students are living
in when working for a wide reasonable
European man and the pressure of
high-end institutions such as CERN
it exemplifies the unpredictably
and vanity of leading authority
figures and how the second and also
the thirst and the drive
for power and also
how the second and third
row of workers stabilize the system
preventing ruptures and
failures caused by the self-entitled
uncertainty of the capital M guy
uncertainty is
augmented by potential infrastructural ruptures
caused by human failed
attempt to overcome technical, physical
or social obstacles
synchronization, prioritization
and the right rhythm
to cut and resume communication
in order to install a memory
of an action seem to be
essential in securing position and bouncing
the common goal of the collaboration
and it has nothing interestingly
enough to do with the kind of
rhythms and memories of the computer
preventing ruptures
means circumventing and uncertainties
means to exchange individuality
against what I call intraviguality
Clare's case
in the end was solved successfully
in her little area of caring
concern everything was fine
and on time once the LHC
started in the season
last year in 2022
since we had our conversation
that I shared with you today
Clare got a prestigious post-doc position
at an American elite university
and is now an assistant professor
at a renowned university in Europe
her ability to become an intravigual
her cunningness and consistency
her notes, calculations and devotion
and a big portion of chance
secured her a place in the future
of high-energy physics
towards an anthropology in the future
screws
as hardware and bugs as software
may be considered agents of ruptures
schemers of cuts
they may be seen as vital forces
shaping human dynamics in a data-driven
work environment
scheming intrigues plots and weaving
the future in the now by dealing
cunningly with collective group memory
and gaining attention for future action
turns into a political tool
differentiating between cuts
and ruptures helps to distinguish
between different modes of action
physically different actors as I learned
from and with my colleague Lukas Mayerhofer
physicist himself
it visualizes that hardware, software
and humans are in seemingly seamless spaces
always on the verge of disruption
it shows how people care
within and about data-driven worlds
and above all it exemplifies
that actions are happening in the fields
of social forces
and how the discurface structures of power
influence actions especially
actions in the digital era
it shows how we evolve from individuals
from individuals to
individuals when living in our complex
digital worlds
anthropology as I understand
our crafty discipline is bound
to empirical insights
but as well to theoretical concepts
no matter how much we put empirical fields
in our inventory powers at the center
and it matters what thoughts
I am thinking and with whom I am
thinking my thoughts with as Donna
heroin reminds us
no matter how much we understand
the discursive structures of truthful
dispositions no matter how much we
are tricked by unconscious drives
language is the trickster
and sound can play with meaning
alterity is key
the rhythm changes everything
communication is misunderstanding
and abs cons from economies of growth
alterity is key
thinking about a future that does
not forget where we are coming from
but understands the horizons of
our Indo-European spatio-temporal
housings and movements so where
we and how we talk and how
we frame things allows
us to recalibrate our own being
on the planet and asks how
we transform from humans into something
we could consider as Terence
since I am convinced that at the
core of our problems within the
Anthropocene lies always of how
we perceive space time and materiality
and that is very closely tied
to our Indo-European language system
there are other ways to be
in the future and we as
anthropologists are looking for traces
that lead us there
I want to visualise this by
sharing with you some diagrams I
made one inspired through re-reading
Nikolai Sorynchikov's Two Lenins
A Brief Anthropology of Time
and the other contemporary
works in anthropology that
I tried to engage
with two philosophers
that I really admire
very much, Maurice Meloponte and
Jacques Derrida
so in this you can actually
see it's like a babushka model
an onion model of how
we are engaging with
temporalities and there are different
ideas of temporality there's a geopolitical
temporality or time that you see
on the outside in the black frame
and then there's the violet frame
where you could say it's a media technological
positive or apparatus
that is also creating a certain temporality
and rhythm and these
rhythms are going along with each other
they create already a certain resonance
a certain form of harmony then you have
a certain temporality the thought
styles and the epistemic ways
of being together so different thought
collectives to put it with Ludwig Fleck
who have again their own temporality
and then you have the yellow
frame which is the experimental time
in this case the time of the experiment
where a certain amount of data is taking
within the time and the fourth
is actually the knowledge that is coming
out of this so the gift
of nature that is appearing
within the collision of the experiment
itself so all these different
layers of temporality are intersecting
and in between you have the materiality
that maybe cuts and you have the
politics that happening and that's the rhythm
and that's the bead itself
that actually is so interesting to
understand and to describe in anthropology
itself
and on the other hand
you can see here that's a very classical
imaginary actually
how Maurice Maloponte tried to
show how the past is an
overlay it's overlaid
by different present times
so you have here
the black
and red line which is
the timeline the physical timeline
and that we have in the Newtonian
world and the blue
lines are actually the cuts of the
now when you go back
and the black lines that go
diagonal through
the blue lines are showing that
actually each spot when you would
go into the past are an overlay
of endlessly amounts of past
time points of the now
so that shows what I said initially
how complex the capturing
of the past actually is for historiography
and on the other hand
when you do physics and we do
terminutical cuts as anthropologists
and the historians when we are
looking to the past
but on the other hand physicists are trying
to push this kind of
experience space of experience
when they simulate
experiments beforehand
and push the experiential
space of the experiment into the future
and have these two
horizons on the one hand
the horizon of theory and on the other hand
the horizon of the experiment itself
and to see this kind of
congruence between thinking how
physicists and computer science
actually makes us and allows us to
rethink the horizons of future
is something that I find very fruitful
for my own discipline and where I learned
a lot of physics and computer science
and such.
I did this to remind at the
end of this talk diagrammatically that it
does not only matter with whom we are
thinking thoughts with but also what
kind of geometries, architectures,
algorithms and compositions we build
when we approach any phenomenon
including the futures and futurities
and also in order to question whether
some of the new materialist
conceptions about future are actually
that new.
Karen Barat's quantum mechanically inspired
concept of interaction harmonizes
with historiographical theories
very well who by definition
aim to reconsider space-time
materiality humans and non-humans
alike and how things come into being.
When it comes to study futures
we need to work with what we have now
and what we find here.
We are not living in eternal time-free
space a place the Greeks called
Koura filled with eternal
aion, the Ian, the eternal.
We are mortals in this whole game
depending on chance, kairos, luck.
No matter how much we travel
beyond space and time. At CERN
I observed solitary beings of all
kind interacting and becoming
solitary beings which brings me back
to the tree I observed 12 years ago in Vienna.
The observer me in the window
acknowledged exclusive moments
of each leaf but the summer
went just as historical time touched
all of us.
As part of one tree these leaves are
part of one universal.
I as observer was audience.
We together were a many world
already. I listened
to the sound of leaves
they brought me to CERN
to this place to understand what our task
in virtue as anthropologists is
when we are doing fieldwork.
That we are sniffling futures.
Our binding leaves through words and finding
traces with forests by summoning
space and time without
imperial aims by piecing fragments
together apart into a unitary
multiplicity.
The modernity, the individual, the
digitality and the future
is about individual inter-imperiality.
Is the old blind in the anthropocene?
Today, anthropology
no matter what field it engage in
is an historically aware discipline.
That's why it's about
when you think of current debates on
restitution of artifacts
stoned within colonial context.
Maybe this happens also in Brussels.
It matters how you gather your knowledge
and I do not steer from people at CERN.
They do exactly know what I'm doing there
and they're sharing with me because
they know I care for them and they care for me.
It is important
to know who has a say or the right
for a history of her own.
For what has happened, departments what will
be. In times of reconsidering
apocal cuts in historical
rhythmizations due to the anthropocene
anthropologists have to roam all fields
as trailblazing tracers.
I presented you scenes of vulnerability
all of them physical, one
material, the screw, the other virtual
the bugs and the third a discursive
one which I framed in the term of
masculinity and subversive actions.
I tell you ethnographic fictions
of science based on empirical
encounters to set your minds in places
to open horizons of experience
to take you along my
storytelling and leave you
to your own horizons of experience
to engage in empathy and taking
the other's point of view.
For that matters, matters more than
any property or appropriation
and fights any kind
of neoliberal dispositive
of existence we are actually
all the time treadmilling in.
We anthropologists are collaborators
in exchanges, translators
and voice givers. We acknowledge
respect and the value of the other
as discipline a priori.
We learned it the hard way
for empathy is the evergreen
of world of many worlds.
Think like a stone along with
Beth Provenelli or like a symbiont
with Lin Margulis.
Think like a mushroom along with
Natsingh or like vertebrae
in companionship with Donna Haraway.
See the world from a quantum perspective
together with Karen Barat
but let those things in their
thingness, those beings in their
beingness be themselves and
relate as Helen Verand does.
Take the alien's point of view
and acknowledge the own alien within
yourself. Be an interdependent
member of Arturo Escobar's
pluri-verse and acknowledge
your individuality along with
the physicists of my field.
I finish this talk with a
question I would love to discuss with you
and hints of positivist
teleology put aside and
that I learned to dare to ask in
and through physics. What could
an interdisciplinary
collaboration look like in 21-23
and how would you
folks think an interdisciplinary
collaboration across cultures
of knowledge would be useful
and fruitful.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Ann.
Is it okay that we close this
screen share that we see each other?
Everybody sees everybody?
Will it make sense? Okay,
that's nice. Just let me
open this on the...
How do I do that?
I don't know.
Thank you for your patience.
It was 10 minutes overdue
but I hope you didn't lose the
attention.
We are all here. So who would like
to start commenting question?
Francis. And let's use the
mic in the row.
Well, I would like to make
a very provocative statement
but before I do so, I will
introduce myself in order to make it
a little bit less provocative.
I'm the director
here of the Central Layer Apostle.
I very much agree
with people like Karen Barat
about interaction.
I've been studying quantum mechanics. I've been
developing an ontology
that I call relational agency
that can be used for post-humanism.
So I all agree
about different agency,
about diversity, about
the fact that an institute
like Assern should be as
diverse as possible.
But now comes my provocative statement
and it is that your analysis to me
sounds quite racist
and sexist because
you are analysing an ordinary
event,
a younger junior person
who points out a mistake in some
senior person and the senior person
not immediately picking it up or not
or being very happy to hear about it.
To me, that seems like
general anthropology
that would happen in any context
white or black, masculine
or feminine
science or non-science.
If some younger member of a tribe
would question an indigenous
elder, that would also
not be taken as seriously.
What happened to Claire Covert
as far as I understood was nothing bad.
She just was not immediately
listened to. I think this kind
of event happened all the time
in all circumstances. So saying
that this is a masculine
white European environment
is actually making
a racist and sexist assumption
namely that in non-white
non-European, non-masculine
environments this would not happen.
Imagine that you would have said
this is an environment
with mostly Jews
and this thing happened there
and people would immediately tell you
that you're an anti-Semite.
But if you say they are white European males
somehow it is considered
to be non-racist,
non-sexist. Well, I think it is.
Yeah, thank you very much.
I think there must be a basic misunderstanding
because I have been quoting people.
I have been quoting and framing
what people were saying.
So it's not me who says that
but it's actually the statement of the people themselves.
They were calling it
in these terms.
I have been just quoting
and if you consider
rightfully this as racist and sexist
then you have to call out
these women who
perceive it that way. So
it's not me. I am just here the modest witness
of their quotations
and what was of concern to them.
You could
definitely push this back
and I perceive this
also as a pushback
but
I just can tell you
this is just one little piece
of data of many many many
and
if people from the US
would perceive a certain style of reasoning
in Europe predominant
and voice this in records
it's not me who came up with this.
It's not me who's
bringing this into.
So yes it is racist,
yes it is sexist but that's
the data of the people
and not my own quotation
and if people are
perceiving what you were saying
this is something, if you're downplaying
actually you're downplaying
Claire
because for Claire this was very traumatic
and she's a PhD student
and that really concerned her
and I have been spending time with her sitting at the restaurant
and many people have spent time with her
and she couldn't sleep
very strongly
to meet this person
that she was frightened on because he would really scream
within the team meetings
and so
actually I just perceive
I don't think that you just simply got
the initial
thing. I'm on your side
but actually that's the data
if you say this is not, this is something very common
she has been hurt, she had to plot
and if you're
then I have to say to you provocatively
that you actually take the master's perspective
of the head of an institution
who's not seeing how
those people who are servants behind your back
are actually playing you all the time
that would be my
provocative reply to you because
really that's not my data, that's not my words
that's not my framing, that's the framing of the people
I have been working with
and that's not a tribe
that is calling out in elderly
but these are physicists
and that's quite a reductionist
in comparison
and also playing down the complexities
of what we call and do not anymore
actually call tribal societies
sorry
I believe that what you described
that I very much understand
that somebody would be traumatised
I have had similar experiences
both in the case of myself
not being listened to
by an elderly when I was younger
and vice versa
I think these things happen all the time
and they are traumatic
but they are part of human nature
implying that it's only
white males who do it
I think is very unrealistic
the white males it will be
we are on the same side
my dear, I also do not think
that it's just like a male white thing
that's how these people perceive it
and that's interesting as a symptom
it doesn't mean that it's a reality
that's how these people perceive it
and actually the question is
why do they perceive it that way
why do young women in physics
perceive it this way
why would they actually
be sexist and call it out
and we have
also at CERN there's something we call
the queen bee phenomenon
you maybe know it from physics or from any other field
so it's saying that there are few
women who come up in leading positions
and they are queen bees
that means they can work very well together with men
but not so well with women
and they are killing other bee queens
and at CERN you could study
for example also very well the queen bee phenomenon
and
as I just said that's the death question
and I just provocatively
put it into you
but
as the so-called
diversity and
gender equality representative
of the philosophical faculty of my university
I can tell you women and
men play the same games and it doesn't matter
what kind of religion race
class ethnicity they have as a background
doesn't matter but still
that's the sources and CERN has
to deal with this
and also what I find
interesting and you know that's not what I want to talk
about what I find interesting is the more interesting
part is to put this
aside and get away from
this kind of how they perceive it
be it the capital M guy
and blaming men and blaming whiteness
whatever I don't care I just
don't think that's useful for us
what I found fascinating is how she actually
tries to solve the problem
and steps back from
her individual perspective
acknowledges there's a certain leading figure
who cannot step away
from his individual's narcissist needs
and becomes
an introvidual playing along
with other people together
to come to a common goal and to reach it
as you did when you were actually young
and that's something where I think
what you initially called the relational agency
and the post humanist
diversity that you're engaging with
is something that you actually embodied
as a sensitive young man
who did research and experienced
the same traumatic downplaying
as Claire in her case
gendered in your case not gendered
well in my case
actually I have been downplayed
by women professors when I was young
but I don't mind
it doesn't matter
the gender is not relevant
everybody plays these political games
as soon as they get in a position of power
I really don't think that
whiteness, Europeanness
or gender plays a role
all situations where there is
an ability to move up in the power
hierarchy they play political games
which means that the ones at the higher level
of the hierarchy don't like
to be criticized by the ones lower on
it's universal I don't think it needs
to be gendered or Europeanized
or masculinized or whatever
you have to
say this to the people I did research with
and not to me I mean that's not my point
it's not
I don't think that it has to be gendered
I just said to you I think
it doesn't matter who does this
people love power plays no matter
but then
that's the data I just gathered
it's the data it's not me
I'm just a modest witness
here and that's the part
of the field that I didn't construct but I try
to show you as an anthropologist is actually
how
intervisuality comes into being how
although hierarchy is preventing
a certain functioning
individual interacting
and engagement in your times a relational
agency is allowing
that things at the end work out
so
we have
so we have 40s and then
shema 40s
I
cannot
40s
40s you are muted
or not connected to
mic
okay
so
we will move
to shema and meanwhile
you will figure it out
for this
shema
can you hear me
yes yes
thank you very much for
your interesting presentation
I wonder
if you can elaborate a little bit
on some sort of like incentive
models that you think
can be put into place
for promoting this kind of
like
intra individualization
especially in interdisciplinary research
because most of the problems we are facing
right now you rightly also
mentioned in your presentation
are so complex that I think
we need to move toward
this kind of perspective
though I also want to say like
some part of like this profile
of male I think it's
kind of present in some
disciplines especially like stem sciences
I'm coming from that background
I can see why these women
probably would witness this
kind of like incidents
I want to move toward this kind
of incentive models like
what kind of environment
what kind of like team
or
arrangements should be put
into place from your research
and kind of promote this kind of
approach and at the same time
if this is like power dynamic
dynamics emerge
from somebody has having
more experiences or having a
different socioback technological
social background
what kind of like
mechanisms needs to be in place
to prevent
the power dynamics
taking over
positive collaborations
thank you very much
thank you Shima for these very fundamental
questions and I have been dealing with
these questions myself
I just I hope I can
give you some of those my thoughts
that I think that would be useful
but that's just like hypothetical
what I would wish
so the good thing and the good news
about CERN is that it works very well
and what they did actually that it works
is that they were implementing
certain types of
competitiveness within the work
collaborations and there are different
styles there's for example the Atlas
collaboration who is flatter in its hierarchy
and there's the CMS
collaboration which is more
competitive and more hierarchical so even
there there are differences of course
and there are more or less hierarchical
correlations
and situations so one cannot
give one solution to all
and this kind of specific sample
that I showed to you is an example
of I don't like the term but I use it
of a toxic work group
so a work group that doesn't function well
but of course there are also work groups that function well
and I studied these work groups
where it functioned well
when did it function well
it functioned well when first there was a
good communication between the authority figures
the so-called leaders
of the teams and the PhD
students and the early postdocs
and that was always the case when
the team leaders were still
also being part of
the programming and also
engaged in the updates and upgrades
and constantly tried
to go along with the time
so not becoming just older
and experience in politics but also
still knowing what actually the younger ones
doing when programming and solving the problems
on the code so it
actually asks from the authority figures
to stay close to what the younger
ones do that's one side
and the other side what I think that would be
really good
on the long run would be actually
a certain form
of
social therapeutic work groups
where people are able to say
what they actually feel like because
if you ask the guy
that Claire is calling out
who is problematic
and who is this authority figure
that she says it's a white male guy
of Europe if you ask
this guy
who I think by his origin is German
if you ask this guy why he's so
choleric and screaming all the time
and cannot allow mistakes
cannot admit mistakes
you might see if he would have time
that he would say oh I have so much
responsibility to take nobody listens to me
I feel I'm lost here
I'm overworked there and so on and so on
so actually it's a certain
mode of taking back
which I would think would be very useful
for everybody of us working in science
and at universities in general
and that's something that's missing
a certain form of mediation
a certain form of acknowledging the others
that's what I also said at the end
listening to the other person taking
the other one's point of view
also what now the director of
Claire was saying
what you're saying is exactly what I wish
would be something that would be implemented
so this kind of
contained groups where people could
see each other so I think that would be
something
that would need to be
implemented because the pressure
is so high
and on the other hand
what's very interesting and I think what would be very useful
is if you talk to people at CERN
I did talk to the psychologists at CERN
and they have records
they do not get everybody but they have
statistics of the amount of
anxieties of sleeplessness
really like psychological
psychosomatic symptoms
that appear within a certain
high level
research environment
and I think what would really help
to just use all the technologies
we have from psychological
therapeutics to just implement
this as mandatory way of
self-care and also group care
and then it would definitely work better
but when it comes
to the fundamental exclusion
of certain groups
who are privileged or less privileged
then it really
needs at least in the German case
we would need definitely to support more
people from working-class environments and so on
from early on and to change
the whole curriculum from early on
to have a different standpoint
of how those STEM fields
are taught
I hope this answers a little bit
Schema, could you give me
a small feedback whether this is a bit
helpful for you?
It's very interesting, thank you very much
for your
elaborate answer, I think
what I see is that
probably the kind of mix of
highly competitive environments
and I think to some extent
also maybe so
more men are actually present
in STEM fields, this is kind of like
statistics are out there, nobody can
basically ignore them, more
men are actually attracted to
these fields, not just because
the field promotes men
I think it's kind of something that is
there are so many complex reasons that are
happening that are there
that actually causing
women choosing other fields
rather than STEM fields and I think
in any kind of field
when you have this proportionate gender
representation you can
get into some sort of like a
maladaptive dynamics
so I think this is
promoting more women
and I think what you mentioned
I think listening is very important, I really
liked what you mentioned, bringing more
of these critical skills
like listening, empathy
and putting yourself in somebody else's perspective
is I think so fundamental in technical
fields and
thank you very much for your very
interesting presentation, thank you
Thank you Shima, just one little
thing I want to add, I asked the leading
also the
director general back then at CERN
and others how they actually deal
with this problem and they're not very happy
that they have just 20% women at CERN
and the problem
is that they also have just 20% students
coming to physics
also it's like it's
the problem starts in school
and they say
they would love to have more
female and that's again
quite sexist as a statement
when you think about that in the backdrop
because they say women
are tending to care more
about the collective
and care more about the experiment
while males are more interested
in their own success
so that's also
a self description
which I found super sexist
and that's what I found also very
interesting and I think that's a point
where you nailed, it is so
impressive when you go to a place
like CERN where people really highly
fight to have a diverse
reality
that at the end of the day
it becomes again
ethnicist, essentializing
and sexist and racist
and it even
comes to the point where Italians
are cooking their food
and the Russians are sticking together
with the Russians
and the Bulgarians are having
the Bulgarian meeting and so on and so on
it's really fascinating how people deal
with this in a cosmopolitan space
that has actually the goal
that race, gender
sex
class do not matter
and I think that's important because
if you have an ideal
of relational agency
and of a post human diversity
then in a way it's a universal
goal
it's a universal hope
and any universalist
approach
is
fragmented when you go
and becomes a plurality
when you go to a certain specific place
and I think that's something that I also try
to make visible and if you
are producing these kind of individuals
certain communities then you
actually could solve these problems
and I really hope that we come
to another solution because we need
different community models, we need
different work models because this kind
of neoliberal work system isn't
healthy for anybody of us and it will come
it has to come at a certain point to end
maybe not in my lifetime but I hope
that I will still witness this
Thank you.
For this, how is your sound now?
Well
there is a message
Do you want to ask a question now?
Ah you can hear me
Yes
I don't know what I have done
Well now I think it's already past
you
so I'm not going to ask any question now
it's already been addressed
No please
you cannot leave me that way I feel
like I'm sticking with you
I was wondering whether you have read
Ways of Being of James Brittle
No
He's telling exactly the same thing you are
but
from another point of view he's also read
which I will
receive for Christmas on the tree
and
actually he's trying to come to the same
kind of understanding but not
on the academic level but
at the post-human
level, the world
with
not viewed from humans
only but to include everybody
everything
and to
have an idea of
he tries to find solutions
to the fact that everything is so
binary so that's also
what's been the point of this
discussion because it's
very binary it's male-female but you
have nobody's entirely
male and entirely female so
you already have
different ways of being
so and
he was talking
about having computers
thinking otherwise than binary
but he's not very concrete
about it so
I don't know whether at CERN there
because I also understood from his book
that also
the computer models
they are using at CERN
are this carol
Monte Carlo theory based
so actually they are based
on
chance and uncertainty
so I was wondering
if they are thinking about something else
as computers which might be
more developed
than whatever he
points out in his book
no they don't it works
very well and they're working
very precisely with their machine
learning algorithms
and the Monte Carlo simulations it's really
astonishing what they're doing there actually
it's really amazing
what they are producing there
then again we are looking at
uncertainty
yes they approximate
and that's where also
the playfulness came into being
that's why I deal a lot with play and games
because they have lots of rules and uncertainty
and chance are playing along
but they are not looking for another
system beyond the binary model
they are not working on this
it's not their topic
would be maybe something they could engage with
but they are much more interested currently
in medical applications
because it's very useful
for example fighting cancer and so on
that's something they look into
and also saving energy
it's something they are really interested in
because
certain uses a lot of energy but also has to deal
with the energy problem it tries to find
solutions so many people are engaging
they are thinking to solve that problem
also fighting fake news it's something that is very important to them
and also
what is a fun fact is the
Claire that I interviewed
later on she came out as non binary
I
didn't say it in that moment because she has been
read as female
and she has been talking a lot about this
but later on she came out as non binary
so non binarism also exists
at CERN
but
I was very much fascinated
when I entered the STEM field
how much all of this matters still
even if I wish it wouldn't
yeah
and also I think
that what I try to
what is very clear for me is that it really
doesn't
that's why I talked about Terrence
instead of humans
it doesn't it is that there are alliances
and I'm really putting aside
the humans along with the algorithms
with the computer
or with a bug and so on
and I think that's very interesting also
to think along that way
and to step out of this
and from a physicist's perspective
we are all made of stardust right
well
yes
that's clear
thank you for your
quantum
yeah
Anna thank you
for your presentation I just missed a part
of the discussion before
as my internet went down
I also want to say
Sandra Karst from Thomas
he had an urgent meeting
to attend so he couldn't make it
but I was
the thing that you just mentioned
about sort of this
both humanist perspective
or maybe transhumanist
I don't know if you would call it a transhumanist
perspective like having also
algorithms and
hardware
as an equal being
well I sometimes
quite difficult especially when talking about
AI or maybe advanced technologies
that sometimes
these types of human made
artifacts are placed above
or more
there still seems to be a hierarchy
that people are talking
within these sectors like
within stem sectors
there seems to be
a bit of a bias between
technology
and certain minorities
so
do you sort of
what's your perspective on that
my perspective on that is
now I give you a very fun
like please take this with a
with a big grain of irony
so in the 1970s
physics came
to certain and epistemically
and technologically
and also as you might know
lots of physicists
were trained
many people who didn't have a job
but there was LSD out
and there were other drugs that allowed them to think
further and they really took these
drugs and then Apple came into being
and many other funny things like for example
string theory and I think what you
describe right now is a time
where we are living in a hyper-realistic
time where these kind
of mind expanding experiences
where you understand
as when people who have taken LSD
they would always describe this kind of
one world and this postal humanist
perspective is something that they are really seeing
when they are taking these kind
of mushroom
derivatives
that we are living in a time where we
coming through technology and that's
fascinating to the same point because the trans
humanist perspective and the post-humanist
terminology emerged by Andrew
Pickering and others who studied in the
1990s physics high-energy physics
and what you describe
in the hierarchy I think is still a
narcissist mirroring
so they look at the stuff they created
and since they want to be big
and taller than they are actually
they make what they created bigger
and taller as it actually is
and I think this will all
be played unfortunately due to
the climate crisis we are
experiencing
and all the augmenting crisis this will be
put into place
and I am at this point
guarded optimistic
that although we are undergoing
these kind of challenges
and undergoing these kind of
crazy fights
of identity politics
that I personally do not like at all
and people who would be racist
and who would be sexist
and would be techno-optimist and so on
say yes we go to the Mars
and so on
that we are coming back to a perspective
where what you are following at the
clear is actually the future
and that is something that I am also working on
that is why I am very grateful that you invited me
because we are working
on the same topic and
people around the world are doing
what you do, what I do
and that is something where we have to stick together
and sometimes we might have to go
into subversion and we have to
use it to play like Claire played
the dominant ruling
society we are living in
but I think that at the end of the day
we will come to that point
and I really hope Floor
that one of the research that you do
will also contribute to that bigger goal
Thanks Anne, I hope so as well
it will be
the least interesting thing to touch on
thank you
I also feel like
in education or sort of this identity
politics that
even through education
or people choosing a certain
that also in education
there should be a lot more trans
disciplinarity and I think also what you
talked about during your
talk that
that people
like technical people also need humanities
back
sort of this whole
being able to place things
in a bigger perspective and perhaps
I don't know if it would help
like if you have a trans disciplinarity team
of trans disciplinary people
but also maybe
or that they might be
more able to place themselves
in another person
like be able to sort of see
or be sort of mindful
about having a different perspective
or that they are biased in a certain way
or is this something that people
need to learn
or become aware of?
Yeah
I totally agree, I think that will be the future
and it's hard to accept for some
but
and I'm very happy that for example
the Centadio Apostol exists
and that you brought it into being Mr. Director
please excuse me
that I was challenging your challenge
but
I really think that we will have these kinds of trends
we need it, we need as humanities we need to
survive these days
because we are not
from an economical, neoliberal perspective
we do not seem to be useful
but in 10 to 20 years
many computer scientists will end up
without a job because AI
took their job
and then it comes back to interpretation
and then comes back to the hermeneutics
and then it comes back to the humanities
and social science because what
AI is producing is boring
mediocre narratives
and when it comes out
comes to the point where it becomes disturbing
where the human factor plays into
that's something we
when we come back into it
when rhetoric becomes again important
and also hermeneutical understanding
we have one question from the room
and then 40 seconds
okay
first of all
thank you for
this interesting talk
my name is Fabrizio
I'm a student
and a PhD student here in CLEA
and I would like to ask
the next question
in a disruptive technology
where we live
right now
I think we could use
the anthropology
in order to empower
our workers
in your opinion
how would you use the best of
anthropology
in order to improve
the resilience
of supply chains
as you know supply chain is
a group
of business echelons
that are integrated
in a network
that works like a one system
and that will be
my question
how would you use the best of anthropology
in order to
improve the resilience
of the supply chain
thank you
the question is what kind of supply chain
should be improved
some supply chains I don't want to have improved
where I think they are not
serving any goals
whenever it comes to the logic of growth
we're coming to an end
and whenever it comes to exploiting the
earth and having this idea
that we're taking more and more out
it comes to an end because that's what we do also
to ourselves and then we are burnt out
so I think one thing
is really to show that a certain idea
of burnout doesn't work anymore
burning out the energy of ourselves
or extracting everything
what we could do and that's where we should
actually cut our say as anthropologists
here as a rupture that's the end
it doesn't work anymore we cannot relate anymore
to the world
and the other would really bring us back
bring us back with technologies
with technologies that we
learn as anthropologists when we do
fieldwork because when we go
into another society and we do
transform we are prepared
and we have technologies
to be resilient ourselves
to not fall or to survive
what we call the culture shock
and we experience usually
culture shocks after two months
we have the field diary, we have certain forms
of supervision and so on and we have all
of this also in Europe already developed
we have a whole apparatus
of care and I think
that's where I see
a future and that would also not
only say in
an essential way anthropology shows
are people from
Belgium are that way and if you're
coming from Mexico then you have to deal
with the Belgians this way and please
Belgians please acknowledge that you do not
understand how it feels to
lose your environment
when you're from a Missonian society
so something like that
I think that's not
something where we are there to just
mediate or be the testimonies
of other cultures but what we could do
is just really relate between the
different perspectives and help others
to see themselves I think that would be
one possible solution that's also where
art comes into being
and in an ever more
entangled world
where people are coming from all over
the world to Europe
Europe itself is turning into
into deep crisis one really
has to ask also
what are the laws, the ideals
and the fights we in Europe
have been fighting and that's the good side
also that's also something I want to say
but this reasonable European
man that the Americans
criticized in this
Fieldburg snippets I presented
to you
on the other hand CERN
is the outcome
of the Second World War
where physicists from different nations
fought against each other
but instead of producing
a bomb they really want
to find knowledge and they want to show
how cosmopolitan work
is possible
how you really can pursue
a goal and I showed you
the destructive side of this
the ruptures, the cuts where it doesn't work
but that doesn't mean
that the ideas and the goals that CERN
produces aren't something that I personally
as a European think I'm standing for
democracy, the ideal
of equality even if it's not working
criticizing a certain non-democratic
hierarchy and so on and so on
so I think that's something
that we also have to do
as anthropologists to say okay that's
a certain kind of standard we have been working
on and even if we decolonize
everything we have to
rethink what kind of criticism
of colonial
power relations actually brought
humanism into being
and where post-humanism
is a child of these kind of developments
as such. I hope that somehow
gives you
a little bit of an answer to this
and I think that would actually put a resilience
to the what you call supply chains
or the resilience to certain
societies that fight
for the equality of people
and fight and have also attained
the equality of for example
women and men or
not or the equality of
voting no matter what kind and how much
money you have or whether you are aristocrat or not.
Yes, so I want to come back to the question
of transition
so I am
doing a PhD in philosophy
on being and becoming
but it's very much
based on quantum physics
so I've been reaching out to Roveli
and Tonelli
at first
they answered
questions I ask
and then when I asked
and Roveli even said
I don't know any philosopher
being
occupied with quantum physics
well he doesn't know Barrett
I didn't know her
then either so I pointed
into Whitehead but at one point
in time when I say do you want to get
involved with my PhD
they don't have time so
so much for transdisciplinary
Yeah, that's a good
it's a good point I have
been collaborating with physicists
in an excellence
at Humboldt University and it was
very interesting where you also would experience
this hierarchy of STEM
versus humanities, philosophy
and so on and that comes
back to what Flo was actually saying
and that's where I hope for the future
generation
and that's interesting I talked to
Lisa Randall
and she was very much open
and she waited for news
and wanted to engage
by Carlo Roveli again
I somehow
have encountered many of these
physicists who are not seeing that
there is a ton of philosophy engaging
with this
and what I also tried
to say initially in my talk
nothing that quantum mechanics
has to give epistemologically
is new
to history nor anthropology
it is not, it's rather
that actually
Schrödinger's cat
tried to prevent to bring these
two worlds together
for certain reasons of dominance of physics
and then you have the new age movement
and so on which is making this thing fall
apart and then again people would say
we don't go into esoterics
but if you go today in science and technology studies
or if you go to Hawaiian philosophers
and Hawaiian
cosmologists as I just have been last
month at a big
4S conference
you will find the exact same
idea
as a philosophy of healing
that is combining the people
of Hawaii, of people
of aboriginal societies in Australia
in New Zealand or people
who quantum mechanics and take this
theory and transfer it
into the world and it's sad
that Ovelli insists on his position of power
but that relates again to
the imperial
power position of physics as such
that is falling
as much as you can see
also with the
with the falling apart of believing
in science as such with the rise
of all these kind of destabilizations
of fact making
through all these people who believe
in whatever kind of
viruses. I suggest
you sent me the email
address of the
Lauren who is interested
and then another thing is I do
think quantum physics
shakes ontology
what kind of ontology? The ontology
as we see it as the
philosophy of being
it makes it dynamic
instead of static. Oh yes
it does and so
I think the ontological
implications of quantum
physics are more important
and if you have
an ontological
problem you cannot even have
an epistemology you don't
have anything anymore so you have to
go to another kind of
thinking about
the life which is no longer
in being but also in
becoming.
Yes for example
if you lead Elizabeth Povinelli
the ontologies of the otherwise as anthropologists
would deal with this also
McKenzie Wark
Molecular Red
it's a beautiful book
I suggest that I ask Marta
for your email address
and then you send me your references
because this is not going to work here.
Wonderful, okay
no I totally agree with you it does
and that's the beauty of it
I agree with you.
Let me take the position
which I'm not used to
take of defending the stem
sciences here
I'm personally with one foot in
stem one foot in the humanities
I'm officially a philosopher
connected to the department
of philosophy my
PhD is in physics but it was actually
more about the philosophy of quantum mechanics
so I know the domain quite well
and I want to say that
it's not sufficient to say there
is some similarity between Hawaiian
philosophy or Daoist philosophy
and quantum mechanics
to say that well they are
equal there at the same level
quantum mechanics is a highly
technical domain
with a lot of deep philosophical problems
but the technical domain means that
there is quite a lot of very hard
mathematics in there
you can't do without it it's thanks to this
mathematics that we can build
all these transistors
and lasers
and all these incredible technological
applications of quantum mechanics
this is something there are
no shortcuts for that it's not sufficient
to say
I have heard Hawaiian philosophy
they say the same as quantum mechanics
maybe at some level they say the same
but if you want to study quantum
mechanics you have to go to all the
work and it is a lot of work
I have done part of it
I have given it up at a certain moment
and moved my career in a different direction
Derek Arts
who was the former director of Claire
is still working in quantum mechanics
he's still coming up with new ideas
and he still has to admit
that there are lots of things he doesn't understand
so it's not a question of saying
yes but these people they just
work from a position of
authority so they don't listen to
people who have new age
ideas or who have whatever ideas
no these people know
that to go into
the depth you really need
to go to all the hard
work all the
mathematics and at that level
you can't have a conversation
just with a philosopher
if the philosopher goes to all the hard work
goes to all the mathematics
then maybe you can go more
deeply into what quantum mechanics
really means because as Feynman
said if you believe you understand quantum
mechanics you haven't understood it
Yes
Francis you are opening many doors
and I really think that you are just listening
half of what I am saying
sometimes because that's exactly
what I am thinking
I totally agree and I cannot agree more
after spending 8 years with physicists
studying
at the university sitting there
taking classes in the history of physics
taking classes in physics
of different levels
and also spending time
with quantum mechanics people
with computer simulations people and high energy physics people
and that's why I am sometimes
also very careful when I see
people who are perceiving
themselves as Hawaiian cosmologists
as indigenous cosmologists
saying what
people in quantum mechanics say
is actually what we are also saying
I wrote an article
on ontological opportunism
where I describe exactly that kind
of communication between
a Lakuta Su cosmologist
on the one hand and a physicist
at CERN
where the Lakuta Su would actually see
in the exchange particle
Iktomi the trickster god
and would study
from his perspective
quantum mechanics
where the physicists try to translate
and get into resonance with this
and
there is no doubt
that one thing is mathematics
and as you said also
Feynman was saying on this
when you think you have understood it
you are not understanding quantum mechanics
that's one thing and the second thing
is that something I asked always
theoretical physicists when I interviewed them
was has mathematics
been invented or found
and
the most witty answer to this question
was by Lisa Randall
because she wasn't sure about it
whether it's invented or found
and she said if we have invented it
then we found a very good thing
with mathematics
so
I totally agree with you
and I think one has to be aware of this
but now we are coming to
strategic alliances again
and the strategic alliance
between the way
quantum mechanics allows
to understand the world even if you do not get it
on the basis of mathematics
on the one hand
and those indigenous cosmologies are very
useful and necessary
to save Gaia
so it's just a strategic alliance
discussing
who has here what kind of
deeper foundation for me
not my point I just want to have a strategic alliance
to save this planet and to come to a better
living together that's all
what I want
so thank you Francis for pointing this out
because that's utmost important
thank you for
your interesting presentation
I first
would like to second one
what Fottis remarked
is it possible
that you were referring to
quite a lot of different
authors and sources
is it possible to put all that
somehow in a file
and make it available
because it was I tried
to note some of them but it's not really possible
so that would be a very
nice thing
to do if you are so kind
to do that
then I have
the following question
maybe I missed something
at the beginning of your presentation
I'm not completely sure
but
I'm curious how many people
work at CERN in total
and
how many subjects did you have there
and how exactly
did you choose the subjects
did they approach you
did you choose them
so as to have an idea
as to how representative
in a way the research is
thank you very much
that's very important that you ask
so all together one could say
10,000 people are working at CERN
but that includes the fire workers
the cleaning personnel
the restaurants staff everybody
the security personnel and so on
then you have around 3,000 people
it's the largest collaboration in the world
3,000 people just at ATLAS
that's the bigger collaborations
there are 64 experimental collaborations
and some are very small
where there are just 10 people
and some are up to 3,000 people
and CERN serves like
they would say like an airport
so you have different universities
who are like airlines who fly to CERN
as the airport
and then you have the airport staff
who works at CERN itself
who have staff positions
these staff positions people are
those with the permanent positions
and then there's the
engineering tracks
areas there as well
and how I ended up there
I went over to my university
I was at Humboldt University
back at the time
and the experiment that was situated at Humboldt University
was the ATLAS experiment
so I was a guest researcher
first and then I became part
of the ATLAS collaboration
and when I entered CERN then
I met more and more people
from the engineering
from the maintenance
from the anti-matter lab
and I was interested
in the machine learning
and I was interested
in the machine learning
and the artificial intelligence
and working units
and that's how I entered
this kind of specific sector
and over the time I met more
and more people from the engineering
from the maintenance
from the anti-matter lab
from the medical section
the psychology people
I went up to the leader
of CERN
and also to the person who serves
at the cafeteria over time
and
I interviewed
I think 100 people
all together
and I was there
intermittently over 7 years
that means that I spent per year
on the site
but I was also spending
within online meetings
and I was part of
social
social
again like telegram or discord
work groups that are
non-official work groups
that go along
so I was actually connected with certain groups
all the time over years
and witnessed everything
even if I wasn't at CERN
on different social media sites
at Facebook back at that time
just to follow
how people there are also there
CERN groups work together
and I tried to capture
all generations
so the oldest person I interviewed was
96, it was Jack Steinberger
who won the Nobel Prize
back in the days in I think 1969
and the youngest person
was around 19-20 years old
entering CERN
as a student who just
would work there for 4 weeks
to find out what's going on
in order to just
get inside into this
and I really didn't want to
make any difference
from where people would come from
so I really tried to
when I realized I somehow
would talk too much
to people from a certain region
Austria, Italy and so on
I would just try and go
specifically to people from Algeria
or from India
or from China or from Japan
just to have different points of view
integrated into it
and then I spent some time in the US
in Cambridge
and in Cambridge you have
in Harvard you have
the CMS collaboration
who's working there
and that's how I got actually into
this whole field of the American Physicists
which is very interesting because
it would have the Hicks
but they didn't have the Collider
to produce it
because in 1996 they stopped the program
and so all what you see about
the European, reasonable European man
is also some kind of bitterness
because for them
the Europeans stole the Hicks
and that's why the American
Harvard American cannot breathe
in Europe because actually
she also told me once
it's actually our boson
and the price not certain
so all of this has to be seen
also within the cultural context
Okay
so
thank you for that
and just something that
irked me
you stated very confidently
and very nonchalantly
that in few years time
software programmers
said this would be out of work
and that's why it irked me
when I hear things like that
do you really believe that?
Yeah
you know
when in 1978
the axle sheet got introduced
a whole generation
of bureaucrats ended
and didn't do their job anymore
and when in 1978
the video recorder
was introduced
a certain type of production
ended
and I just
theoretically
and just
I know that it hurts
but I really think it transforms
I don't think that everybody will lose their job
but I think this wish
of many young people, young parents
that's the place where you have security
will not
will not be
I don't think that all parts will be falling
will be gone
but many aspects of the work
will be automated
and then you have to come up with new ideas
that's what I think
but I understand I would take this with cause
this was a bit dramatically put
thank you Zlatka
Thank you
We have two minutes left
so if there is
a very short comment or question
we can still
get to that
Fortis
in real life
not at the academic life
I'm a finance manager
and I think
everything in finance will be taken over
by AI
because it's very easy to do
but the final decisions
will always have to be taken by humans
because
machines can't do it
you have to decide
how you want to
go forward financially
and that's not something they will do
Thank you so much
for the interesting talk
and the conversation
I think it was lively
I believe the conversation
could still go on at least for one hour
if we had time
I was particularly intrigued by your question
can we imagine
anthropology in 100 years
I think it's a
brilliant question
I regret we didn't
manage to dive into that
but maybe there will be another occasion
so thank you
so much for today
thank you everybody
I remember I am
to send your email to Fortis
and if anybody else needs anything else
I suppose that
if Anne sends me anything
I will just simply put it on the website
where we have been coordinating
this event
there will be recording
the standard procedure
is that we put it on the YouTube channel of Claire
is it okay with you Anne?
I'm all fine thank you
so there will be links
back and forth from the website to the YouTube
and again
you are most welcome to join our series
for the upcoming events
we have things planned till April
so far
I hope I see you in person
in Brussels and then we can continue
the conversation
and discuss lively with you
and Frances and everybody else
thank you
good evening everybody
have a good weekend
bye bye
