Okay, so hello back again. Thanks for rejoining to the workshop. Artificial intuition. In
order to follow up from the morning discussions, I put some words here that may be in camera
not very clear, but I will read them. The idea of this workshop I will repeat again is to come up
with perspectives and questions that are relevant to the fine intuition, because it's a very
complicated notion that we will not most likely will not all leave the room thinking we know what
it is, but at least we will learn some new perspectives and we will enrich our understanding,
our current understanding or new current understanding. So some of the words that were
coming and I will talk about a few things that I want. I just want to share with you
just some perspectives. Some of these words are coincidence, and I wonder why coincidence came
to the table. Why coincidence is a relevant element for intuition. So I will just mention
this briefly, and I think intuition is something that is not a coincidence, but it looks like a
coincidence somehow, because it's not something we can rationalize and so on. So there is a relation
there that we can play and try to make more analytically understood. Then forward and backward
reasoning, these are the notions that Jendraco brought today this morning, and I think it's
very, very important to to go back home remembering this. So that's what I mentioned,
predictive processing. It's also a notion that this brought by Francis today a lot to explain
the notion of intuition, maybe as a mechanism that we don't have a clear explanation that maybe
runs in our unconscious. So yeah, well this was mentioned, and then the free improvisation,
I like it very much, and I mentioned here because it's an idea, it's a playground
where intuition can be studied, maybe more scientifically. Free improvisation is like
the precise playground where you can do things, then you can ask people, why did you do this?
Let's really listen to the recording and so on, and I have an article that maybe never shared with
Christian, and this surprise and equilibrium, which was mentioned also, that the idea that there is
a surprise that makes everything fun, makes everything interesting, or makes life, I don't know,
challenging. And then something that protects us, as you were saying, so this rationality
or this idea of predicting is some sort of protection. This idea I like a lot and resonates
as well with the things that I will talk. I will basically talk about three things,
so I'll try to dedicate some five minutes to them. The first one is like the idea of non-linear
knowledge, which I've never called it that way until today, so it's a new concept. The second is
the triangular inequality and the space where ideas might live, so that's the first, the second,
and the third is the idea of life towards intelligence, and through a concept that I call
importance, which is a concept that exists in the literature with different names,
but I'm trying to redevelop, so I will try to share these three things. The first is the
non-linear knowledge, okay, so if we want to know the world, if we want to think, when we think
about the world, there is something really interesting about this notion of objects,
that the things we know from the world are things that are in the world, so in a super
realistic, in the sense of realism in philosophy, so in a very realistic perspective we have a world
that we have to know and the world is composed by objects or something that is static, something
that is there to be known, so we start with this idea of objects and things that are going to be
known, okay, let's assume for a moment that the world is only composed by objects of that kind,
but by things of that kind that are completely stable, so we will know them, okay, if we go back
to the description of dynamical systems in mathematics, there is a very fun and simple
description of something that is static in time, this is static, we mean static in time, so for
example, let's say in very simple terms, a rock is a rock, because if you go to see the rock today,
the rock will have this oldest, the molecular structure of it will be the same tomorrow,
so it's the same, it's the rock, it's the same thing, okay, and that has a very simple description
called in dynamical systems a fixed point, so there are many intricacies that we can go and
discuss, but basically it's very simple to argue that a rock is a fixed point in the dynamical system
we need that, so there is this notion of fixed point, so what's the idea of a fixed point
if I look in a diagram, for example, of motion, let's think of the motion of a ball in a table,
okay, so this is the x-axis of the table and this is the y-axis of the table, so if I see this table
and I have this x-axis here, y-axis there, so if I want to draw the trajectory of this
ball that is going, let's say it's a billiard table, okay, so I will shoot it from here
and then it will do some trajectory like this, let's say I'm in the middle of the table at the
y-axis and in the zero, middle of the table at the zero coordinate, so I'm here and I shoot the
ball, so it will reach something like this and it will do something like that and then something
like this and it will start, at some point it will stop, we don't see the speed of it here
because we are only looking at position coordinates, so it will go up and down as the ball draws and
it will draw this trajectory, once the ball reaches the end because of the friction the ball
at some point will stop, after that there is nothing else, so the ball stops and it's in a fixed
point that is reached through this transient dynamics, okay, when we look at the, for example
something like the typical thing like this and we draw a ball it will do something like this,
so if we look at this in this diagram then it does something like this,
something like this, those back, yeah, so something like this, we can then, what's the point here,
the point is that the object that we are trying to look at in the space where we represent its
properties, it end up having the same fixed property at some point forever, in this case
we're looking at positions, that's that these are the properties that define what we are studying,
positions in two axes and then the fixed point is the end position, so it's the end property
of the system, so I'm trying to move this analogy to the dynamics of other concepts, so
like I said the rock, for example the rock is the object that it had some somehow it evolved
from Big Bang whatever some dynamical system and now we got this solid rock there, so if we think
that the world is composed only by objects, this is the and this is the case, then we should expect
that everything that is around us has already reached its final state, because it's an object
already, it is finalized, it is a fixed point somehow and this idea is of course very
not interesting today, but it was interesting 400 years ago, 500 years ago, they were really
thinking that the world is something that has to be known, everything is just there in some space,
everything is a fixed point at the end, in some we just have to discover what the space
of representation is, but then later on the dynamical systems thinking came with an extended
idea of stability which is also very old, but it's called the periodic orbit,
the periodic orbit, so in the in the case of a fixed point let's say, let's make this example
maybe it might be even better, so I have the earth here and then the moon rotating around
and let's say that the moon somehow loses the the capacity to remain around the moon and will
hit the moon, it will hit the earth, so it will do something like more or less like this and then
it will hit the earth, so if we got this is the position of the of the earth and this is a starting
position of the moon, we will see something like it will collapse towards the moon, towards the earth,
but in that case it will reach a fixed point with respect to the earth, but the moon somehow
remains circling around, circling around the earth, it never fixes its position, but it's always
changing its position with relation to the moon, but in a way that it repeats the pattern of
positions, so it first is in full moon or like empty moon and we got stages and it follows
these stages, the moon gravitating around the earth is not a fixed point, it's not an object,
what is the moon around the earth, what kind of concept is that, so how do we think about this
in terms of an object, the object is the moon, the object is the planet, the the earth, but what is
that trajectory that makes around, is that an object as well, that motion is not an object,
this is what we understand normally as a process, it's the process of being around the moon and so
and that's another sort of mentally, it's also an object, like the process is a sort of mental
object, right, but I think we all can kind of assume here there is a trick, like we are again
attributing the features of an object to something that's already showing in the physical space,
not having the properties of an object, so there must be something tricky here, and that's to me
what I why I call this towards non-linear knowledge, because if we look at nature,
it's the interesting thing, if we look at nature and we analyze any part of nature as a mechanical
system, we will find that the stable regimes, the dynamically stable regimes of the system,
so what remains as such, what we is stable enough to be even observed, will not be fixed points
generally, generally what we have is oscillations, we ourselves, we are oscillating machines as well,
we eat food, we have certain levels of energy, sugar, glucose, blah blah blah and everything is
always coming, everything is always oscillated, so with our stability in the world, our beingness
is not of the kind of a fixed point, it's of the kind of a periodic orbit and there are some other
forms of stability in dynamical systems that I will not dig into, but it's much more likely that a
dynamical system settles in a periodic orbit than in a fixed point, so that means that it's much more
likely that the things to know in the universe are processes and not objects, so why do I call this
non-linear knowledge, it's because if the system is too linear, it's too simple, it will always end
up in a fixed point and when you have non-linearities, it's when you start seeing this behavior and that
is what connects to me with the Hopi tradition and all this kind of ancient and like really weird
philosophies from a western perspective that assume that the whatever signals coming from all over the
universe can be telling us something, I think that at least from this perspective that shows that
dynamical systems settle into processes of self-preservation rather than in fixed points,
objectual fixed points, if we take this argument seriously, we cannot discard the fact that there
are certain trajectories of this kind distributed across the universe that are much more informative
of what's going on in the universe than the objects we are accustomed to see and try to seek for
and watch, so this is to me the first thing that I wanted to say that I call it now non-linear
knowledge, I will maybe elaborate some day on this more seriously but it's an idea that has to be
has been with me for a while that when we question seriously the nature of knowledge,
it's probably more like a periodic orbit than an object, so that's one thing, that's chapter one,
okay so now chapter two is the question another reflection or diffraction better said according
to our nomenclature today, which is the idea of questioning how the let's say back again to the
idea of trying to put things in spaces, let's assume that there is a world of ideas, I start
with this question, let's assume that there is a world and universe somehow of ideas in the same
way that we have the physical, real, physical world, we have another mental world, ideas,
words, semantics, words, meanings or whatever we can call it as we want, but there is another space
okay where we can put ideas and indeed connecting to the artificial intelligence methods, many of
the methods in natural language processing tend to map words to spaces, so for example I have the
space here, I will make a very simple space, happy and I will say I don't know I will be,
okay well too happy, well so if you are sad, so this will be maybe to give a
some word like this, we think that now the points are concepts or words in this space,
so where do we put for example street dog here, street dog, street dog will be maybe not wealthy
at all and maybe it will be somewhere here, not oh well it depends, not too wealthy and maybe happy
somewhere here, where it will be put I don't know Michael Jackson, so Michael Jackson is very wealthy
and very unhappy, so it's here, where do we put I don't know who you can tell me an example if you
want, someone that is happy, Dalai Lama, okay Dalai Lama is very wealthy, I don't know where it will be put
Dalai Lama, very wealthy or not, I think he's very wealthy, okay but he's super happy, he's
very happy, we know and and and and we must believe that he's very unhappy, right, this is the Dalai
Lama, we have to believe his and this is the Dalai Lama that maybe I would believe really yes,
I don't know but if you travel around all over, come on, the pope, the pope, where is the pope,
well super wealthy, super wealthy, it's not wealthy, super poor and super unhappy,
okay we can both think here and and that's the thing that we can start putting other words,
if we augment the dimension of this space, we can use other objectives like not necessarily wealthy
happiness and we will not be categorizing people, we can use it actually for for putting every
possible word, every possible word we can imagine like freedom, what is freedom here,
it doesn't really exist, maybe we need another dimension for freedom, we need another dimension
for systems or for relations or for colors and so this is what the natural language people do
or used to do in the early 2000s at least, they were creating this like super highly dimensional
spaces and then they were putting words in these spaces and then according to their distance,
they will check whether a word is predictive of another or whether if you have this text then
you should put this other text and actually this is called word embeddings and it's done by the
neural networks as well today but with other methods and it's I'm actually over simplifying
the description of what really happens but it's more or less like this, you have dimensions
and you get words in these spaces and then the geometry of the meaning, the meaning between
the concepts is given by the geometry between the points so whether they are far, whether they can
be connected to some other thing or you can establish geometrical relationships of this point
to grasp meaning relationships between the concepts so that's the idea that we can put meaning
in a space so if this works then what we will say is what is the space of ideas, okay what people
normally actually believe still today and this is also another thing I would like to contest
myself doing research, they say okay well it must be a 2000 dimensions space, I think 2000 no no
3000, no billions, no with a hundred is enough we will get like and they make experiments and try
test and and do all sorts of things and actually it works really well but there is an underlying
assumption here which I will question now which is the idea that this is a space like the physical
space so the question the guys make is how many dimensions you need whereas I'm going to question
now the very structure of the space so and this is why I call the triangular inequality because
every space that we know from Euclidean geometry or from like basic mathematical mathematics about
what is a space what is a space in the first place a space is any except we call it a set
so you need to have a list of elements we can be all the points in the space it can be an alphabet
it can be any any collection of things so it's something like x y and there can be infinite
or as many as you want so for example the real numbers is a set composed by zero it has 0.0001
0.0002 and all the numbers in between the natural numbers is the most simple set is one two three
four natural numbers integral numbers count the negatives and rational numbers count the fractions
real numbers count also the irrational numbers which are not fractions and so on and that's the
idea of sets okay so a space in mathematics is a set is a set x that is equipped with a notion
of distance distance is something that requires two elements of the set x1 and x2 and it will
give you a value with a number between zero and infinity what infinity is not considered so you
make it like this but you take two elements of the set and that will tell you a number which is
the distance between the number and the points the elements in the set okay that's the distance if
like I say between Orion and me once the distance okay 1.5 meters that's that's the distance function
between me and Olga between you and you we can all measure our distance and that's what the function
makes okay but now to be super general about the space distance has three properties and that's
every distance we'll have to have that in every geometry the first is that the distance between
an element let's call it s in the space s1 and s2 sorry between s and we'll make it more simple
between a and a so a is a point in the space the distance between a and a is equal to zero
for all a so for all the points in space if I measure the distance between him at the point
and itself it's always going to be zero so nothing can be far from itself everything is within itself
okay the other is the distance between a and b it's equal to the distance between b and a
that's another brilliant property I cannot be further from you than you are from me now if you
are a little bit thinking about it that's not what happens for example in social networks
where you can be a friend of someone that is not friend of you you know you can follow someone
that doesn't follow you so this already is far from social relationships we can see it immediately
and actually there are experiments in psychology that say that people think that Korea is more
similar to China than China to Korea so so that is already questioning like the notion of distance
sorry let me finish the point and and then the last one is the triangular inequality which says
for all a b and c the distance between a and b must be smaller or equal than the distance between
a and c plus the distance between c and a that's the triangular inequality and if we make it
graphically it's very simple I make two points in space a and b I have their distance
and then if I draw a third point c whatever and I calculate the distance between a and c
plus the distance between c and b then the sum of these two distance is larger than this one
so that's pretty obvious for every point any c that I try to look in the universe
will never make the distance between a and b shorter it can only make it equal if it falls
over this line if I go c here then I got a and c c and b and that will be equal just equal but never
shorter so this is to me a very interesting element that to say okay if we put ideas in a space
then ideas will have to be of this kind they will have to respect the triangular inequality
but actually I have this experiment that was not made by me but it has been made by
psychologists that you put the word uh assassin for example here the guy that kills for money
then you get the word uh spoon
assassin and spoon normally you don't find many connections it's not really kind of
not too not not too connected they don't mean the same thing but if you put knife in between
assassin and knife very close they always go together knife and spoon they always go together
so then if let's say this is distance 10 assassin to spoon assassin to knife is distance one knife
to spoon is distance one so one plus one is not larger than 10 it's smaller than 10
so I think in meaning we are able to reverse the triangular inequality we can go and find
another thing which is the intuition to me it couldn't be thought as the intuition that will
allow you to bring closer I'm not defining intuition I don't know I'm just like saying that
it's related to this act of discovering in your in your mental space in your mental construction
that something can just get bring things closer so make feel the semantic gap that something
feels distance or unknown and now it feels known or close so all these things are to be more
precise I'm just throwing the idea on the table and now I finished this concept with with the
with the radical transformation of this axiom from for all A and B and for all C
this inequality hold and I replace it with this alternative that says for all A and B
there exists a C such that the distance between A and B it's going to be larger than
the distance between A and C plus the distance between C and B if you impose that for all points
for all ideas there is a third idea that will bring this two idea closer this two ideas closer
what you are assuming is that for every two things you think you can somehow think it better
make the connection faster or somehow connect these two things this has an interesting conclusion
which is which what I'm going to finish is that it's easy to look if we draw again A B
and then I put C here we will geometrically it's impossible to find that point that makes the
distance shorter so I will just make it longer and you have to imagine that is short so now
I discovered a point that makes the distance between A and C closer and now I apply recursively
and now I look for the new point that makes the distance between A and C shorter so let's call it
C1 and then from C to B closer and we call it C2 so now we go in this trajectory and if we go from
A to C1 to C to C2 to B it's even shorter and if we apply recursively this again all over
and all over and all over and all over and all over again we might find that there is an infinite
pathway of concepts that takes A to B at no distance so A and B will be the same but only
when they go through that I call it enlightenment path so that's something that
it's a geometry that allows for having things with distance but except if you go through
some other structure sequence so that's an idea okay and I have not developed it
further than this but it's really interesting because it can connect kind of what is wanted
the Buddhist philosophy with mathematics and with geometry so it's something to occur
and I believe because of time I will keep this very very short not even make a drawing
but and also a little bit technical so I will not explain the full details
but in our project in our recent project with Evo and some other people will arrive and join
to the team as well we were working in the origins of goal directedness and and the basic
idea is that goal directedness and it's a property that beings have so you get a B to
be goal directed and in order to be you have to remain in the world enough so others can say you
are right so starting from this again we can be as a fixed point or we can be as a process right
we mentioned that already fortunately so we focus on those things that are as a process
and these are like in in the language of maturana these are the autoboyetic systems
so then the first goal of something is to be as a process for a complex enough system
it will be to be as a process and then how do we get from that to intelligence
and that's the evolutionary pathway that these things because they receive perturbations
they change their structure I will go really far here really fast so sorry if it doesn't make sense
but these things start acquiring novel structures in them that might prevent them to remain
self-maintaining so they will break down and become a fixed point that is not leaving it
will just be like a rock or it would allow them to navigate better their environment and if I
navigate I don't mean they are able to move even I mean just to stay around so actually motion
will be first one of these first things that a cell at first leaving this chemical structure
was able to implement maybe moving was something very primitive that things needed to acquire the
features to be able to do that as part of their self-maintaining processes some other very very
intuitively simple feature that should have gotten is the ability to distinguish certain things that
are harmful from these other things that are not harmful if the system is not able to distinguish
those things eventually it will die right it will not survive enough so those other systems that were
able to make these distinctions through evolution I mean so systems changing their structure
implementing improving what they are able to eat and process if they develop the selective capacity
then they become better if they develop further capacity they might get memory a representation
of the state of the world a predictive capacity maybe develop other forms of perception and that's
what it's called the affordance in in in some literature it's it can be equated to this concept of
know what to do with your environment know how to deal with your environment and use it for your own
say for your own resilience so I think that there is a pathway between the origins of life
and intelligence that is just like the ontogeny of affordances and I think that this is something
also very interesting to think because intuition it's a concept that we only think for highly advanced
cognitive systems like humans but would ants have intuition you know would fixed points have
intuition can a can a rock have intuition or you need to be first a process so this is the
angle I want to bring like when we define back if we want to define intuition we need to know
what are we talking about first and I think that this setting is a helpful setting to identify
the different possible definitions would apply to which possible kind beings so this this were my
three my three six aspects okay thank you thank you so Katarina would you like to speak immediately
or we can burn on because we cannot go for too many questions if there is something urgent maybe
we can do it now there's too many points yeah okay okay I want you to make a fine point of what you
said at least to me yeah we're all just quite a bit further and I'm going to stand a bit
because I think you've done right me if I'm wrong but you've offered us a very good analysis of
quantum context orientation okay that's it and you the way I understood it you're showing that
there's too fast the context organization which happens in any case a linear one the rational
one that we talked about this morning and then the nonlinear knowledge only but in either case
for you to arrive nonlinearly to knowledge you have shown that context civilization is necessary
right tonight the assassin the court right so that process happens but you don't have to
arrive at now we can finally talk about the results if the result is context civilization
by linear means have I understood you yeah yeah fairly correctly but I think you you pulled the
rabbit out of half at least for me yeah this did yes and yeah that's all I want to say and also
again we don't have to it's not that we are they're reacting so
whoop you can play rock paper scissors
go in your view you're right by the camera okay so yeah I have a nonlinear way of
understanding and echoing with you all to do but I will write it down here okay also
what you guys think is that I was already doing in private school also based on mathematics
so if we have impossible and then we do this and we are with mathematically well I mentioned that
possible so because we know the definition of it and we know the definition of possible
but we cannot predict so the thing we can do is to do everything possible as much as possible
to turn as small as possible so in this way we will turn impossible into possible
I mean by this I mean as close as to possible which is this and so this is one layer from
mathematics and then from a philosophical perspective so by doing this putting the slash
in a mathematical way and then impossible itself really become impossible because when we use it
as a word when you use it to signify something impossible and impossible itself become possible
but if we do this slash and itself become real as it is linguistically so that's my nonlinear
understanding I'm not sure about the the operations you were performing but we can discuss it later
because because I had I think I am I think that would take way too long yeah just a way of understanding
what yeah okay I have a quick question about a second equation you said that is broken by
social network that when you follow someone it's not necessarily someone follows you back
I think here is a very fundamental cognitive error because this is like imagine set is like set of
people in this room right and this is like distinguished and then I see someone in the
window of another room and like I see them yeah so I create the connection but he doesn't see me back
it doesn't mean you know that like the distance is shorter or longer it means that we are not
in the same set and that's why we just not allow it mathematically to apply this equation
exactly so that's why I don't understand why you connected social work to this equation yeah
it's because there is a tendency in engineering mathematics to try to invent reality in the
mathematical structures they know so people like to make the assumption of course you would fail
miserably if you try to explain this this phenomenon you're saying with this but people try
and and they try with language you know and people still do that and it's as stupid as you say
is what I'm saying that what happens for language okay so because I thought it's really like you
know a question the equation is for me not it's just you just kind of rely on the situation to
the non-equal system yeah because this person until this person doesn't know this first person
then no one says so yeah yeah I can also say that if we are not in the same set it's because
there's some something yeah yeah yeah there's a sense themselves are emergent
yeah no no I mean this this can be elaborated but but and there are all these dimensions of
the construction of the set and so on we are really interested never explored it
but but I think they you know as I've discussed with mathematicians about it and
this is something like this in general relativity you get a little bit of this and
and I know these things are kind of been never seen in the cognitive science you know
there is a big time here I mean well the best
makes makes appears three sets
yeah nice no no but yeah the intuition behind this is to question the actions
that define a mathematical structure that you would end up using to describe reality
so and this is a second foundation of question whether the tools we use because it's a big
problem in that remember the processing they made this work in medics in vector spaces they do it
because they don't know any other geometric structure and they think that the Cartesian
map is all what you need and everything that can be represented geometrically has to be
in a Cartesian scheme you know it's to me it's like really deep that there is like
one last question from Flo okay so and then I was wondering also going back to the improvisation
side like you're in a process of associating and then you think of something and then this
this can be very different from person to person maybe one person has has a different
life experiences different perspectives than the other person and also different associations
between words so perhaps for person one a b and c might have a different way of arranging than
the other person if that's something that can also be incorporated in this model and if it still
sort of fits yeah that's not different either in which part of the yeah this one then maybe
yeah assessing and for maybe another person would even make this association or these
distances would be different yeah based on persons or basically for every person this
is different I would say so you have a familial functions indexed by the differences that you
can establish let's say we got for simplicity we got only three concepts and we got only maybe
three possible values zero one and two these are the possible distance and no other values
exist then you would have that all possible combinations in principle are ways to represent
this reality right so everything has distance one everything has distance two zero to this one
to this and so on so all these combinations are possible in principle mathematically speaking
there is no problem with it so then it comes to the question of fitting data so we will say okay
this type of culture will make this type of associations and it will get this type so
that's uh that's sorry but to finish the answer of the other question is that
that that is not really a big and it's not really a question that will modify this argument
because different people will have different functions different cultures will have different
functions we can make this parameter dependent and that's more like on the on the modeling side
on parametrization of this thing what what I mostly care about is about that this structure
regardless of the values there is a third point that makes that that's what I but for the modeling
yes that's always a defense and then whether these points are whether these points are points you know
or or processes from another space and that that's something I haven't really got deep into it but
but I think it's uh extremely relevant to think because it might be the clue to unveil maybe
these distances better so and but that this is only very I would say intuitive reasoning I have
for the moment so just just like clue like vague so but vague and intuitive it's not the same so
I don't want to misuse the word
you said that there are infinite possibilities to calculate any of the infinite possibilities on
hopefully that's not the point because there's anything you think you have to waste
yeah option by myself so I hope all the responses are there yeah yeah the the thing is that if I
said this is a rock B is my idea of a rock that that I don't know if that is at least the object
itself or it's me as a process thinking of this you know so all these things is like more like in
the pilsen side that we should anyway yeah it's it's also a question please because this is something
we can discuss further later you know all this we cannot discuss a bit today so now we have a
the pleasure to have a Katarina speaking you can introduce yourself to three minutes and then
so thanks Katarina you will be on camera now we lost the we lost a bunch of them after we was
yeah the battery is getting weaker so it died oh yeah so we need to reestablish our
I will I will ask people I will let me check who is who is uh let me check who is this host now
I think I'm host I'm it moved me it moved me back as I was so let's get in and then I will yeah
yeah fortunately are there any questions from the audience in the meantime because we are running
little you know the online audience sorry I don't know I'm kidding I'm kidding yeah
so uh Clemón
yes I'd like to talk about how to create kind of ontology based on the dynamic and system theory
but uh then I think you you could purchase much much more like export the cycle and so you could
yeah yeah it's a strange attractor and all that yeah yeah I didn't because of time I won't go on that
but yeah I think so I would write it as a or explore the ideas of new ontology in a way to
yeah I've been about to do that for 10 years
I know I know I know whoever wants to join in the effort of writing that I will be glad to
collectively write this paper because I've been really and I think it's actually even a possible
kind of argumentation towards all them like that odd and all this you know like the hoppy
knowledge or you know like all this kind of not well credited forms of knowledge I think they
I mean this is not that it's not supporting but it's giving some kind of mathematical ground to
it at least you know
fortunately like the passion is not the personal distance that's
the thing is that distance it's it's a specific uh notion of not all topology has a distance
not all topologies have a distance that can be defined so distance is basically for
the the the real the traditional geometry of space but I think that
most of or not I will in short terms most of the non
non what's the non non-rimanian geometry it's like hyperbolic geometry and all that these things
can happen but only low there is one point that is like the black hole that bends the reality
depends the geometry but you don't have that for every single every two points so so that's that's
the radical thing of the argument that you are kind of saying that there are infinite
wormholes between every two points in space pretty much is something you know actually the
action could be said there exists a unique c-point that makes this distance shorter because if you
don't say it's unique there could be more or infinite so there is a first exploration that
should be done when you assume that there is only one I call it epiphany point because it's like
the illumination the epiphany you know in the sense of spirit spiritual thinking yeah
how is it related to problem in the sense in a language model with one word follows
another
the thing is that every more every probability model will be finite you need a finite number of
states you that that's my thought that you will never have like the whole space accessible you have
just like a a sample of points and those will be the distance you add a new point and that will
propagate all the changes in distances the distance will be proportional no no inverse yeah
inverse yes inverse you're right yes yeah and if you if you model it as the inverse of the
probability you add this new epiphany point you discover it and that will propagate changing
all the probabilities and that's why yeah maybe some yeah there are so many to create the third
yeah yeah yes yes yeah I've tried some I tried to ask him I question these axioms actually
the dissimilarity whether something is similar to what find and find a concept that makes these two
things closer you know and then to the other as you see some but I haven't systematically
explored it so also a potential research can you tell me absolutely yes and now I can even make you
host you know send another cable to your phone make host we will ask the audience do you have a
charger yeah so
katarina and with this here so because here is the microphone right here's the mic
now that this is typing so okay we need a what is it USB-C, C, C cable does anybody have a
your phone's not even USB yeah USB or USB-C? I know it's on the table on the floor
with uh no no with this finger
this one works no
no
does anybody have a laptop adapter like a laptop that's great yeah yeah okay
okay next time we need a power bank
right yeah we need to put that
okay
all right all good it's a little intimidating
um yeah thanks Thomas and thanks everyone for having me over I didn't really prepare
a presentation but I would like to share something with you and I would uh appreciate it if you
asked me questions can we make it more a conversation rather than me
uh giving a lecture or anything I'm just gonna present the project and I think it
goes really well with what Thomas was just talking about
so I'm just gonna find these videos
now you know how to get in touch
it's just your computer doesn't really
it doesn't do anything
yeah I know
no it's just too many open tabs
there's only 13 open tabs
13 every new window is taking more CPU so
that's what I'm gonna try to minimize
you think it's internet
no it's
okay no it's super slow
okay well
so while this is loading
since the beginning actually for two years now I have been interested in the
notion of origin and nothingness and how do these very abstract ideas of
origin if we're talking about processes so every time we talk about the process we also have to
kind of figure out when a process started so if it started then also when it will end
and this whole idea of origin and end and thinking of the world in these terms also
presupposes that there is a point of origin a zero a moment where there is nothing happening
and how do these all these abstract concepts actually stand I have it here so I developed
two ways of inquiring about these
concepts one is in language and the other one is in material in language I thought
can we investigate what the origin is if we treat the point of zero as point of origin
as something from which like in mathematical Cartesian scale you can come back to as if
we are speaking out of this or language arises out of this chaotic unordered mind
so can we come back to this chaotic unordered mind through language so can we
basically employ a mathematical function of cancellation can we have a positive statement
that is then opposed with a negative statement and one day two collides can they cancel meaning
can you reach that point of zero by positive and negative
that I think is the
direction in mathematics that's called the inverse operator yeah so you want the inverse of meaning
yeah and this so this was in language and in material I was wondering how does this
idea of zero or origin or nothingness enter our domain of experience in material
how do we understand these through our senses and so I started working with
vacuum and silence some things that are we only understand this absence is not directly
in both of these cases it's all indirect knowledge so here I'm going to tell you some
recent developments with negation in language because I started working with AI and since the
beginning of the year we developed in collaboration with a creative coding studio in The Hague
called Render we developed two works that use AI for negation
and I will show you the first one is
inversion so this is a very yeah it's not at all obvious when we say to negate something
what do we mean because it can mean that you oppose something that you invert something that
you you're doing contradiction or it's a contriety
and so immediately it is quite apparent how natural language is so much more complex than
mathematics because in mathematics the inversion is one minus one it's not one and minus eight
um but sorry but there is a whole range of mathematics that stands that day
so but but it's not the mathematics we learn in
it's a specific theory
but that's not for it
but that's really not very much by language it's the thing it says in the years haven't
like what states give
well so what we see is that we have quite an asymmetrical problem when we are talking about
negation because the moment you try to inverse to invert something the moment you want to
invert the meaning you are immediately in the domain of context on which level do you want
to invert the meaning and so what you will end up with is that saying the dog is barking
the opposite of that is everything else including the dog is barking
because of the way you said it or in the context of which you said it because even if the dog is
barking a question is already the inversion of that sentence so it's not at all apparent in which way
uh I would send a statement as a negation or a positive statement
so I will show you the
it doesn't want to open the
all right sorry it's just my computer's it it does it sometimes it just goes slow
it was doing it was doing really well today but now it's like having its battery run out on
it's like on fire it's put it in a bad language
maybe you can't yeah maybe we have to quit my quitting stuff
quit that and quit the other one this one also you know pro is actually the worst for your
computer in terms of your spotify and quit that that's the other ones we need up yeah okay
so um so it was really difficult for us to kind of formalize negation being me being an artist
trained visually and Edvin Jacobs who is a computer engineer also with interest in linguistics but
also not a computational linguist linguist so it's quite a complicated matter but so we developed
basically an approach towards using AI for this purpose and I will show you a visualization of what
happens within a computational model and this is a visualization for us
so basically what we are looking at is a density map of all the words used in
are you sharing that to the to do I don't know no
so what we're looking at is a density map of all the words that are used in the book on the origin
of species by Charles Darwin and we're using the sixth edition from 1901 and we use this text
in order to indicate material evolution using AI and what we see on this video is a two and a
half dimensional map of words relationships so later in the video the words are going to appear
for the nodes so the proximity of the nodes is how often the two words are found next to each other
and the the height of this landscape basically the height is the frequency of a word being used
so on the signal of the plants you can kind of
uh
it's just an animation it's this imagined space of language through the prism of the machine
yet this is totally not what the machine does or how it looks like it's entirely what someone's
was talking about it's all about vectors and these models that we are using um in this case this model
has it it has 300 dimensions for us this cannot be represented so each word has 300 dimensions
that means that it can connect to all the other words in such complex matters and calculate
their dependencies and relationships so beyond what we would think or understand of that world
so in a way through working with these models I realized that I've kind of entered an alien
territory and I I'm no longer in natural language territory and I'm not sure if I'm
learning about our language or about the machine's language because they are it feels like they're
totally different
so
yeah
And then what we also tried and it's really interesting I was thinking about this totally intuitively, maybe not.
So, talking with them, we were thinking about how to represent geometry.
And there are these circle inversion algorithms that we had the idea of using and basically what happens later in this video is that this entire landscape gets inverted onto itself.
Absolutely, like a black hole.
I think in version, like to me naturally would mean you can invert in many levels in any place, and it's so complicated that simply taking it for both.
Landscape and imparting.
This was one video this is trying to visualize what happens in a language model.
And in terms of
in terms of negation, what we found out is that
to my surprise what we found out is that these language models are actually quite advanced when it comes to negation.
Something I didn't think.
And if you ask to GPT it will give you eight different modes of negating
standard negation, which is a simple negation adding a
negative before the adverb to the predicate of the sentence so dog is running dog is not running that's a standard or simple one.
That's negative prefix double negation, negative adverb in the right location and rhetorical negation and on the side you can
read about them.
And a little abstract from the from the fourth chapter the national selection is negated in each of these models.
At some point.
This this part of the work is done with LGBT at some point LGBT also inverted the Darwin's book into
the text everything is as God intended. Everything is unmutable and as it was supposed to be and I was like, wow, perfect negation.
Then here you can see some details about how negation is actually asymmetrical.
And actually, perhaps, most importantly, for this research for me is that
to try to negate is really to be creative, because like any other translation, choosing between a variety of possibilities.
And also looking for those possibilities is at the same time being imaginative what something in the negative can be.
And so if machines are good at negating at understanding them contextually and are able to negate that means that the machines are not only becoming more creative, or more inventive.
But they are also developing a way to deny and to lie.
Because they can take in a context what something that something is true this is a positive statement that they are now capable to deny it.
What we see is this year just a few months ago, we had a chat bot that lied that had a task to solve a problem and in order to solve the problem it had to do the capture it had to click I'm not a robot.
But it did it went online and it hired the person to go on click for it that it's not a robot and it told the person I'm a blind person, so the person believed it.
And that's how the robot solved the problem.
So we already have a eyes that are have the capacity to deceive.
That means that they're getting smarter.
They're not like smart kids, the kids that tell you the truth, they're not the brightest.
And so here you can see on the left side, only the title on the origin of species the five words.
And then antonymization so all the possible antonym for each of these words generated more than 36 million possible negative sentences for the vital alone.
And
I want to, I want to print out every single possible variation of a negative book.
I think it's great but that poses another problem is how do you then decide or how do you, how do you find the value on what is a good negation or not and that is then again a subject subjective decision you got to make based on your level of creativity.
And you're going here on the right side, we can see that if you do want the machine to negate more creatively then you have to find ways to teach what you mean by that so you have to design a prompt and one of the prompts with design was
the sequence of words by using color opposition so black is to white like defense is to offense offense as to attack attack to counter attack so this was one way to force a machine to think in the country when looking for opposites, because otherwise can keep generating this
options and another thing I wanted to mention, we're going to talk about today is that you do all of this training of the machine with punishments.
We punish the machine when it doesn't do what we expected to do and this backtracking the back learning what Francis was mentioning that some statements gain more value when this correct and everything to a judge you could be asked you how good was this.
If you can give it the thumbs up or thumbs up this is how you are basically keep staying the relationship.
But every time the machine produces an answer which is not what you are looking for it's punished by points. And of course it wants to perform as better as it can. So it wants to avoid making you unhappy.
Anyway, this is how we train the challenge.
I would say like a slave. So we treat AI like a slave right now.
That's the most stupid because you can't in real life, you have it like the dog attacks, people would not go and tell you the real thing.
Yeah, I would like to them because they did not get punished. So the same way maybe accept the moment to make the AI more stupid by punishing it for coming up with outside that she don't like this is how it depends on what we want them to do for us.
If we want AI to be more creative then definitely.
And so, lastly, I will mention the last project I just developed which is on view at the moment here in Brussels.
And it was a commission.
Actually, I was asked to go deeper into this relationship between color and opposition.
I read, not fully but I started reading Wittgenstein's remarks on color. And this is a very nice area as well where
talking about color and experiencing color are completely two different things. Some things can be said yet not be seen and some things can be seen yet cannot be said and every
color is different. So I took this one part of this system we built this opposition black is to white like, and then I wondered, how does a machine look for color opposition.
How does that machine know like in white, unless, of course, it's in words, but even in words black and white are going to be so close to each other yet because they belong to the set of colors or lights.
So how does it learn this.
And what we did we use then a new model by open AI the same strategy PT which is basically all image generating a eyes they work on you write a prompt. So somehow machine knows what you mean when you say tree.
So how does the machine know this.
I will just briefly show you the this the website of the model that we are using and it's one of the earliest models developed to combine text and image.
And basically what it does is the same as with language it creates these large image data sets that it runs.
What they call a zero.
Like, without much training, it can start recognizing or choosing the right. This is your short prediction.
And essentially, what it does it it creates embeddings for text and images together yet really weirdly it doesn't, it doesn't embed words as words it embeds them as characters.
So it calculates her character not her words the relationship to the image. And it does that in 512 dimensions. So it has 212 dimensions more than a regular text model.
Every time, every time we think about these relationships that means that I can play this while I speak.
Well, I can show you.
I'm going to try to play it again. Basically, now I lost the train of thought that's what we've done is we took 4096 colors from RGB spectrum.
And so 256 color for red, green and blue. So these 4096 colors, we embedded in this clip model. We said, organize it how you think these colors should be organized.
And then we embedded the English dictionary. And we said, organize it's how you think it should be organized.
And basically what the model did it created.
You could say a world of its own, where certain colors stand close to each other because of the way we speak about them, how they are in language.
But they don't follow the geometry of color that we standardly accept through color theory. So the opposition of red, not green, yellow, or the opposition of blue is dark brown.
And, and this is, of course, there is a lot of intervention from us, because what we have done and I'm trying to play this video, but maybe I can do it on my Instagram.
Your computer is so slow.
Yeah, sorry.
This is the installation, you can see it until the end of October, but I guess it's better I tell you about it.
Where is it.
It's
It used to be called labo or actually it is still labo or topos and it's in Bollebec. It's an artist run space.
And it's an exhibition that deals with art and language.
And here I want to show you
for everybody posted on the workshops website after the 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, that information and also the slides, your slides.
So there will be all this information you see the website after the recording.
So basically this is what we did. We took this 512 dimensions.
We translated them into two dimensional space, preserving the distances between the points. And what you see here is the color space as viewed by the machine.
And then what we've done is we use the opposition of 180 degrees on the globe to look for the opposite of a color.
And so we use this method basically to push the machine to go into a more creative way of looking for antonyms and negations in language because every, every color has the most closest words.
Right, so you can find these
sometimes it makes sense such as orange is paired with orange color, but sometimes I don't know like pendant is this side color or
it's very arbitrary but what we see is also in our languages arbitrary like what I would ask you what is the color of
this so many times said especially today but what is the color of services and so if you would ask the model.
It would also give you its own view.
And so, yeah.
And here is the week created basically the dictionary that maps all poison colors.
And then we used it to translate different poems.
So yeah that's what I wanted to share with you.
I also had some thoughts on the previous conversations since the beginning of the morning but I don't want to take more time right now so.
Thank you.
So,
focus to the organization now.
We have time for a little bit of time for conversation discussion so we have questions now. It's a good time.
I think that the reason that myself personally, I would prefer to meet up with you later, because too much too many things to say, but I will throw some new comments or not.
Very, very far.
So that thing of the nation is very interesting because in traditional mathematics.
We learn the nation as the complement of the set.
If we have to elements then the negation is just there. We tend to think that what is not in a given set so the drawings, it's like, have a like a universe data set, then the negation is everything that is not in the set.
So if this is my set x, then you minus x is equals to no x.
I think that this is a very rudimentary form of negation, because in this case the space has no operations.
So then later, if you have a vector space, which is has more mathematical structure, more operations, you can add things you can multiply and so on.
So negation starts acquiring more freedom.
And in quantum theory, it's a very important form of negation that is called auto complementarity, which is like, I have a, like the other, like the autonomous space.
So if something is this, then no, this will not be the rest of the universe, but my pump will be this or will be this.
So the negation is not unique by definition.
And there are many other extensions to that logic and so on. Actually, the people from the Center for logic and philosophy of science in Amsterdam are experts on this.
You should talk to them to Sonya's meds or, you know, I will introduce you to them.
So there's a lot to say about that. And I like very much that you were doing we have so many things I like to discuss.
So, any other comments on the internet.
Okay.
Okay.
I mean, now in the last dictionary.
Yes.
Yeah, so it was basically.
So, briefly, it's basically the system is oscillating between representing words as vectors and as characters.
So here you see the vectors being printed out and then it mixes with character.
Yeah, just two things. Thank you.
Yeah, this this question of negation is really what is a good negation. I think this was this is this is a great take what you said.
And it's yeah, it's it's almost what you said to that the dog is not barking. What does this mean?
You know, sorry, it's doing anything else, or is it just not barking.
And so this is, I mean, we're not really talking about language in this kind of sense. And this is the one thing. And I just want to add what went through our mind when you were when you were talking.
It's what I find interesting that we want to be AI superhuman super it should be reliable.
So we have this idea of reliability when I say I'm Christian that I'm that you think that I'm really Christian, and the great.
It's great because we are not reliable. And you, you're working with this that the machine is also not reliable, you know,
when it was shown the first time in May, if we would run that script again, it would give a completely different and much improved negation of the book.
Yeah, it's like, it's like, I met you when you were two years old. And now I know you. That's the difference. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I think it's, you know, and maybe it's, I don't know, it's just an idea that comes to my mind that we were talking about mimicking human behavior.
It mimics now human behavior because it's unreliable, but we don't want to that mimics that human behavior, you know, to be unreliable.
And this is, I found super interesting and it is, and it is not intended by our algorithms and programming that it behaves like this, you know, and this is this I found super interesting.
Yeah, this is again these different logics. No, like, I think it's like this logic of the algorithm versus this like complex logic. It's a different one is really reliable and one, you just don't know what's going to happen.
But if you want to do it the machine, that is not the non-reliable.
Yeah, this is so maybe we're already there, you know, and we expect the wrong things.
Yeah, if we want to, but I'm really talking about a mimicking behavior without that we so so and so we can say we did something in negation that leads to the result that the machine behaves unreliable we're trying.
We try to, we try to program it in a way that is reliable, but behaves unreliable, and which is the negation of what we are doing. So, we, we, we, you know what I mean. So we are really working in this direction and doing the opposite.
And, and this is another thing which which I found so intriguing, you know,
it's very much in the ethics of the discussion, whether how safe are we, you know, yes, we're training the thing to do something.
Actually, I want to share something that I wrote recently about.
You will, you will assist.
Yeah, I just wanted to throw in a really interesting thing about negation that you asked what does it really mean, as long as I park it.
That's papers from neuroscience and neuroscience, how every time we're talking in negatives, our part of the brain that does the imagination of what is being spoken is off.
We are not imagining in negative.
It's impossible our brain does not.
When they say the dog is not parking, you see the dog parking, somehow not parking.
And so other, other research also, which is that kids do not remember stories that were said in the message.
And the simply our brain won't memorize things, not negative experiences that that's going to be a negative states, they don't pretend to our memory.
And another thing is that we have not found any other species of an organism that negates.
So, apart from us, and now the machines, where the only two species that can get.
I once did a performance where I was reading a text, a scientific text.
And all I was doing was exchanging.
If it was a normal statement, I negated it.
So it's not this. And if there was a negation, I left it off, you know, and it really, really starts to get.
And if you do it for a while, and the people listening to it for a while, it really gets strange things.
It's really crazy, you know, and it really opens up a complete field of, or you start to get an intuition of, of, of this, you know, that there's always this.
Yeah, is it absence which which follows or if I do this at the same time, it's the absence of something else or I do something.
But I, I, the effect is the opposite and these questions and this is, I think in this whole discussion about how to, how to create an artificial intelligence.
All this, this is a super important field, which is, at least to my knowledge, not really explored at the moment, it's, you know, it's.
Explainable.
Yeah.
These guys are moving.
What is that?
What is that?
Explainable AI is an area of research in AI that dedicates to find the way that the neural networks are able to explain the reason why they think that they were right the way they do.
Why, why GPT will tell you something, it will explain you because this because and that one has to be encoded in the numbers in the network.
Why those numbers would mean time.
So it's people trying to discover concepts we need them.
Francis mentioned that a little bit.
Sure. Yeah, but they're having been like much advanced in that. Sorry.
No, no, it's good. Should we maybe like take a five minute break.
Yeah, since the schedule is a bit great on 10 minutes break. It's, it's, and then we have the videos showing.
And Stefan and then kind of close the session and start and then we keep.
Okay.
Right. So now people take real fresh air.
But maybe it's good just because we originally we were going to end up five, right?
I think we're going to run over. So it's good maybe just to say, if you have to leave a five, that's fine. No hard feelings.
But maybe who can, who wants to stay? Who can stay on longer?
30 minutes and then for beers.
Yeah, then we have beers anyway.
All right.
What are you saying?
Yeah, we'll have the beers later guys.
So we have to wait very, very long because beers are not holding it.
Matthew will be crazy.
Okay.
Okay.
After the break.
Check in with him. You're going to have to ask him anyway, right?
I was just saying, I could stay a little longer if needed. That's it.
I'm trying to.
I always try to.
Because.
You.
So people wrote, you know, the rights of the way.
This is.
This is scary.
Because I'm trying to fight you at the system.
Yeah.
You were talking about, sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
You know.
But, but.
So I don't have anything as a background.
I keep working in trauma.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But let's say that I don't know the ratings.
It means that they work together with the market on their own.
And also the collection, the source collection is growing and growing.
So it's like a growing library, a living library, the libraries of the middle age,
elements that can be written.
Yeah.
And so I'm just a bit.
This is a very initial stage of the process.
So you come up with this, this is already there.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the first stage was a selection of what I did together with my colleague.
And we both had this part in the idea of fascinating nation states,
what we need to boundaries, to language.
So we had these three tables that I picked our personal collection, our collection of sources,
but that, for example, in this episode of the project, we were in dialogue with the visual arts.
Starting from our own collection of books provided visual collection.
Okay.
Okay.
And now we are starting to work with an economist.
And then we will rewrite sources starting from this layer of collection, it's on there.
Yeah, you see it's going, going, you don't tell me.
And get after full.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, because we started from this three points about work with the north.
We started with this idea of non-identical rule.
We declined it in a relationship with boundary with language and with society.
So we have, we have this tree starting table of matters.
And because we work with the nature of a local city museum with with the exposition about ecosystem.
We tried to bring the perspective of ecosystem in the reflection working on the work also on permanent
and integrating a part of it.
So that now you have like all this reflection about society, borders and language.
And so we thought in a non-identical way with another layer that is out of existence as an ecosystem out and I think about a language that is not
relevant if I, if I look at it as an ecosystem.
Yeah, yeah.
So,
sounds really creative but
whether you have the healthcare participants, so we have a big narrative.
So you come to this one factory where the big narrative that is deconstructive but it's not.
But it's not so scary as now that without setting, without materials, without nothing.
Without the experience they work together.
And you do it for problems or not.
I think we search and we propose it.
For now we propose it in the context of what for school and universities in a small scale and for museum as a one week evolution.
Okay, let's see.
When I participate, what is, why do I participate?
Can I participate as a normal?
You can participate, we have a format, this is for groups of people.
Then we contact or there are some mediating organizer contacts, full contact organization working with groups of people.
Okay, we have good contacts with universities where people come from university but we try to have very very mixed up groups.
So not just having students from universities.
But we have the form of visit of the factory.
So you receive a form of movement.
With some activities that I would like to move this guide coming in with the process where you're reading.
So you can.
But this proposed activity with the same.
You come in a more active way of listening.
And we have to interact with each other.
So we come across in this form of community.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it's like it was a great course.
Come back.
I would rather see what's up.
I was trying to get some texts, but I think I let me see if they are in my email or in your work in my WhatsApp.
It was actually close. Maybe. So this is Olaf.
So this is one link.
YouTube.
So it's
And now it's different.
This is okay.
Wow.
And you see another life.
Yeah, or, you know,
I just want to step on because I don't know from which email she made.
So then she sent it to me via WhatsApp, which means I will send it to you via WhatsApp.
That sound is so nice.
You get that typing.
It's so funny.
Every time I say he's writing to me, this will get me every time.
It gets me every single time.
It's a good way.
Okay, so you will get the two videos when you project them and then you will talk.
I want to share at the end of it. I want to share a little text that I wrote, but it's very short.
It depends on how many questions raised from your but but I will close with that is just to close.
Okay.
So in the meantime, you can load Olaf.
So we will in order to make in order to make attribute to digitality and to the digital world and to the possibilities to communicate.
Thanks to technology.
Asynchronically in time and in space, we will have two presentations short presentations now by dear colleagues from Japan and the Netherlands respectively.
They will give their own spin and share a bit about the research. So of course, if you have any questions to them, you can share them with me and I will pass them on.
So the first is Olaf.
And then we got seven.
So, okay, now we're going to work.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Okay, sorry. I'm not muted now. Okay, so I'm introducing a few different concepts relating
to today's different conversations and sort of just throwing out some tangential connections
and relating to what we're talking about. So the first concept is about play and game.
And so, and it's notion of a finite play and infinite play or I think infinite play is
sort of finite games and infinite games. Infinite games are somewhat like play.
So play, as I think about it, is much more like what, say, what children do, you know, it's this
process of exploration, shared exploration with your environment. And in a sense, the goal of an
infinite game or play is to keep the game going, right, like to keep playing as long as possible.
So to keep all the, to keep the other children with you, to keep the game evolving,
to keep play evolving, whereas a game, a game is interesting because it's like, in some sense,
emerges from play initially, but it also becomes very like rule bound. So a play,
it's somehow, I think it's in some, these are like intuitive relationships, but somehow a game
becomes much more like what we were describing earlier as symbolic rule bound, whereas a play
remains, play remains heavy and much more self-organizing. I also find that somehow
game is something which is maybe, I'm not sure, I'm just throwing these like that,
but I think maybe game, so a game, for example, is like chess, for example, right,
whereas a play would be more like playing in the fields and seeing what happens. So I feel like,
in a sense, this is more like this for this great interesting person,
in the sense that you know what the outcome is supposed to be, right, like the chess
there's an outcome, you're trying to get to that outcome, like with the, with the example you gave
with like a sculptor who is, he sort of can picture the sculpture that he's trying to sculpt.
So this is backwards, right? So with chess, for example, you know what the goal
is you're trying to get to, and then you sort of come back from there, whereas this is forwards,
in the sense that you are where you are, you're playing what you're playing, but you're not playing
towards God, you're not playing to end play, you're playing to keep play going, and in that sense,
you're playing to kind of stay in the, in the present. So this is, this is like towards having
an ending, and this is in the sense to keep exploring,
keeping playing.
Yeah, so one of the,
so that's one, one set of associations.
One of the, right from like a really practical point of view,
when I start thinking about how we might make art and art science in relation to AI,
I think somehow, I mean, it's, it's, on the one hand, it's, it's, it's very interesting, on the one
hand, I think it's quite difficult, and I think it's good to already start thinking about what
some of those difficulties can be in relation to making art with AI, or art science with AI.
Of course, in one sense, it's like AI is kind of everyone's talking about it, everyone's thinking
about it, and in some senses, ubiquitous, it's everywhere, but that precisely because it's
everywhere, it's quite hard to make art about, like it's so fast moving, it changes so much, like,
you know, like for example, we make these images here with the Dalai and so on, like already these,
these kinds of images feel kind of somewhat out of date, no? So there's this side, there's all
these pitfalls of, we're dealing with these kinds of things, like how do we deal with all the cliches
of AI, you know, like we also see on the, on the poster.
Ah, okay, so we made this, yeah, we made this poster,
actually Thomas made,
Thomas initially made this image here,
um, with, from an image for arts, fish, and intuition in a creation and mixing work,
and of course, hyper realism, as a, as a way to like illustrate today's, today's workshop,
and, and said like we make some posters with this image, and I felt like it was
interesting to ask different people to try to devise an image for the, for today's workshop,
partly as a way to kind of illustrate like the different things that, that AI images can do,
but also to kind of illustrate in some sense the way that we each think about AI,
so the kinds of prompts that we would put in, no, like how do we think about this workshop
already, it's somehow like expressed in the time it is from, and yeah, there's, you see somehow that
there's, it's both these, it's mirrorless now, in some sense, because there's, there's both these
different, we all have different ideas about what the aesthetics are of AI, and not a bad thing,
but there's also what these kinds of, uh, the stages of what AI can be, which I think
artistically is quite difficult to, to figure out, know what to do with, but I think one of the,
one of the, also the problems with the difficult things about AI, working, what art about AI,
potentially, which comes a little bit back to games, is this, is this kind of this idea of a
glass bead game, right, meaning it's this like incredibly intricate thing, this is incredibly
complex and intricate, uh, thing AI, like it's, um, it's super fascinating, and we can get really
sucked into it, but one of the difficulties of making, I, I, I wanted the interest, of course,
the interesting difficulties about it, is that artistically, you, you have to one, it's one of
those things where it might just be more interesting to do it than to show it, right, like, it's,
it's really interesting to play with AI, but then is it interesting to, when does it, when is it
interesting to show the results of that playing with AI, and when is it just more interesting to
let other people play with AI, like there's a problem, there's a problem with representation
in terms of like artistic representation in terms of AI, and how are you, and how you get over that
thing. So, and I think, yeah, these are, so, and I think one of the things is to
figure out how to, you know, how to open it up to other people,
how to collaborate with AI, or how to extend our, a bit like Olaf was saying, also like to
extend our minds with AI, to become these kind of extended minds with AI, or to become these
extended minds with each other, you know. So, with that, I thought today, I thought of a,
a text, which, a short text, which I've written
sometime before, which suddenly became interesting to reread in the, in the context of AI.
The text is called, All Thinking is Thinking Together. I think I wrote this text a couple
of years ago. A reflection on networks and thinking. Okay, no reading. All Thinking takes place in
complex adaptive systems, which, as we know, are composed of parts
which interact, therefore forming relationships between the parts. In other words,
All Thinking takes place in adaptive networks. The kind of thinking that takes place depends
on the form of the network in which it takes place. The kind of thinking we are most familiar with
is the human brain. Whether we're thinking about science or art or anything else, we know that
the network of the brain must be involved in that thinking. Subjectively, we have a mind,
and we can suppose that mind is an emergent phenomenon of certain kinds of network.
We also know that thinking is subjectively different in different situations. For example,
we know that thinking while sitting is different from thinking whilst walking in the mountains.
Our bodies are also a part of the network of our thinking, and how we use our body
changes the thinking that emerges from that network. So when we speak of thinking, we must
also acknowledge the feeling, sensing, and intuitive. So our thinking is embodied. Varela puts it
like this. By using the term embodied, we mean to highlight two points. First, that cognition
depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensory motor
capacities. And second, that these individual sensory motory capacities are themselves embedded
in a more encompassing biological, psychological, and cultural context. End quote. Thinking sitting
down is therefore different to thinking sitting down with a pen in one's hand. And functionally,
we can write and later reread a note on a piece of paper. A thinking network or mind is extendable.
An extension changes how we think and what we think. The network can also be extended by
communicating with another person, two people, or an AI. And it's different according to who
those other people are. A group of people will form an extended thinking network,
inputting, outputting, and circulating ideas to, from, and in between one another.
Ideas are not solely the product of one mind that can be reshaped, constructed, and evolve
memetically through the interaction of many minds. Plus books, notebooks, papers, videos,
artworks, computers, and so on. Objects cannot serve us individually, but serve to share
transmission in a wider environment. Not only do physical materials act as extended memory,
their representations also become enfolded into our internal networks in significant ways.
Lakoff and Johnson famously write that physical objects, actions, and situations, such as
container spaces, trajectories, serve as mappings to think through more complex domains. Lakoff argues
that all cognition is based on the knowledge that comes from the body and that other domains are
mapped onto our embodied knowledge. They argue our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we
both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature. Metaphor constrains and permits what
we can think, as it is a fundamental means by which we can think about one domain in terms of another.
As well as extended memory and mappings for internal metaphor, physical materials can have
another role in extending thinking. For example, clay plus moisture plus gravity will react to
the imposter's ideas and imagination of the hands. It will easily retain some of the ideas
of the child and yet resist others. If some information is left out, this means that some
information is left in. This entails a form of selection, in other words, processing. Other
any material or medium can thus participate in a thinking network in different ways.
All thinking happens in networks. According to Bason, the complementary conjecture is that
wherever and whenever networks exist of sufficient complexity with feedback and
adaption, then self-organization will take place which is akin to thinking, if not actual thinking
by some broader definition of thinking. And that complexity, says Bason, occurs in a great
many places besides the inside of my head and yours. These minimal characteristics are generated
wherever and whenever the appropriate circuit structure or causal loop exists. Mind is a
necessary and inevitable function of the appropriate complexity wherever that complexity occurs.
A redwood forest or a coral reef with its aggregate organisms interlocking in their
relationships has a necessary general structure. A human society is like this with closed loops
of causation. In a sense, both art and science variations of this principle, artists and scientists
are subjects who both contain an external complex adaptive network and who participate
in wider networks from environments. Processing happens through the whole wider network. Both
artists and scientists enter into thinking networks, extended, coupled, embodied and inactive
with the things they are studying together with others. Within these networks, feedback and
iteration happen and patterns emerge and these patterns become source domains for metaphorical
thinking. System one, as Francis will mention this morning, i.e. to understand the given phenomenon
in terms of a newly formed pattern and logical thinking. System two, does the hard work of
checking these intuitions and following through their logical consequences. The difference in
thinking styles of art and science reflects the different networks that artists and scientists
consciously or unconsciously have set up through which to think or to let thinking happen.
Einstein and Escher made the jumps of logic which seem to be inexplicable
based on the knowledge that was available to them at the time. Escher's work actually
prefigured and influenced Francis in mathematics even though he himself did not
feel he understood mathematics. However, I feel that the intuition of Einstein or Escher is not
a mysterious element but more like an emergent property of a particular network of thought
that they cultivated and developed around and within themselves. Einstein's network incorporated
conceptual metaphors, the physical space and travel connected to physical bodily sensations
through which he could use the metaphor of movement to infer possible relationships in his
mind in order to think about space time and relativity in ways he could not do using mathematics
alone. Escher set up feedback loops between his observations of natural patterns and
tessellations of Moorish architecture with his internal mind and his notebooks. The drawings
and observations updated his thinking just as his thinking mediated by his hands and eyes
updated the drawings and observations. The new ideas I would like to think were an emergent
phenomenon of a whole system. Looking at Escher's images it would be surprising if he hadn't thought
about the nature of feedback. The geometrical pattern serves as metaphors to think about
patterns in drawing and real space such as staircases and about complex geometries.
This
bomb sites the etymology of dialogue is coming through the flow of meaning between and among
us all. I see a direct correspondence between this and Gordon Pask's definition of cybernetics as
the study of information flows in all media together with Heinz von Forrester's suggested
etymology as a computer as from the Latin computare meaning thinking together. Originally
computers were rooms of people doing mathematics thinking together. Thinking is always distributed
always collaborative always participatory and always transdisciplinary. Thinking takes place in
nested complex networks or networks within networks and the kind of thinking that takes
place depends on the network actors or agents involved in that thinking network. Thinking
is always thinking together with one's body with other people with other components
computers with other material. So I just want to
relate to close
with just this yes putting this idea out like how do we how do we turn this research into AI
into a not a glass bead game but a collective process of thinking and thought and
and an open an open game and here to illustrate
what kinds of what kinds of novel thinking systems can we form by becoming ourselves these kind of
algorithms or playing these open games together or even how do we how do we find this best
what are the really interesting forms of collaboration between us and the AI
like we join as we join forces with them form a single thinking network within
okay sure I just wanted to one last thing just to
Katarina earlier was talking about the negative poetry
um and so I just wanted to show you with an earlier iteration that we made of
negative poetry as a as a human algorithm where we became uh we become a a collective
thinking system together I will fast forward it to around the moment
okay

Invert Words, Live
Invert Words, Wehl's

Invert Words,founded
Invert Words, OpFo,
Our flavored
invert words
invert words
There's a kind of algorithm involved in how we collectively make decisions about what
we're going to, which words we're going to target, and this is this collective moment
of choosing which rule we're going to do, and then there's another process where you
take on the rules that other people have proposed, so you either propose a new rule or you answer
the previous rule, answer the previous rule.
You might do release, number, a calling, someone, trade, a withcoming, someone, a cave.
Well I'll put the links to this and some other algorithmic pieces which involve kind of collective
thinking together, also in the links that we sent.
What are you doing there together?
Is this prompting?
We're prompting each other.
I mean this is, when I was thinking about this today, I thought it's sort of interesting,
a kind of a short form, a short hand way to relate these kind of work to the, you know,
it's this kind of artificial, artificial intelligence.
So in these works we're kind of becoming a computer together.
Yeah, but what are you doing exactly there?
You're not prompting an AI.
No.
So when someone says negate, no negation, what's happening then?
So it's a linear system, so we go one after the other, we go in a circle.
There's basically two, there's basically one rule against two rules, trying to think clearly
how, remember quickly how it works.
Either you have, so you have like rules like you can select a line or a word or a whole poem
and you can ask that thing to be inverted, right?
So you could say, for example, line two, word three, invert.
That would be like a valid instruction in this game.
And who's doing this?
The next person alone then does that.
But the next person on your turn, you have the choice to either carry out the current instruction
or to change the instruction.
And if you change the instruction, that's your turnover and then passes to the next person.
And they then have the choice to carry out the instruction or change the instruction.
So collectively it's like you're trying to figure out what's the best next instruction
and you're also, and if you stick with an instruction, you're trying to figure out the
best way to answer that.
So yeah, you have the piece of text and you have operations.
Yeah, so what's missing from this is the fact that we're all looking at the same poem.
Yeah, that's clearly what's missing from this screen.
This piece, no, with this piece, why not?
Because I'm, I think you probably did straightforward answers because I'm not a scientist.
Really, for me, it's not like you don't want to come to a really interesting conclusion
because you don't want to think you don't want to be, you don't want to play,
because you don't want to try to do this, you know, but you don't want to enjoy this
So I think my question is like,
we did, I don't have it here.
No, I mean, I can find it.
We have another, there was another system, very simple game that we devised called
the wonder machine, which is a super simple algorithm.
It's just every, again, everyone talks in a circle, but this time you just,
you start every sentence with the word I wonder.
That's it.
You just say whatever you're thinking about, what you have any sense for or about,
and what starts to happen is that the wonderings start to interact and people
start to start wondering about each other's wondering.
And you think you do actually get a certain kind of collective intuition coming out of it because,
and so we got interested in that, actually, like how certain ideas start to emerge in the group
and people start to make, yeah, this process of priming starts to happen and people start
to make the connections and associations between other people to wondering when you
start doing it for a large amount of time.
And there we did, we were working with these, this Rensker, this is that, so this was the,
should I say, like the interactions group.
So when I was a fellow at Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Studies, when corona happened,
we just kind of, we started the group and went online and basically just made these like
collective thinking experiments every week.
And so this, so these guys, Rensker, she's an evolutionary biologist, Cassandra's
evolutionary biologist, and they would, they said exactly what you said, and they were like,
we're going to do the data on the wonder machine.
And so they, they started making graphs about ideas and how ideas emerge through time, stuff like that.
Yes, certainly, but not right now.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we met.
Yes, and we were, and we had this collective online collective for a couple of years.
So we are kind of, I guess, maybe coming forward in the end, I wonder if anybody has
a question to share a little bit of something, like maybe
Olivier, you wanted to talk like five minutes about your, your image.
Yeah.
Maybe people online as well.
Yeah, I'm trying to find it. Yeah.
Maybe he'll be directed.
This one?
Yes.
This one.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
I think the image I would be, I mean, I asked to send some images with this,
but images I got from Stable DPP, we have the AI system, which I like to use.
And it's a very simple, it's just, it's just, we like,
portraits or music.
And in fact, I, I put it in an exhibition of AI art in France.
So, I have been working on time for a 50 million sector in France, and I know that
sometimes the main artwork in the museum is the museum, the art director itself.
So, I try to get fun to make an artwork with the museum and the director.
But what is the relation between the subject of our
cinema today is the question I send it off of proper times.
This, these images are made by the AI, and that showed that the AI has somehow
the prototype of a museum director in this, at this model.
And, yeah, this is another image, it's a real museum director.
This is a new museum director of Venice, Vietnam.
I, I stumbled upon this image after doing that, and you can put this image in this series,
it's exactly the same way, but AI has written a prototype of a museum director
in this model, just like Vietnam, kind of model of a museum director or a politician or a serial
killer or, I don't know, a Russian, a Russian must fight.
In fact, I made many series of people, portraits of different categories of people.
And the question of the prototype is very deep, I think, it's related to
a kind of man, the Linda problem in a natural, so the idea is to,
to think about this woman, Linda, who studied philosophy, was very bright, and always concerned
with social justice, going to, going to violence, protest, squad, all that, she was into this thing.
Then time passed, and now she is 13 years old, and then you get a series of questions about
what would you expect to be reasonable work like before me, and they said, yes?
Yeah, this is the first question. So the first question is that she works at the bank.
She's a bank teller, so this is, I would say bank teller, so she works at the bank.
So the second question is, she's feminist.
Feminist. So among these, these two questions, normally, that I would just give the,
and there is a third question that says she works as a feminist,
and works as a bank teller. So the thing I will not judge you, you can think in your own brain,
now in your own mind, what of these three is the first most likely, the second most likely,
and the third most likely. So what people normally do is they say, this is first, this is second,
and this is third, most likely. They tested it with probabilities, with sorting, with millions of
when, with other sort of situations, but the thing is that if you look from, from, from a
rational set theoretical perspective, you got bank teller here. She's the set of cases in which
she's a bank teller, maybe smaller, we will say, or maybe something like not so significant.
She's feminist, according to the description, it's very big. So it could be something like this,
and then she's a bank teller, and it is a bank teller and feminist, it lies in the intersection,
because it demands the two things at the same time to be both. So why the probability of the
intersection between some kind of something else will be larger than the probability of, of the
thing itself? Why it would be, why it would be larger? It's impossible, according to this view,
which represents the way in which we rationally think of events and probabilities, because this
way of thinking is what it plays, thermodynamics, the modes of planets and this and that. But then
when you take to psychology, then people tend to attribute joint categories a higher likelihood
than specific or singular atomic categories. Yeah, and why? Because this is a prototype,
a category that we have in mind. Something that is more complex in terms of probability,
simpler in our mind. We can imagine that kind of people more like when we don't exist.
And yeah, these people are categories, are two shades. We can imagine this, and I see
what is resonating with that. I copy these categories and make a solving of images.
And yeah, speaking about kind of manly that problem, I have also checked it between
when I did that problem exactly as you mentioned, and then I answered this question.
As a human, exactly, as a human. So it's changing, you can copy, copy, I don't know, everything.
Yeah, yes. And if you have a strategy, please answer as a professor of mathematics,
then slowly, slowly, you understand the ways, but slowly, slowly, yeah, you have to guide
you. Yeah.
Yeah, when you, when you go wrong, you're going wrong with the formula.
So yeah, that relates a lot to
