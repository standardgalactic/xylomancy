Checking 1littlecoder/Deploy Stable Diffusion as Service - Build your own Stable Diffusion API.txt
1. The presenter is demonstrating how to use an API endpoint for text-to-image generation, specifically from the Stable Diffusion model, which can be accessed via a POST request.
2. They have executed the API call using Google Colab and are showing the response, which initially appears as a base64 encoded string.
3. The presenter decodes the base64 string to reveal an image generated by the Stable Diffusion modelâ€”in this case, a picture of Kung Fu Panda seemingly slurping with chopsticks.
4. The presenter emphasizes that this API can be used in various applications and not just on Google Colab; they demonstrate this by using a website called Hopscotch to make a new API call with a different prompt.
5. After sending the new request, the presenter waits for the image to generate, which takes around 30 to 40 seconds depending on the parameters set.
6. The result of the second API call is a beautiful portrait of a young Chinese girl, as per the prompt provided, showcasing the capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model.
7. The presenter has made clear that the code used in Google Colab for making the API call will be linked in the YouTube description for further reference.
8. The presenter thanks Abhishek Thakur for developing the diffusers repository and invites any questions from the viewers in the comment section.
9. The presentation concludes with an invitation to check out the Google Colab notebook for deploying Stable Diffusion as a service, offering an example of how one can integrate such AI capabilities into their own applications.
