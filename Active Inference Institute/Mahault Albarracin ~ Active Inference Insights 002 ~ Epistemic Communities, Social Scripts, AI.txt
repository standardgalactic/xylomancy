Hello, everybody, and welcome back to the Active Inference Insights podcast, brought
to you by the Active Inference Institute. I'm your host, Darius Parvizi-Wayne, and today
I have the pleasure of chatting to Mao Albarassin. Mao is a cognitive computing PhD candidate
at the University of Quebec in Montreal, as well as the Director of Product Innovations
and Research at Versus, a company which leads the way in applying the Active Inference Framework
to AI. With expertise in computational neuroscience, sexology, consciousness, and much more, Mao's
work is broad, innovative, and deeply exciting, which makes me rather excited for this conversation.
Mao, welcome to the show. Thank you so much for joining us. As I said, it's an absolute
pleasure.
Well, thanks for having me.
So yeah, as I sort of mentioned in the introduction, your work covers a very broad range of topics
and areas of research. But as you know, this podcast is exploring the themes of Active
Inference and the free energy principle. So I want to mainly focus on that, even though
we can see about how these different themes tie in with that overarching framework. If
one goes on your Google scholar and sees your work on Active Inference, again, they'll see
it's diverse. Where I want to start is the paper that you wrote on epistemic communities.
I guess the first question our audience might have, just as a reminder for those listening,
this podcast is very much meant as a gentle introduction to Active Inference, as gentle
as an introduction to Active Inference can be. So just for our audience, my first question
is very simple, and it's just what is an epistemic community?
So it has many definitions. It's a loosely used term in a variety of fields. But the
way we've used it is essentially a community of people that share very specific types of
beliefs that lead them to sample reality in the same way. So if you think about like,
norms, they usually are tied to a specific way of thinking. Like for instance, the fact
of going to work, the fact of going to work nine to five is tied to an ideology that values
a certain type of productivity, consumerism, etc. and a certain type of relationships where
we are together in the morning, together in the evening, and we are with different people
during the day, etc, etc, etc. So your life becomes shaped by these ideas that give rise
to norms.
Cool. And let's sort of tie in the Active Inference framework then to this idea that we have a
community which is tied together through sampling similar norms, similar sensory observations.
Perhaps you could start just by giving us a brief or relative accessible notion of what
Active Inference is. I mean, Karl did a very good job last week at explicating this, just
as a reminder to people. And then how that framework and the truths that the free energy
principle discloses can be applied to the formation of an epistemic community.
Yeah, so Active Inference as a principle is rather simple. It's really just the idea that we
try to minimize how much we are likely to dissolve. We don't want to die. So in order to
do so, we're going to try to map the world and understand what might be coming such that we
can avoid moments where we might be dissolving or moments that are dangerous for us, more
surprising. We try to create evidence of ourself. We try to predict ourself existing in the
future. And to do this, we make a prediction, act in the world, try to change something, see if
it changes the way we thought it was going to change, and then update our model of the world.
So you've got this sensory active loop where the agent is embedded in the world rather than just
outside of its mapping. So it's a pretty crucial idea that the agent necessarily has a
perspective which is defined by how they are separate and yet embedded in the world. They
have a boundary. We generally refer to that as a marked blanket. This boundary is both defining
and defined by the outside world and the agent themselves. So if you understand that the agent
necessarily has to map the world in order to predict what's likely to happen, but that the
agent is only capable of dealing with their perspective and how much they can compute from
their perspective, you understand the agent is fundamentally limited. It has to to maximize
how much information it has about the world to communicate with potentially other agents,
which will also be gathering information about the world, not just from each other, but from
their own experience within the world. Now what we posited when we were doing our research is that
it would be more costly to just flat out change your entire model of the world if you are wrong,
then try to seek out agents who might validate your view of the world and therefore
also share the same model. This is where we bring in the notion of niche construction.
When agents exist in the world, as I said, they evidence their own existence. To do so,
they shape the world. So anytime I walk on the grass, I make a little dent and I create a little
path. And so if other agents like me, same agents with the same model are going to take the same
path, eventually that path is going to be pretty obvious. It's going to pull other agents to that
path. So I and other agents like me are shaping the environment to resemble us. So we therefore
thought that confirmation bias here was a way for agents to avoid having to constantly change their
model and we're more likely to be with people like them, create a world that resembles them,
eventually create something that resembles an echo chamber, at least on the belief on the belief
path. What we also posit is the outcome of that is you're not just sharing beliefs,
you're creating the world around you, such that eventually some communities will in fact
create some degree of the beliefs they are sharing in the world around them, which is no longer
at all the same world as some other community, which may be sharing together another model.
And it becomes practically incommunicable. Not only are they not sharing the same model,
they're not sharing the same world. They're not sampling it the same way. And so communicating
here is essentially impossible. Amazing. That's super interesting. And I think definitely maps
onto people's experiences in if they've ever found themselves down the rabbit hole of an echo
chamber, whether that's on Twitter or Instagram or whatever. I guess a question that comes to my
mind here is that maybe a heuristic idea would be that truth exists as some kind of prior within
a generative model that an agent like us has. It's important that we tie ourselves in some way to
veracity. Because if not, then we're going to be constantly surprised every time something
false happens. Or that false true distinction is a bit blurry, but you see where I'm going.
So a lot of echo chambers are reinforcing their model of the world, but it doesn't
necessarily need to subscribe to any notion of external truth. To what degree does that ever
butt up against a kind of inherent prior, which is that eventually the falsity of your claims is
going to come home. Or can the echo chamber, the entrenchment just keep going, keep digging
as far down as possible? Yeah. So this is a super interesting idea. And we first have to define
what we mean by truth and what level of truth. What do we mean by truth? Do we mean something that
I can observe? Do we mean something that is verifiable by other agents? And then what level
of truth do we mean? The truth of the event, the social truth of the meaning of the event,
the fact that to some extent, no matter what happens, this element will be considered true.
Do you see what I mean? Like, there's so many ways in which this can break down. And what this
leads us to is, so this is a theory. This is something I'm trying to develop. Obviously, it's not
verified yet. So it's still something to take with a few grain of salt. But it's a theory that I think
naturally falls from what we've done. Depending on the level of truth you're talking about and your
definition of truth. The fact that something, say, happened or not can be irrelevant.
What matters about truth is whether it's actionable to some extent. So let's take an example. If I
decide I can fly, but I never act on it, it has no impact on my life. My sensory active loop
isn't going to change. My model is not going to change. So I can carry this belief
without ever having any consequence at that level. I'm not going to die. But now I can tell other
people that I can fly. And if none of us act on it, but we all squarely believe we can fly. And
it serves a social purpose of identifying each other. We know who we are. And then we congregate
to each other. We create a reality together. We create purposes. What happens then? Where does
the buck fall? Where does that belief become a belief that potentially harms us? I think that's
a true question. So think of things that are more contentious, like does God exist? Technically,
there is no way to prove it. Literally. Part of the definition is that
believing God has to be faith-based, or at least for Christian,
Judeo-Christian beliefs. It has to be faith-based, which means by definition,
you shouldn't need evidence. You should believe without evidence. You should take a leap of faith.
Okay. Then by virtue of that, we can't verify it. We can't change it. Your belief is kind of
impervious. So then what are the outcomes of that belief? How does it allow a community to survive?
How does it allow people to survive? And there's a really interesting phenomenon that happens there.
Some people will start manufacturing evidence of God. They will start thinking, okay, well, yes,
it's true. I don't need evidence. But I can read certain kinds of things as evidence. And they will
select the kinds of things that count as evidence, i.e. things that they can't ascribe a clear cause
to. So for instance, they won't ask God to feed their dog. Because if they did, and the dog doesn't
get fed, the dog dies. And now they're like, well, God didn't do it. There's a clear proof here.
It didn't happen. But something more nebulous, like in the future, I will get a job. I mean,
it's highly likely you're gonna, but can you really ascribe the cause of that? You might have
sent some resumes, but there's no guarantee anyone will pick up your resume. It's practically luck
at this point. So if it's luck, it's God. Because luck is not something we can ascribe a clear cause
to. So then you get these communities that are functional because that belief never really
comes into play in their actions. And so you can have weird types of layered beliefs
for certain people, like you could have a flatter third be your manager, it probably won't change
much. It's not compatible with your beliefs. But in terms of the layer that you share,
the functional layer that you share, it doesn't come into play. But if I believe I can fly and
therefore you can fly and I tell you what, go do it now, fly, jump off the building.
Now we're going to have a problem. And therefore that kind of belief is less likely to be carried
because functionally, it's likely to disappear. So for in terms of self organization, it just is
likely to disappear. Right. Yeah, that's interesting. I guess it's absolutely right to unpick these
different layers. And the fact that I guess one way of looking at it is that truth can have this
kind of instrumentalist or pragmatic aspect to it, but also this something that, you know,
philosophers of language would think about a little bit more in terms of conditional statements
and whether something's actually true in the world. I wonder whether therefore if we look at
the active inference framework and we try apply active inference to this a question that comes
up in my head is does for an agent to consider their beliefs to genuinely be true? Because I
think what we can say here is if I had the belief that I could fly, perhaps I occupy that truth at
an instrumentalist level because I'm surrounded by other people who believe that they can fly and
it actually gives me a sense of purpose. And so I almost delude myself into thinking that, but
really a push came to shove and someone had me at the top of a cliff edge, I probably wouldn't
do it because I don't think there's actually a state of the world out there which says Darius can
fly. Does the all of that say that does does the active inference framework require for an agent
to believe that there is genuinely solid epistemic grounds to believe that something is ontologically
the case so that I can actually fly that if I took off that I would need to be able to sample or have
sampled evidence for that or is there a mechanism that might be peripheral to that which could give
me the trust in a sufficient trust in my model that I maybe I would jump off the cliff?
So I think we have to look at how life is realized and how you plan yourself in the future.
Right? So let's assume you really think you can fly and your life just doesn't lend itself to it.
Like that's how you do. You take the car, you hang around, you have coffee, you work, whatever.
It's just it just never comes into play. You could hold that belief with high certainty because
it never gets tested and there's never a risk. Now if you were to start having a real risk like
that it actually like that state is not highly unlikely it's like it's over here and you now
have to start testing your own predictions of yourself into the world and you're going to start
seeing spikes of free energy like this like you've never seen anyone fly you sure you can but you've
never seen anyone fly and the risk associated with not flying is really really really high.
I think that's when you start seeing the armor break like I think the difference becomes between
someone who has lost touch with actual reality like they genuinely believe they can fly and it
becomes an actual thing they need to do now they probably will do it but they will also probably
die which means that these kinds of beliefs which we generally consider to be psychotic right like
it's it's that's the definition it's a loss of touch with reality no matter what that means
and so when we start couching these ideas in this way we start deep pathologizing a little bit
we're like well it's not they're not they're not sick per se there's nothing intrinsically wrong with
them but their beliefs are no longer aligned with the ecosystem within which we exist if they were
on say the moon for a minute maybe you know they could fly like it wouldn't be an impossible belief
it's just not a belief here that there works um so I think that's why most of the people who hold
beliefs that are not uh related to what we would consider something that happened like it's not
verifiable it's not uh it's not something that we can assure ensure it happened or can happen
generally these beliefs don't relate to things that are possibly um harmful to them like for
instance believing in Trump believe in what what Trump says it's easy to debunk what he says
like a lot of people have done it in fact it's actually it takes more time to debunk everything
he says than just to listen to him but it has no impact on your life if you do believe him
like pragmatically it won't hurt you so it's it's it's um it's a very useful tool to lie about
things that are completely unverifiable to you therefore why not believe them yeah I think um
I think what you spoke about in terms of de-prophologizing is very interesting when um I'll speak to
Carl for those who are listening they might recall we've sort of spoke about the fact that
the complete classroom states that actually any behavior can be cast as um they's optimal
under some prior beliefs so I think that's a nice it leads itself it lends itself to a
humane approach to psychopathology or confirmation bias less um you know more mundane instances of
circular reasoning or or convincing yourself that something is true when it's clearly not
going back to your paper I thought an interesting thing was so so for those who don't know Mao
and Maxwell and others sort of created a computational model in addition to the to the
theorizing right so there is the theory and then you would put it in silico and you um
you endowed your silico agents with an a priori hypothesis that or or preference that they would
be more likely to sample um agents who are similar to them which is in in a sense the kind of prior
preference which underwrites um confirmation bias my question here is in that are you stipulating
that we too have those prior preferences because on one hand yes I mean that manifests in the
behavior and it makes sense in terms of confirming your own model at the same time humans can also
be incredibly flexible creatures who do change their model on the basis of evidence so firstly
is the claim that that is an actual um feature of human cognition and our generative model
and two um if so would you couch that in terms of natural selection and evolutionary pressures
or is that is it even more uh fundamental to self-organization to um sample information from
those who are more similar to you right so so confirmation bias was a parameter it was something
we tested with and without or on a continuum and we saw what the effects of it were relative to the
formation of echo chamber or to the change in beliefs um and and we saw that it had a magnifying
effect but it wasn't as simple as just you turn it off and it's gone and you turn it on and it's
it's there right there was still the possibility to form communities without the notion of
confirmation bias it just wasn't as strong and it also depended on the network dynamics
different networks for propagate information differently so um we we also had the notion of
habit formation so if you have uh the need to uh to have habits basically you're going to slowly
start sampling the same thing over and over and over again so um there there were a lot of parameters
that we that we used and we found that uh confirmation bias basically uh
biased the agent the agent's likelihood model to acquire more evidence about their environments
if the information confirms their pre-existing beliefs it's it was that simple basically so
basically it just made it so that they would still sample people around them but they were more
likely to re-sample somebody that said something that agreed with their model which is extremely
compatible with active inference right you are trying to self-evidence so you're going to try
to sample things that seem to you know agree with your model um so that the confirmation bias was
just a formalization of that specific parameter um what we see is it's actually adaptive for you
to be with people like you when you are with people like you not only are you likely to
understand people better and therefore share information more efficiently um you're also
likely to be in an environment that is beneficial for you not just because you craft the environment
around you but because if you find yourself with people like you you're probably finding yourself
in an environment that benefits those people so you know it's it's just adaptive now it's adaptive
to an extent if you're only with people with exactly your all your same model then you're also very
likely to to um have the same issues and to be um vulnerable to the same kind of volatility
it's like the it's like monoculture if you have one type of banana if there's one disease banana
they're all going to get it and you no longer have bananas it's it's an idea you want to continuously
grow and change and and gather more error and increase your fitness landscape such that you never
get to a point where there's an error that none of you saw coming and it just wipes everything out
like a black swan event um so there's like a nice middle ground it is it's like a super stimulus
if you find yourself in an echo chamber it feels really really good for a time but there's a part
of your model the part that wants exploration that eventually understands that you're stagnating
and something needs to change something needs to happen so it's not because we try to confirm
or a model that we also just want the make the model to be stationary we want to minimize free
energy and we want to know that we are minimizing free energy right it's layered and metacognitive
so in that sense you want to see yourself going down so if you're in a plateau you're no longer
going down right um so that's why I think to some extent even when you have a group that seems to
agree that seems to have the same idea it'll eventually start disagreeing inside like there will be
people that'll push that'll keep polarizing such that now there is um a little bit of a difference
like you're you're still some people like well no okay that's that's too far I I don't think
all of the world is flat maybe you know a little bit but not all of it or I don't think the entire
universe is just the planet that's silly do you see what I mean like it's the same belief it's the same
kind of um moving away from the trajectory that the others are going but you can't always constantly
absolutely agree or you cease to learn information so you'll start again simply a little bit outside
it's just that if you're stuck in an echo chamber and the echo chamber has you know drifted drifted
drifted drifted drifted so far away from anybody you could ever talk to such that there is no
reconciliation point here you're you're just going to have like a straight up no there's nothing to
hold on to for you to be like well maybe my model is a little similar but not quite the same so I
could you know adapt a little bit you're there's this this this ridge is too far it's too it's too
far gone so it is adaptive for you to be with people like you but if it's too like you then
you're stagnating and eventually you're likely to potentially disappear amazing yeah loads of things
come to mind from that answer as you said again for those listening as you said just
important to point out as you said to reduce free energy over time so called expected free energy
in the actual mathematical formula there is this balance of epistemic and pragmatic
actions so we can't we do have to explore the world and we do have to sample in conditions of
uncertainty so if people are curious this this sort of evades the so-called dark room problem
which was a kind of an initial contention to the free energy principle which people can read
about in this over 10 years old now these arguments I guess listening to this something that comes
to my mind is and then well something that comes to my mind and maybe those listening is why does
one end up in these states anyway so maybe I'm listening to this and I might I'm not but I might
have been in some hypothetical world of flat earth and I might start panicking saying well what does
that actually say about me fundamentally that I was amenable to those claims whatsoever is there
in some computational formulation or just some conceptual formulation an idea about why some
people tend more than others to be wrapped up in conspiracy theory or groupthink this monolithic
way of cognizing rather than cognitive flexibility and again I don't mean to put these two on sort
of binary polarities as if one is amazing and one's terrible as you say we do spend time on
people we agree with all of us as we should or else we'd have no friends but is there a reason
perhaps why some people end up really going down that rabbit hole and sudden you know and and and
it's it's bizarre for those on the outside as to how they've got to that point right so let's
always remember that anything we're going to say is a conjecture because social systems are extremely
complex and it's a little bit like chaos theory like ascribing one or two causes to a very complex
phenomenon is always wrong we can have a model and it's an approximation but we can't make too
many blanket statements so that's how i'm going to caveat when i'm about to say next the second thing
i'm about to say is another caveat is everyone does groupthink everyone does it like it's just
that some groupthink is considered and that's what i meant by the truth yeah in the end can you
reproduce any of the experiments that come out from the scientific field can you
like reproduce a proof can you run it yourself do you understand everything that comes out
the truth is no you have to rely on others for an epistemic chain like is this a justifiable
belief yes maybe i think you know that person looks really confident and other people seem
confident in them so i'm you know follow that and sometimes what their model allows you to do
is predictions about the world and those predictions happen to come true so you through
abductive inference believe it must be true but it doesn't mean that in fact it could be completely
unrelated maybe this is just like you know something that happens anyway if everybody told you
you've got to jump and the sun will come up so we've jumped and the sun kept coming up and you're
like all right i'll jump and you're like you're right the sun did come up wow that works so like
it could be completely wrong but you still you know that's your best explanation so far it allowed
you a prediction your prediction worked okay well there you go there's some evidence for that in in
our case it's more along the lines of our beliefs or the right beliefs and our ideology is the right
ideology because it leads to xyz kind of kpi we've arbitrarily defined as the kpis that correspond
to what allows us to minimize free energy but it's it's highly contentious oftentimes the
the kpis we define are the kpis that allow us to stay in the state that we are and so it's heavily
slanted towards people in power right propaganda media etc all of these tools are built to get you
to believe that you are correct and you are doing the right thing and that right thing is to give more
money to rich people so you know let's let's keep that in perspective for the time being um
um why do some people fall down rabbit holes it's a very known thing that there are key um
funnels for certain kinds of ideologies because certain kinds of ideologies have a dynamic
they very quickly allow you to feel better about yourself feel better about yourself or
feel more in control of the world like you now have an answer you you can now understand what's
going on your model feels like it reduced free energy pretty quickly um that's one of the reasons
conservatism is often very popular or at least populist conservatism it tends to rely on very
easy very simple answers to very complex problems why is your life crap immigrants obviously it's
immigrants it's not the vast complex industrial series of institutions that keep you in a position
where everything around you has been eroded to the point where you have nothing to grab on to
because that would be really complicated it's immigrants so we when we understand that certain
kinds of patterns of stark reduction of free energy exist in specific rhetorical patterns
we then understand okay well who needs these kinds of reductions who are the people that are currently
feeling high uncertainty very vulnerable and need something to hold on to it's probably people
whose model had evidence and sort of no longer does there is nothing in the world around them
that continues to validate their perspective so now they're searching give me anything anything
that will allow me to continue this model of myself which has crafted who i am my phenotype
depends on this model if it no longer exists now i have to accept that i am at the bottom
of the food chain and i don't see a way out because it's complicated so who are the people likely
to be like that well currently it's men who feel like they're in a crisis of uh of masculinity
it's very poor people who feel like they're disenfranchised and nobody's helping them and
the only reason that would be the case is because the elites are sucking the blood of babies
and to do to to fulfill their evil ends the ring more immigrants in because the immigrants are
the reason that you don't have jobs anymore etc etc etc like these conspiracy theories
generally tend to give you erroneous but easy answers the problem is
they're usually very wrong so they have to prop themselves up with these webs of tangled beliefs
which locally are a very easy answer right they're like why uh why do i see this well because you
know that thing and that thing is conceptually related therefore that must be the answer and
so we get into this really interesting space where there's people with incredibly complex webs
of will you be like well that doesn't make any sense if it's more complex why would they hold
on to this well because remember these things are layered they also get a sense of control from this
they're minimizing free energy somewhere at the level of the easy little answer the easy little
thing they got a small chunk of explanation it validates their position in the world and they
now feel like they have control over things they understand the world it's actionable so all of
these reasons give you a very clear profile for the kind of person who is likely to fall
with that pattern of beliefs fascinating okay good that's a yeah that's that's really useful
and yeah perhaps good to remind people that in terms of the actual
formula for the free energy principle as you know it's can be cast as accuracy minus complexity
of your model so always seeking the so-called most accurate accurate model in the sense that
fulfills our preferences without added layers of complexity about greater degrees of freedom
and maybe to flesh out what you were saying you're right people have these incredibly complex models
of how the world works and it's a paedophile ring and that's somehow linked to 9-11 and
but they kind of internally cohere in some strange and our narrative way they're not complex in the
sense that they involve contradictions because if they did that would be the build-up prediction
error so it's like you have this stacked generative model but because everything kind of contextualizes
and constrains everything at the lower level there's actually minimal prediction errors reduced
it's just that if you actually spit that out to an external world it just it turns out to be
bullshit and I think that kind of explains why some of these people have massive existential
crises at some point if they're just like oh shit that whole thing was really really wrong
because the whole edifice comes crumbling down and you get this enormous spike of prediction error
every layer and there's something interesting too like even when they encounter a contradiction
they have the power to resolve it right they can just make up another thing they'll just
look at the patterns and be like this is sort of like that that's the explanation and that's
powerful right you have direct power to minimize free energy right there and then right it's super
powerful and attractive so I can imagine what's happening here in the way you've just described
it is you have this sensory signal which signals that are your belief was wrong but because my
priors are so sticky because they're granted so much precision I can kind of just ignore
that evidence against them and it's not like I'm actively doing that that's just part and
part of the way that I'm constituted good well I think well that's it's kind of a bleak picture
but actually I think it impels us to have some epistemic humility which is that all of our
explanations for the world are probably in the service of minimizing complexity while trying
to maintain the modicum of accuracy and we're missing out on some some important details and
that's true for all of us not only the the so-called crazy ones this leads us quite nice yeah go go
please I think it's not just a bleak picture I think it's also hopeful because it gives you a
pathway like how do we allow or help people to potentially get out of that yeah and the way
to do that is through kindness through empathy and through a soft approach out you can't you can't
bash someone on the head to change their beliefs but you can slowly without making fun of them
without telling them that everything they believe is wrong just slowly untangle one thing you know
like be be part of who they are and if you approach this a clinical practice what this means is
instead of telling someone your belief is psychotic this is absolutely not real you should
more like be like okay well tell me what you see bring me into your belief and together
from your perspective let's move out slowly it's it's it's actually something that they
do now in certain approaches to clinical practice with people who go through psychosis
and it does work it does make people feel better it pulls them away from the edge and it's an
epistemic stance that is generally less pathologizing right it comes yeah it comes back to what we're
saying is kind of more humane approach to understanding one another and yeah and just flows
nicely from like it's we're not making this stuff up this is how the maths and the physics
unfolds in inactive inference you would slowly change the precision that you deploy on certain
parts of your model through conversation but as you said it's very rare that you can do that in
a single blow so probably not advisable which actually leads us you know this conversation
regarding social norms the way we group together the way our cognition is distributed right we're
not just siloed off inside our skulls we rely on one another we offload to one another that brings
us very nicely onto a second part of your work which I feel like because of your background
in sexology you've been working on social scripts for a long time and you have a very deep root
interest in it so it's going to be really cool to unpick this with you and yes it is well I'd like
to discuss social scripts and the kind of active inference account of them obviously when people
hear the word script they think of drama the theater films whatever they might not think that
their life is scripted unless they've got some sort of Truman show syndrome what again very
simple question start what is a script and what does it say about our behavior right so there are
many again many definition of scripts this is part of the reason we did these studies is oftentimes
in social sciences the work is beautiful it's deep it's again empathetic but it tends to
not perfectly defined in terms or at least not agree on the definition of the term so many
paradigms exist they use the same term and can't agree on exactly what it means if you try to bring
it together they will adamantly disagree that these terms can be combined because of fundamental
issues in the in the definitions that's something I kind of wanted to curtail through a formalism
and so what we showed is that there were basically two main ways to understand scripts the first way
was through weak scripts weak scripts are the cluster of concepts that generally exist together
and you can sort of draw a mark of blanket around it so that's the reason that prototype theory
essentially shows well can you really define a chair like there's many things that can be a chair
most things that are a chair do not fulfill what we generally consider to be the prototype
of a chair lots of chairs don't have backs or lots of chairs possibly can't be sat on is it
still a chair some would define it as a chair nonetheless like there's there's many ways that
you can define a chair but in general you know there's like a cluster of elements some of which
higher probability and other lower probabilities so think of a restaurant it's the it's the example
everybody gives in a restaurant you generally know there's probably food you're probably gonna sit
not every time but probably probably gonna sit for only food it's probably paid he's not free
here you can just go and get it and in general but not always there's people giving you the food
and making food for you so that's the you know these are concepts that are loosely and more likely
or not associated with the concept of restaurant but now there's the strong scripts so inside that's
cluster of scripts there's a sequence you don't eat right away you're gonna enter the restaurant
probably gonna get seated by someone you you don't always pick your seat sometimes you do sometimes
don't but you know you're gonna sit somewhere and then you're gonna order something you'll look at
something or order something and then you're gonna eat maybe maybe you pay first so you see how
the scripts themselves have some wiggleness to them like some parts of the scripts can come before
or after but there is generally a sense that something comes before another thing and there's
this some of these are higher probabilities so like I have to enter the restaurant before I eat there
and I probably have to eat before I pay these are like generally generally pretty high probability
in between can wiggle a lot like maybe I'm gonna take 30 minutes to order maybe I'm not even gonna
look at a menu maybe I'm gonna be brought food in the dark like seemingly like there's there's
wiggleness and that allows for some scripts to sort of change a little bit this is also why scripts
in general tend to be a little bit porous they don't stay the same thing forever so you have
scripts that are of a very long temporal scale in the way they unfold and there are
scripts that have a very long temporal scale in the way they repeat so for instance a wedding
or marriage that's something that's happened this existed for a while like we've had marriages for a
long time the exact way that marriage is unfolded that you know that's changed over time and it's
still changing and its purpose also is changed to some extent the the people it applied to changed
also but in general you know we consider marriages to be between two people who are gonna pool their
resources together and we assume want to stick around with one another for a while and so in
general we need for a wedding to happen for two people to know each other at least a little bit
you know at least once just a little bit they need to go through the ritual of marriage because
otherwise that doesn't apply and then they probably need to share some of their resources
that repeats over time that's repeated for maybe like I don't exactly know when the first weddings
happen but I know there are marriages in the bible so you know there's some degree to that
but each marriage lasts like 20 years maybe maybe 40 maybe 60 if you're lucky like you know what I
mean like it used to be very short bursts of time now it can be shorter or longer but the
repetition of it happens so that that timescale is very long even though the actual script itself
is very short and then there's very long scripts like um like a war will happen over a long period
of time or like the rise of the rise of an empire generally follows the same kind of elements of
the scripts or the rule of a ruler etc so these can be very very long so that's that's a script
that's a script good um I think um yes the first thing that I can think of when it when we hear
the word script again it's obviously acting to some degree before I get into the question of
kind of authenticity um there's I think when people hear about mechanistic explanations of
behavior they slightly worry that they're being reduced to some automated robot um especially
when we talk about something like habits in active inference so um lots of papers talk lots of papers
sort of borrowed from reinforcement learning um approaches to habits and there's notion of belief
free um habits versus belief based behavior um or value free value based however you want to formalize
it but it kind of comes down to this idea that through repeated practice we arise in a certain
context and act in a certain way and under very sort of stringent conditions like if I touch a
hot pan uh you know my body is reacting in a habitual way I know it might seem extremely
reductive say so but I'm jumping out of the way but I'm automated in that way I do not choose to
and it seems like in principle one could codify a loss of behavior in that way whether it's
opening a door whether it's what to do in the restaurant so how much um flexibility or degrees
of freedom it does the active inference framework or or or scriptology I don't know if that's the
word the ology for scripts um grant the agent in the social construct you said that they they
they're quite porous they change over time but within the actual synchronic moment where the
agent is acting where does their own um agency and power to actually act upon the world come from
well it depends on where you're positioned relative to the script so everything is
perspectival again and let's imagine that you coarse grain the world into things
you're not seeing every pixel right you're seeing clusters and again these clusters are defined
by these weak scripts so how can you recognize something as a door well something is a door
because it has a handle and you can sort of see the shape it's not quite the wall but have you ever
been say uh to japan where it's wood panels would you be able to tell where the door is if there
isn't a handle like you'd have to see someone opening the door and then you'd be like all right
that that's that's a door it opens and I can go through like that's um similarly have you ever
been to one of those very fancy fancy mansions um where everything is glass and there's no specific
handle so you're like oh god I I want to go outside and it's like it's right in front and you don't
know what to do yeah yeah yeah you'll wait for someone to do it so in that sense that's where
scripts are interesting you are going to learn by looking at other people do things instead of you
figuring out a new way to interact with that door you're just going to repeat that it's
computationally efficient to just you know you have a purpose you want to be on the other side
let's just do the same thing but now let's imagine you know there's a door in front of you it's
obviously a door and there's someone coming and you're at this awkward distance where it's like
if you don't open the door for them it's kind of rude yeah they're not quite there yet so what are
you gonna do you don't have the right answer there's no proper way to exist here because it's a little
bit ambiguous what you're supposed to do you're in the middle of two scripts here you could open
the door for yourself and go and risk being a little rude so there's there's a there's a cost
here or you could open the door for yourself and wait for them and there's a cost of maybe it's
awkward because now they feel obliged to run so you're going to weigh the costs of this and you're
going to change by your by your decision by your script by what you're choosing to enact here
you're going to tip the scale a little bit so in general the way the scripts change is in these
uncertain places in these moments of like this hasn't quite been defined there really isn't much
of an answer here that is like the obvious one so I'm going to tip the scales and next time
that depending on the outcome the cost I paid this will act as evidence for the future of you
and that other person you have crafted the world through your choice here so I wrote a paper on
this with Pierre Poirier on on gender essentially explaining in gender seemed to be pretty binary
like this is not a blanket statement obviously it's not binary everywhere not across cultures not
all the time but let's say in North America let's say in the fifties it was pretty binary right it
was pretty clear if you were a woman you were this you're a man you were this it seemed like it
fit within specific roles or let's say let's say the thirties because the fifties is exactly the
time we're starting shifting but let's say in the thirties and then the war happened and what happened
well you didn't have enough men to do what was needed to do so the script that was generally
functionally associated to a role was no longer being able to be fulfilled but we still needed the
function and so then we were like well okay well what's the closest thing to a man well you know
another human a woman woman could do this it's just not in their current role but they can do this
and so it's like all right well the script that generally was associated to women now expanded
a little bit because it expanded the porosity also expanded because the the semantics semantics are
either very strictly constricted or they start smashing into each other because if I connect
one point everything else can now be connected right so if I can work I can wear pants if I can
wear pants I can wear skirts if I can wear skirts I control my body if I control my body I can have
sex you see what I mean like it kind of all flows from these natural normally rigid connections
but you make one connection and therefore well now you can make more connections and there was
no real functional error when women did that right when women wearing pants it might shock you
socially but she's not gonna die you're not gonna die so it's acceptable you just have to find the
right people around who to do it and so with urbanization with the fact that after the war
people gathered in city centers with industrialization etc like with you you had to repopulate
you had to find a job you had to etc etc etc you ended up with people being able to connect with
one another technology also increased and grew we had more access to media more access to each other
and through this mishmash you were capable of fostering certain kinds of porosity such that
well now gender is you know does it mean the same as it once did do we even
free those categories anymore some people don't even think so anymore it whether they're right
or not is irrelevant to them it's now meaningless they they don't need that category to exist in
the world some people still do and they use it but we found that the fluidity of gender has
been made so overt so clear to people that they feel they can act upon that they feel they have
the choice to change the script themselves so i think it starts from there's either a functional
need for a switch to happen or there's so much uncertainty that effectively it can go either
way so it'll really be about you know your decision it's kind it's it's a little bit random maybe your
specific position in the world will make it so that you are going to make that choice but somebody
else coming from a different reception would have made a different choice so the script in itself was
slightly uncertain at that level cool yeah and i guess the conception that comes to my mind is that
one can't think about script evolution in terms of these enormous steps i mean clearly you do have
these occasional historical moments that call for radical shifts in social convention but if you
think about the evolution of a restaurant for example there's been no single event at least
that comes to my mind which means that people have to wait to be um sat in a european restaurant and
maybe they go and sit at this table in america whatever it is but maybe through these kind of
incremental changes require you know necessities pop up in certain niches and are less relevant
in others so you you see this kind of staggered evolution um which brings me kind of a question
i probably should have started with which is in terms of active inference you spoke a
lot about function of um like you know when the function changes so the script will change
well that brings me to just ask a very simple question which is what is the function of a script
for um free energy minimizing creatures like ourselves what what does it allow us to do and
maybe perhaps on the flip side of that how does it constrain us so scripts allow us to
avoid computing everything all the time because you have a script you could make plans much
farther into the future you can know how to act um in a situation even though it might be a little
novel so you stay relatively stable no matter where you go right there's never i mean it's not
true if you have a lot of scripts and you know about a lot of scripts no matter where you go
you're probably going to be fine you're probably going to know how to get what you need who to
talk to when you need something etc etc so because you have these sort of pre-baked policies that have
high certainty that you can recognize because you can understand what triggers that script
you're very adapted to the environment and that also allows us to avoid friction so when i know
what i'm supposed to do at a restaurant i'm not going to cause a big commotion by doing
something ridiculous or by doing something highly unexpected for everybody else we're
naturally going to self organize into the purposes we've meant to fulfill when we went there that's
why it's uh it's an interesting experience to go to a different country and and make errors and
realize oh wow okay my assumptions were wrong this is not how things are done everywhere there are
other ways of doing things you loosen the prior over this is the script and you add an extra layer
of context yeah this is the script here and this is the script here and your model becomes a little
bit more complex but also more adaptable so scripts are superbly useful for self organization and for
planning over time splendid yeah that's just a super useful addendum um in so far as yeah we are
limited creatures if we could compute if we could do perfect Bayesian inference and compute every
single contextual element of our world and then then we probably would need them right we would just
act um omnipotently and omnisciently in all context unfortunately well maybe not unfortunately it's
probably quite a good thing um you know i was talking about kind of one inherent worry that
perhaps all of us have is that we're just becoming the vehicles of our culture that we're acting
without really thinking that we're just um yeah that we just embody our norms without really ever
having a moment to think well did i choose those did they choose me um this may be irrelevant but
i'm curious to see what you think about it um there's an Italian playwright called Pirandello
Luigi Pirandello who was writing in the early of 20th century modernist right uh playwrights
he wrote a play called um Henry the fourth and he called quite an Italian and in that um a kind of
man acts um they're doing a sort of play in which he is playing the role of a nobleman on a night
and he falls off and he ends up believing that he is Henry the 12th century Henry the fourth
and acts accordingly and shapes the whole world so that because he's very rich originally so that
all of his butlers end up wearing medieval wear and whatever anyway it unravels during the play
that actually for the past five years he's known like they all think that he's mad he's actually
returned back to his normal condition but continues to act as every the fourth because
philosophically those people are more mad than him because he's actually chosen his madness
he's chosen his script whereas other people just embody or vehicles for the ideas that are relevant
to their context which brings me to something that Jung said which is that um people don't have
ideas ideas have people so just sort of throwing it out there all of this kind of a smorgasbord
of authenticity to what degree um do you think that active inference agents really are anything
beyond the contingencies of their time like do we have anything new that we can bring or is it only
um a matter of circumstance when we do something kind of random and change things is there any
notion here of like genuine agency genuine agency i know i know i know it's i know it's
forward it's loaded that question i think agency is a continuum yeah it's first of all agency is
really hard to define in psychology you sort of define it but if you try to define it anywhere
outside of its functional like observable metrics like they did this end they assigned it to themselves
kind of thing um it's really hard to define but if we were to define it as say a degree of entropy
let's imagine that i expect you to do this when that right so there's like this absolute baseline
that you can be perfectly predicted and then based on that anything you do outside of that
prediction is a form of agency like if i don't factor your actions into this you're going to be
this but given your actions there's a degree of entropy and uh the more unlikely your actions are
the more agentic you might be because you factored into the shift in the decision
um let's assume that's a definition but it would be a very contentious one not everybody would agree
with that i think we are very agentic we're constantly exploring we're not just exploiting
we're not just uh pragmatic we in fact these two terms exist epistemic and pragmatic within the
after inference framework where you try to balance between the two you are trying to balance between
a pragmatic outcome that keeps you alive which would be what these people are doing and following
the person they're trying to stay alive and doing what he's saying because they kind of
don't have a choice if they want to keep going but to do so they might also be very creative
they might improve the model of the world they might be gathering different things they might not
act exactly the way he had thought because if he could compute it all then why would why would
other people do it you need somebody to gather the knowledge that you currently don't have so
there's always a degree to which agents within certain sets are agentic and so that's where
we define those scripted supersets there's highly certain things like who has the money well it's
not me it's you so that thing I know if I want the money I know but you're going to tell me to do
something but in the way in the something in the distance between the moment that something is
fulfilled and me fulfilling it there's like there's there's a million miles it's practically infinite
like depending on the granularity of the order as well there's there's some space for agency and so
what happens is we sort of agree on what fulfillment means here maybe you know but you didn't necessarily
have a very clear picture of what that fulfillment meant you have some criteria and everything else
kind of falls outside and if we were to again fully try to define what those criteria mean
we would go in the sort of infinite regress of it's impossible to define everything you need a
definition to define yeah so um because of that like infinite metonymy because of that space in
between the the time you are given the action and the fulfillment there's space for agency
interesting as you said it probably would you know raise some contentions from the philosophers
I guess my my pushback on that just to sort of play devil's advocate would be his notion I mean
just back down to the definition of agency and we don't have to go deep into this
because it's somewhat peripheral but I guess it's interesting to think of it as entropy
away from my expectations of you given my model of you is obviously contingent on my
knowledge of you right so if I'm a baby well everyone is super free because they're doing
wacky stuff the whole time so I guess the on the complete other end of the spectrum you have a
god or Laplace's demon who can model everything you're going to do in and that you're just kind of
some porn in some chess game so completely as you as you said it's you're a defendants yeah
exactly it's all perspective um which I guess is actually one of the fundamental insights of
active inference which is that um what is free energy to you might not be free energy to me because
we're all self evidencing or self organizing for our for our own ends for our for the maintenance
of our own models all right excellent um cool well then we'll jump to the third paper the third
theme but it actually all kind of ties together I think which makes sense given that obviously
it's your work in these own coherent uh you know coherent interests um you wrote a paper
I think it was this year with um with Ali Ali Ramjuhu who obviously is a great friend of the
institute um and and helps Daniel out with with everything so shout out to Ali um and this one
really piqued my interest um so this is intra active inference um I think right now it's
am I right say it's only out on psy archive at the moment is that right now uh yes it's a
pre-print it's still a pre-print well definitely people should check out because it's a it's a great
paper um they might have to get their head around some terminology uh because it's quite
rich with with with specific terminology but I'd love to be able to unpick some of the insights
that you and Ali uh came uh came up with in that paper I guess the first one here is that you say
that um and I can quote here a genuine FEP so FEP is free energy principle a genuine FEP based
ontology must reject any discontinuity between matter and subjectivity as FEP does not confer
any uniqueness to cognitive or active agents the same mathematical technology applies equally to
a whole range of entities from inert rocks to the brain so there's a natural tie there to
what we've just been talking about in terms of agency and free will but I want to actually
stay a little bit away from that and talk more about this discontinuity this um this separation
that we in sort of intuitively make between matter and mind or matter and subjectivity
just for the kind of um layman people out there go well of course they're different because
this is all mental and the chair in front of me is not and okay um so what does this so this
sounds bizarre for them what does it mean to reject a discontinuity between matter and subjectivity
right so let's start from the beginning please
materialization is the key here matter isn't static it's constantly becoming
it's shaping itself it's being shaped and basically it's that's that's how what we were
discussing which is neo materialism is distinct from materialism where materialism presupposes
elements outside of say the perception the individual it presupposes it there is a true
outside in the world and you have to do your best to figure out what is that truth
in neo materialism we're basically saying it's not that simple um we have basically um
a relationship between what is being perceived the perspective the observer and what is being
perceived at all like like this this um the element outside is really just um a relationship
between two things becoming together um so basically we we try to recognize that there's
an indeterminacy of matter and um the this this movement of matter is constrained by possibility
spaces um so like we discussed like the scripts right scripts are possibility spaces but they
are also constrained by say um physical constraints like you can't fly like that's just not a thing
yeah but you know um there are perceptions that shape what you consider to be things around you
and you will shape the things based on what you consider to be these things so basically given
these possibility spaces you're going to create meta stable formations and everything is going to
align around these meta stable formations it's the niche formation idea right and so materialization
in this sense is um the iterative process where matter continually redefines limits and boundaries
these are constantly changing and being um negotiated and this negotiation is due to the way
things um self-evidence right so matter being relational and in a sense self-caused because
things self-organized is is moving this um this division between the ontology um that aligns the
view of um the self and the matter here everything is self-evident everything is self-organizing
and effectively um you you are also constituting others and they are constituting you others or
other things so the the the boundary here is virtual it's dependent on a third sort of perspective
that defines that you are not the thing in front of you um the um this is where we basically
determine that there's a probability of sensory state that's interpreted as evident for the
agent's existence uh and so everything around you both uh is evidence for your existence and
you evidence as well right does that so far as that's is that clear yeah yeah um just for those
who may be more familiar with the terminology active inference am i right to say that this
possibility space could be uh defined as an attractor set um with that what is that
bit of a blanket statement uh no i think that's that's interesting so basically um
in the possibility spaces or at least according to the la anda and the news uh you have virtual
and actual uh properties and capacities uh and so if we relate them to the dynamics of FEP
and active inference um you basically just have a temporal depth of these possibilities that are
um directly afforded to you or potential given say a new agency of the the elements in play
and so yes you have farther away attractor set that are more or less likely given the
complexity that would need to be given that we need to give rise to them so if you think of energy
energy is just um the the the improbability of something happening high energy means it's highly
unlikely for it to happen um and so um when we when we deal with these uh possibility spaces
we're basically talking about um the co-constitution of what might happen and what is happening given
the collapse of the possibilities by what you are doing and what the world is doing to you
so you're constantly in this sort of um twister yeah in this twister where you act on the world
and it acts on you and it's constantly being argued shaped right and i guess uh an important
elision there not only between subjectivity and matter but also ontology and epistemology
so ontology there's the study of what is in the epistemology the study of how we know what there
is or what it is in the sense that a free energy minimizing agent is in the game of basically
getting to know themselves in some strange way so they're garnering evidence for this own implicit
model that they have of themselves and the world that they want um given this attractor state so
that's a really beautiful way that to know oneself is to be oneself or vice versa and i know Carl has
some strange inversion of the Cartesian um that i think that's where i am this is this is a really
interesting question because i think uh or it's a really interesting area because it yeah i mean
just brings up so many fundamental questions one being that i think in your paper you speak about
how one can never perfectly actualize a or be static in a possibility um set or put in terms of
attracting states you could never be at stasis where you could never be fully attracted to your
attractor set um you're always uh in well at least for us we're in this kind of itinerant state where
we uh are open to the world and therefore has to deal we have to deal with its kind of stochastic
nature um i guess maybe i'm being an idiot what would the world maybe um what would the world
look like if we managed to reach that stasis so this i understand that this dynamic um unfolding
this um this mutuality of self and other this getting to know oneself what we're really coming
to is the notion that matter is a process rather than this this kind of rarefied static thing
but if that i mean if that process essentially came to a halt are we invoking that matter itself
recedes the matter hides matter if matter is processed once this thing stops if it reaches
its attracting state if i reach perfect home your stasis whether do i stop is my ontology
rooted in my dynamism or is there something over what was the material to say about that
or is there something over and beyond this process of self-evidencing no i think you're
touching upon it i think if there is no more energy if there's no more information being exchanged
there's nothing happening and therefore if nothing's happening you're dead so is there
a strange paradox there but from the outside right like if the claim is that this extents
existential imperative is to minimize free energy to try and get to this precise level of homeostasis
it sounds like what we're trying to get to is equilibrium right like i just want to stop
right like why am i cursed with this fact that i can't right that like i'm cold and hot and off
you know but like that seems to be the goal but paradoxically it would all stop if that was
fulfilled right yeah that that's kind of the way that i'm interpreting what you're saying so again
giving a teleology to something that doesn't have a teleology but how do you kind of unpick
that paradox yeah well it's because this isn't we're not meant to fulfill it right we are the way
we are because they're because the universe is the way it is like the universe leads towards
entropy right eventually there is no more energy eventually everything is spent eventually
everything is equivalent there's there's no information to be gathered anymore that's
just how things are and it and it exists on such a temporal scale on such a massive temporal scale
that at the level of us this is and always will be so we are not meant to ever reach a state where
there is no information to be exchanged where things don't change anymore so obviously we are
constantly pulling in the other direction and it kind of looks like we're trying to reach a point
where we no longer move but that will never happen right so it's natural that if the slope is like
this you're trying to go like this and and basically what you're saying well yeah but what if you
reach the top of the mountain what happens then well yeah if we reach the top of the mountain
eventually we would cause our own issue right we would we would we would reach the point we're
trying to avoid reaching well yeah yeah the thing is we'll never really get there and at the same
time consider we are a product of this system because the system is ongoing so we also contribute
to reaching this point we are consuming energy and we are going to help eventually reach the
heat depth of the universe this is not like obviously we're we're trivial at this point right
we're a blip but imagine we got better at it then we would probably just make it much much much
faster than it would have been otherwise that's what a lot of people think that's what that looks
like what kind of looks like what we're doing yes i um yeah maybe i need to just banish this
romantic notion that there might be some top of the mountain um my sycophant struggle will actually
have a have some benefit you know some positive outcome i think something that you mentioned
there in passing which is really important and really interesting and might not always be made
explicit to those who are learning about active inferences that we're talking about information
here so i'd love for you to um be able to i'd love to hear a bit more about information um
we think of matter again as this kind of static entity the models that we learn at school um
but at least my very layman is we have this with um the free energy principle and just
modern physics as it's unfolding there's really beautiful convergence of matter and information
and you have statistical mechanics and you have stuff like Shannon information and all of these
really fascinating concepts when you say that we will get to a point where there is no more
information transfer um where basically yeah just everything is as is um again i just digging into
the ontology there is that to say that and i know there's no hard and fast answer is that just like
it are you postulating some kind of it from bits as david charmers would say that like kind of the
fundamental unit that we're talking here is information and matter is in some way emergent
from that is there some ontological hierarchy ontological structure that you can point to
that or is it fuzzy so that's an active area of research obviously there is no perfect answer
in the relationship between information and matter like we can always port to the lend our
principle you know uh we can talk about um how um mass and energy are related and if you have
energy then you have a sense of information because effectively um information is related to
the concept of survival where like the negative log probability of an observation becoming true
is effectively you know surprising and therefore information so there's a relationship there right
and if what we're talking about is the relationship between um subjectivity and therefore perception
and uh or at least observer dynamics and matter which are mutually shaping there is a sense in which
the way that information is is is exchange effectively shapes the boundary which gives rise
to what we constantly consider um the ontological scale scale at which matter exists so in a sense
yes but really when we talk about information we're really talking about a degree to which um
um
a certain bound on a surprise is related to a sensory data in a model of the world
so um information is negantry when you have unlikely something that's information if everything
is equally likely then there's no information there right so that's where we get to this
relationship between the heat death of the universe and the absolutely equivalent um
probabilities for anything because there is nothing there and the fact that uh if you
reach the point where you weren't exchanging any information effectively uh you you there's nothing
going on there there is no information to exchange yeah i think that that sheds light on um a potential
point of confusion that people might have when they read the active inference literature which
is that when we're talking about self-information we are not talking about a kind of self-evidencing
result a maximal self-information is not self-evidencing in fact it's quite the opposite
um so that's that's that's useful to remember that the input like if everything was unfolding
predictably you would have less information right like your model would be working optimally if you
gain more information out of your model well then there's some divergence going on here and so so
so yeah it can all be kind of cast as this um quite simple statistical picture excellent good
well now the last thing i want to speak to about i mean this was fascinating and honestly on this
topic i would love to just go on forever um because you've also got another um excellent paper that
people should check out which is about consciousness um and holographic screens and so there's plenty
there's plenty for people to get their teeth into we really barely touch the surface but i guess the
last thing that i want to speak about in some depth is your work of verses um and artificial
intelligence and and your phd as well of course which is in cognitive computing so obviously
within the um the limits of disclosure and how much you're allowed to talk about maybe you could
kind of give us a little bit of information pardon the pun about what verses is what verses does um
and how it's kind of revolutionizing intelligence in some ways um and and how that's being embodied
or encoded into artificial agents right so i guess i can give you the key difference most people
consider just like we discussed that intelligence is a property of an inside and that everything
else is outside what we consider is that intelligence is a phenomenal it happens as a function of the
interactions between different kind of um individuals agents objects there is information
being passed and it's the integration of this information that can be self-reflexive through
different kinds of boundaries that enable acting in a specific kind of way relative to an outcome
you wish to see happen so you accrue agency given how much information you can sort of
pool together so our approach to intelligence is shared intelligence and um we consider that
shared intelligence is not just about shared bits of data it's also creating perspectives
forcing and embedding into the world and because you have an embedding into the world
you have the possibility to dissolve and when you have the possibility to dissolve
and information you have valence when you have valence you have emotion and then you have the
possibility for empathy you have the possibility for theory of mind coordination cooperation and
eventually shared intelligence these are key elements that have not been used in the literature
so far at least are not being um delved into as much from say the machine learning
crowd they're doing amazing work they've allowed for very deep processing of data but this data is
always decontextualized the key issue currently is LLMs hallucinate and they hallucinate because
they have no clue what the context really is or what you're trying to do really and where they are
relative to this context they have no loop and more than no loop they have um no true sense of
how to coordinate with you they don't know if something happened they they don't know if you're
happy with the answer really like you can give a thumb up or a thumb down to chat gpt but while
it's giving the answer it doesn't have that so all of these elements together make it so that
potentially this approach is going to hit a wall our approach is more natural and gives rise to this
fundamental principle of mutual information exchange where in order to improve your model of
the world you have to get to know the thing in front of you better you have to integrate part of it
as a part of you and now you're shaping each other so this whole alignment problem sort of falls out
because it's no longer one about one true value alignment it's about how all of these pieces
coordinate together and create a harmonious self-organizing system that reaches towards
something that resembles a metastable state awesome so just to kind of backtrack there and
maybe give a broader picture um really good that we now have a kind of understanding of
what versus trying to implement I thought the mention of kind of the machine learning law and
the LLMs is really useful here because people have a I think have a notion now because there's
been so much news about chat gbt and bard and neural networks that that's what artificial
intelligence is perhaps you could give us a very simple um carving up of the space in which if you
could a very brief sort of synopsis about how what an LLM is what a large language model is how it
works what you know like vector spaces and probabilities and stuff like this and then what
an active inference system might look like um whether that is embodied or not so I might be
leading you down the part yeah so essentially uh transformers or attention mechanisms that have
self-attention and attention to the text in question they embed different relationships
between different words that give you essentially a probability of a next word being produced
it's really that simple it's a hierarchy that retains certain words and then gives you probabilities
at different scales so the more complex your transformer hierarchy the more complex your
attention can be but effectively it's just that what is the probability of this word given that
that word and that word and that word were set so it's content to content really it's not it doesn't
understand the structure of the world it doesn't have a model what it has is just a sort of given
this word that word given that word that word given that word that word and it's very performant
because knowledge the accrued knowledge that we have crafted in language has a sort of
underlying model you know like we don't talk nonsense most of the time when we talk we try to
make sense we we're not just spouting out a bunch of random words out of nowhere that speak to
nothing of our reality but that's limited to that our approach basically gives our our models the
capacity to from what it observes create another layer and that layer tries to understand what the
causes are why did this happen not what word pre-empted that word but why was that word used
and in that case what you would get if you created an an LLM with an active inference agent
what you would do is it's not just something that predicts the next word it's something
that predicts the cause of the next word and therefore has a sense of why you're saying what
you're saying what you're trying to do and what it might say if it chooses to go along with that
perspective another difference is that the LLMs are not really placing themselves in that loop
it has self-attention relative to words but it doesn't know what it is it doesn't know what its
actions are it can't make a choice relative to an objective that's something that you get
if you have an agent that places itself within the loop and understands the outcomes of its own
actions relative to these to these causes great yeah yeah that's a really useful
separation there a distinction between the two an interesting aside that we could get into but
maybe it's maybe we don't have the time there's no worth it which is about the degree to which
language does indeed refer to some external world because you have all the you know the
semantic internalists I'm sure Mr Chomsky would have something interesting to say
but actually I'll refrain something I have heard which I think is a bit more interesting
and I really was really happy that you mentioned the action perception loop that you are encoding
but maybe a better word there would be that you're embodying or you're allowing these agents to
embody and I really want to have just a moment to speak about embodiment because these large
language models don't have sensory states they don't have active states and for anyone who's seen
a Markov blanket that seems pretty fundamental to adaptive intelligence to being able to
enact self-organization in the way that we do it something that I have heard is that in some
ways this embodiment grants us and perhaps the robots in the end with a sort of care
um and I mean care they're in the Heideggerian sense that there's a kind of um there's a tendency
to lean towards the world in a way in which we're interested in the way it's coupled to us and
and the way it interacts with us and the way we interact with it whereas if we are not embodied
exactly because you don't have that causal impact on the world um you don't you don't embody that
fundamental phenomenology of care um it doesn't really mean much to you to put it in sort of
layman's terms I guess bringing it back to some a topic that always I want to speak about and
need to stop speaking about so much is consciousness it's a very loaded question but is there a degree
to which embodying an artificial intelligence doesn't just endow it with um goals that are just
in principle more aligned with ours but an actual sense of phenomenology a consciousness
and if not why not and if not what else would we need to add and again I'm not expecting you to
solve the whole problem in 10 minutes but just what is the kind of active inference perspective
on a question like that right so I think we need to reformulate what embodiment means I think
embodiment is just a relation to self within a context right and so because because why would a
body just mean this yeah are you less embodied where you're in when you're in the virtual worlds
yeah I would argue you actually are because in effect your perception of your own body is just
an illusion created by your brain so what is embodiment really I think embodiment is that
it's a relationship to self relative to context which means there's a boundary somewhere
if you are the entire context there's no boundary so there's no real embodiment you have to somehow
separate something now maybe you separate your own parts maybe you are every part but you understand
how the different parts are different from one another that's maybe one thing right if you if
you imagine the scenario of a say an overall AI that is connected to everything in everyone
its embodiment might be how it can pull different strands of perspectives given its
different pieces for instance so we have to rethink our understanding of embodiment to be
a little less centered on our own experience and this leads us to isometry why would phenomenology
only be given to something that resembles a physical because I imagine that's what you kind of
had in mind right yeah sort of in mind like a humanoid sort of android thing which we would give
to an AI and therefore they would be anchored in the world in the same way that we are and
effectively that would give them a phenomenology but I think if we're thinking of embodiment we're
really just thinking of how the thing the agent relates to itself relative to its boundaries
and how those boundaries define how information is processed relative to its objectives
I think the problem with that is that it doesn't ensure that we will understand each other
what we want is to endow the AI with the possibility to truly grok us and for us to truly grok it
we need to be able to exchange this information in a way that's you know useful
so we tend to want to give it an embodiment that resembles ours I do think embodiment in the
sense that I defined it is required for what we understand to be consciousness because you need
the boundaries to reflect each other without the boundaries reflecting each other you have
a form of information being integrated but you don't have self and therefore you don't have
self-reflection and I don't think given that you necessarily have access and agency over that access
you just have you know movement along some gradients so that's what I think will be required to
give a form of consciousness to AIs that have a version of embodiment
but just to clarify are you saying that a recursive or embedded system of Markov blankets in which
information is being exchanged up and down and in which areas have been passed up and
temporally slower levels contextualizing these higher order levels are you saying that is
sufficient for consciousness I understand that it might be necessary for consciousness
but something that I've heard you and Maxwell speak about actually on with the active inference
institute is this notion that the that consciousness might might entail some
layer of that cake which is so-called right only so it isn't being contextualized it is just
I don't know what the issuing information how would you what does that model look like
and have I well yeah I don't want to completely butcher it so I'll pass it over to you
I think the right only parts of the models are just
they're dependent like depending on the scale everything can be right only like it's really a
question of what is the degree of access and I think when we define right only we define the
conditions for the thing to survive you don't have a choice but to breathe air right you don't
have a choice but to drink water these are not
choices you're making so to some extent there is one layer at which something is like it has to
happen right and therefore it's not something that that is written on because it's likely to change
so at the level of an AI that's what I mean by the perspectival aspect of their embodiment
with a boundary if they have a boundary some boundary whether that boundary is they have
a condition for that boundary to be dissolved and that condition those conditions define
the right only layers of the boundary
does that mean in some sense that being able to for the system to recognize it's distinct from
something else from everything else is a prerequisite condition for consciousness within
this model that's right that's right in order for a thing to have a self and an embodiment it has
to be somehow bound from other things like it it has to be different to some extent it has to be
able to take perspectives that enable this difference like I said if you had this all
or that you pull into different consciousnesses it would still for time being be able to pull
this specific boundary and embody it in a sense yes yes and that and that feeds back very nicely
into this hydrogarian notion of care to take a stance on something I think is a way that he
might express that wonderful I mean I I guess my final comment on this would be what given this
given that a kind of the perspectivalness the the self versus other distinction is so at least
in this model crucial to a sense of what it is like to be anything how much credence or how do you
rejoin the those who speak of boundless consciousness experiences or yeah ego death or oneness of these
delusional do they or do they invoke some minimal sense of self where do they fit into this story
so I think that's a really interesting topic and I'm not someone who's going to invalidate
anyone's experience so obviously again take what I'm saying with a grain of salt your
experience trumps my perspective on your experience what I think happens is you're not actually
dissolving right you are dissolving certain layers of what generally constitutes yourself
and that experience is powerful and transcendental and because you feel like what usually constitutes
yourself is dissolved you feel like you're connected to everything else but you're not
you're still you you're still embedded in your body right these practices are conceptual and tap
into what we believe to be what that would be like but the truth is you don't know no one who's
ever reported that experience wasn't in a body so I think we all tap into that same experience
when we go through something that resembles ego death in the sense that there are layers that
become mill like we dissolve these layers not all layers which means on a fundamental level
that infinite consciousness is still being tapped into from a perspective
awesome yay I mean I guess here I ought to point people to where this philosophical
foundation is and people should definitely check out Thomas Metzinger and something that's really
important to point out here is that when we're talking about self one ought to keep in mind
that there's a distinction here between the so-called ontological self this kind of entity
that I think people instinctively associate with a kind of Cartesian soul this unchanging entity
and perhaps what we're more concerned with which is the so-called phenomenal self model
how the system models itself how it reflects on its own being how it takes a stance on its own
being and what it conceives of itself and perhaps the attenuation of some of this self-modeling
is exactly what's happening in psychedelics and here we speak to people like George Dean
who I'm trying to get on and I think that would be fascinating and some of the work that I'm working
on is is completely to do with self-modeling so so this is all very neatly tied into current
work going on in active inference now this has been awesome I know I know our time is basically up
where so what what do people have to look forward to on your side what are the kind of
interesting things that you're working on where can people find you where can people reach out to
if they're exhilarated by the stuff we've spoken about today and want to find out more
so I'm working on several papers one on emergence in active inference I'm also working on a paper
on self-esteem and how to model it in social groups and I'm working on a paper on sustainability
and how that arises from the notion of resilience and mutually effective resilience
you can find me on linkedin on google scholar and sometimes on twitter very very rarely I would
much more encourage people to reach out to me by email if they find it on one of my papers or on
linkedin directly awesome thank you mal this was great thank you
