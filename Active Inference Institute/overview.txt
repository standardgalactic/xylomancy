============================
Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream #015.1： Bobby Azarian, Universal Bayesianism： A New Kind of Theory of Everything.txt
1. **Red Queen and Evolutionary Arms Race**: The discussion revolved around the concept of the Red Queen phenomenon, which describes an evolutionary arms race within a single species, not just between different ones. This intraspecific competition drives complexity within a species as they adapt to each other and their environment. John Maynard Smith applied game theory to this biological process.

2. **Complexity Limits**: While there are limits to biological complexity due to factors like skull size in humans (the cephalization limit), humans have the unique ability to augment themselves with technology, potentially overcoming these limits. This open-ended complexity is not just biological but also cultural and technological.

3. **Technology as an Extension of Biology**: Technology is seen as an extension of biology, following Richard Dawkins' concept of the extended phenotype. Devices like phones are considered extensions of our minds, which leads to the Extended Mind Hypothesis. This perspective highlights the importance of considering privacy in a technological world while also recognizing that technology can enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.

4. **Future Discussions**: The conversation hinted at potential future discussions on topics like free will and agency, with suggestions to involve experts like Kevin Mitchell or Eric Winsberg, who have contributed significantly to the understanding of top-down causation and causal emergence.

5. **Feedback and Engagement**: The speakers expressed gratitude for the feedback from individuals such as Marco and anyone else contributing to the conversation. They encouraged viewers to revisit the discussion if needed and offered tips on staying hydrated, with a light nod towards microdosing substances like delta eight or cannabis for those interested in such practices legally.

In summary, the conversation covered the concept of an evolutionary arms race within species, the limits and potentialities of biological complexity, and the integration of technology as part of human evolution, leading to the possibility of becoming "hyperbiological." The discussion also highlighted the importance of community engagement and expert input for further exploration of complex topics like free will and the role of technology in human life.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 041.1 ~ ＂A conversation on Chomsky & Large Language Models＂ ~ Murphy & Piantadosi.txt
1. The discussion touched upon the debate among syntacticians about whether syntactic categories are innate or learned. It seems that most do not believe in the strict innateness of categories but rather in the innateness of certain linguistic computations.

2. Charles Yang has recently expressed uncertainty about the innateness of categories, suggesting that the focus might be on operations instead.

3. An example was given where GPT-BBC News articles demonstrated a lack of compositionality, as seen when it incorrectly compressed "58 people are being charged with manslaughter" into "58 people are being charged with manslaughter."

4. There was a discussion about whether AI like Bing Chat is capable of analogical reasoning or if it merely finds existing meta-relations documented by humans. An example provided was comparing Jesus Christ and the Nokia 9910, where Bing Chat made some relevant comparisons but also some nonsensical ones.

5. The group acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) like GPT have learned more than just part of speech categories; they possess a significant amount of grammatical, semantic, pragmatic, and even translation knowledge.

6. A teaser for future discussions was presented, suggesting that the participants might collaborate again to explore more topics in depth, including comparisons between small transformers in 2020 and children learning language, the role of implicit priors versus animal instincts, and the constraints imposed on LLMs during training.

7. The session concluded with gratitude from Dave to Elliott and Stephen for their contributions to the discussion, expressing hope for future collaborative efforts.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 051.1 ~ Tommaso Salvatori ＂Causal Inference via Predictive Coding＂.txt
1. **Predictive Coding with Temporal Data**: The concept of creative coding can be generalized to work with temporal data using techniques like Kalman filters or more advanced dynamical causal models that can handle ranger causality and complex interactions over time.

2. **Causal Inference in Complex Models**: While causal inference is often applied to smaller models, there's potential to extend these methods to larger, biologically plausible models that can model the effects of interventions over multiple time steps.

3. **Actions in Predictive Coding Models**: Actions can be seen as a result of perceptual experiences or as part of the expectations about action within the predictive coding framework. In the context of active inference, actions are chosen based on their likelihood, not on a utility function.

4. **Integrating Action into Predictive Coding**: Action variables can be integrated into the predictive coding architecture, aligning with Bayesian mechanics and allowing for practical applications where predictions about external events are made based on expected actions.

5. **Future Work**: While some papers by Alexander or Obrie have explored this integration of action within predictive coding, there's still a lot of room for research and application in solving practical problems using these methods.

6. **Gratitude and Future Collaboration**: The speaker expressed gratitude for the invitation to present and discussed hopeful future collaborations and opportunities to share more work related to this topic.

7. **Closing**: A warm closing with thanks all around, and an open invitation for the speaker to return and share future research findings. The session ended on a positive note of collaboration and continued exploration in the field.

8. The conversation concluded with expressions of gratitude for the opportunity to engage in the discussion and enthusiasm for future collaboration within the community.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 077.1 ~ Gareth Lee Stubbs： ＂The Police Hunch＂ Bayesian Brain, Active Inference.txt
 Gareth is planning to conduct a study on how police officers around the world make decisions based on hunches. He aims to collect narrative accounts from officers when they act on their intuition, ranging from minor suspicions to strong, high-threat instincts. This research would be documented in a repository and could potentially become a worldwide voluntary study. The goal is to understand how these hunches are received, processed, and acted upon by officers, and how this might relate to the perception of police legitimacy.

Gareth also mentioned an idea related to the law, where he believes people call the police when their "surprising bounds" are breached, seeking the police to act as an agent of return to restore their personal stasis or sense of order. This concept could lead to a general theory of police contact and might differ across various communities based on their tolerance for surprises.

Gareth invites listeners who have ideas or questions to reach out to him, and he is excited about the potential discussions and collaborations within the community associated with the Active Minds Institute.

The conversation also touched upon how Gareth's research could intersect with existing decision-making models in policing and how it might contribute to understanding the qualia of hunches. He is currently seeking funding for his study, and once secured, he plans to proceed with his research.

Gareth expressed gratitude to Daniel for facilitating the conversation and to everyone who listened or participated in the live chat. He hopes to continue this line of research and exploration of these critical areas.

This could lead to a more satisfactory theory of consciousness that integrates neural models with behavioral outcomes.

4. **Transferability Across Species**: The research is not limited to insects; it also considers the neuroanatomy and behavior of mammals, octopuses, squid, birds, and potentially other species. This comparative approach can reveal how different bodies and environments influence spatial perception and navigation.

5. **Active Inference Loop**: The research emphasizes the Active Inference loop, which includes policy selection for movements, such as deciding to go, stay, or change direction based on factors like information gain, safety, and other heuristics.

6. **Empirical Data Analysis**: By analyzing empirical trajectories and their component loading, researchers can understand the decision-making processes behind an organism's movements, including moments of uncertainty resolution and inertia.

7. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: The research touches on various disciplines, from neuroscience to robotics, and encourages the synthesis of theoretical models with empirical data across different species and environments.

8. **Hands-On Approach**: Reflecting Richard Feynman's philosophy that if you can't build it, you don't understand it, this research advocates for a hands-on approach to understanding complex systems by actively engaging in building and testing models.

9. **Future Work**: The researchers aim to continue exploring these topics, including the release of code and datasets for others to experiment with and contribute to the ongoing investigation into active inference and decision-making in animals.

10. **Community Engagement**: Robert invites the community to download the code and datasets (available at http://theoryofactiveinference.org/resources), encouraging others to build upon this work and add to the collective understanding of how organisms make decisions and navigate their environments.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 082.3 ~ ＂The Projective Wave Theory of Consciousness＂ Worden, Rudrauf, Williford.txt
 In this conversation, several participants discuss the complex relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, particularly as it relates to the unity of consciousness and belief updating in the brain. Karen Smith had previously expressed concerns about how quantum effects in the brain might avoid decoherence, suggesting that nature might have found a clever way to realize Bose-Einstein condensation within neural structures without losing coherence.

Ken Hogancamp is open to the idea that nature may be more clever than humans and appreciates the complexity of the universe. He looks forward to continuing the discussion on the links between spatial waves in the brain, projective geometry, information geometry, and belief updating, including whether mortal computation can encompass these ideas.

David Ingerman acknowledges his prior skepticism about the quantum mechanics and consciousness connection but is now more open to exploring it due to a growing awareness of his own ignorance. He suggests that having experts in quantum mechanics, like Chris Field or Grégoire Sergent, would be beneficial for the discussion. He also corrects a previous participant's mistake, noting that the individuals they were referring to were actually Swiss, not German.

The group agrees on the importance of a falsifiable theory and looks forward to exploring this topic further in their next meeting, which is scheduled for 16 UTC on July 29th. Participants express gratitude for the contributions made during the discussion and anticipate continued exploration of these intriguing topics.

Checking Active Inference Institute/ActInf GuestStream 083.1 ~ ＂Embodied intelligence＂, Joshua Bongard.txt
 Josh Bongard, a professor of robotics at the University of Vermont, has been exploring the intersection of ecological psychology and robotics, emphasizing the importance of embodied cognition in artificial intelligence (AI).

Checking Active Inference Institute/Mahault Albarracin ~ Active Inference Insights 002 ~ Epistemic Communities, Social Scripts, AI.txt
1. **Self and Embodiment**: In the context of Thomas Metzinger's theory, a prerequisite for consciousness is the ability of a system to distinguish itself from other things and to take perspectives that enable this distinction. This self-modeling is crucial for any form of consciousness.

2. **Boundless Consciousness**: Experiences described as boundless consciousness or ego death might involve the dissolution of certain layers of the self, but not all layers. Even in these states, there's a fundamental level where infinite consciousness is still being tapped into, and this happens within the context of a physical body.

3. **Phenomenal Self vs. Ontological Self**: It's important to distinguish between the ontological self (a stable entity) and the phenomenal self model (how the system models and reflects on its own existence). The latter is more relevant in discussions about consciousness and self-attenuation during psychedelic experiences.

4. **Current Research**: The discussion touched upon active inference, self-modeling, and how these concepts relate to various phenomena, including ego dissolution, sustainability, social dynamics (like self-esteem), and emergence.

5. **Further Engagement**: For those interested in delving deeper into these topics, the presenter suggested reaching out via email, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or Twitter to engage with their work directly. The presenter is working on several papers that explore these themes further.

In summary, the conversation highlighted the importance of self-modeling and perspective-taking in consciousness, provided context for experiences of boundless consciousness, and outlined some of the current research areas in active inference that are relevant to understanding the self and its relationship with the world around us.

6. **Closing Thoughts**: The conversation highlighted the potential of active inference to raise more questions than answers, which can be a positive aspect as it opens up new avenues for research and experimentation. The team expressed gratitude for the engaging discussion and encouraged everyone to stay tuned for future developments.

7. **Engagement and Interaction**: The live chat during the lecture was active with many comments from viewers, although not all could be read or addressed during the session. It's noted that viewer engagement is a valuable part of these discussions.

In summary, the conversation was a collaborative exploration of how active inference can contribute to understanding complex social phenomena, with specific references to resources and ongoing projects at KAIROS research. The team emphasized the importance of continuous learning, development, and collaboration in this interdisciplinary field.

1. The discussion revolved around the concept of how agents can integrate or differentiate to achieve unity through various means, such as reducing variational free energy, prediction error, surprise, and increasing mutual information.

2. Andrew Yates highlighted that integration can occur through both blurring (generalized synchrony) and differentiation (increased articulation), emphasizing the trade-off life or cognition faces on this frontier.

3. Dean Kleckner expressed his intention to revisit Chris's comments on common cause and fine tuning assumptions, questioning whether it's about dialing in or metaphorically adjusting for better fit.

4. The course is halfway through, with three lectures and three discussion sessions completed, and the midterm has been successfully navigated by participants.

5. Upcoming topics include how agents use multiple communication channels, which will tie into the concept of quantum Free Energy Principle (FEP), and the emergence of spacetime from communication. The course will also explore the connection between these concepts and biology, particularly life, as it moves forward.

6. Participants are encouraged to submit questions for Chris, engage in upcoming discussion sessions, register for the course, and contribute to the publication of collective works that will compile all the discussions and insights from the course.

7. The next three discussion sessions promise to delve into increasingly complex and interesting topics, inviting more voices and perspectives to join the conversation.

In summary, the session was a thought-provoking dialogue on unity through integration, with a focus on the upcoming lectures and discussions that will further explore the interplay between information theory, communication, and biological systems. The course continues to invite active participation from all interested individuals.

1. **Agent's Reference Frame**: In the context of an agent perceiving its environment, the agent must have a reference frame to understand space around it. This could range from recognizing different parts of its own membrane without any metric (discrete location names) to eventually developing an understanding of angular and then radial space with metrics.

2. **Phylogenetics and Embryology**: The lineage of organisms, including the last universal common ancestor (Luca), can be understood in a similar way as the development of an embryo within its mother. Mike Levin and Chris Bishop have published papers suggesting that phylogeny should be viewed in the same terms as embryology.

3. **Temporal Aspects in Quantum Channels**: The concept of weak rotation, which was mentioned earlier in the context of quantum channels, relates to a reversal in the direction of time. In the context of agent interactions across a boundary, this means that for two agents (Alice and Bob), the flow of time is perceived differently from each other's perspective due to the input-output cycle of their interaction.

4. **Upcoming Discussion**: Chris Bishop invited everyone to join a participatory discussion in about two weeks to further explore these topics, including the phylogenetic questions and the formalism of spatial measurement by biological systems.

5. **Continued Exploration**: The ideas discussed are part of an ongoing exploration into understanding how organisms, especially at the level of single-celled organisms like Luca, perceive and assign spatial coordinates to their environment, and how this relates to broader concepts in physics and biology.

6. **Quantum Computing Analogy**: The analogy between quantum computing operations (like weak rotation) and biological processes (like the flow of time in living organisms) is a key theme in these discussions, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of understanding complex systems.

1. The basis of semantics lies in the differences that make a difference in behavior and action ability. In programming languages, these differences are represented through variable bindings and other constructs that influence what the program does.

2. Embedding theories describe relationships between systems, such as between a programming language and an operating system, and can be represented using mathematical constructs like category theory.

3. Reductive theories, particularly in old-fashioned AI from the late 60s and early 70s, often ignored semantics by focusing solely on syntactic aspects of computation. This view is too narrow because it leaves out the meaningful aspects that give computation its purpose.

4. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) emphasizes the importance of semantics as it relates to an agent's model of its environment and the agent's actions to manipulate that environment to achieve predictive power or desired outcomes. FEP is inherently semantic because it involves active engagement with the environment, not passive observation.

5. Both FEP and quantum theory refute the notion of a passive observer; they highlight the active role of the observer in shaping and being shaped by their environment.

6. The conversation between Daniel Kaufman and Chris Gerry highlights the importance of semantics in understanding systems, whether in computation, biology, or physics, and underscores the need for a holistic view that integrates sense-making and decision-making processes.

7. The discussion also points out the limitations of purely reductionist approaches and the value of scale-free theories that account for complex interactions across different scales and contexts.
