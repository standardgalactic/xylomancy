Hello and welcome. It's July 29th, 2023, and we're here in session three discussion of
the course, Physicist Information Processing at the Active Inference Institute. We're having
follow-up discussion on Chris Fields' third lecture on quantum reference frames,
and we're looking forward to your participation. So if you're watching along live and you've been
invited to the calendar event, it's not too late to jump in. If you're watching on YouTube, you can
write any questions or comments in the live chat with Dean and Andrew here. We're going to be
looking at some of the key points and taking it in a few different directions,
sharing our reference frames, making a shared one. So Andrew, be awesome to have you zoom in a little
bit on the slide and then feel free to take us through some of the key points so that we can
see a little bit how you're seeing it. Thank you. That looks good. Yep. Okay, so let's start by
reviewing the last lecture from a couple weeks ago, and then we can open up the discussions
if there's any questions that appear in the live chat. We can address those. All right, so
lecture two, Chris introduced this idea of the information processing between system AMB,
you know, where they interact via qubits on a boundary and they have reference frames
that give meaning to this communication. You want to think of information processing as
a communication channel the way Shannon thought about it. So that was in lecture two and lecture
three a couple weeks ago. I tried to make this more explicit by emphasizing the idea that this has to
be physically embodied somewhere. Okay, and I think that because we are so used to information being
fungible in no small part because of the internet and everything, it's a little hard to understand
at first when the claim is made that you have a QRF that it's non fungible or you have a piece of
quantum information that's non fungible or things like the no cloning theorem. We're so used to
information being fungible to it being zeros and ones. It's a bit of a change in mindset at first,
but that's exactly what lecture three introduced. This was all stuff, right?
Could you maybe just unpack that a little bit? What would it mean for information to be fungible
or what's that stance like and then what does it mean for information to be non fungible and what
is that stance like? Yeah, I'm allowed to get there. So let me scroll down the slides because
that's addressed here. So I was maybe I should have kept this in the beginning, but anyways,
session two talked about how information theory makes this simple and obvious. Okay,
and in session three we talk about reference frames and mechanistically how all of this works.
So yeah, let's address that question of the difference between
between, hold on one second, let me use my mouse to scroll down here.
Okay, so that's a little faster, right? Okay, so can you restate your question, Daniel?
Yeah, what would it mean for information to be fungible or non fungible? People might be familiar
with that in the economic setting with non fungible tokens and all of that, but what are we talking
about with informational fungibility? I think it basically comes down to
whether you can replicate. I mean, it's basically the difference between classical
and quantum information. As far as I know, fungible information is everything that you can
basically turn into a message of zeros and ones. It's, you know, how you transmit it may be
different, you know, the channel, the physical hardware and so on, but at the end of the day,
it's something that you can write on a boundary and something that you can
transmit as zeros and ones. Whereas quantum information, you literally have to send the
hardware, the piece of hardware, the QRF, at least that's how I understand it. So a simple answer might be
that it's information encoded in a piece of software versus a piece of hardware, but I
don't think that analogy is perfect. Yeah, Dean, what do you think?
Here's what I'm curious about. And again, you guys can help me with this. As opposed to reference
frames, I oftentimes default to frame of reference. And I know that in one of the live streams,
what I tried to bring out was the idea that there was an ice cream cone looking at an ice cream
truck. And the question was always whether or not which, which one of those two entities is that
one is in the foreground, and one is in the background. And in this slide that Andrew has,
the question is, is the non-fungibility because
only A and B can decide whether the A, the VA as seen by B, the A is deeper
into that image based on our frame of reference, and the B is closer, or is the B the one that's
actually deeper, and the A is the one that's in the foreground. And I was wondering whether the
idea of non-copyability is because of that depth of field aspect that cannot be determined unless
it's literally handed over the way that Chris was describing it. I think that's basically accurate.
I think, I'm not sure I can answer the question, but I think I have the feeling that Chris,
well, Chris said this in the lecture that, I mean, at the end of the day, the QRF
is somewhere in your nervous system. And here, whether, I mean, you bring up a good point,
right? It looks like this slide is a bit of an optical illusion. Whether you see A or B deeper,
I guess it depends on something going on inside your head. If you, this picture is so
symmetrical that if you focus an app on it, you can change your opinion.
Well, just to even connect that to what we're talking about, the classical fungible information
on the holographic screen, on the blanket, and then the quantum cognitive rotation is,
those two images are on the screen, identical, and then whether it gets a quantum rotation
such that the three points of the axes are closer to us than the intersection
on that kind of tetrahedron or the other way around, whether the ballerina is rotating one
way or the other, that's not on the boundary. So the information about the depth of field
is part of the QRF or part of the enactment of the QRF, and it's not written on the boundary.
And that goes back to the preparation question and not just the measuring.
Yeah, like at the preparation, if your whole enculturation or the last five minutes,
it was entrained or you were holding an object that predisposed you to think that the vertex
of the intersection was further away. That's the preparation that sets your prior so that when
you get this ambiguous artifact, you rotate it into the most natural position cognitively,
and that's the preparation that sets you up for measurement, no measurement can happen
without a preparation. What do you think, Andrew? Sure, yeah, everything you said makes sense.
So perhaps let me recall what I said around the slides. There was a, in this whole spirit
or philosophy of making, emphasizing that information is physical, you know, income from
cubit, this whole thing. One of the glaring omissions in physics was the embodiment of
the reference frame, which was treated as an abstraction, you know, in classical physics,
such as by Galileo, but maybe even Einstein, even if he, my hunch is that he did have more
this instinct of, you know, particularly in all those thought experiments of trying to
chase the light ray, you are chasing the light ray, right? So at the end of the day.
But I mean, this is a whole process of making the observer and the reference frame more and more
explicit and more and more physical, because at the end of the day, it has to, right? If you
start with this assumption that, so it's just the assumption almost that, you know,
all you see and, you know, it's part of the same material ether that you are, then, you know,
then you are part of the universe that you're observing something that is out there.
So you need to make, include a theory of what it means for you to be observing that, right?
And at the end of the day, the observer has to be physical. That's what was emphasized by Chris
at the beginning of this lecture. So this jump from treating the reference frame as an abstraction
to a real physical entity. Yeah, these are, these people have talked a lot about,
in these papers that are quoted there, but I should also remark, if folks want to see this,
it's coming up in high energy theory also, in recent work of Sasuke and others,
where they talk about quantum reference frames, very explicitly. So I don't have the
citations of the but, but it's definitely becoming an important thing the last 20 years.
This attempt to really explicitly treat the reference frame and the observer as a quantum
entity, as a physical entity. Okay, so this, that's what I just said, okay, the jump from
treating things, reference frames as abstractions to physical objects. Go.
And, and because we cannot make a perfect copy of quantum information, we say that these are
unique, controllable and unfungible. So in order to recreate an experiment perfectly,
this is the, this is addressed as the part of fungibility or not, right? Can Alice,
if you have some sort of quantum experiment, and Alice and Bob are, you know, it's the usual
EPR thought experiment or whatever Alice and Bob are separated by light years.
Is it enough if they want to recreate the same exact, the same experiment or Alice to send
string of zeros and ones? Well, if you, if you had an experiment where that's enough,
then, then you can recreate it with fungible information. If not, then you need to somehow
send non-fungible information, which really implies standing a piece of hardware.
Um, can I, can I add another, another piece here? Look on the previous slide. So,
this looks really technical and scientific, but let's think about Alice's laboratory is
Alice's brain, mind and Bob's analogously. Alice is thinking about what to say,
and then says it. And that information might be written in a chat form. It might be said
verbally. It might be transmitted through digital or analog signal. But at some point,
it's going through this classical informational interface. And then Bob's laboratory is like
perceiving and unpacking it. And the question of semantic alignment is such that if Alice gives
a shopping list of 10 items, if there's semantic alignment, Bob would be able to go to the store
and then find those 10 items. And it made me think of the, the dictionary definition of left
and right. So this gets back to our discussion of whether the vertex on these axes is coming
towards us or away from us. So I looked up the deck, the dictionary definition of left
on towards or relating to the side of a human body or of a thing that is to the west when the
person or that thing is facing north. So that's, I guess one attempt to anchor what it means to be
left. The second definition is the left hand part, side or direction. And you could imagine
there's an analogous definition for right. The point is you can't describe verbally leftness
and rightness or chirality in general, because its reference is an embodied perspective.
And so if Alice said, okay, you're going to go down the street and then turn left at the stop sign,
how would Alice communicate to Bob what leftness meant at that stop sign versus rightness?
And that's this question of flipping. And the way that the quantum formalism accommodates that
is through the WIC rotation and the quantum cognitive events, where the fungible,
transmittable holographic information gets rotated into the imaginary axis
with the formalisms that enable it to be rotated at all. But that means you could rotate it left
quote or rotate it right. Yeah, I think that's, that's a very good explanation. I don't know
if I have much to add, Dean, do you want me to say something? So, but I can't, I don't know the
answer to this, but to take what Daniel just said, to take the basic concept of being able to
take something that for all intents and purposes can appear one way or another. And then turn that
into how Chris closed the last lecture with, we are, we are seeing ourselves as both being entangled
and also being separatable. How did we go literally from a three dimension vertex to we're both entangled
and we're, we're not living in a paradox. That's just the way it is. We're also
removing ourselves or separating ourselves at the same time. That's what I would like to know,
because somewhere between three arbitrary lines and complexity is not a paradox.
Something has to be happening. And I'm not exactly sure how that transition plays out.
Anybody want to enlighten me?
Can you repeat your question, please?
Well, how do we, how do we go like from the, at this point of the reference frame description
of saying it can't, you can't copy it. All you can do is pass it. Because we think things could
be flipped based on internal, internal reference frames, internal meanings and
turtle models. The thing we choose for context, yadda yadda yadda goes all the way out to the
conclusion of Chris's conversation with us in number three, where he said, bottom line is,
is that it's not a paradox that as things become more and more complex, then it wants to be able,
it wants to get to a place of entanglement, alignment, a sense of agreement, and at the
same time wants to remain separate. So between those two things, a whole lot has happened.
But, and I don't think we've skipped over it, but we certainly haven't
opened it up and really looked at it closely. And I'm just curious,
what's in between those two scales?
I agree. I think we're, we're going to cover that towards the end of the, of the talk.
But I agree. I mean, I don't know how you see this related to QRS or the stuff we just talked
about. But I think it's the big question in this, in this lecture, right? That was like,
where does this tension between increase in complexity and, you know, wanting, wanting to
predict what the environment is doing? One requires entanglement and one requires separability,
at least colloquially speaking. I think this tension is basically what the free energy principle
comes down to, right, Daniel? What do you think? You have the free energy and you have the E minus
TS and one is prediction error. I mean, not exactly E minus TS, right? That would be the
right dynamics, but you know what I mean? One is prediction error and the other one is,
what was it? I can't remember.
I'll definitely look forward to the, the technical unpacking that, that you'll get to soon. But,
but I was reminded of the William Blake quotation, do what you will, this life's a fiction and is made
up of contradiction. So let's modify that. Project what you will, rotate what you will,
space times a fiction, not that it's false, but that it's a projected fictionalization,
that it doesn't have the ontological primacy that that's apology of communication does,
and is made up of contradiction. Yes. And it's made up of this tension between
fitting and not overfitting between aligning and the principle of unitarity and differentiating
and becoming through others, we become ourselves and that type of articulation and recognizing
that two complimentary forces like convex and concave come into existence at once like a zero to
two jump is not an issue or a stumbling block. It's that we wouldn't have it any other way.
Couldn't have it any other way. Yeah. Sure. We'll get that towards the end. You can almost
even call it a duality. It's not far fetch. I mean, it's the sort of thing that I think most
people will be happy to take for granted such, you know, supersymmetry, like you have two kinds
of particles, but the same amount of them. And, you know, dualities that are all over the place.
So I think, I think it's fairly, it's not unreasonable to just accept that there are,
there is a tension between increasing complexity, which you want you want me to be
separable for and accuracy prediction. Now, how this is related to emergent space and
this QRF stuff, you know, I don't want to make very far fetch claims, we'll talk
about emergent space later on the course. But for now, let's, let's, let's say a few more words
and then we'll get to the complexity stuff towards the end. So QRFs are almost building blocks if you
want for information processing. Here it's very useful to recall the definition that I feel. I
think we, we have mentioned before of information as being differences that make a difference.
That's probably the best flow for definition of information. I've heard, and I think,
I think it does a lot of work. I mean, it's almost mathematical. But anyways, we need to unpack it
a little more and see, so for a difference to make a difference, what do you want out of QRF, right?
And surprisingly, I mean, not surprisingly, but reassuringly, I think would be the word.
So you need a QRF to have sensory action and a default state, right? This is sort of like
where your Bayesian prior distribution is encoded. These three things will give you a
building block for any information processing and that, you know, ties together with all the work
in the pre-energy literature and perception action loops and whatnot. So before we see
mathematically how a QRF is defined, I think it's more illustrative. And I think Chris went
exactly on the right order when he presented this a couple of weeks ago, seeing examples from
magic. These are actual pieces of forward that are effectively QRFs. And it's remarkable how they map
to, well, I'll skip ahead a little bit, but when you get to the mathematical definition of a QRF
as a quantum system that, you know, you can specify with this category theory diagram,
you know, you have incoming arrows into a node that then expands, right? And this roughly
corresponds to measurement and preparation degrees of, not degrees of freedom, the degrees of freedom
would be the same, right, when you attach it to the boundary. But measurement and preparation stages,
I guess, would be the better word. But anyways, let me go back to these examples, right? And Daniel,
your biologist here, so correct me if I say anything wrong here. You have a cartoon picture of the
bacteria, I think. And this is a very simple sort of thing, right? It navigates in the direction of
food. And that's it, right? So it is a very simple rudimentary example of a QRF. You have the sensory
stage here, I guess, the degrees of freedom. I guess the degrees of freedom, it's not obvious
here what the boundary is. That's one thing. But it is a good enough picture to see the resemblance
to here. We have the measurement, which in this case, you're trying to measure concentration of
food. You have your node here, C, which is your prior distribution for concentration of food.
And finally, you have the output, the preparation stage, which is your, you know, the rest of this
chemical network that will control and steer this bacterium, right? So there's here, you want to call
it the action degrees of freedom that will steer this bacterium in the direction of food.
And likewise with cell division, this I understand even less, the network appears more complicated.
But I think it's fair to say that at the end of the day, all these chemical networks
that appear super complicated, somehow have to be mapped to this
category theoretical diagram. That's all there is to it. You're going to have the sensory input
and the action output. And you're going to have the default chemical concentration, which
amounts to this node over here.
You remember this from last lecture, right, Daniel?
Yeah. And the cone cocoon we explored also in Livestream 17 on the Bayesian semantic information
flow. But I'll kind of add a point about these biological systems in relationship to artificially
specified systems and what that helps us understand about perception cognition action.
So the cone cocoon diagram has this bow tie architecture, or this kind of like two
pyramids touching point to point, where there's a preparation and a measurement,
which can be different dimensionalities or different scopes, like it could be multi input,
multi output or multi input single output vice versa and so on. But they come through this
eye of the needle with C prime here. Now contrast that kind of architecture
represented here abstractly with what we see in the bacterial process and in the cell division
process. These have that kind of a bow tie perception cognition action architecture or
measurement cognitive integration preparation architecture. In contrast, we see, for example,
an artificial neural network where the input and the output layers are usually lower dimensional,
maybe an image coming in with several hundred pixels and a single output like a classifier
coming out the other end, but a dimensional explosion in those internal cognitive layers.
But in biological systems, it's actually exactly the opposite. For example, many, many, many receptors
on the cell surface on the holographic boundary, the sensorium of the cell. But then
there are these common secondary messengers that many pathways converge upon. So that reflects the
kind of radically different architecture that a QRF embodies, as opposed to the approach taken by
disembodied intelligence frameworks, which use dimensional explosion internally to try to
categorize and classify and find find edge cases versus this dimensional winnowing
that is reflective of these embodied intelligences.
And if I may make a tangential comment here also,
I think the good thing about these two examples is that they also showcase
the fact of how the deep implications of a scale free biology, if you want to call it this way,
we tend to think of these sorts of processes such as here only happening at the level of
the nervous system in animals or, as you said, neural networks. We tend to associate this with
neural networks. And perhaps evolution as tier does in a way that's endowed us with nervous
systems to make these things, maybe these are higher up in the layers. But really, that's a
bit of an arbitrary distinction that we make. The processes going on at the cellular level,
even if they don't appear to have anything to do with the nervous system,
my understanding is that there are some generic properties that are the same,
and everything that has to do with information processing manifests maybe slightly different
when it comes to explicit nerves. But at the end of the day, it's the same generic process going
on. Would you say that's right, Daniel? The ontological claim is that it's the same generic
process happening, whereas the more instrumentalist claim is that we can model it with some shared
abstractions. Yeah, okay, so we can continue, right? I don't have a whole lot to say, Daniel,
said quite a bit about at the end of the day, QF is, you can visualize it as this diagram.
And you know, you can think of it as, if you are more familiar with the picture of
a neural network and ways on a neural network and so on, that's the way to think about it.
Now, let's continue with explicit embodiment, if you wish. So, QFs in the formalism
have to be attached to a boundary, boundary degree supreme. And I should add another remark here,
I think, and personally, to me also, the hard part about this quantum pre-energy principle
formalism, if you wish, is what you said at the beginning is the fact that it's topological,
right? So, very often it's not clear what the boundary degrees of freedom are,
right? Because we tend to think of boundaries as, you know,
geometrical, and certainly the classical FEP treats them as geometrical.
But that's not the case here in the quantum pre-energy formalism. And where we have
emergent space, as we'll be talked about in later sessions, that's just like one,
one quick remark to make. At the end of the day, though,
even if it's topological, we're going to have real degrees of freedom that
this QRF is attached to, this cone-cocoon diagram. And you're going to have measurement
operators that yield classical outcomes, plus and minus one. And then you can think of this
QRF, or more abstractly, this cone-cocoon diagram as a neural network, if you wish,
acting on those boundary qubits. And then back propagating some sort of action signal preparation.
Okay, then let's not forget that Landau's principle and so on requires that we are mindful of energy
constraints on computation. And that gives us the following picture. Number one, we're going to have to
use energy from the environment to fuel our computation, to fuel our observation.
That means that right away, you cannot use the entirety of your boundary to gather information.
It necessitates an allocation of resources. Here, E is the observed environment,
and the blue portion is a thermo- dynamical sector, where you extract free energy and
heat in order to run this computational process. And then furthermore, you can have
a memory sector where you write things on the boundary. And this takes up energy also,
writing information onto the boundary by Landau's principle. We'll take up information.
And Chris called this the minimal interest in observer because it has a memory sector.
And why minimal here implies that we have at least a minimal interest thing implies that we have
more than one layer. Here, the process of writing things into a memory sector
requires us to have a clock so that we can label those memories in time. So we do have
time as part of this formalism, just not space yet. Time has to be internal to the observer.
Just one piece on that that Chris mentioned. And as you echoed, time here is an attribute of
some cognitive systems in terms of their internal understanding so that they can sort
memories and understand what came earlier or later. It's not something that's a priori defined
externally, which is the case in the kind of space time first. Now, how do we fit communication
into here? We flip that, we're talking about the topology of communication as ontologically primal.
And now certain kinds of sophisticated agents, it's not like necessarily true of rock or a metronome
or a particle of a gas, but some kinds of cognitive systems are such that they are able to generate
an internal clock concept. And that doesn't have to be the same thing as what's happening on the
wall with Kronos. This can reflect a purely internal time, Kairos, that enables observers or
interactors that have different clock structures. And then Landauer's principle helps us arbitrage
or connect the informational demands to the energetic or the metabolic demands. Dean?
So when I first listened to the lecture, I thought when the term or phrase trade-off
was raised, I traditionally have thought of trade-off as kind of a binary. If I'm picking this,
I'm trading off against all the other things that I didn't pick. So one or the other,
or others plural. But when I saw this, and especially when I heard it in the context of
things like degrees of freedom, I began to wonder whether it is, because it could sit on either
side of that boundary, it could be a priori, or it could be ad hoc or post hoc, a trade-off.
Which, prior to this conversation, I just assumed that a trade-off was one or the other.
But essentially what this implies is it isn't even, it's still a kind of a degree of
how much weight you put into it. And then you kind of cross a threshold and then you've made
your pick. You've completed your trade-off. Or did I, again, did I misinterpret what I was hearing,
if it's topological, as opposed to the more conventional space-time perspective?
Is this, can a trade-off be both ad hoc and post hoc, seemingly at the same time?
Very interesting question. Let us just let it float and continue on, Andrew.
All right, because maybe, because again, if it's, if it, I'll just say this, if it can be,
that would really move us out of the classical realm. That would essentially say that anytime
we've made a pick, we really haven't made a pick. There's still a whole bunch of other things that
are going to happen that can change whatever that action is that we thought we carried out
or enacted. If we're talking about an internality state, which is what I think we want, I think
we want to be able to change our minds. Let me take that one way, Dean. The analytical equations
of the action perception loop don't tell us in implementation, like if we're going to write it
in code, whether we should use action first procedurally to update our observations,
or whether we enable our observations to, to wag the dog and then select action at the end of the
loop. So is it a perception action loop or is it an action perception loop? And those enable
a kind of seesaw where sometimes we want what we learn to change what we do. And other times,
we want what we do to change what we learn. And having that kind of a fulcrum or a pivot,
and again, to connect it to the vertex popping in and out, the analytical formalisms inscribed
on the screen of the FEP, like the textbooks, they're ambiguous, whether we lead with action
and have inference follow, or whether we lead with inference and have action follow, or, or
so lead with action have inference follow, whichever one of the combinations there are.
Because we, and then the that trade off or runoff is broken by specific embodied cognitive agents
that that trade off about the the procedural primacy of perception or action
can't be broken generically, right?
It certainly makes for a lot of waste heat, if you're not careful.
It'd be exhausting a lot anyway.
Okay, so, so I see, I don't know if we can talk a lot
intent much with this formalism, but we can take a very descriptive approach to it. And
go down here a little more. Actually, before I don't want to get ahead of myself, what I mean by that is
whether we can put intent or not in this hierarchy, I don't know, I don't know if it
matters a whole lot, but at least we can talk about it, you know, operationally and descriptively
and and say just like when you have a clock,
you know, that the clock is just there, right? Like it is, if you don't have the clock, you
don't have the memory and that's it, right? And likewise here, if we don't have attention
and attention control compartment, we just cannot have, we cannot play with all these
QRFs that are non-commutative at the same time. So, if there is no attention control system to begin
with, we don't, we cannot talk about a system that has non-commutative QRFs, meaning here one,
one presumably goes to memory sectors, the other one goes to environment sectors and so on. So,
so this is certainly a necessity of the fact that we have different sectors of the boundary being
allocated to different purposes, such as environmental observation and memory and so on.
Within the environment, it was, it's worth remarking that here, if you think deeply about first
principles and what it means to observe an entity, well, you still come down to these
differences that make a difference sort of thing, right, which involves whenever you're
looking at the environment to, if you're going to identify a system, you need sort of a background
that tells you that puts the system in context, right, so that you can identify the system as
something distinct. I think this again is something that we have talked about in previous
discussions, where the easiest picture here is something like the gauge, speed gauge in your car,
where the P is the gauge itself, it tells you the speed, but it's meaningless without the
reference system, right, outside of the thing that stays invariant, right, the context, the background,
that gauge moving means nothing to you, okay, so come back to this idea of if we think of
information as differences that make a difference, in terms of first principles,
this environment sector that we saw earlier has to be further broken down into pointer and reference
states. Again, this is covered in that, in Chris's papers, I'm thinking particularly of
free energy for generating quantum systems.
And again, just to reiterate, this attention controls that compartment, which is, by the way,
very reminiscent to the hierarchy that was earlier with the clock arising higher up in
the hierarchy, deeper into the layer, likewise whenever we have, so whenever you're writing something
into a memory, you need to have that clock, whenever you are deploying non-committative
QRFs, you're going to need attention, an attention control compartment, and we just described this
operationally, if you didn't have it, then the agent would not be what it is, it could not
deploy those non-committative QRFs. So marching on, we'll just end here with the QRF alignment
and the free energy principle, just a few more words. This is possibly the most interesting
picture in this presentation, and just we can recall here the possibilities for QRF alignment and how
free energy comes into play in this formalism. We call A the trivial interaction, we call this
a thermal interaction, and then you have a bunch of possibilities, and depending on each
possibility, you're going to see things as notes or as in the paper says, non-local variables.
The last situation is what we call alignment, when we have QRFs of the same size, perfectly
aligned. So I can't quite recall, I think this
this would be the situation where you have a noiseless classical computation, right?
You have A and B just interacting, and also this is the situation where
correct me if I'm wrong, Daniel, this is entanglement, asymptotically,
once all the QRFs are aligned, you have entanglement. And now we can tie it back maybe
to gains earlier, so these two slides conclude the discussion basically, and then we can open it up.
So given these possibilities for how QRFs can be aligned, QRFs deployed by A and B can be aligned,
and how in each situation you're going to get noise or whatever,
then what does the free energy principle say in this quantum setting? Well,
minimizing variational free energy leads you to entanglement. So if you're in the picture of
B here, and the QRFs are aligned, A and B are going to be entangled.
Now there is a tension between this tendency towards alignment, as the free energy principle
will carry you, and observe reality, which is that we're not just a blob of entangled particles,
there is separability, and systems are attention between maintaining separability,
and at the same time being correlated enough to the environment,
which has to be able to predict it, and now we can maybe go into a more philosophical discussion
on the free energy principle. I should also say in the last month, just like I talked earlier,
a lady is asking whose recent paper that talks about gravity, it led me into a rabbit hole of
looking into his recent work, and he's talked a lot about complexity. I'm being very speculative here,
so if someone can pull me out, that would be good in the comments, but just to skim
me through some of his papers, I saw a monograph in 2018, where he talks about complexity,
you know, he puts forward the second level of complexity in quantum systems, and increased
complexity, and it is very reminiscent of what's going on here. You have a tension between
systems, standing to entanglement, and the other side of the free energy function,
if you wish, where systems increase in complexity, and that necessarily requires
that AMB are separate. So Daniel, do you have any comments at this point?
Yeah, there's a lot to it. I like that you showed the four possibilities
in the image above, and said it was one of the most interesting figures. I agree, and
how to connect this to the classical FEP, and also how to see the quantum FEP
not as just a second story built on top of the classical FEP, which would be kind of like a
historical chronological understanding of the theoretical apparatus, but it's almost like
the quantum FEP was like a basement we didn't know about, because it gives a broader context,
and though it appeared conceptually several years later in the timeline we understand,
that doesn't give it a secondary status. So what it really means for the classical FEP
to be kind of like a special case of this actually more generic setting, there's just a lot, I'm
very uncertain about it. I can wrap it up, and then if Dean or you want to say something,
we can continue with that, but let me conclude, and this is all I have to say for today,
I think, I'm sure Chris will explain this more in coming sessions and lectures, but I think the
main key differences isn't the emergence of space, how it might emerge from something more
fundamental, maybe a sense of network or who knows, but that's the big difference, and I suppose
the quantum free energy principle generalizes the classical free energy principle, because he
doesn't have this spatial embedding. Now this, to me personally and also to folks in the audience
for asking questions, is probably the hardest part to wrap your head around, and I foresee
interest in those discussions and lectures that deal with the concept of emergent space,
because every time you try to, and I've done this myself, I've been thinking about how you could
apply this formalism to better known pictures or compare it, for instance with thermal
equilibrium, with relaxation with thermal equilibrium, and then you start thinking about,
okay, what is the boundary and so on, it's far from obvious, because again, you have to
remind yourself that the definition is topological, so in that regard, I think it might be worth
talking about one of the questions that came up that I thought was good,
and then I can call it a day on this end.
So this question, and I think it was the first question asked since the last lecture.
Can you just read the full question, and then read the full answer, thank you.
The question on the answer, it's number 28 here, can you guys see it? Should I zoom in a little bit?
It's pretty small, but reading it will be good.
Okay, so this question I think, I fast myself this question to, maybe in a different way,
but basically it gets to the point of what I was saying earlier, that it would be nice to see how
we can use this quantum free energy principle formalism to recover maybe familiar settings,
such as relaxation to thermal equilibrium, the equation, but that's far from obvious how you
do it if your definition is topological. So the question says, what happens when the agent
becomes identical to the environment, when the model has been improved so much that it does
not differ from the environment? Is this a stadium impossible, would it be thermo-equilibrium,
maximum entanglement? Okay, so clearly it's not thermo-equilibrium, but I think what the person
is asking if I'm maybe, if I'm understanding this correctly, they're wondering, okay, so if the free
energy principle drives AMB towards entanglement, then it's referred to say that they have
that any distinction between them has dissolved, right, that they have merged into the same thing,
and that has to do with this whole definition of philosophical debate of thingness that Carl
Christen, you know, is a proponent of, right, what it means for two things to be separate, okay,
so let's see what Chris said.
Chris has pointed out that the limit of the classical FEP, the limit of perfect prediction,
corresponds to general synchrony between system and environment, each sense messages
that the other can perfectly predict. Now, however, it's clear, and I'm not reading anymore,
I'm making a quick remark here, I'll continue in a second. In the classical FEP, it's clear
that AMB, even if they are, you know, in the perfect limit of the FEP, they remain
different, different entities, right, because you have that, if you wish, that extra
layers of differentiation coming from their spatial embedding, right, in the classical FEP,
that is clear, that they haven't, even if they are getting synchronized, they have not lost
their separate identities, you can always say, well, this is the one that was to the left,
and this is the one that was to the right, pun intended with earlier discussion, right,
you have that extra resource for separating them, if you wish, by virtue of the spatial
embedding, right, the spatial embedding is giving you this extra information that
allows you to keep track of AMB separately. Okay, so I'll continue, this notion depends
on the system and its environment being separated and has distinguished somehow,
in classical formulations, they are separated in ordinary 3D space, i.e. they occupy different
locations, so they are different because they occupy different locations, right, but if you
don't have that geometrical background, then how do you know that they're different, right?
Okay, so I continue, the quantum formulation is background free, meaning it assumes no
spatial embedding, system and environment do not have different locations, even though they have
different sets of degrees of freedom in the overall Hilbert space. Here the FEP,
the limit of the FEP is maximum entanglement, this does not mean that the system and its
environment are identical, they are, and since they have different degrees of freedom, okay,
so this is just addressed as the question I just posed, it means that their joint state
is not separable, okay, into a system S and environment T, their states are no longer
conditionally independent, this is distinct from thermal equilibrium, which means that they have
the same temperature while remaining separable, and that their interaction can be characterized
as the change of thermal fluctuations, i.e. noise. So I guess this is a nice format for things that
are to come, but I do think that this whole idea of emergent space is going to be possibly, you
know, one of the most important in the course. I'm just going to help you stick out between the
class and the quantum formulations for sure. Dean, what's your take on this? What I saw was that
when you have that kind of alignment, that perfect alignment, that is one, that was one,
that was D in that diagram, right, that was one state of a complex state that included an A and
a B and a C and probably a whole bunch of other ways that, yeah, right, so that one state where
you've got this kind of entanglement isn't into perpetuity, like you don't get there and then
stay there, and that's where I think the question of separability and complexity,
it still works, because just because you've momentarily gotten to a place that we define
here as D, doesn't mean you stay there indefinitely. You could be swapping around to B and C and A
in the next instant. So at least that holds the complexity piece up. That moment, for however
long that moment is, where X, A, and X, B are aligned, isn't permanent. So it's not predictable
in that sense. Therefore, it is complex. I still don't know how we get, though, that the closer we
get to agreement, the more complex things are, unless we're just talking about D in this array
of A, B, C, and D. That goes back to that quantum reference frame. I think, like I said, again,
maybe I'm interpreting this wrong, but when I message pass, the reason why I have to, like,
literally give it over to the other person and let them have it, I can't give them, have them copy
what I'm doing is because there has to be, I guess that reinforces the separability piece of this
as well. The fact that I can't give them a copy that I can only give them the information, and
then they've got to sort of unpack it in their own way of taking it off the boundary. But again,
I struggle with this. I'm guilty as charged. But I am, what I'm trying to do is trying to come up
with my own narrative so that what Chris is saying makes sense to me, as opposed to make sense to the
world, which is what Chris is trying to do. I'll try with another speculative fiction. So
there's a screen between, let's just say, the stage in the audience or whatever. It's a holographic
screen. And on each side of the screen, there's some embodied object. So that means that it must
have, it's a volume enclosing object, because points and lines and planes are only abstractions.
Every real physical object encloses volume. And now a light is going to be coming from behind
each object facing the screen. And that's this kind of cone that we're seeing from each side.
It's like the shadow cast by the object. So if the object was a sphere, then it would be projecting
down to a circle onto the screen. If the shape were a cube, it could be projecting down. And so
where the light is positioned is the perspective that that cognitive entity is taking on its
QRF. Those lights could move. So now we have this situation where the two spotlights are moving.
Maybe the shapes are staying the same. Maybe they're changing too. And it's like two searchlights
scanning across this B oval. And sometimes they are perfectly locked. I mean, there could be a
situation where they're perfectly aligned. Or there could be situations where they're totally
disjoint. And each of those situations have different implications for what one entity
sees when it looks at the screen. Maybe like the shadow is the only part where you can see,
because the rest of it is too blinding or something like that. And so then if we're in case A here,
where maybe B doesn't have a projection or maybe B's projections totally somewhere else,
then A is in this solipsistic, I'm the active agent interacting within an inert world setting.
And D is like potentially the computer engineer's classical dream or asymptote,
which is like all the data going through the USB cable is just being perfectly noiselessly
received. And then we also get these B and C cases. But A is kind of like the inert world.
D is like the perfect communication channel and then to connect it just to Friston's concept
of generalized synchrony. As we've talked about many times, generalized synchrony doesn't mean
lockstep. Two agents could reduce their uncertainty about each other, not by doing the same thing
at every time step, but for example, by turn taking. And I think that points the way to how we get
reduction of variational free energy, reduction of prediction error, surprise and so on,
without especially spatial temporal enmeshment, but not necessarily even
informational identity enmeshments, because you could have two things that through their alignment
become actually differentiated. And that could increase the mutual information between two
metronomes, not just to have them going in the same direction, but to have them going in opposite
directions. The mutual information in those two settings is going to be high. So it's not the
case that generalized synchrony means that things are becoming blurred. We could actually also have
integrated information through increased articulation, not just decreased. And then
life finds a way or cognition finds a way on this tradeoff frontier of in our pursuit of
unitarity. Will we blur to unify? Or will we differentiate to unify? But those are the paths
we have. We don't have the backwards ratchet. Yeah, yeah, makes sense.
Any other ladder slides, Andrew?
No, that's it. So Chris made a few more remarks at the end of a language here.
But he mentioned that he's going to talk more about this in the coming lecture. So we'll just
do it after him. Yeah, there could be some very powerful and interesting linguistic opportunities
for updating our speaking to reflect what we are learning here. I don't know what those necessarily
are. Whether it's a syntactic or a semantic thing, or whether it's a narrative thing,
but how to actually re enter some of these formalisms into our focus understanding could just be
immensely powerful. And we could have a lot of integrity between the natural language way that
potentially we're already showing up for engagement, and some of these formalisms
that get to first principles about interacting entities and boundary conditions and all of that.
Dean, any penultimate thoughts? Not really. I'm going to go back and listen to Chris's comments
again about this common cause and the fine tuning assumption and whether that's a metaphorically
dialing in or what he means exactly by the fine tuning in the context of this conversation today.
What you just said about, are we dulling something here? Or are we sculpting something to make it
more fitable? I'm going to go on now and go back and listen to what he talks about in terms of fine
tuning and maybe update my priors around that. And are any last thoughts or maybe scroll over to
the schedule of the course again just so we can close on that? Yeah, we're halfway through. We
just completed the third discussion section now. So we've had three lectures and three discussions.
It's all downhill from here. By the way, this was the first midterm. You guys both did well.
We're going to head into session four with these last three. How agents use multiple
communication channels and that's going to get connected to the quantum FEP. How spacetime
emerges from communication, which is something that we've brought up a bunch. It's been in the
background but making that explicit is going to be exciting. And then section six, I think is just
going to be such a jumping off point because the scope and the intensity of what is transpiring is
extreme. So connecting it to biology, which is to say life more fully and where we go in 23 and
beyond. That's going to be awesome. So any last words, Andrew? No, I'm just going to go with what
you said. I would say it's going to be uphill in terms of how interesting it's going to get.
Uphill in the good sense, meaning that we're climbing. Cool. Well, I encourage people to
check out the course website and submit questions that they'd like to see addressed
by Chris. Also to register and join these participatory discussions. There'll be three more
of them. So if you want to join, share your QRF, be part of the publication of all of these works
that we'll compile at the end and just get your exoskeleton in the game with what is happening
here. It'd be really awesome to hear more voices and to have more on board. Okay. Thank you, Dean
and Andrew. Till next time. Bye-bye.
