to copy or not to copy? That is the question from chimpanzees to the foundation of human
technological culture, recently appeared in physics of life reviews. Let me see if this
works. Yeah, sorry. So it all starts with a gypsal puzzle. And the puzzle is why a highly
innovative species like chimpanzees do not live in a complex technological world? So we know
chimpanzees are very inventive. They are very creative. They are insightful. They can learn
socially. But what we don't see in the same extent or similar extent we see in humans is the
accumulation of complexity across generations. So you can see here in these images, we have one of
the more complex and demanding tasks that chimpanzees perform, cracking nuts open, and they
can combine different tools. They can use it in the appropriate order. So this means they are very
insightful. And yet, if we compare it with a rocket that can bring civilization to Mars,
it is clear that accumulation of technology across generations works very differently in humans
and other non-human species. So the basic question or the one million dollars question is why does
innovation fail to translate into technological cumulative complexity in chimpanzees? Does it
owe to a limited capacity to copy with fidelity? Or what we referred as true imitation, which means
reproducing not only the end result that would be emulating or emulation, but also the steps that
lead to that end result. So according to this view, failure to copy innovation with faithful
accuracy hampers their intra and intergenerational spread and any ensuing ratcheting up effects.
So possibly when copying with fidelity is impeded, innovative performances are unlikely to lift their
protagonist. And this brings us back to the discussion we had the other day in The Snakes
on Ladder's Paper, where we said that after two million years ago, Iriomo produced this
almond sheen with faceli flaked stones. But these kind of artifacts that we don't even
dare to call them tools were not copied by conspecific observers, because perhaps they
were not attributing to them any kind of functional use. So perhaps they were not seen as tools,
and were the result of manual inactions. So to ratchet up complexity, it is important that
inventions, that these tools are copied with sufficient fidelity so that they retain the
fundamental features or attributes that make them functional. So following the steps of demonstrated
tool manufactured by an expert model to the letter is the simplest, fastest and cheapest
way to make sure that copies of the original artifact are accurate. And here cheapest we
refer to in terms of expenditure of energy. So if the copies are functional, hence useful,
they keep circulating in the group community longer. And these skills increase the opportunities
for one or more individuals different from the original inventor to add in complexity.
So for example, one individual invents a buddhist spur, and 100 years later, the smelting of
copper is discovered, and another individual adds to it, to this spur, a sharp copper point, and so on.
So here is an interesting concept of ratchet effect, that buddhist explaining part why humans
have built such complex cultural and technological work. So the idea of the ratchet effect is that
no generation starts from scratch. Instead, inventions and cultural products created by
one generation are kept in mind and transmitted to the next generation. This way, every generation
is better off, supposedly, than the one that preceded it. So here we can think of books,
books are a wonderful way of keeping information, sharing it across generations, and among the
same generation also. So thus technological complexity and success in humans is not dependent
solely on the geniality of one or few individuals. It is a joint endeavor where many individuals
contribute their specific expertise and skills to produce increasingly complex artifacts. And again,
we can think in establishing a colony in Mars, no single human alive could achieve that alone,
or we have the required expertise to achieve that alone. But all together, we can perhaps
manage that. So we need this kind of shared knowledge and accumulated across generations, of course.
So why it is some behavior or innovation are copied or not can be explained at the level of
social dynamics, but also at the level of the brain, or giving a more mechanistic explanation.
Explanations why copying of certain behavior in chimpanzees does not occur with frequency have
been often kept at the level of social dynamics, where factors such as social prestige, dominance,
etc. are set to be key to explaining whether or not an innovation is adopted by observers.
And this is a problem against the brain to a subsidiary role. Here, Michael and I will
be attending to identify what the minimum cognitive requirements are that can give rise
to innovations and their horizontal and vertical transmission. And we also attempted to differentiate
the cognitive ingredients necessary for innovation from those that need to be in place for the adoption
of an innovation. So we wanted to establish a clear demarcation between the brains of the
ones that innovate and the brains of those who observe an innovation, because we think this
is important to be analyzed separately. So in order to see which are the mechanisms
at the level of the brain that would allow for one innovation to be copied, we invoked the lens of
the free energy principle. According to active inference under the free energy principle,
it is through there being limited to a restricted number of states, that is the attracting set,
that organisms minimize the variational free energy of the internal states and resist entropic
dissipation. Minimizing variation of free energy reduces prediction sensation discrepancies,
prediction errors, that can be corrected by active sampling of predicted sensory inputs
and perceptive modification of predictions. This is sometimes expressed in terms of perceptual
inference, that is changing predictions to more sensations, and active inference,
reactively changing sensations to much predictions.
So innovation in a way might represent potential misfireings from a Darwinian perspective.
So minimizing variational free energy can be achieved through action, sending creatures
can act, active inference in order to fulfill their predictions, and thereby reduce discrepancy
between the latter and sample reality. Being limited to a restricted number of states,
what we could refer to as the attracting set, is therefore synonymous with minimizing variational
free energy and hence maximizing adaptive fitness. Here innovation represents an anomaly,
and innovators are unorthodox actors or protagonists who entertain new courses of
action or plans, new phenotypical responses that have not been previously entertained.
And according to this interpretation of the free energy principle,
it is at the level of policy selection where innovators stand apart from the crowd.
Their policy selection is in a sense faulty insofar as their ensuing behavioral outcomes are in
more contrast to those of their fellow actors, who deploy orthodox responses that reduce discrepancies
between predictions and sensations, thereby reducing the prediction error. Here when we talk
of misfireings, we don't do it in a kind of negative sense, it's just to express that
these new behaviors, these innovations necessarily will produce more surprise.
Okay, since utilizing things with this phrase, I am kind of paraphrasing Andy Clark in a paper
in Behavioral and Brain Sciences. He referred to seeing surprising things to being able to lend
credibility to the sensory information that is not in accordance to prior beliefs.
So the family of priority density is entertained by an individual irrestricted to the systems,
the brains prior by some beliefs, equivalent, roughly speaking, to its phenotypical repertoire.
This means by definition that innovative behaviors both are likely to be imposed in any given phenotype
and, crucially, difficult to recognize when observed by another.
Should an innovator's behavior diverge markedly from the repertoire plausible policies used
usually by an observer to predict another's behavior, it may be beyond the capacity of
the latter's generative model to recognize it, that is, to make sense of it. So large discrepancies
pose a threat to the brain, because one, updating involves making energetic demands,
and two, risk-reducing adaptive fitness by inappropriately changing the generative models.
And here we need to think that the generative model has been selected also in a specific
economy, so changing it might have risks. Okay.
So what is required for a brain to entertain generative models that involve unusual or bizarre
behaviors? The hierarchical predictive interpretation of the brain, or hierarchically
mechanistic mind, an inference machine, sorry, implies that each level of the hierarchy of
cerebral neuronal circuits conveys predictions or conditional expectations that suppress errors
at the level below, while concurrently conveying errors that permit the revision of the expectations
at the level above. Possibly, dynamical precision weighting enables the system that is the brain
to readjust the confidence afforded to top-down expectations as opposed to bottom-up prediction
errors. In other words, in order to entertain a prior data and likely hypothesis might explain
best some behavior within this, it is further necessary to relax the precision or commitment
to prior beliefs, thus enabling new or implausible hypotheses to explain novel behavior.
And here I introduce some things we discussed the other day, Professor Freiston talked of
attenuation of sensory information in relation to saccades, which is kind of switching of this
sensory information we are being aware of, and that would be the opposite as being impressionable.
So, I'm quoting Professor Freiston here. If I can copy, that means I am impressionable.
I will accumulate new evidence very quickly. I have the capacity to design great evidence
of precision to sensory evidence and suspend the precision to my prior beliefs.
This is something he mentioned in the last active inference recording, 53.1, 0.1.
And to end this introduction, one concept we introduced in our paper, which is central to
our discussion, is that of sounds of bounded surprises. So, this is a new concept we introduced
to refer to the levels of mismatch between prior beliefs or top-down predictions and sensory
information that a species can tolerate. So, first and foremost, the focus of the ZBS concept
is on the observers and their ability to make sense of unobserved innovation. Encoding and
subsequent copying of innovation depends on the degree of disparity or surprise between
predictable behaviors, namely those typical of the species and the perceptual incoming information
about novel behaviors. If the ZBS is white, it means that a species can give credit to the
information received through its senses that challenges the prior beliefs. In short, a species
can register, encode and potentially reproduce innovative behaviors of certain kinds of specifics
that deviate markedly from customary prototypical behaviors. The species is highly impressionable
if we use the words that Professor Friston used the other day. So, if the ZBS is narrow,
then a species' ability to change prior beliefs to accommodate new evidence
regarding innovative practices of serving on specifics is compromised.
I just want to end up and avoid any kind of misunderstanding. I want to make clear that
our sounds of bounded surprises have nothing to do with the sound of latent solutions by
Tenie, albeit we are discussing similar topics. So, the sound of latent solutions
that was introduced by Tenie, Kai and Tomo Aselo refers to solutions to a problem,
for instance, extractive foraging that can be achieved by an individual in isolation during
his or her lifetime and hence is not likely to be the product of cumulative culture involving
social learning when observed in the wild. And for those readers interested in this concept,
they can go to the original paper I'm showing here. And also, there is a recent paper by
Andrew Whiten, who is a professor inside Andrews, that discusses this concept and
that has replication by other authors. So, it might be a good update for those interested also.
And with that, I finish this short presentation and we can enter the discussion.
Let me stop sharing the screen, I think. Okay, now.
Thank you, Hector. I will bring up the notes again and to Michael, Carl or Dean,
whomever would like to provide a first response, please.
Well, I don't really have a great deal more to add, I think.
Hello? Yes, please continue.
What's happened here? You're all good, Michael.
We're here, Michael. Hello. Can you hear me?
Yes, we hear you continue. Yes, we can.
I'm not quite sure what's happened here. We seem to have snakes and ladders up on the screen.
As I said, I don't think I can add much more to what Hector has just said.
I think it makes a very succinct summary of our paper and I would like to
certainly congratulate Hector for making what seems to me a very original and perceptive
observation that it is the observers whom we have to thank for the copying and therefore
for the handing down of technological achievements by early humans,
whereas too often the emphasis has been made on the personal responsible for making a technological
innovation. But of course, unless somebody copies that, or at least it registers in the
mind of somebody else, it is unlikely ever to get copied. And although this seems to be a fairly
obvious observation, it seems to have escaped most of those who have published on the matter
either too. And I think this is a very original contribution on Hector's part which deserves
to be complimented. And really, that's all I wish to say. I think I'd like to throw this open to
other people. And if I can illuminate or elucidate any matters, I'm happy to do so. But I think
this is really very much to put it mildly, Hector's brainchild. And congratulations.
Thanks, Michael. You're very kind, but this is our child. And you know a lot. You have a lot to
contribute. So I mean, I can only learn school. But thank you anyway.
Awesome. Carl or Dean?
Go ahead, Carl.
Right. So I just wanted to reiterate Michael's admiration for both the idea, but also the very
fluent and clear articulation of it. It was nice for me to see that presented so succinctly,
because the clarity of the idea is really very evident. It struck me there were sort of two
themes that we could discuss, which is the emergence of more complicated solutions to
accurately engaging with and modeling our world. I think that was sort of a generic theme in the
first part of the presentation. But then very quickly we moved to this kernel idea, this core
idea, that the dissemination and the transgenerational propagation that could be read as some kind of
cultural niche construction in a sort of evo-devo context depends upon being able to recognize
a particular behavior and thereby copy and imitate. I think that was the key thing. And for me,
just understanding the mechanics of that from the point of view of belief updating and active
inference was, I think, a really useful thing. And as Hector beautifully articulated, the ability
to recognize something new and update one's generative model or posterior beliefs depends
very sensitively on the confidence or the precision that you've described, the sense of
evidence in relation to the precision with which you hold your prior belief. And I think that's
absolutely crucial. I sort of highlight that issue because it is exactly the same issue
that you will find when applying active inference and the free energy principle to
psychiatry and the different ways in which we can. I can't remember, Hector, what was your word,
misfire, in neither a good nor a bad sense, but certainly there are certain psychiatric
syndromes that could be regarded as misfiring. And of course there's a very close association with
innovation and creativity and manic depressive psychosis, famed in terms of various historical
figures in the arts. And that, I think, again brings us back to this key notion of getting that
balance, the balance of the precision of our prior constructs, what we have accrued through
experience-dependent learning and the precision afforded evidence that this is how the world is
actually working and how I am actually working, getting that balance right. And that's a really
difficult job. And sometimes in computational psychiatry, we try to explain this in terms
of a statistician. In order to get the balance right you have to be able to estimate these
precisions in the exactly the same spirit that a statistician, when making an inference doing a
t-test, has to estimate not just the difference in the group means, but also the standard error.
And it's often much more difficult to estimate the standard error than it is to estimate the
difference in the group means. And that standard error is the inverse precision. It's the weight
that you afford, the meaning, the significance of some quantitative difference, say a prediction
error. So you see this theme that there are two parts to inference. The first order part is just
the prediction error or the surprise. But then you have to assign how newsworthy is that. You have
to actually modulate that with its precision. So you can multiply by the precision or divide
by the standard error to get the actual thing that matters that's going to change your mind.
And there's a whole literature on different kinds of people in the context of neurodiversity
that I have an impairment in being able or possibly have an impairment in being able to
estimate that precision. And I'm thinking here of the poster child of this kind of formulation,
which is autism. And the idea being that there is an early developmental failure
to attenuate sensory precision. So they are perennially and continually during their early
development, severe autism, unable to ignore any of their sensations. And as a consequence,
everything is surprising, everything's arousing, everything is in danger of revising any beliefs
very, very quickly. So they're highly impressionable to the extent they can't build deeply coherent
models of their lived world or indeed the other artifacts such as mum that constitutes their
world. So I'm just wondering whether a species that has the same kind of latitude in terms of
either biasing attention or precision, the sensory evidence versus accumulated prior beliefs
would display the same kind of misfiring. So you can go from one end and autistic species
will be overly impressionable. It'll be too evolvable. It will be able to remember anything
from generation to generation. The converse is somebody who you can imagine from a psychiatric
perspective has committed unduly to very precise prior beliefs about the world works.
And you can think of this in terms of compulsive obsessional disorder or perhaps even depression.
The world is an awful place. That is true. Therefore, there's no point in going out
and challenging the evidence that the world is an awful place. So I'm just going to stay inside
and feel isolated and not move or say very much. So that would be an example of who somebody is not
very impressionable. In fact, their pathology, their misfiring prevents them from acquiring any
evidence through advisers beliefs. So if you imagine a species that had that same kind of
second order misfiring, this is not the misfiring of the inhibitors. So this is a
failure to infer the second order cystics, the reliability, the precision, the variance, the
entropy of the content of the things they try to innovate or make sense of. You're left with this
notion of a species that just cannot respond to selective pressures for selectability.
They can't respond by adjusting their evolvability simply because they're fixed in their way. So
for the environmental and economic changes in any fundamental way, they're not going to be able to
respond to that. So I think there are many examples of this key.
If you like, yes, I think it would be called a pathology in the sense that in a volatile environment
you would need to optimize the precision afforded sensory evidence in order to make the best sense
and understand and engage with that environment. And if you get that wrong, there will be a pathology.
And I think basically Hector's formulation really drills down and really focuses on the
actual mechanism of this kind of pathology. It's all about the transcultural spread
of generative morals and sense-making in terms of engaging either with artifacts or indeed
with conspecifics. And I repeat, it's such an easy thing to get wrong.
As evinced in psychiatry, there are so many instances of
neurodiversity expressed clinically that I think reflects this singular dimension
in terms of the ability to get that balance right. I remember we discussed last time again in terms
of impressionability and selection for selectability and the like, the same kind of mechanism
unfolding in terms of evolutionary mechanics. But at the level that I think we're talking about
today in terms of pursuing plans and novel ways of doing things that may or may not be
recognized due to a failure or not of being able to suspend the precision or pribelies,
I think that was a central theme. I'll just close with an interesting comment that
in terms of the kind of misfiring that Hector was implying, basically a novel way of doing things,
being the unique province of those kinds of creatures that can plant possibly deeper into
the future. There's a really interesting sort of link back to this precision notion
in the sense that if you try to simulate the depth of planning of any sentient artifact,
then the degree to which they are able to look into the future depends upon the precision
of their beliefs about the succession of contingencies. What will happen if this happens
and then what will happen if that happens? It's technically the precision of the transitions
amongst worldly states of affairs as you roll out into the future. Again, you have to estimate
that precision. There's another point at which precision gets into the game, but in this instance,
it's not the precision of the sensory evidence, but the prior precision about the ways things
unfold and what will happen if I do that. If you have a low precision there, then you don't
come very far into the future because you lose certainty and confidence very, very quickly
after just a few moves. Whereas if you have very precise beliefs about the state transitions and
the consequences of various actions or sequential policies, then you can roll out confidently much
further into the future and perhaps find that innovative solution. Again, you come back mechanistically
to phenotypes that have differing degrees of precision. In this instance, get into the game
in terms of bounding the depth of the planning or the temple horizons that you can entertain
when scoring different plans in order to actually select the best action at the moment.
For me, that insight is really useful because I can see how one could simulate that quite easily
in toy situations. Those are my thoughts inspired by Hector's excellent presentation.
Thank you, Carl. Dean, what say you?
Well, if it's okay, I'd like to step back for a second. Because we were privileged to be able
to look at the two papers almost simultaneously, I know chronologically we've split it up into
weeks, but all the readers, we were able to kind of look at both papers side by each.
I kind of want to take a bit of a Hofstetter strange loop, two-sided condition, Mobius. We've
got all those representations in a lot of our live stream introductions. So if we were to
assume that, because Carl pointed out, not everybody can accommodate a two things at once
perspective. If we can assume that that doesn't overwhelm, my question to the authors is,
do they see their own journey as a one paper or artifact morphing into the next? Or, and as
we were pulled out and taken up by this relationship between epistemic and pragmatic values
when uptaking an active inference perspective? That's part one of the question. Part two is
the former is kind of a sequential mechanical technical side of things. The latter is the
combinatorial plus meaning entailed and entangled. So more more where am I relative? So
combined, that's a relative depth of field as setting as establishing morphing. We want to
call that. As active inference strategy is applied, how do the authors see or potentially see this
perspective combining, meaning the sequential and or the combinatorial affecting, not effecting,
but affecting what we believe? Because I'm a big believer that we can't just sort of strip the
feelings part of this out. I think that's whether we're talking chimpanzees or whether we're talking
the emotions of sliding down a snake. Those are, those are, are part of this thing that we're looking
at. I'll just give one short note on that. In the paper, sophisticated affective inference,
they simulated counterfactual futures projections about futures, which are inactive inference,
action oriented, all futures are analyzed and inferred about with respect to policy selection
by the agents. And one of the patterns already apparent in even the simple simulations were that
even if a very small fraction of counterfactuals have like death as an outcome or highly negative
outcomes, it can increase the variance estimator on possible futures greatly, leading to essentially
ruminative behavior and affective anxiety around the legitimately warranted variance in possible
outcomes. So I see a key piece of this puzzle to be entertaining progressively wider time cones
of possible futures in a prospective capacity and entertaining progressively wider time cones
in the past of causal mechanisms and somehow negotiating that affect
barometer in the moment as the eye of the needle.
Hector, Michael, where do you see affect coming into the snakes and ladders to copy and not to copy
set? Well, may I make one or two comments? First of all, in addition to what Professor
Fiston has told us about autism and so on, I think it's worth mentioning in the connection
of the question that Daniel has just raised to say that there is clearly a difference in the
evolution during the life cycle of early humans on the one hand and great apes and probably most
human forerunners on the other. The extension of the human life cycle, the extension beyond
childhood and in particular, as I mentioned last time, the adolescent growth spur to which we have
but which may not have existed in early Homo even one and a half million years ago,
I'm sure is relevant to making the evolutionary step between, let us say,
the surprise that perhaps a chimpanzee has if she observes a dead bird and then regards this as
counterintuitive because birds ought not to be lying on the ground, throws it up into the air,
but this is an individual spontaneous reaction which is not handed on as part of a behavioral
repertoire of the species and on the other hand, when we begin to see the reproduction of,
as it were, counterintuitive behavioral sequences such as taking a lot of flakes repetitively
by hand from a piece of stone using another stone to produce an almond-shaped hand axe
fairly regularly flaked on both sides, something which is not found before Homo appears
in the archaeological and paleoanthropological record, but which is not something that seems to be
a regular part of human behavior. It is almost as if the individual who made that
was doing it as a kind of spontaneous thought of what might happen if I was to do this,
part of the deep generation of the hierarchically mechanistic mind which Professor Fiston has
told us about. A deep generation that, however, may have been a misfiring. It may have been simply
a personal spontaneous event which is not easily recognized by others, particularly if their,
shall we say to put it mildly, their mental development is stunted due to the early
adulthood and the lack of any adolescence. Adolescence in particular, which and of course
the development of the neuronal architecture of the brain, which in modern people continues until
our mid-20s, if this was not to have occurred, as it does not of course in evening gray tapes,
then there would have been perhaps a problem here about the deep generative potential of an
individual ever being recognized such that it isn't just what might happen if I was to do this
with a piece of stone, but what might happen if I was to copy what that other individual is doing
with a piece of stone. And this I think is the stumbling block. This is what has led to the
snakes and ladders picture. It is what I think has led to the very slow adaptation of technological,
cumulative technological, handing down from between generations or between individuals
of a generation and between generations. And it may well have been the case that it was not until
then demographical, as well of course as paleobiological changes had evolved in
the Guinness Homo that there was sufficient intercourse, not merely sexual but social,
such that these questions continue to be asked ever more frequently and with the appearance of
better and ever more fluent communication would allow what we now regard as human culture,
or specifically human nature, which I think has differentiated us ever more from the gray tapes.
Those are my thoughts on the matter.
Thank you, Michael. Karol or anyone else, please?
But I just speak to the question about affect and what Michael has just treated us to.
So one way of conceiving of affect and valence and the emotional aspects of
choosing different plans or making sense of my own bodily sensations is to think a little bit in
terms of precision estimation. So one way of carving, one way of a very generic way of thinking
about some negatively effectively charged states of mind would be those states of mind in which
there is irreducible or unresolvable uncertainty. So to put simply, to be uncertain about what is
going to happen to me or what I should do is to be in a state of angst and that can be
linked to notions such as anxiety and with some extra nuances, other feelings such as a low affect
and indeed if that is pervasive, a low mood or depression. But I think the key thing here,
and indeed many people have developed a calculus of emotion based upon whether
your average level of uncertainty is increasing or decreasing or is high and low and adding these
things together to get an ontology of emotional states from a purely sort of inference perspective.
There's another body of thought and literature which links emotions to the literally gut feelings
interception. So certain emotional states are just hypotheses about the way that I am feeling
now that best explain the myriad of extraceptive, intraceptive sensations. So I think there is
a mechanics of affect in certainly intraceptive inference and possibly more generally in terms of
active inference. However, there is another aspect of things that we, the feelings that we might
associate when we feel compelled to do things. And I'm thinking here not about the irreducible
or irresolvable uncertainty, but about uncertainty that can be resolved. I'm thinking here when Hector
mentioned Andy Clark's treatment of surprise, there is also the truism that we expect to be
surprised. And technically that lens, that can be explained in terms of the imperatives for
choosing those actions that will resolve uncertainty about the way the world works. So this is just
an expression of novelty. So if we anticipate, if we anticipate that we are going to be surprised
by some outcome, what we are saying is that that outcome is going to be informative and that it
will reduce some uncertainty. Technically it has a high expected information gain. So I'm speaking
here as a statistician and using terms that would underlie the Bayesian principle's optimal
experimental design that we do these experiments specifically in order to get surprising outcomes
that are by definition going to resolve my uncertainty about my different hypotheses.
So if we think about the misfires that are innovations, these are effectively by definition
novel behaviors. And the fact that people or certain people in certain regions
engage in novelty seeking is entirely sensible from the point of view of the free energy principle
because novelty seeking just is an expression of curiosity. It is just an expression of choosing
those outcomes that are going to yield rich information that has technically a high self
information or an expected information gain. So this is another view of the, if you like,
the effective aspect that we do, we are compelled to expect ourselves and will possibly explain
ourselves as being excited in a positive way and the opportunity to resolve uncertainty
because we see an opportunity to do something novel. What is behind that door? What is inside
this present? What would happen if I did that? And that's an entirely natural and by natural,
I mean something that is easily naturalized under the physics of self-organization of any system
that has or entails an implicit generative model of the consequences of its own action.
So I thought it was a lovely link between that kind of
affect written into the imperative to seek novelty, to seek surprises in the future.
And what Michael was saying about, well, yes, in order to do that, you still have to suspend
your prior convictions, because if you a priori think you know everything,
there is no novelty, there is no imperative for exploration, and you just do the same thing
time and time again. But if you're, if you can recognize that there is reducible uncertainty
and choose those actions that have the greatest expected information gain,
then you will necessarily succumb to novelty seeking behavior and thereby discover those
misfire innovations. So, and it may be that, you know, the story that Michael was telling
was that we are built to be curious creatures for much longer. We are built to, you know,
to be able to respond to novelty and to find those innovative novel ways of behaving.
So that we remain, we retain that childlike curiosity as part of our epigenetic neuro
developmental programming for much longer than other species. So I think that matches very nicely
with the sort of the basic thesis that Hector was proposing during the presentation. It all
comes back to getting the precision of your prior beliefs right and suspending very precise
prior beliefs in order to explore hypotheses. And that exploration just is in terms of engaging
in novel innovative behaviors that will, that you know will resolve your uncertainty.
So if that's right, sort of engender the question, why is there an evolutionary pressure
for this kind of eternal childhood? So I want to ask Michael and Hector, because Michael certainly
brought in language and cultural niche construction. My guess would be that there will be a circular
causality between the cultural eco niche and the phenotypes that are trying to adapt to that
cultural eco niche such that they are required or the phenotypes that have the greatest adaptive
fitness are those that retain a greater curiosity in the context of the culture in which they find
themselves. And part of that will be necessary to actually understand the communication and the
signs and the semiotics afforded by their conspecifics which could be read just as language. So my
question is, does innovative tool use, does it emerge stochastically or at certain points along
with communication and language? Or are they not correlated? And if they are correlated in terms
of historically, what are their thinking about the direction of causality? Does the fact that you
remain curious and innovative for much longer lead to language that we can engage in novel
communicative behaviors? Or is it that we need to remain curious and open-minded in terms of
thinking about or entertaining novel plans and innovative plans simply because we have to
make sense of a world that is rich in information because there is language that has been culturally
inherited. Or is it both? Is a both top-down and bottom-up causation?
So two questions. Language, tool use and copying and the coupling between the sort of evolutionary
phylogenetic, sorry, the phylogetic and the sort of phenotypic levels when it comes to
things like language. Well, I wonder if I could come in here. Daniel, is it okay if I
address Carl's questions? Yes, in whatever order you like. Thank you. But in the first place,
there is a voluminous literature on the relationship between language and the origins of toolmaking
and tool use. Really, and there's a lot of unresolved argument about whether the two came
together very early in human evolution, let's say between one million and two million and one and
a half million years ago, as I originally thought some years ago, or whether in fact
languages we know it, or shall we say fluent communication at least, only developed much
later as I'm coming round to believe now and as Noam Chomsky has said for many, many years.
I don't want to get involved in that because really we would need two or three programs
and a lot of literature to compare and contrast. Rather, I would query whether we have
an eternal childhood. On the contrary, I think that physiological childhood
is slowed down and when the adolescent growth spurt arises after about the age of let's say
nine years old, sometimes or perhaps somewhat later at others, is when we see a major change
in behavior which is no longer childish, but neither is it adult. Of course,
we needn't go into that, we all know that adolescents can be very impetuous,
but they can also be extremely anxious and this brings us to the angst that Carl has mentioned
and which I certainly felt as an adolescent facing the weekly viva voce examinations in human
anatomy in the dissecting room, which in those days we all had to undergo, at least in the United
Kingdom, as I can show Carl remembers and which always brought me into a state of extreme nervousness
and has given me a lifelong worry about the lack of accuracy, let alone precision,
in anatomical description and identification and a concern with the statistical
variability in human anatomy or aspects of it, well anatomy in general is necessarily human
and its relation to process, in other words, to physiology and I feel myself much more,
despite having lectured in human anatomy, much more aligned to physiology and I spent some time
doing your physiological stuff many, many years ago, you know, at Oxford and Ingettingen,
then in the classification this has to be that way and as we were taught as medical students,
all of us think about the most obvious rather than the most obscure, but we have to have the
whole range before us and this brings in the whole problem of do we think in terms of
very right or wrong concrete facts about stuff in general or do we think in terms of the
statistical range of variability, whether it is in terms of occurrences, let's say related to
Poisson type distributions or to continuous variants which can be let's say related to
Gaussian type distributions and unfortunately it was only much later in life that I discovered that
in fact modern statistics allows these two approaches to be compared and contrasted
in a uniform manner. I didn't know that 50 years ago, alas, which shows my ignorance.
Still, I would come back to the whole business of the growth curve of humans. This clearly has
altered when we look at chimpanzees and other great apes. Basically they don't have much of
anything approaching our adolescence. They don't have this slowing down of growth
and then a recuperation of the velocity of growth combined with most important not nearly
anatomical and physiological changes but also those of the mind, the ability to innovate,
the ability to have lateral thinking or the ability which I have noticed in some
young people I've met with an Asperger's syndrome to be able to concentrate
in much great detail on particular matters which are extraordinarily arcane such as Sanskrit
literature in people that are not of a South Asian heritage whereas in dealing with other people,
other colleagues, they appear to be shall we say gauche and this is of course well known. However,
and indicates the range of variability, but it is the change which we all undergo in not
merely physical but also intellectual ability and inquisitiveness which can get us into trouble
when we are in adolescence and as young men and women given the
continual and continuous changes in our neuronal architecture at least until our
mid-20s these days which I think distinguishes and has distinguished the evolution of
Homo sapiens well Homo in general and Homo sapiens in particular but I wouldn't rule out Neanderthals
or even Homo erectus and which I think has been cumulative and undoubtedly although we have no
idea undoubtedly enhanced by increased excuse me and ever ever more complicated communication
during the the past probably half a million and certainly quarter of a million years.
Because this curiosity what would happen if we did this what would happen if we did that
but even so things are not rapidly grasped and we see that in different parts of the world
particularly in modern populations even that have been long separated from each other
not everything is developed at the same rate a couple of well-known examples are for example
the wheel which first appears probably on the Eurasian steps about 5000 years ago and was
used for traction and then appears quite independently in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica
about 2000 years ago and was not used even that would have been very useful but even anything as
simple as a wheelbarrow but simply to move around in your images whether they were dolls or toys
or gods with no idea and another one taken from the same two areas of the world is the metallurgy
of copper which appears about well perhaps over 6000 years ago in Eurasia and possibly
2000 years ago independently in the new world and yet other things happen too for example
in Australia we find modern people were making hand axes when these had long ceased to be made
by anybody outside your Australia some of them may even be only a few thousand years old
so this
appearance and disappearance and reappearance is something which has not gone away and must be
related somehow to our ability to for this deep generation of our inquisitiveness our curiosity
and indeed our ability to not to see the most obvious thing around us the desire to see
only one simple solution this which so irritated me when
my teachers in the in Hatterville department when I was a medical student believed that there was
only one right answer asked to how many heads this muscle had or which how many how many
vertically there were and this and all that part of the column that alone in the skull and we know
how very valuable these matters can be so there is this tension between the desire for things
to be seen in one light only in a one-dimensional way and our natural inquisitiveness this
deep deeply generated desire to say what would happen if it was like this
how is it how has it come to be like that why is everything different and not the same
I can't put it any other way with that I've said quite enough
so again this is for the authors this this has been really helpful to me as observers because
that's that's highlighted very clearly in the papers I see both papers speaking to something
that I would describe as conditions set meaning in the papers examples limit the game to the game
metaphor at least to this type where there's a limited number of tiles and a kind of a clear
continuation until a conclusion or recognize the limit of the species to not cracking
so there there's a there's a real clear idea and michael's and Hector both spoken to so what was the
what was the growth limit of the of the brain's capacity etc well I'm curious about and I and
I don't know if there's a Michael or Hector or have a real clear answer to this but I'm wondering
what and when was the was maybe the range of time that we see the unlocking or or or sort of
combinatorial explosion or not well what I guess what I'm asking is is is there a move
that we can clearly see as being something the differentiates playing which we know happens
in a lot of species and gaming because as I said at the end of 53.1 I wondered if it was going to be
game on and so I'm curious what the authors think about that is there a difference between playing
and gaming meaning that there's now an actual introduction of strategy in this um so maybe
another way of asking it is there a moment when you guys can point to it and say this was kind of
when we saw a a reducing or maybe a um relaxing of a of a limit forward world
I wonder whether in fact this difference is really quite as great as Dean suggests
and whether it may be have something to do with the ability in working memory and other aspects
of memory in dealing with or in developing uh logical mathematical ability to
plan or in planning and in communicating disability such that
the planning is no longer at an on an individual level but is participatory and therefore again
in other words um and perhaps Hector can answer this question but I would suggest that
this developed slowly gradually and by no means in a continual uh let alone a continuous manner
uh in homo uh but not in earlier uh in a way that it did not in earlier and other hominid species
do we see and this I would ask Hector do we really see um let us say uh well chimpanzees
or other great apes developing the kind of logical math ability to make very very simple
combinatorial associations between objects or behavioral activities and developing this
into a communal game which involves other individuals in the group because as Hector has
remarked on various occasions and informed me um when we see things like nut fat in small groups
of chimpanzees uh by no means um is copied by all of them uh let alone copied um or emulated by all
of them but uh and by no means even when it is with faithful accuracy and precision in the
manual operations as required so that I would ask Hector do we see these associations being
transformed into games? Okay that's a tricky question um
I mean what we know with chimpanzees is that they have promised to do these second organ
relationships which is like hierarchical um ordering of for instance if I have a set of
objects I can classify them attending to the color for instance chimps could do that okay if
only color is involved but I can classify them by color and shape so this is another order of
of hierarchy so I can pick things that are square and red and put them together so this ability to
abstract um a kind of ordering category so that I have relations of relations like in
analogical reasoning when I I can focus on one dimension or in another simultaneously so I can
shift my focus from one dimension to another in order to classify things this I think is
quite human like for instance the Wisconsin car sorting test so I can shift from one
dimension to another to classify objects or cards and this is something that chimps would
have more problems to do so they might classify in a first order categories like I put things that
have a same color they could learn to do that that wouldn't be a big problem but I guess they have to
use two dimensions together to classify the objects they would have more problems because
this involves considering more than one dimension simultaneously I'm not sure I'm making sense here
this is the Jonas Langer work that he did with with kids and that's a remarkable work that Jonas
Langer did and then there were these people in Rome I think it was Poti at the lab of
um Biopark and Rome that replicated that with um with chimpanzees I think it was a spinosci
who replicated it and found that chimpanzees were more compromised in order to have this kind of
classificatory relations of relations so and I think that's a very very remarkable ability that
that uh that we develop so I don't know if I answered your question Michael
perhaps that comparison of two dimensions color and shape and then the snakes and
ladders overlay that lets us take the hypotenuse is that abductive jump enabled developmentally
and neuroepigenetically by all of these different features which happen over much slower timescales
especially considering the actual millisecond timescale associated with recognition those
other changes are so much slower but the ability to move diagonally on the grid
through the rows and the columns and turn that into movement on a manifold
is the ability looked at from the either row or column perspective to move in both at once
but by condensing those two dimensions into one there can be new kinds of cognitive movements
and then applying that cognitivist lens also evolutionary transitions
even without the complex cumulative feedback with the eco-cultural niche merely in the
abductive moment and just one other piece I wanted to return to is that every
variable can have a precision estimator or not in the generative models and active inference
every variable can be fixed and so the model can just be persistently surprised with no updating
or one can have any kind of prior or hyper-prior and so on and that enables learning and that's what
enables not just estimation of the mean or the center of gravity the expectation of
but also the variance the whole distribution and then it's by applying that kind of precision on
everything view which as Michael brought up is exactly what modern statistics does
you can't do inference with a t-test unless you have the mean and the variance
won't go into any more details on the statistics but every variable has the center of gravity
mean estimator and the variance estimator and so we talked about precision on sensory information
the mapping between observations and hidden state estimates and then also there's this
action-oriented precision on how things will unfold and you might be able to update your
precision on sensory evidence by seeing something different but updating your precision on how things
will unfold is oriented around taking actions
Daniel you must have some questions I can't be the only one
floating questions and having my zone of doubt and surprise of being expanded here
I have um questions I can ask you a question or Michael or Hector or Carl please feel free
if you allow me I would like to pick up with something that professor please don't mention before
and that was kind of was intriguing because it is true that some great artists like Bangkok
and others were very creative and also I don't know if it's appropriate to say they were in the
verge of psychosis I don't know if it's appropriate because I don't have any statistics but I'm
thinking if being innovative is this again is misfiring so I would like to separate two things
one is how innovative you are and I'm thinking in the economy if you are well adapted to an
environment it's not a good idea that you try different things all the time because imagine
that you have some place where there are nice berries you have discovered a safe path to that place
and if you keep to that path you go to the berries you get there you feed so that's good for you
imagine you want to try something new so you are very innovative and one day you decide to try
another path to the berries a shortcut so you have one risk that you can face new dangers
because this path is new you don't know what is waiting for you there the other is you face
that you can get lost and then you could spend the energy you need to survive so in a way I don't
think that being innovative is good in itself but we have the risk if we are too conservative
that the environment changes and if the environment changes significantly we are not well adapted
because we don't have alternative behaviors that are adaptive to the new environment so I guess
with this happens like psychological traits nobody has extremes so we don't have people with
extreme psychological personalities I mean we have pathologies but the selection has favored
kind of intermediate levels so I guess and professor Friston can correct me on this he knows
more about psychopathology but I guess it happens with innovation that we need some kind of balance
and what this is doing for me is how humans escape that balance in terms of how they
manage to be creative and innovative at times because we are very we repeat many routines so
but still we can be very creative and we have selected so we have been successful enough to
our recognition and I'm just thinking in this counterfactual idea so I think this might have
played a major role the ability to have counterfactuals because perhaps instead of risking my life
every time I innovate I can rehearse what will happen and as professor Friston mentioned before
if I have a good precision I can imagine things that will unfold if the genetic model is very
deep I can think ahead many steps and see how I will fare in the future so I can kind of rehearse
things in my head before I put them into practice in the real world and this might help me to be
innovative but with a kind of bounded risk or controlled risk I don't know if this makes sense
but I think it must be some kind of balance between if I can rehearse things in my head I'm
very good and predicting things that will um evolve or unfold many steps ahead I can see
how I will fare and then I can risk to be innovative I don't know I mean I'm very I'm being very
speculative here okay so I just want to make clear that I'm being very speculative
please Cara yeah no I'd like to speak to that yeah I don't yes yeah you may be
speculating but I think those those observations are very very little and very and very useful
I mean you've brought a number of fundamental issues to the table first of all the importance
of being able to plan to have a genetic model and the consequences of actions is not the gift of
all species and in some instances um in your words when the environment doesn't change
that would be an undue complexity cost to carry around a brain with a genetic model
or the consequences of my actions if I don't need it if I was a virus or an insect I wouldn't I
wouldn't need that it would be um it would be very inefficient um so that sort of lens um
brings you to a picture that our world is sufficiently complex and changing at pace
the um committing to um very simple underly expressive genetic models is not an option
and one really important way of making the more expressive is to increase that temple
arise or temple death so that we can you know in accord with things like simulation theory roll out
into the future and and now um become the kind of phenotypes that can select among a number of
plausible policies um and you know I think that would be one bright line between lots of you
know different genres and different species you know that could be just um drawn on a dimension
which is just the depth of planning that my genetic model will support um and we've talked
previously about uh that being constrained by the precision afforded in a given context
my beliefs about how I would roll out into the into the future so I think that's just
you know from the from my perspective at least that's a really important observation that um the
depth of planning is a very important functional characteristic of the generative models that
are implicit in phenotypic behavior and possibly in terms of um what um what kinds of models are
subject to selective pressure at an evolutionary or indeed a you know an eva diva um at an eva diva
level um the other the other I think key insight that you um you bring to the table here um relates
to um what affords the right balance between novelty seeking exploratory behavior
um and the risks that that would entail and I think you know um that from a purely um sort
of mathematical point of view is a really important observation um just to sort of join the dots with
other ways of understanding how the universe works um that um particular question um is very
usefully framed in terms of constraints so the free energy principle that from which active
inference inherits is um one way of or is dual to um something called the maximum entropy principle
under constraints so this this was um brought to physics in the 20th century by um a foundational
thinker et james who basically rewrote physics in terms of probability theory and said that
basically everything that um of interest at least or physically um conforms to a constrained
maximum entropy principle so that actually is just a an expression um or a form um
for 10s the free energy principle in the sense that the constraints um in from the point of view
of free energy principle um are just what is brought to the table by a generative model um and um the
entropy um pertains to the entropy of belief so you've got this um this dialectic um simply at
the level of the physics of measurement and inference which means that I'm always trying to
explain any measurement in um such that my predictions are as accurate as possible but at
the same time um um leaving having the maximum of the attitude so that I don't over commit
in accordance with Occam's principle so mathematically what that means is the entropy of my beliefs has
to be as big as possible provided I provide provided I am an accurate um the given the constraint
that my account on my measurement has to be an accurate measurement so that that may sound if
you like completely unconnected to whether I choose to um wander away from the very path
um but in fact exactly the same maths applies to these quantities either the constrained entropy
or the variational free energy in the future and what happens is um you get exactly the same
dialectic you have two pressures on the one hand um to comply with Occam's um principle or Occam's
razor and on the other hand to um um to uh to uh keep all your options open um which in a sense
is exactly do I uh comply with the constraints um um that I know I'm going to get my barriers and I'm
not going to be eating my but myself by a predator or do I keep my options open and try that other
path so this this so dialectic is just bait into the physics of any self-organizing system
and practically um you know it emerges in a number of ways one way of writing down the free
energy or the constrained entropy from James's point of view expected given a particular policy
do I go down this path or that path um is in terms of ambiguity and risk to you're using exactly your
words you know uh so the risk is just the relative entropy or the divergence or discrepancy between
what I think will happen and what I expect to happen to me so I expect not to be eaten
and that's the key constraint at hand here there's not about rewards anymore we're throwing away the
notion of rewards and we're now replacing it with a multi-dimensional construct which is
all the constraints in the ways of being like having a certain temperature or not being very cold
or very hot not being eaten not being dead just keeping within my characteristic states
so you write down those characteristic states in terms of constraints and those constraints
basically preclude certain states of being and then I just compare well what will my states be
if I do this and how far away from um how far away uh is that anticipation from my prior constraints
and that literally is called risk it's the KL divergence between your policy dependent
predictive posterior and your prior preferences that have the constraints the other thing is
the ambiguity and that simply reduces to making sure that you make moves in a way that um
in underwrites a an unambiguous precise mapping between what you see and what caused your sensation
so you avoid dark rooms basically you avoid the dark you avoid dark aliens you you don't go
where you can't see what's happening so that's the ambiguity so together the expected free energy
is equal to risk plus ambiguity and when read like that then the balance between
the risk and the ambiguity or another way of carving this up is in terms of expected information
gain and expected cost or its complement expected value where the value is just the
how to what degree am I complying with my constraints um is um enables you to to now
write down the balance that resolves to a certain extent dissolves that dialectic
by the precision of your prior preferences your constraints so if you're the kind of creature
or child or insect um that has very precise beliefs about the kinds of outcomes I expect
to anticipate and I may have very precise beliefs about my body temperature for example but I may
have very less precise beliefs about where I am in terms of latitude I could be an
our bomber I could be a new custom London I can still be me but I can't be minus uh
your minus two degrees centigrade and still be me so some constraints are very precisely
specified and other constraints are less precisely specified so the risk is you know
is is determined by the precision of your prior beliefs about your characteristic states
the precision of the constraints you bring to the table as a phenotype and some of these will be
innate and completely sub-personal this wide into your home ostensis and some will be learnable
some may even be um sort of oppositional you know we can talk about them um but whatever
they have to be that because they define basically what kind of thing you think you are
and how you act act accordingly so the balance between the um you know whether to go down another
path as opposed to the very path is going to depend upon this particular creature of phenotype
and specifically the precision of their prior preferences in terms of what outcomes they would
a priori entertain and if they have very very precise preferences of not being eaten and
there's even a marginal small probability of being eaten if they stray from the current path
then they won't explore if on the other hand they have a slightly more liberal expectation
about being about the encounters with the predator for example and then there will be more
there will be more likely to engage in novelty seeking and exploratory behavior
so you know perhaps put this even more simply you know that this is the exploration exploitation
dilemma written in terms of the physics of self-organization under planning um and you know
and it all reduces again to precision and in this instance it's the precision of the constraints
that um articulated as the uh your prior preferences your characteristic states your
the kinds of states that you you know you are um you believe characterize you that if you stray from
you cease to be you cease to exist you know basically so i thought i was i thought you know
that's i don't think what you said was speculation i think there are all
fundaments of behavior and actually um from an ecological perspective you know they speak to the
heart of the of choice behavior um and you know why we do the things we do um and why it is always
in the background the game of say do i explore or do i play it safe
awesome thank you carl dean think you'd mute it daniel oh thank thank you carl go ahead dean
i i just like to run with what carl was saying
this is mostly for hector and michael um
um here's a here's a here's a case in point all the collective wisdom on the side of a volcano
can suddenly be arrested and yet there is still a Pompeii today i wonder what you gentlemen think
that says about certain species zone of founded surprise
dean does this refer to the material the fixed materiality alone of the ruins of Pompeii
of which no more will ever exist in the
archaeological context being able to be unpacked into this collective wisdom
well i'm just curious because we are talking about regular irregularities and regular irregularities
these these seismic events occur in the timeline and i'm just curious what we think then as we
reflect on that and still adopt that kind of risk mindset as i said i would just want to run with
what carl was was suggesting and i don't know that i don't know that there's an equivalent
i don't know if i if i if chimpanzees would do what humans have done like see the evidence and still
you know park themselves right in the path of of danger i'm just curious what they think about that
in terms of that the timeline aspect of this
Hector or michael go ahead
i don't think you're muted now Hector
sorry my microsoft um so it's a kind of difficult question and i'm not sure if i understood correctly
but as you're referring to the zone of founded surprise and linking what what professor priston
said before he wanted to take any road which is i don't know what awaits for me there okay
but if i'm very good at making guesses or inferring what might happen based on information i have
gathered before so i'm good at anticipating what might unfold okay because i have this complex
machinery let's call it working memory which is a construct i have a powerful working memories
i can't entertain many possibilities and there is something that kind of
ring bell when professor fristo was talking of precision which is the concept of metacognition
so metacognition refers to thinking about my own thinking right so i and you have to clear
and to clear aspects one is how sure am i about my knowledge for instance i'm sure i know
something even when i cannot remember this is the tip of the tone effect so i can be or i can
give you an answer and be a hundred percent sure this answer is correct i can be 80 percent short
50 percent sure so i can evaluate how much sure i am about something okay so this i think
it rings a bit like precision so if i make some expect plans and i think one might unfold i can
be very sure this will happen or not and this probably has to do with my metacognition so how
sure i am about what will happen and that might help me to decide whether i go or not um and
coming back to your son of under surprise i'm not sure if i'm digressing but
perhaps i can preempt the surprise if i have a good precision or good metacognition so
if i'm sure that i can rehearse things in my head and see how they will unfold
they won't be that surprising later so i i'm just speculating perhaps this ability to
have counterfactuals to have this kind of rehearsing in my head and this depth of generative models
can be empty surprise and here i'm speculating clearly so i don't know if i answer your question
about Pompeii because i'm not sure that i understood but just bring some some ideas
that might be useful but again they are speculative
it'd be nice just to link that notion of metacognition and having beliefs about beliefs
you know the precision of a belief about the likelihood of being eaten by a predator um
i think that's what daniel was speaking to before when he was talking about um the hierarchical
depth of models and their increasing complexification um one really important way of making making a
model more expressive and context sensitive is to induce a hierarchy of exactly the sort
that Hector was talking about in terms of this sort of metacognitive aspect but not just um
content but crucially again coming back to the um the confidence and the and the precision
i think that's a really central concept and i was just thinking you know if you had to
commit to what kinds of epigenetically specified constraints you would um associate with the genome
what in what space would they would they would they live um and my guess is that most of it
is about the constraints and within that is going to be the constraints on the precisions
that there are certain sort of innate ranges um of outcomes that i will entertain um and
in in in principle at least you can actually just write down an entire generative model in
terms of of constraints and in terms of precisions in the sense that and if the generative model
is universally expressive and everything goes then you can sort of carve out an
apt structural form for that um generative model despite shrinking some of or 99.9% of this
overly expressive generative model uh to zero with very very precise uh constraints so um
well perhaps i'll turn this into a question you know if if you were um trying to simulate
artificial life in its most generic sense if you're trying to simulate tool use for example the
emergence of tool use in a synthetic population um and you had to actually write down what could be
asked via genetically or epigenetically to each subsequent generation what what kinds of things
would you specify that's kind of my question in the same in the same sense how do we
where where do we draw those arbitrary lines i mean it's the it's the thing that comes up again
and again and we continue to sort of see the next the next sedimentary layer of papers discussing
this right but the but the fact that it can be moving and the fact that it it isn't there is
a rate constant that you mentioned in the last live stream that has to be um working functioning
and effective and then there's still this question of so so what is our our but what are we attending
to and what are we still available to all at once and how do we organize that in a way that it
most closely as you say precisely it that that's the best way to describing it what's really going on
and that that's that that seems to me at least to be a moving target
just one quick speculative mapping as well first the um instead of just stacking bricks with content
on content on content intercalating layers of content estimation with metacognitive estimation
is what allows the extendability of the multi-layer predictive processing type architectures it's
actually like the back and forth or the interplay between the content estimators
and the variance estimators that allows that model to not just be described in terms of its
center of gravity but also in terms of its full distribution and then to Carl's question
about what is being passed down genetically and epigenetically and thinking about those
terms even generically like in the context of perhaps source code and a configuration file
or some other mapping of like what is inscribed from a classical information genetic perspective
and then what is contextually and more rapidly transmitted
there's an interesting angle I could see it this way or potentially the opposite but there's a
shorter term epigenetic firing rate and then a slower updating of neuromodulatory like genetic
possibilities kind of opening and closing valves over a slower timescale and then of
course these are nested within another one so what is what is neuromodulatory this can also
itself be a firing rate in other ways but just focusing on this direction the uh inscribed
constraints are like the width of the aperture and then the actual flow of the photons through the
lens is an instantaneous firing rate that's happening way faster than the aperture can be
dilated or not and so merely the fact that there are multiple concurrent time scales and the associated
interplay of their rate constants tells us a lot about this kind of learning architecture
what we do with that understanding is the action question and related to our preferences and
positions however it seems pretty key that to alternate estimates about content with
metacognitive type estimates and to package that set of two belief distributions mean and variance
to package those also as one so it can be handled as a composite one
and just to point out that learning rates are the manifestation of that second order
specification that precision so you know they are the same thing you're at every at every timescale
so you could you could articulate the the developmental stages for example the
the not used word rejuvenation but certainly you know the the which changes say in late
adolescent as a programmed learning rate for learnability that can be read at some level
as a precision because the precisions are just the rate constants that link the state to the rate
of change of the state and that basically is just a learning rate at many many different levels so
I think was a sort of uniform way of putting together these different notions some useful
notions here from machine learning are sort of the notion of learning to infer you know so I was
thinking about my an answer to my own question and clearly you can't write down a generative model
that's going to be able to get up and go to school in the morning all you can do is to
create a self-organizing blob that has exactly the right learning rates so that it is has exactly
the right learnability so that it can acquire a generative model and learn through experience
dependent plasticity that model of its little lived world of course that little lived world
has been constructed by other grown-up babies so you'll we get back to this circular causality
that the evolution is trying to provide you with the right ability learning rates precisions
and structural constraints on your generative model but your generative models from the
evolution's point of view are actually creating the environment that has to be learned so there's
to my mind isn't there's you know a very beautiful circular causality here that you know as fast as
you're learning you're actually creating new worlds in which to learn I guess we're seeing
that at the moment with the advances in technology and the like which brings me back to my question
about the sort of the top-down versus bottom-up causation about you know what is a good model
of this world what is a good phenotype
in our final 15 minutes or so here
how do we move beyond the 53.2 either to the authors their directions and excitements
about the work or anyone's exhortations or raising of possibilities for other ways it can be developed
I wonder if it's worth bearing in mind that
increasing technological not necessarily complexity but at least variability
may well have permitted a reduction in selection pressure on the
phenotype and evidently affecting the genotype and epigenetic
variability I see this because I would like to draw attention to the the graph which I presented last
week which was taken from Professor Philip Tobias's work on early humans showing an increasing
range of variation in the cranial capacity of bipedal hominids from the osteopathy signs
through to homo sapiens suggesting a reduction in selection pressure for particular
well for the size of the brain basically I find it hard not to relate this to
the advantages that slowly accrued to
tool use and thereby of course the variability and variation of tool making
thereby reducing the risk or some of the risks or existential risks
that otherwise plague or have plagued other homininans whether extant whether the ancestors
of extant great apes or indeed the earlier forms of bipedal homininans osteopathy signs
palanthropus canianthopus etc well who knows but it's perhaps
um not totally irrelevant that this variability has grown over the past couple of million years
and is now very wide as I mentioned last week
this I think is in contra distinction to the the way in which
selection pressures have been highly discriminatory in for example producing let's say the wide range
of Darwin's famous Galapagos finches just to give a well-known example
thank you Carl
can I ask um coming back to this theme of um selection for selectability um and the notion of
precision or learning rates cast in terms of um mutation rates so you're my favorite example of
and I'm sure there are better ones nowadays when I was reading around this subject
my favorite example was um the story told by Ernst Merer about Drosophila fruit flies being reared
in volatile versus non-volatile environments so you're rearing generation after generation
at a fairly fixed temperature and then an equivalent set of generations where they varied
the temperature um you know a few degrees plus and minus and what they showed was that the mutation
rate of the Drosophila in the volatile changing environment was greater than the mutation rate
the genetic mutation rate in the less volatile population or transgenerational populations
which I thought was a beautiful example of selection for selectability itself that you know
that increased variation certainly or it's you know a phenotypic expression of implicit
increased genomic variability was itself an adaptive response to the rate of change
of the environment so my question is is there a similar sort of picture or view of
um variation in either phenotypic or genetic characteristics in over a longer time scale
in in sort of human evolution and if there is is there any evidence that there's going that
there is in the past century or so um perhaps this is a bit of an ambitious ask but is there
any evidence that there has been a sort of phase transition in the variability and the
evolvability and the associated um phenotypic variation
the empirical or un-empirical research agenda would be to make a hierarchical active inference model
and perform dynamic causal modeling on different variability characters across levels of phenotypic
and genotypic integration and have that model in use but a very provocative and interesting
question Carl
and to what extent is it happening with our cellular architecture and to what
extents are these processes happening with our niche given these unique cumulative cultural
generative model generative process thinking through other minds increasingly the production
of artifacts that enable not just offloading but outsourcing these do represent unique cognitive
niches and so it will be quite interesting to investigate perhaps if we each want to have
some closing round thoughts perhaps dean with the first word thank you because you know I hate
having the last one I'm just curious gentlemen thank you first again for for your generosity
I'm just curious now that you've dipped your toes in this this active inference institute
live stream world what are your what are your impressions is was it was it was it helpful at all
who is next you perfect okay so I think that's been very useful and mostly very
fun I mean I've enjoyed a lot to have this discussion with all of you so it's been very enjoyable
and just for the future I'm just wondering if there is such a thing like preempting surprise
based on these counterfactuals I guess maybe it's already written and discussed and it's all clear but
I wonder that this might be an interesting idea to explore if I can preempt to surprise
before I act I mean for even acting but that's kind of maybe that's resolved already
anyway it has been fun thank you all honestly
thank you that makes me think about saying I don't mean to surprise you but that's actually
going to increase it's like oh boy has someone been injured but what is the show not tell
of preempting surprise so that with a linear string in time there is the path from the old
berry patch to the new berry patch such that it appears to be within a nested hierarchical model
the path of least action to follow though in a less nested model it would be quite surprising
Michael or Carl your kind of closing thoughts or questions as we bring this set of 53 to a close
well I'll let Michael have the last word
and just speak to what you just said in Hector's comment I think there's a lot of interest in
that in that notion you know sort of trying to preempt surprise I mean a simple reading of risk
minimization you're just basically not engaging in policies that are going to result in surprising
outcomes where surprise is just the violation of prior preferences and so at that level I think
that's that sort of almost a truism but there is an interesting there's an interesting sort of
implication of that which leads to notions of the way that we choose to behave epistemically in terms
of avoiding information that would be very surprising sometimes articulate in terms of
optimism bias sometimes in terms of wishful thinking but the kind of paradox that you get
when we are base optimal creatures and yet we don't want to open the letter from the GP giving us
our most recent cancer results or we don't want to open that letter whether we fail to get that job
or pass that exam or indeed the anatomy dissection viper and there are certain things that we
avoid there are certain surprises that we avoid or split in the way there are certain ways of
preempting surprise by avoiding knowing stuff that we might find surprising and that's that's
an emerging literature now which which takes you a little bit outside your your comfort zone but it's
a fascinating literature because you'll find things like transient cognitive signs and and
the like in answer to Dean's question about these sessions because this is not my first session so
but I this but this does exemplify it yeah it's for fun and we're amongst friends and indulging
ourselves and those people who care to listen to us so I think the next thing to do is is the next
horizon although I do think dynamic calls the modeling of evolutionary trajectories is an
excellent idea I suspect the heavy lifting now is to get the ideas that we've been talking about
out there I think that's what Michael and Hector have to do basically it's just keep keep on telling
the story and in my experience usually takes about five to ten years before people start listening
thank you Carl Michael with the last word
well there have been these sessions have been fun and most illuminating there is a lot to be done on
the matter of whether there have been phased transitions in the evolution of what we might
call evolvability in again as Homer over the past two million years there are big
arguments amongst human evolution specialists between whether there was a unitary evolutionary
whether a unitary evolutionary model is acceptable or as lumpers like myself would like to believe
or whether in fact there was a big bush with a lot of dead end separate unsuccessful species like
Homo flori ciensis Homo leuconiensis Homo leuconiensis or even perhaps Neanderthals
with whom I've had a lot of contact have excavated about 15 of them
and these arguments are highly relevant to the matter of cognitive evolution and indeed as to
whether the record of artifacts and tools can indeed inform us that I believe it can about
just how and how slowly I would say evolution precedes preceded and of course the splitters
believe it happened in in leaps jumps and leaps I'm rather convinced Darwinist I believe that
things happen very very slowly and that we have to concentrate and with this I conclude on
the especially the neuro epigenetic modification of genetic expression as affecting not merely
morphology and physiology but also I would say cognition and the matter in hand of course
the ability or not to let our surprises affect one lookers and other people
permitting let's say modification of behavior in a very wide in a far wider
with far wider results than those that occur in many other species
including some of those of our closest our closest primate relatives and thank you very
much for organizing this session Daniel and Dean it's been a pleasure to take part
I'm sorry that I have this terrible appearance but I really can't do much about that at the moment
I have well lost a few days
thank you all Michael at least you have an excuse I have no excuses at all
all right till next time long live the mean long live the variants thank you
you
you
