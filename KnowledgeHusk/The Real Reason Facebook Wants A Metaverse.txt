So a few years ago me and a friend were attending a college. It was the end of
the semester and we had a big final project. Create a business pitch and
show it to some investors. Now this was an early computer engineering course and
I was a terrible student. My friend said hey do whatever you want so I waited a
few weeks until the the final day and I was gonna start the project. I came up
with my dream idea. It was called VR funzo or something stupid like that. Keep
in mind VR was barely relevant at this time but it sounded cool to investors
right? It was a large grandiose spanning an innovative social network where
users could live a second life. You get it? I think you played ping-pong to mine
cryptocurrency or you could just get money by watching an ad. You could use
this money, these fun bucks to buy cars, buy things for your house, just buy
things. You could hang out with other people and show them your cool things and
out of the 20-page paper 15 pages were just bullet points that described
the various cats that you could buy in the game. Beneath that was the various
hats that you could buy for those various cats. It wasn't the most original
idea. This is permeated fiction for a good while but you know I always like
that idea. Maybe not the mining for crypto part but having a place where you
can you can just hang out with people and VR and have your various hats in your
various cats.
All right perfect.
Oh hi Mark. Oh oh oh no. The word meta is obviously in reference to the meta verse
that's what Facebook's doing here and in many ways this has become the new buzz
word for tech companies and journalists and investors. Pretty soon we're gonna
have the Fortnite metaverse and Microsoft announced its own metaverse for
business and Facebook is this. It's all very corporate, it's all very cringy but
is there something there? No but but I'll get to that. What exactly is the metaverse?
That's something that a lot of people seem to misunderstand. We called it a
digital living world where you can socialize, make money, hang out, do anything
you want but there's a key factor that people seem to forget. Well a lot of
factors. One it has to be in VR so no regardless of what you've seen on
Twitter, Second Life and MMOs and all this stuff is not a metaverse. The
internet itself is not a metaverse because it has to be in VR. Secondly it's
got to be open source. Nobody can be in control of it not owned by a singular
entity. In this way it is like the internet but finally and most importantly
it's not real. It's literally a work of fiction. The metaverse is a place in the
world of Neil Stevenson's 1992 novel Snow Crash. That's it. That's where this
word came from. It's a book. I won't go too in-depth in the story here because
there'll be a whole video on that at some point. But in short the metaverse is
an entirely open VR platform and in this place people are represented by
avatars. They can communicate with others, go to various locations, buy a house,
earn a living, whatever. It's the direct inspiration for every VR world story you
have ever heard. In the story the metaverse is so important because the
outside world is awful. It's a chaotic dystopian landscape where various
corporations control limited city states across the nation. Hyperinflation makes
a billion dollars useless. You're gonna need trillions to buy a lightbulb. The
core concept of the metaverse is intended to be escapism. Your status in
society is more so defined whether you know how to write code, make programs,
create models, or contribute to the larger metaverse. It's entirely open in
nature and hobbyists can contribute whatever they want to make the metaverse
a better place. The story is meant as part speculative futurism, social commentary,
and a parody of many of the cyberpunk tropes. Our main character is a pizza
driver for the mob who happens to be a hacker. His name is literally hero
protagonist, but the humor right now is that the top corporations in our world
are interested in creating their own metaverses. As TechRadar points out, this
concept is literally the antagonists plan in Ready Player One. The only
difference here is that there never is a free metaverse. It starts broken. Now I'm
not gonna lie, I love the idea of the metaverse of a VR world. Disruptive Tech
is disruptive for a reason. It will never be obvious when it's coming. And most
people won't think it's a good idea. I've talked about on this channel how in
the 90s the internet was deemed a fad. The rhetoric surrounding the smartphone
was that people were too addicted to technology. The television was seen as a
cesspool of culture, something that would ruin America. This is human nature, new
things are scary. The technology made before you were born was flat out
unusable. Everything going forward is unnecessary, and only the time in which
you grew up will be just right. With that said, yes, I love the idea of the metaverse
of a VR world, but Facebook is fucking evil. I have the utmost respect for
Oculus and its engineers and the man from id himself, but even the best product
can be ruined by upper management. And Facebook does nothing but ruin things.
I'm not even going to go into all the shit they've done, because you probably
know about it. It is not a hot take to say Facebook bad. It's simply factual.
So why is Facebook doing this then? Why are they the ones that are heading up this
giant push for not only VR, but the metaverse? Well, that's actually quite
simple. In recent years, VR has gone from massive bulky headsets tethered to
computers to standalone devices to goggles. In many ways, it mimics another
market that was fledgling for decades before it exploded, the smartphone.
By 2017, it had sold 8.5 billion times, more than one for each person on the
planet. Media itself shifted to cater to this market. Now, I believe this might
happen to VR, maybe at least a fraction of this kind of growth. But even if
that's the case, that's more than a billion units. Facebook seems to see this
too. And there's a real chance that in 10, 15 years, head mounted displays will
become the successor to the smartphone. If that happens, the power dynamic
between these massive corporations will shift once more. All of these companies
have other products that can survive regardless of whether the smartphone or
VR is the most popular computing method. But Facebook just has social media.
Social media doesn't cultivate users based on features and quality. It's a
snowball effect. If your friends and family are on this platform, you will
use that. You likely joined Facebook in the first place because your friends
were on there, your family. Remember that MySpace was actually pretty big when
Facebook took the reins? It had about 100 million users at its peak. But it was
the disruptive technology of the smartphone that made Facebook become
what it is today. And this is Facebook's biggest fear that VR will make all of
its existing services irrelevant. Users will gravitate towards VR social
networks or even the traditional phone apps of those services. And Facebook
does not want to be behind the curve. So now they're betting on this. Whether
this manifests into something of quality or value. That's another question. But
yeah, Facebook's metaverse. It's not really a metaverse. As I said before,
that would have to be an open platform. Without this, unless they're connecting
Facebook's metaverse and Epic's metaverse and Microsoft's metaverse all together
and allowing anybody to make their own and jump in, this is not a metaverse. This
is PlayStation Home in VR. 2018 documents laying out the metaverse from Facebook
leaked. This included plans to buy out game developers to fuel this and the sole
goal of crushing competition. They don't care if it's good or the best. They just
don't want anybody else getting in. The metaverse is not ready. It will not be
ready for years. But Facebook wants to discourage somebody else from trying to
make their own. This whole story is written like satire. Its big evil
corporation wants to build the thing from a 1990s novel that was criticizing big
evil corporations.
