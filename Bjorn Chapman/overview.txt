Checking Bjorn Chapman/Make Music Tutorial Chord Progressions and Circle of Fifths 1.txt
1. **Circle of Fifths**: This concept in music theory illustrates the relationships among the twelve distinct tonal keys. By moving up by intervals of fifths, you can cycle through all the major and minor keys. Each step along this circle provides a new key center, which is characterized by its own unique set of chords and harmonies.

2. **Resolution**: When moving through chord progressions, certain chords create tension due to their distance from the home key. This tension can be resolved by returning to the home key, which sounds comfortable or "resolved" after the tension has been built up.

3. **Major Scale Formula**: The major scale consists of whole steps and half steps in a specific order (W-W-H, W-W-W, W-H). This formula underpins the construction of chords and progressions within a given key.

4. **Tension Chords**: In the context of the circle of fifths, certain chords like the dominant seventh chord (V) create a strong sense of tension because they are typically a distance of five steps away from the tonic (I) chord in any given key. The dominant chord is particularly influential as it pulls towards resolution to the tonic.

5. **Dominant Chord**: The term "dominant" refers to the V chord in a scale. It is the most dominant and strong sounding chord in that scale, which is why it's often used to create tension that leads to a resolution back to the tonic chord.

6. **Cadence**: A cadence is a harmonic device that signals a pause or ending within a piece of music. The most fundamental and conclusive type of cadence is the authentic cadence, which involves moving from the dominant chord to the tonic chord, providing a sense of closure or completion in the music.

7. **Future Learning**: The video promises to introduce more complex harmonic concepts and "words" (chords and progressions) in subsequent videos, including other types of cadences.

In summary, understanding the circle of fifths is essential for creating chord progressions that build tension and resolve it in a musically satisfying way. The major scale formula guides the construction of these chords, and the dominant chord's role as a tension creator is key to understanding how music provides both tension and release. Cadences, particularly the authentic cadence, are tools for bringing closure to musical phrases.
