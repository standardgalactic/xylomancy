When did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did
all my money go, when did all my money go?
So I'm sitting in the grass and I wonder why this time passed so slowly, it ticks by so slowly
You just stop looking real, see this man walking down, down the road
But all this time I'm what I said and all this time we go
When did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did all my money go?
Do you want to go for a ride, let's go down to the other side, let's go
Blue cream, black and gold, when you gonna get a hold of yourself
But all this time I'm what I said and all this time we go
When did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did all my money go?
When did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did all my money go?
When did all my money go, when did all my money go, when did all my money go?
When did all my money go, when did all my money go?
