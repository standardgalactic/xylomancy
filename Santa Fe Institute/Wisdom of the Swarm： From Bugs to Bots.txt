at Cambridge University, and he's been a professor of physics
at Harvard University for the past 20 plus years, I guess.
Two facts about him that you might not know,
or maybe you do know, is one of the Carther genius
awards in 2009.
And the other thing is that he's also
recipient of the ICC Bill Bill Prize in 2007.
And what he wanted for was understanding
wrinkly of sheets and manifolds when they land on surfaces.
So every time I look in the mirror,
you see my wrinkles?
I'll keep the view.
That's pretty cool.
I hope everybody else does the same from now on.
OK, thank you, Sid.
It's a very small group, so I hope
that you will make this more of a multi-log,
and just interrupt me as you feel the need to.
And correct me, which I'm sure you will.
So I wanted to tell you something about some problems
that I've been working on for more than a decade, all inspired
by originally Edward Lear, and the wonderful poetry
that he wrote in the 19th century associated
with collective nouns for groups of animals.
So I'm going to show you one, and I'm going to ask you a question.
So these are starlings from a BBC documentary above Rome.
So probably everybody over here does
know what the collective noun for starlings is.
Memorization.
What is it for rhinos?
No idea.
A crash.
What is it for owls?
Parliament.
Parliament.
Parliament.
Yeah, so I think what is it for?
I'm going to say, well, no, I'm not going to go.
No, never mind.
So the point about these collectives
is that it says something about function.
And that's very important, and that's
what I want to try and emphasize over the next hour or so.
That even though, from the perspective that certainly I'm
going to tell you a little bit about, from physics,
from mathematics, you can ask about what kinds of and what
forms of order do you see in collectives of organisms
on any scale, from microbes to robots.
But as the language, as English actually has got so many,
and I'm sure this is true of every language,
has got so many different forms for collectives
depending on the organism, it's associated with function.
So why do these collectives exist?
And presumably, they're associated
with every collective as a function.
And also, from a physics point of view,
you can ask a mathematics point of view,
you can ask how do they form.
So there are three kinds of questions
that you can ask about any kinds of collective behavior,
in particular, associated with collections of animals.
And what I'd like to do is to ask two different types
of questions associated with collective behavior.
One is how is collective behavior constrained by physics?
And the other is how does physics
enable function in the context of collective behavior?
And I think it's interesting to point out framework
for this which has been laid out a long time ago
outside of physics by Nicholas Tinbergen,
one of two brothers, both of whom got the Nobel Prize.
Tinbergen got the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine,
and he shared it with Conrad Lorenz and Frisch
in 1967 and 1968, and he raised a set of questions
which have formed the bedrock of ethology
in studying behavior in animals.
He was originally thinking about single animals,
individuals, but we can ask the same question
in the context of collective.
So he asked, what is a behavior in terms of its function?
So how can you describe that function?
Why does that function arise?
How does that function come to be
in the context of causation?
And then both a proximal and a distal perspective
in an organism, how does that behavior develop?
And how does it essentially arise
across different species in an evolutionary setting?
But you don't have to limit yourself to organisms.
You can, of course, ask the same question
in the context of collections of organisms.
And what I want to do is to make this very specific
because I'm thinking about function
in the context of architectures,
because they are very concrete, quite literally,
often, for example, with the human situation,
but in the animal situation,
you also have remarkable sets of architectures
which are formed from the scale of microbes
that can essentially create biofilms to ants, to bees.
I'm going to focus on social insects, to termites.
And I've shown you three different scales.
Each one of them has organisms on the scale
of hundreds, two thousands, or even millions.
In this case, associated with maximizing transport
from one location on a tree to another.
In this case, which I'll come back to,
associated with understanding how to minimize
heating and cooling conditions within the inside
and or mechanically being stable
when responding to a wind, and in this case,
a combination of making sure
that you are simultaneously not fully insulated
from the environment,
but not fully porous to the environment
so that the vagaries and the fluctuations
associated with the environment
can be buffered to some extent by architectures.
So these functional collectives in general,
lots of work has been gone on from a biological perspective,
tend to roughly be capable of being broken up
into ways of controlling how,
in a physical context, energy matter information
can be transferred with an uncertain environment,
and that environment and the ways in which
the collectives form or have to be adaptable
in a way which has become clearer
and also are spatially heterogeneous.
So they're not just temporal,
but they're also complex spatial patterns that form.
And moving away from our perspective
and thinking about energy matter information,
if I'm thinking about these systems,
in a biological context,
we have to start thinking about how you can
or not get coordination and communication
in the context of these functional self-organized patterns.
And an important thing that I think
I don't have to convince anybody over here,
but worth pointing out right at the beginning
is in none of these cases,
is there any evidence of a plan or a planner?
There is some sensing,
there is some action at the individual level
which gradually transcends the individual
and at the collective level
leads to these functional patterns.
And the most important part
is that you can't leave out the environment.
And that's what I'm gonna talk about
in three different examples.
So you have to think about the organism,
you've got to think about the organism interacting
with other conspecifics,
and then eventually you've got to think about
how it interacts with the environment.
It changes the environment
and is changed by the environment.
And you have to see these three examples,
we immediately see that, to understand that.
Okay, so as I said,
typical kind of question that we can ask is both ways,
how does collective behavior enabled
and how does collective behavior constrained by physics?
Okay, I wanna talk about social insects
for a reason which I don't think again
is necessary for me to elaborate too much,
primarily because you have a remarkable,
so these are the big four classes of social insects,
bees, wasps, ants, and termites.
But from the point of view of the perspective
that I came to this from,
I started out thinking about morphogenesis
and thinking about multicellular organisms,
and there are lots of parallels
between multicellular organisms and super organisms,
where the super organisms have a separation
between the germline and the soma,
just like in multicellular organisms as well.
Here you have often usually a queen,
and that's the only organism in colony
that's capable of reproductive behavior,
but then everything else is shared.
You have common nests,
they are unlike in us, social insects are clonal,
you have reproductive division of labor,
as I said before, you have cooperative brood care,
you have overlapping generations,
and the consequence of the last two
is that you have a sense of culture,
that culture is transmitted not through genetics,
but through other means.
Okay, as a consequence of having
these very large collections of organisms,
you find that they are extraordinary problem solvers.
They can solve problems in physiology
that are impossible to solve
on the scale of an individual organism,
but can be solved collectively
on the scale of hundreds to millions of organisms,
and as I said, I wanna tell you about architectures,
and architectures are wonderful,
because you can essentially figure out
a way to connect physiology to physics,
and in this case, the physiology is the architecture,
which is living, but not necessarily made
only of living things.
It's essentially the environment,
which is dynamically changing,
and I'm gonna show you examples
of how these architectures allow for respiration
and ventilation on scales much larger than organism
in the context of bees, thermoregulation,
also in the context of bees,
and mechanoregulation in the context of termites and bees.
I've said this before, I want to emphasize this again.
We should be thinking about the fact
that in all these examples that I'll tell you about,
the environment is a malleable substrate,
so it can be changed by the organism,
and a consequence of that is it changes
the behavior of the organism,
and so the environment serves
as a slow communication channel,
the dynamics of the environment is slow,
typically compared to the dynamics of the organism,
modulo being close to where we are
in the context of climate change and tipping points
and whatnot, but in general,
you have a separation of timescales associated with these things.
Okay, so the three examples that I want to tell you about,
which involve connecting experiment and theory
in very different places,
and very different times over the last decade,
first example that I want to tell you about
is associated with termite mounds.
This is an image of a termite mound from here,
from Bangalore.
We started out doing experiments over here,
and then in Namibia, and then parts of Western Africa.
This is an image of a termite mound during the day,
this is an image of the termite mound at night,
viewed through an infrared camera
superposed on a regular image,
and what you can see is essentially changes in temperature,
so this part is at night,
warm and cold,
depending on time of the day or time of the night.
Now, I'll come back to this,
and this is work that was done with Sam Oko,
who was a PhD student, and Alex Hyde,
also a PhD student, and I'll come back to that.
So, what are the questions over here?
The questions are, what is the structure for,
how is it built,
and how does this all work out
in the context of a larger ecological question
of the environment?
This is a termite mound.
Oh, what?
How long is it?
I'm going to show you.
I'm going to show you all this.
I'm going to tell you about the anatomy,
I'm going to tell you about the physiology,
so hold the questions.
And please do stop me with questions at any point.
Some of them I will answer immediately,
but some, if you don't mind,
I'll wait because I will have something to say about that.
The second problem that I want to tell you about
was done in collaboration with Ory Pelig,
who I know is an external faculty member over here.
She started this when she was a postdoc.
Now she's in Colorado,
and Jake Peters was a graduate student,
and this is understanding ventilation,
but not for termite mounds,
ventilation in beehives or bee boxes,
and this was done not so far from Boston,
in our Concord Field Station.
And then if I have time,
I'll tell you about a third problem
where we essentially brought everything into the lab.
Initially, we wanted to do this,
but we haven't been able to.
The third problem is associated
with the third class of social insect.
We haven't had a chance to work on wasps yet.
I would love to find a way to do so.
And the third problem is associated
with understanding how architectures
can be broken and built in the context of ants,
which want to try and escape from a coral
in which they are essentially initially placed.
And then I want to gradually move
from thinking about ants to robotic mimics of this.
And the question over there is what are the necessary,
what is the minimum necessary set of rules,
and what is the minimum sufficient set of rules
associated with having a programmable set of agents
that can interact with each other,
and interact with an environment
to be able to capture some aspects
of the dynamics of organisms interacting with each other,
and with an environment, all of which are malleable.
And this is work that continues, actually.
We started out with Ganga Prasad and Sovik Mandal.
Fabio built robots,
and this is all a very close collaboration
with a colleague of mine in biology,
Venky Morphy, who's very interested in collectivity.
Okay, so I'll give you the final result
or way to think about at least the way
I've approached this problem,
and then you can come back to the talk periodically.
If you feel like every one of these I claim,
and I'll show you evidence for even though the problems
that are solved on much larger scales associated
with very simple local sensing rules
and local actuation rules,
and the key ingredient that I would like to emphasize
is global physics, physics associated
with how heat is moving around,
how vibrations are moving around,
how fluid dynamics plays a role,
and coupled with simple local sensing
and local actuation rules and global physics,
you can get both function and architecture as the claim,
and I want to essentially tell you
how we think about this in all these problems.
Okay, so termite mounds are remarkable.
They are an ecosystem on their own.
You can actually have collections of collections,
if you want.
These are collections of termite mounds from Australia.
They are called magnetic termite mounds,
wall termite mounds, which seem to be oriented roughly
at a particular angle with respect to magnetic knots.
So each mound can have millions of individuals.
A termite itself is the size of a fingernail,
and you find them everywhere except in Antarctica.
Probably the most remarkable example
of recent work in this space.
This is England, Great Britain.
This is the coast of South America.
This is a set of termite mounds
which was excavated five or six years ago.
Look at the scale.
It is not one mound, there are many mounds.
You have a whole bunch of them.
Hundreds of thousands of square kilometers.
So they essentially have the capacity
to completely change the ecology of the environment
in which they are.
So you can ask questions on the very, very large scale.
You can ask questions on the intermediate scale
or on the very small scale.
And I'll talk about the intermediate and the small scale.
What happens on the scale of an individual termite mound
when I coarse-grain and look at it,
and what happens at the level of termites interacting
with each other and with the termite mound as they build it?
Those are the two scales in which I want to tell you about.
I won't tell you anything about on the very large scale.
So answering Sid's question, we started out, as I said,
working on it in India with a particular species
called Dr. Termi's Ovisis.
You know, a few millimeters in size.
The termite mounds are hollow,
but they are hollow on different scales.
You don't have a chimney at the top,
contrary to what sometimes is shown in children's books.
This is a view from the top.
You don't also have to have this very fluted structure.
So for example, this is one from Namibia.
It's more or less axi-symmetric.
Certainly it doesn't have flutes, these ones are not.
Under what conditions do you get it?
Under what conditions you don't?
I don't really have a sense of that.
The ecologists and the natural historians
haven't actually really, I think,
quantified where and when you get this.
So it's porous on multiple scales,
and you can ask many questions.
You know, what is this good for,
from a physiology point of view?
How might it be built from a morphogenesis point of view?
And what are the effects on ecology?
And this is the question that I will not answer.
I'll try and answer some of these two.
Okay, so start with anatomy.
So this is the anatomy of a termite mound.
The most interesting part of the mound
is not what you see above.
It's below.
It's what's called the gallery.
And within this gallery is where the brood is,
where most of the termites are most of the time.
And along with the brood and the termites,
you also have fungus.
Essentially, the termites will bring water and fungi
from their environment in the neighborhood
of an individual mound,
and they will use this to feed the brood
and keep the entire environment moist.
The gallery itself, you can't, of course,
see until it erupts into a mound.
So there's a very difficult question over here,
which nobody's really addressed,
which is on what are the conditions
for the eruption of a mound?
And nobody's been able to really build a mound in the lab.
There are some attempts, partially successful.
Continuing to answer the question, Sid, that you raised,
a collaborator of mine, I'm sorry, his name is not here.
Rupert Soar basically took a mound,
which we knew was not inhabited anymore.
And how do we know this?
We know this by essentially looking to see
whether it starts to degrade over a period of time,
and if there is no repair,
then you know it's very likely it's been abandoned.
You can pour gypsum into it,
allow that to precipitate,
and then you can wash out the mud,
and this is the negative image of a termite mound.
So you have vast, almost vertical channels,
which are themselves connected to each other.
The termite mound is micro porous on the outside,
and as you go further and further inside,
it becomes more and more macro porous.
So the porosity is got a gradient,
small, many pores on the outside,
as you go deeper and deeper,
the pores become larger and larger,
and you have essentially vertical channels.
And of course, this would suggest
that it has a very important part in ventilation,
and I'll show you some images associated with that.
So what is the physiology of this?
Best way to describe this is to ask my favorite naturalist,
and probably everybody's.
Here in South Africa, it can also get very hot,
but there's no danger of flooding.
So termites can take refuge from the heat below ground,
where it's cool and relatively stable.
But two million insects living below ground
create a different kind of problem.
The air around them gets stale.
So termites need to have a way of linking the underground air
with the fresh air above, a ventilation system,
and they do that with this.
And to see how it works,
you've got to look inside.
Using the latest scanning techniques,
we can create a picture of the mound's interior.
An intricate network of passages lead to a central chimney.
Hot, stale air from the insect population below
rises up through the chimney.
But the top of the mound is sealed.
So how does this stale air escape?
The mound may look as though it has strong defensive walls
like a fortress, but in fact, these walls are porous,
and their primary purpose is to harness the wind.
Fresh air blowing against the side of the mound
is forced through the tiny holes in these walls.
From there, it travels through the smaller chimney
from there, it travels through the smaller tunnels
until it reaches the central chimney.
Here, the cooler fresh air mixes with the hot stale air
rising from the insect community below.
Meanwhile, some air is blown around the side of the mound.
This creates a suction that pulls the stale air
out of the chimney and out through the outer walls.
So an internal air current is created,
and the whole mound ventilated.
The mound's inhabitants spend most of their time
close to or below ground level.
So he said, to David Anberos said two things.
First, he said that you have to have transport across the wall,
which is porous, which of course makes a lot of sense.
But in fact, as you know, because the pores are small,
hydrodynamic effects are all going to be dominated by viscous forces.
They're not going to be dominated by inertia.
David Anberos then said something else,
which should have gotten all your antlers or your antenna up,
and he said something about the fact that,
oh, if I have air moving around it,
then the velocity of the air is high,
the pressure is low, and it's going to be suction.
That can't be correct, and you can do an estimate of that.
And so clearly, if you have porosity,
part of the argument associated with transport
because of differences in concentration is correct,
but the airflow argument associated with Bernoulli is wrong.
And so, you know, this is the kind of argument
which has been around in the literature for a while,
and we decided we'd go and measure things.
We went to Namibia, and we measure. What did we measure?
So you can measure the fluid flow velocities outside.
You can essentially drill holes into the termite mounds,
and you can put in temperature sensors,
and you can also have velocity sensors to measure.
I want to emphasize velocity sensors,
not just speed, but direction of the motion of the air inside.
And then you can ask whether this is correct or not,
and I'm going to summarize the story,
because it's almost a decade old now,
and the story is that the argument that Attenborough put forward
is only partly correct.
An important part was missed,
and what is the important part that was missed?
In fact, let me show you an image,
and then I'm going to walk you through the argument.
You know, our measurements and so on are there in this paper,
which is, as I said, published almost a decade ago.
I showed you this image in the beginning.
This is a termite mound using regular light.
This is an infrared during the day, and this is at night.
And so what really happens is the following.
The mound is heated during the day, and it cools at night.
But because the mound has a large thermal mass,
and therefore a thermal inertia,
the entire mound can't be heated simultaneously.
It has to be heated from the outside and gradually moves inwards.
And so there's going to be a lag.
If my thermal inertia is large enough,
then the outside is warm during the day,
the inside is cold, hasn't had a chance to heat up,
and exactly the reverse at night,
because the inside is starting to warm up
and the outside starts to cool quickly.
That means you have thermal gradients.
And these thermal gradients in space
are a function of temperature variations in time.
So in fact, the termite mound actually is a heat engine,
which instead of working between two,
a source and a sink in temperature,
as we are used to thinking in thermodynamics,
which are kept at constant temperature,
now in fact the source and sink are oscillating,
and the mound is harnessing this temperature variation in time
to create spatial flows inside the mound, which we measure.
So during the day, the outside of the mound is hot,
the air right inside is warm.
As a consequence, air is going to rise,
but because the air can't leave because of the microporosity,
so during the day you have cycles like this, which we measure.
And at night, the outside starts to cool,
so the mound air, sorry, the air in the mound just inside,
it starts to cool, it starts to sink,
and the whole thing reverses.
So when will this happen?
It's not going to happen continuously,
it's going to happen at dusk and at dawn,
or slightly after dusk and slightly before dawn,
which means that the mound is a lung,
and it's a lung driven by temperature variations,
and the mound essentially breathes twice a day.
In us, our lungs work primarily because of our diaphragm.
Our diaphragm is essentially fundamentally
what is essentially pushing and pulling air in and out of the lungs.
And instead of the diaphragm providing the muscular forces in us,
the temperature variations are essentially giving rise to the same thing.
And so we measured this in dead mounds.
To be sure that we were right, we said,
ah, in a live mound, if this is the same thing,
if this is happening in a live mound, which we know is live,
as I said, because it's under construction, we can see termites.
In a dead mound, we see exactly the same thing.
Both in a live and a dead mound, we see the same thing.
And we did this with two different species on two different continents.
We did this in Africa, in Namibia.
We did this in India with a different species.
In Africa, in the temperate region, temperature variations are much larger.
I'm going to come back to this.
So therefore, you have much larger variations in temperature between day and night.
The consequence of that is the velocity should be much larger.
In India, the temperature variations are much smaller.
The velocity should be smaller. All that checks out.
And the idea that it works like a lung, here is the evidence for this.
So what I'm showing you over here is what's happening in the nest,
in the gallery, and what's happening in the chimney.
The carbon dioxide concentration starts to go up during the day,
as the termites are physiologically active.
And then when at about 6 or 7 p.m., when this entire cycle reverses,
instead of having flows like this, the flows reverse, you excavate the bottom,
you excavate the gallery, and when you excavate the gallery, the carbon dioxide comes up.
And when the carbon dioxide comes up, the concentration of carbon dioxide inside is high compared to outside.
Now the porosity kicks in because the concentration difference allows you to essentially equilibrate.
So you have large-scale flows coupled to small-scale diffusion,
all driven by a heat source and a heat sink, which are fluctuating.
So this is an interesting observation, if only because it suggests that unlike our heat engines,
animals don't have to work at constant source and constant sink temperatures.
We can have fluctuating versions of this.
Okay, so I'll leave it at that.
A second question that this raises is when I said, ah, the thermal inertia is large,
if the thermal inertia was not large, of course temperatures will equilibrate quickly.
And if temperatures equilibrate quickly, you don't have to have any of this.
And so that begs the question, how in the world do termites figure out how to build a structure of this kind
so that it actually works?
And I want to introduce another naturalist, an evolutionary biologist,
who basically pauses the question and then I'll show you an attempt at an answer.
Okay?
Now what's fascinating to me about this is that if you came across a building like that,
you'd assume that some architect had designed it and he'd had a blueprint of some kind, right?
The drawing of how it was going to go.
And he told people exactly what to do.
Now this termite mind, nobody had an image of the complete building.
I mean no termite has a picture of the whole mind.
All the termites do is they build the mind and they're following some rules.
And to be honest, I don't think we know exactly what those rules are.
My guess is that they're fairly, fairly simple.
So he gives it at that.
What are the rules?
How can we essentially now connect the building behavior to the environmental changes
because the building behavior will change the environment.
The environment will then feed back and change the behavior.
For example, if I build a mound, there are only certain places that the termites can get to.
So can we now understand how to couple the physics of the environment
to the behavioral biology of the organism?
So don't separate out this part is living and this part is not living.
Okay.
So here's a cartoon and here's a phrase which essentially summarizes everything.
So Churchill famously said, we shape our buildings after they shape us.
Well, in the context of termites, the mound morphology clearly will influence the airflow.
I've already shown you, at least I wave my hands and told you how it works.
We have some measurements of that.
The airflow is going to change the olfactory currents.
It's going to change the pheromone concentrations.
The pheromone concentrations are going to change the termite behavior.
And the termite behavior is going to change the mind morphology.
So you can't anymore separate out the organism from the environment
just as we can't separate out the brain from the body.
We have to think about all these things together.
So how do we unpack this?
And I'll show you two ways of unpacking this.
First is understanding the coarse-grained morphology of the termite mound.
And second, I'm going to show you CAT scans of the mound itself.
And then I'm going to see how to unpack the fine-grained morphology.
First thing that you notice is that termite mounds are conical.
The aspect ratio is, they're not spheres.
In fact, I'm going to show you examples.
Termite mounds, which you see in environments which are shady,
or termite mounds on trees, they're much closer to spherical.
So first question is, how come they become tall?
And I don't have to, I think, explain to this audience
that one way to break symmetry is to use buoyancy.
Because as soon as I heat the air, heat air is going to move up and down
much faster than sideways.
And if I essentially have buoyancy, that means I can move pheromones
much faster in one direction compared to the other.
That means, therefore, I'll be able to build more in one direction
compared to the other if the pheromones were essentially
responsible for the behavior of the termite.
And as a consequence, and I'll show you some scaling laws for that
in just a minute, as a consequence you would expect
that as you move from environments where the temperature variations
are small to environments where temperature variations are large,
the mound should become larger.
This has been known for 100 years.
If you go to the savanna, you go to parts of southern Africa,
you go to the temperate zones, the mounds can be 3, 3.5, 4 meters.
You go to India, they are smaller. You go to a tree, they're even smaller.
So already you say, ah, that the physics of the environment
is playing a very important role, can I essentially unpack that?
Okay, so here is an attempt to do that.
I've already, this is a cartoon.
I'm going to assume axi-symmetry.
You have all kinds of interesting questions associated with how you
break axi-symmetry, we haven't addressed them.
This is what I told you a minute or two ago that
associated with diurnal variations in temperature,
you have heat and therefore air moving around.
That means pheromones are moving around.
And the simplest rule for biology, for behavior,
is you build if the concentration of pheromones increases
past the critical value, you stop and then you allow things to degrade
if the pheromone concentration does not.
That's it. That's the only place where I introduce a behavioral rule.
Minimally, I have to therefore couple three different fields.
Temperature, which is the driving source of all that's happening.
It's a function nominally of time, but it becomes a function of space,
s and z, z and s in the radial direction,
because I'm thinking about a conducting porous material.
Velocity, which is drive, which is driven, air velocity,
which is driven by temperature variations because of buoyancy
and then pheromone concentration, because they're essentially moved around.
So minimally, we have to have these three fields,
and forget the equations.
I'll just describe what they mean, which I think is very intuitive.
Dianolosylation, which change in time with a frequency which is 1 over 24 hours,
is heat flow, so temperature variations are driven by advection
because of the fluid flow and they also have diffusion.
Fluid flow, this is a porous medium,
it's driven essentially by temperature variations.
Temperature variations lead to buoyancy,
and the fluid is assumed to be incompressible.
And the pheromone is advected by the fluid, it diffuses, and it has a source.
And the source of all the pheromones are in the gallery
because that's where most of the termites are most of the time.
Those are my equations.
Here is the only place where the biology quote comes in.
You build, if the pheromone concentration becomes large,
then large in the critical value, you stop building,
or you actually let it degrade and that's coming in otherwise.
That's it.
What are the parameters?
So there is a thickness of the wall,
which is where you have microporosity,
after which you have this microporosity.
There's a thermal diffusion length,
which is essentially associated with how much of the mound
you can heat or cool during the day or night.
There is a buoyancy parameter, which is telling you
as a function of the temperature variations,
how fast or how slow is the fluid flow moving up and down.
And there is a pheromone penetration depth.
And that is the idea that if I have a source of pheromones
and I just uniformly allow them to diffuse,
there comes a critical distance beyond which the concentration
has fallen down below critical value.
And if it's fallen down below critical value,
you won't build larger than that.
And if there was no temperature variation,
or sorry, if there was no buoyancy,
then this would be isotropic, so you get a spherical termite mound.
The reason that you get an elongated mound is precisely
and only because the termites are harnessing the buoyancy
without even thinking about it,
to have pheromones move much faster in the vertical direction
because of buoyancy and only slowly diffuse
in the horizontal direction.
So you're assuming that the pheromones
will produce their constant rate.
Anything beyond that will essentially
make the problem more complicated.
But yes, in the simplest setting, I'm assuming
that there is a source of pheromones that's uniform
and at one location.
You can start making all kinds of complexities beyond that.
Yes, indeed.
I don't understand the mechanics.
So here I'm going to concentrate
with uniform termites in the gallery.
Which is known?
Yes.
And they're just sitting there at the highest concentration.
So they're just in their building and surrounding themselves by cement.
No.
Over there, they're mostly excavating.
All the building is happening above.
So in the gallery, there's a lot of porosity.
Okay.
So, but that's where the brood is
and the brood are metabolically very active.
So there's a huge source of pheromones and humidity,
water vapor, consequence of respiration, right there.
But I don't know what was the...
There's a motion assumption here that I don't know.
So you're assuming something about the distribution of termites
across the structure and that's not...
It's not here because I've zoomed out
and I'm thinking about not the individual dynamics of the termites.
I'll come back to that when I think about a second level of a model,
which is more fine-grained.
Here, I'm saying I'm thinking about the termite mount
as it's being built over an entire season.
I'm assuming that they're somehow uniformly spread over the structure.
I am assuming nothing about them except the fact that the order production
is happening at a particular location with a particular rate.
Right.
Okay.
If the termites were actually moving around and depositing it,
if you hold on, I will show you a more fine-grained model
which asks what is the fine-grained structure.
And I think part of the message, perhaps, which I should have said
and maybe I'll say now, is I'm going to build a sequence of models.
Actually, in this case, two models.
One for the coarse-grained perspective to understand the aspect ratio
and the size of the mount.
Another one for the fine-grained structure
because I'm going to show you with CAT scans that, in fact,
the mount has a layered, smectic-like behavior,
a smectic-like structure, like a parking garage.
And in order to understand that, I'll have to start worrying about
the dynamics of termites which are loaded with cement,
termites which are essentially unloaded, are moving around,
and how the air is moving through.
All that I will build in at a more fine-grained level
if you will just wait for a couple of minutes.
Question, more questions.
Yeah.
So you said, you know, this still holds in the gallery.
In the gallery, they're always active because of the concentration
of pheromone and they're always...
In this case, I'm assuming that the gallery is where most
of the pheromones are produced.
There could be pheromones produced elsewhere,
but I'm assuming that the concentration of pheromones elsewhere
is a consequence of being produced in large amounts at the base
and then moving around because of either diffusion or buoyancy.
I guess it's just for my mental picture.
Is the gallery always increasing in size?
No, no, no.
The gallery is first built, reaches a critical size.
I don't know, we don't know what the critical size is,
and then and only then does the mount start to erupt outwards.
Upwards, sorry.
Okay, so I've told you the parameters.
There are three-dimensionalist parameters from these four scales.
There are two scaling laws, which I'm going to tell you about,
which we can calculate as consequences of these equations,
but I could just directly read off once I know what the parameters are.
One is the aspect ratio.
What is the height compared to the radius?
And the most important thing is its non-unity
and the reason it's non-unity is because of the presence of this quantity,
which I'm going to call a Peclet number.
It's related to things in hydrodynamics,
such as how diffusion and advection play off against each other.
And what is this saying?
This Peclet number is a ratio of this quantity to this quantity,
a pheromone penetration to buoyancy.
So what is that really saying?
That means if the Peclet number is small, it's dominated by diffusion,
therefore it's going to remain spherical.
If the Peclet number is large, that means the buoyancy length is large,
it has very, very large flows in the vertical direction,
which means that the aspect ratio becomes very, very large.
And the reason it's a square,
you must expect it should go at least as a square,
is because the symmetry doesn't matter which way it's going,
whether it's up or down.
So you could have just guessed that,
but in fact you can calculate it and you can do the numerics,
solving these PDEs and you find that that's correct.
And there is another length at timescale and the timescale is associated
with how long does it take to reach steady state.
Why will it reach a steady state?
Because it's a non-equilibrium steady state.
It reaches a steady state because eventually the Pheromone concentration
on the walls reaches P star.
And once it reaches P star, it can't grow anymore outwards.
And similarly, once you reach steady velocity,
it can't grow to large in the critical height.
And that characteristic time, not surprisingly,
is related to, I'm going to call this the BI,
the BO number, which for all kinds of historical reasons
is named for the scientist BO,
and it's characterized by this thermal diffusion length.
So how much does that heat penetrate in or out of this?
And you can calculate solutions, which I'm going to show you,
and here are solutions of the PDEs,
which show you different kinds of mounds,
and you can qualitatively, but only qualitatively see
that they don't have a complete discordance with observations.
I mean, I can't say that they capture all of it,
but qualitatively they're correct.
But question.
Sorry, on that one.
So if the population were growing...
Very good.
Yeah, ask the question.
Well, that final inequality then would not be here today.
Indeed.
And if the populations are growing,
termite mound will continuously grow.
And so now, and this is where you get a second mound,
which starts to come up,
because what happens is there are two possibilities.
One is just you grow this individual mound,
but then that means you're depleting resources
from the immediate neighborhood.
You're depleting water, you're depleting fungus,
and so there is a characteristic scale beyond
which it's no longer efficient to keep growing this one mound.
Instead, you'll find a second mound that grows.
And in fact, I should say,
so we worked in Namibia for two seasons,
and in India for three seasons.
What we found is that mounds will be built
in a period of three to four months.
In India, the monsoon essentially washes out almost everything.
In Namibia, we found often that grazing animals
use this as a backscratcher,
and they will destroy it.
But in either case,
rarely do you have a mound which will essentially persist over,
for example, we came back after a year,
and most of the mounds we were studying were gone.
So there are much more sophisticated analysis
associated with the timescale over which you would expect this to stay.
I don't really know. I don't have anything to say.
Okay.
But I do want to now zoom in.
You can see, I hope, these mounds,
these are cross-sections of mounds,
these are actually layered structures.
And I want to now tell you a little bit about them.
Okay.
So not the macromorphogenesis,
but the macromorphogenesis, zooming in.
And here's an image from our collaborator,
Geeth Aralos, who studies collective behavior in Toulouse,
took one of the West African mounds.
This is a much smaller one.
Look at the size over here.
It's very small of the order of something
that you can hold in your hand.
And you see this beautiful, smectic structure.
In fact, if you, you know,
like love these kind of ordered structures
and familiar with liquid crystals, for example,
where you have nematics, smectics,
smectics A, smectics C,
and then you have coalescerics and all,
and like discoid liquid crystals
and polarized liquid crystals and whatnot,
you know that you get defects, edge dislocations,
screw dislocations, so you see all these structures.
But very importantly, unlike in liquid crystals,
where those are consequences of a very racial principle
associated with minimizing energy,
here these are arising from non-equilibrium considerations.
There's nothing about the system which is at equilibrium.
And yet, because of the geometry,
you are inevitably going to be forced to have dislocations.
And these dislocations, as I said,
can take the form of edge and screw dislocations.
How do we understand these?
Okay, same picture.
I have to couple the environment with the behavior
and with the airflow.
In this case, I'm going to think of now
three fluids interacting with each other.
As I said, the population of a termite mound
can be in the order of millions.
I have two classes of termite mounds,
termites which are loaded,
so they have a bit of clay,
a particle of clay that they're moving around.
I have termite mounds which are unloaded.
The mounds which are loaded
are going to essentially respond to gradients in pheromone
and then drop the nest material at some particular location.
That changes the local porosity.
That local porosity changes the dynamics
of how the pheromone is moving around
in the presence or in the absence of airflow.
That then changes the behavior of the termite,
and we have to essentially couple these
exactly like what I was showing you before.
What Guy and his collaborators had shown
a couple of years before we started working on this
by looking at the behavior of individual termites
in a Petri dish.
They weren't able to build anything on the scale of a mound itself,
but they were able to build small attempts
that the termites made to create these layered structures,
and they found that the building rate is proportional
to the first approximation of the pheromone concentration,
and the removal rate is not proportional to constant.
They essentially build more and more
in response to higher and higher concentrations,
but then when they break it, they break it
at a uniform rate, and I'm going to use this in a model.
Here is my model, and I'm sorry it's a bit messy,
but let me explain what the physics is associated
with each one of these equations,
and these are just essentially conservation laws
and some reaction diffusion type equations.
Let me explain what.
The nest material, the nest material,
when u varies from zero to one,
it's either not there at all or it's solid when it's one.
Nest material is moved around in consequence of termites
which are loaded and destroyed because of termites
which are essentially taking material away,
n plus and n minus are the populations of the termites
which are loaded and unloaded,
and the nest when it's being built is assumed
to be a soft porous solid, so it's like clay
which will gradually settle down,
and that settling down we build in through this term over here.
G is an effective gravity,
it's essentially just loading the system.
The fact that this is a diffusion equation
is consistent with the case if I have a porous system
which is just heavy without any loading or unloading,
without activity, it will start to sag.
That's essentially why the Leaning Tower of Pisa is leaning
over large periods of time
because of differences in the foundation
and the soil around it, it starts to essentially degrade.
So that's the nest material.
The termite workers themselves are diffusing their chemo-tactic
because they essentially respond to gradients in the soil
through chemo-tactic coefficient,
and the termite workers themselves can switch from being loaded
to unloaded with a rate k.
This diffusivity which is non-linear is simply there
because you can't have any diffusivity when u is equal to 1
since it's a solid, so it's essentially completely gone.
When u is equal to 1, it's a solid,
therefore the termites can't move at all,
and finally the pheromone concentration is diffusion,
and there is addition because of the pheromones,
because of the termites which are loaded,
and there is a rate of degradation.
And the building and removal rates are very simple forms
which essentially are proportional to the loading
or the loaded termites or the unloaded termites,
and this u times 1 minus u is precisely again,
so that it vanishes when you have no material
and it also vanishes when it is only a solid.
So you can do a linear stability analysis
and pull out the dimensionless parameters,
and the key dimensionless parameters that matter
are the rate at which diffusion and degradation
arise in the pheromone concentration,
a rate associated with the settling,
and the chemotactic coefficient.
How strongly or how weakly do the termites respond
to gradients in pheromones?
Here is an example of a simulation.
I hope that you can see it.
You get this layered structure.
The layer spacing is essentially,
it shouldn't surprise you, anybody who's looked
at these reaction diffusion equations,
you always get a spacing when you balance
degradation with diffusion.
There's a characteristic length scale,
which is this square root of those two.
It turns out for the values that we have in the system,
this characteristic balance between diffusion
and degradation dominate and give you this spacing.
No surprises that you also get
edge dislocation-like structures,
and you also get screw dislocation-like structures
because you will never be able to build perfectly
when you're trying to essentially get layers.
The only last point which I want to make
is what sets the orientation of the layers,
and the orientation of the layers is set by gravity.
It's essentially right there.
Otherwise you could say,
oh, why should it be layered this way,
why can't it be layered this way,
or why can't it be layered that way,
and that's because the settling is happening in one direction.
So gravity, in a very humble but profound,
I would say way, dominates both the physics
of the large-scale buoyancy-driven circulation
and on the small-scale setting the polarization
of the layer orientation as well.
Okay, that's my second story
about mound-micromorphogenesis,
and I hope that it's clear,
no plan, no planner,
there isn't even a representation of the task.
We think about intelligence-requiring representation.
There is no representation anywhere.
All that's happening is local sensing and local action,
and out of that you can essentially get these structures,
and I want to emphasize these are also out of equilibrium.
They are not solutions of any variation problems,
even though they look like they may have a variational way
of getting there, for example, in liquid crystals.
So therefore they are both repairable,
and they're also adaptable.
They're repairable because if I monkey around
with what happens at one location,
immediately these dynamics will essentially change
the way in the pheromone moves around,
and therefore it will repair itself,
and it's also adaptable for the same reason,
because if the temperature variations are present,
then you will essentially upscale or downscale the pattern.
I'm just wondering what limits the size of the tumor mound
and also the tension of a lifetime.
Yeah.
So the size, I believe, is associated with the population.
It scales with the population.
Now you're asking what sets the population,
and I don't know the answer.
I do know that what has been seen,
and that's primarily in these tree mounds,
so they're not really mounds, they're much smaller nests.
You will see characteristic population
and mound size correlate very well.
In the context of mounds on the ground,
you have to have ground penetrating radar
or something of that sort to be able to first know
where to even look and then start asking the question.
I don't really have a whole lot to say.
Context of how long do they persist?
I think the question that you're asking is a question of
is it more efficient to repair a mound,
or as it ages, and it's physical aging,
or is it better to start a new mound?
And so that's, I think, now a much harder question
to understand in the absence of any data.
I mean, you can make up a story that, past some age,
it just becomes very hard to continuously repair the mounds,
and then you start making another one,
but that's my story as good as yours.
Okay, all right, so I have 10 minutes or less?
Okay, so I want to switch.
Maybe I'll just give you a brief view.
I think you must have heard some of it from Orit.
I'll give you a...
Do you know anything about the evolution of all these energies?
I mean, are there termites that are sort of
crap at building mounds,
or is there any comparative data
that gives you a feeling for that?
There probably is.
I am not able to recall having quantitative data.
I can tell you about quantitative data
from an evolutionary point of view
associated with the fact that,
because we've studied three different species
and three different continents,
the size of the mound, the shape of the mound,
we can qualitatively understand using these scaling laws.
Temperature variations becoming larger,
the mound becomes larger.
Populations becoming larger, the mound becoming larger.
If you're now asking me, can you predict the exponents?
I mean, we can, but can you essentially verify anything?
No, zero.
These experiments, yeah.
No.
So the only part of the history is we've studied
three different species and three different continents.
They're all conforming with the model.
They are qualitatively consistent.
You know, I have another life where we actually
study just the physics of things where I think
we can be a lot more hard-nosed about exponents
and phase diagrams and so on.
And if I try to compare it with that part,
we are very far away, unfortunately.
So this is all qualitative at this point, unfortunately.
Okay.
All right.
In the next 10 minutes, I want to first give you a view
of the kinds of problems we've studied with bees,
but I won't tell you about any of them,
and then I'll switch to ants if I have a little bit of time.
But I'm also happy to stop after.
It's okay.
This is a bee beard, if you like, in the Concord Field Station.
And, you know, on a day like this,
actually at a time like this,
but probably about seven years ago or so, eight years ago.
And so, you know, this cluster of bees
is hanging by essentially holding on to its neighbors.
Okay.
And why is it doing this?
So probably the most famous thing that everybody
knows about in the context of collective behavior of bees
is associated with the waggle dance.
Okay.
So when the bees essentially have to make a decision
about creating or moving to a new home,
then there's this remarkable set of events.
First, I think described by Carl von Frisch in the 1930s and 40s,
for which, as I said, he and Tinbergen and Conrad Lorenz
shared Nobel Prize in 1967 and 68,
where the bees essentially signal to each other
by waggling their bodies, changing their orientation,
and having more or less vigor associated with a particular location.
Once that decision has been made,
the bees have to move from one location to the other.
And they typically move in over a period of days.
So they don't have the capacity to do this in one day.
And if they do this, as it will typically happen at this time of the year,
early spring, then there's a potential problem,
which is that they may freeze at night.
And to prevent freezing at night,
they essentially have to create a bivouac for the night,
for maybe two nights, maybe three nights.
And this is the kind of bivouac that they treat where they create,
where they essentially hold on to each other.
So this is a potential solution to two problems.
One, you need to be mechanically stable.
So you have to hold on to the branch, not at one point,
but over some finite length of the branch or the bow.
And another is to essentially minimize the amount of surface
to reduce the amount of heat loss.
And there's very nice questions,
not just associated with how they form these structures,
but even the structure of the structure itself,
which means what?
Which means what type of bees are on the outside
and what type of bees are on the inside?
For example, we know, due to the work of Bernd Heinrich from the 1970s,
that in fact, the younger bees are on the inside,
the older bees on the outside.
The older bees on the outside have an ematic order.
So a very beautiful set of questions associated
with trying to minimize the thermal shock and the mechanical shock.
So a few years ago, with Jake Peters and Ulrich Pelleig,
we studied this.
And I want to show you an experiment where Jake did.
And I won't tell you what the theory, which was done a few years ago.
So here's an experiment.
Jake basically took a piece of wood,
created a little cage to which he attached,
which he attached to the piece of wood
and within which he also had a queen.
And then the bees essentially aggregated around that
and he put this whole thing inside a box and changed the temperature.
So you want to essentially understand how does this cluster respond
to temperature variations.
Let me show you.
The temperature is cycling from between 15 degrees.
14 degrees or so the bees will go into a chill coma
and it's changing over a period of a few hours.
And what you see is essentially a porous medium,
which is capable of responding by becoming more porous or less porous.
It becomes more porous as it heats up
and becomes less porous as it cools down.
What does that mean?
That means that it becomes hotter and hotter.
You essentially create, change the porosity
and by changing the porosity you can essentially get airflow
and by changing the airflow you can get dynamics and cooling.
And then when it becomes cold, it shrinks.
And we understand, we teach students how to do calculations
of heat conduction, temperature variations and so on
in the context of a first course in thermodynamics.
And this is very cool because it's functional and it's active.
So what are the bees doing?
So they're essentially spreading themselves out
or moving their legs out or moving their legs in.
And one can make some sense out of this.
So this is an example of, if you want,
where temperature regulation is associated
with changing the physicality, the embodiment
of how the collective essentially responds.
We're seeing the porosity is like the area.
That's the simplest measure.
Oryth has now gone on, I think, has actually measured,
in fact, using an X.
She's put the whole hive into a tomograph
and she can essentially watch what is inside.
Right now, you can just see it's the same number of bees.
How do we know that?
We can measure the weight before and after.
And we can see that the same number of bees,
the volume is much larger.
Therefore, the porosity has increased
and the density has decreased.
And therefore, it allows...
It's not increasing the surface area, right?
There has to be naturally a change in the surface area.
But the total number of bees is kept constant.
Yeah.
Okay.
There's mechanical adaptation.
So as I said, you have to change,
you have to figure out how to maintain temperature.
You have to also figure out how to essentially respond
to shocks, mechanical shocks.
So if I put you inside an elevator and I start shaking you,
what would you do?
I mean, I've shown you the result over there,
but what would you do individually?
Okay, move to the ground so that you can basically move
and have your center of mass as low as possible.
Or go to a wall.
This happens collectively as well.
Okay, so when I start shaking the cluster of bees,
they start spreading out.
Okay?
So this is very interesting because this is a kind of mechanical,
if you want, way of distributing the load.
Because if the bees at the base have to take up all the load,
the bees at the tip don't have to take up any of the load at all.
And yet they do so.
So is this a mechanical altruism?
I don't know.
Okay.
Because all that's happening, move all the bees to the surface
and therefore the load on all of them reduces
and they're much happier.
Okay.
So you can make sense of this again using a theoretical model,
which I'm pretty sure Orit has talked to you about.
But fundamentally, it's playing with a collective version of a set of pendula,
which can essentially oscillate from side to side.
We can also oscillate up and down.
So you have two degrees of freedom.
You have a whole collection of them.
And you can show that functionally, load distribution is much, much better
and much more robust when you flatten out at high amplitudes or high frequencies.
And then there is a third problem.
So this is thermal regulation.
That's mechanical adaptation.
And then there is the hydrodynamics of ventilation.
So in the termite mound, the mound is more or less fixed
and the whole mound works as a lung.
In the bee box, the bee's question?
Yeah, what would be the tradeoff between shaking?
Very good.
Between these two?
Yeah.
I don't have an answer.
What we do find is that you can see over here the...
Yeah, why don't we...
Can you ask me the question at the end?
I'll come back to that.
Because it's a very difficult question associated with, you know,
if I want to be mechanically stable and thermally relatively well insulated,
what kinds of shapes do you get?
I mean, we have some thoughts on that,
but just can you hold on and ask me the question at the end?
Okay.
So I want to contrast ventilation in the termite mound,
where the mound is fixed and temperature variations as a function of time
are converted to spatial gradients which lead to flows.
In a bee box, the bee box is fixed
and a remarkable solution seems to present itself on the solution.
So this is the bee box right here.
This is where the brood is.
Now let me show you.
Please, at the entrance, fan.
Okay, question for you.
Which way should we fan?
And where?
First which way and then where?
Outwards or inwards?
Does it depend on the time today?
No.
Outwards?
Why?
The heat from the time?
Not only to remove the question or comment.
Inwards.
You say inwards.
Good.
Okay.
Turns out that you want to actually pull air.
You want to get it outwards.
Why?
Because I can measure.
Not only can I essentially ventilate, but I can measure.
I can measure what is happening inside the hive
or inside the bee box by pulling the air out.
And now there are two solutions.
Okay.
If I can pull air out, I can do this by modulating in time.
That's how we do.
When we breathe, same entrance and same exit, we modulate in time.
Okay.
I don't have to modulate in time alone.
I can modulate in space.
It depends on the size of my orifice.
If I had a very wide mouth, I can say at one part, I essentially pull in.
And if I pull in at one part, I can continuously pull in.
And the other part, just by continuity, you just move out.
And that's the second solution that we find.
So they always pull out, and then they will spontaneously,
when they start out, originally being homogenous and distributed,
they will end up on one boundary or the other.
So there's a transition.
There's an instability.
And it essentially drives the transition.
All the bees, which are pulling out, end up on one side.
And then they can continuously pull out.
And the advantage is, when I'm measuring and I am ventilating,
now if I need more bees, I just have to signal.
And so bees have a Nazanov gland.
They have essentially a whole set of pheromones associated with signaling.
So they push that signal out.
And the same wind, which is essentially associated with pulling the air out,
now you can essentially advect.
You've probably all heard of stigmergy.
And in the context of stigmergy, you're using diffusion to essentially signal.
Now you're using flow, which, of course,
that means you're essentially improving the efficiency enormously
because instead of square root of time, it's going linearly as time.
And this is what bees do.
So they will first start pulling out.
Then they will essentially end up on one side.
And then finally, they will essentially get other bees to join
using this Nazanov sending mechanism.
And you can construct a mathematical framework for this.
You can do experiments and so on.
Okay, I think I have run out of time.
So I am happy to stop here for anybody.
And same thing in every one of these problems.
In the termite case, in all the bee cases, there was local sensing.
There's local actuation.
Here it's heat transport.
Here it's mechanical vibrations.
Here it's fluid flow and heat transport and carbon dioxide.
All of these things embodied or available to you,
I wouldn't even say embodied.
Local sensing and actuation is embodied.
The rest is there.
And it's used repeatedly by these organisms.
So I will stop by going to the last slide.
I had, I think, three slides, four slides.
I'm going to go to the last slide.
And happy to talk to people about ants if you want to stay.
I showed you some examples of how large scale problem solving
can happen very, very simply using local sensing and actuation.
And critically, it's mediated by physical fields,
which you cannot ignore because all this happened in the world.
It didn't happen in some abstract brain or with a set of circuits alone.
Second thing, this idea that you can separately study,
you know, the living and non-living, perhaps,
but certainly in these social systems and super organisms,
I don't think so.
And I want to bring to mind, I think, somebody who I'm sure
is a great inspiration for people here as he has been for me,
which is associated with the parable of the ant.
I think Herb Simon famously showed an image of an ant
showing some very, very complicated path
and without showing the environment at all.
And the point that he wanted to make is that it looks like a very complicated path
because you've forgotten about the environment.
And as soon as you put the environment in,
everything starts to essentially make itself much more clear.
And so rather than thinking only about embodiment,
should we be extending it in order to account for the environment as well.
I showed you these examples.
Stigmergy's diffusive signaling, flow is advective,
vibrations is non-local, just like flow.
I want to emphasize what I said before.
You can have what you might think of as adaptable,
learnable solutions, but you don't need representation.
You don't need plan.
You don't need planner.
And you automatically get robustness because you've distributed
a lot of everything that you want to do into very simple local rules.
Okay.
Last point, I want to come back to where I started.
Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to tell you about this,
but I am happy to talk to people privately.
We've really started now asking questions of how hard or how easy it is
to do this from a synthetic perspective and not synthetic biology,
but if you want synthetic engineering.
Mathematical models, of course, are a way to synthesize systems,
but also physical mimics.
And I'll close with a question which I think inspired a lot of people
over here and continues to inspire me.
Just like Kuring was thinking about intelligence,
can we think about behavior the same way?
How much of what is happening can I essentially understand
by looking at collective behavior?
And if we can't, then I think this quest of pushing towards
ever smaller mechanistic understanding of the molecular scale
may be a lost cause.
You can only say what is minimally needed.
You can perhaps say what is sufficient,
but beyond that, it's very, very hard to say exactly all the different things,
all the different ways in which you can essentially come up with a solution.
And that's, of course, not at all surprising,
because inverse problems are notoriously imposed.
Unless I have regularization, unless I have mathematically or physically
ways of essentially saying these are the classes of solutions
that I'm able to deal with, I can't really answer that question.
How do I deduce the rules by looking at the behavior?
For example, if I had shown you these robots as individual particles,
could you tell me whether they were actual robots,
whether they were termites?
And if you can't, I think there's a real issue with asking that kind of a question.
Okay, on that, I will stop.
Thank you so much.
I'm sorry I went over.
Excuse me.
So, it's sort of interesting this,
this is in the biological spectrum,
that it fits this circumstance very well,
but us, or us, and I don't get into the interface.
Shops of sand, what's in it, the dude, is what, what is in it.
So, some physics for you is embodiment.
So, right, so the non-local large, large space scales,
net scales are coming from physics,
and whereas us, we get it from the whole body.
We don't need the physics to do the work, our body does the work.
I'm just wondering.
I would say that even for us, the environment is critical.
Well, I was saying it's not critical,
but in this narrative, if you're that tiny or a termite,
the only way you get this on non-local information is from the physics, right,
from these circulations, whereas we can get it from long axons,
and we need physics to do the work.
Well, I would say the long axons are probably one of the physical solutions,
but anyway, but keep going.
Well, if that was, then you'd be inconsistent in the way your narrative works,
because that's a part of the organism, right?
You could say nerve conduction is physics or something,
but I don't, not useful conception physics seems to me,
but I'm just wondering whether or not there are sort of two worlds.
There's the world of little things,
and the only way they can build large structures
is by obtaining these non-local information from physical principles,
and there's nothing to go to us where you just build large-scale biological structure,
which does the work, and physics becomes auxiliary.
Let me, first of all, say that even for,
so for us, are you saying that if I wanted to build something large,
I cannot do it using physics?
I think you cannot, but there are these two very different ways of doing it.
Yeah, so let me frame this from an evolutionary point of view.
Okay, so these organisms have been around for a hundred times longer than us,
for 350 million years.
With relatively simple, I think, compared to us,
we're going along exactly the direction that you're going,
cognitive rules and yet capable of solving these physiological tasks,
which are common across the entire animal kingdom.
If I have societies, I have to worry about large-scale respiration,
large-scale physiology, locomotion, predation, pre-capture, and so on.
In early evolution, this is a solution that came to be.
As evolution moved on, and this is a question to which I don't really have an answer
in the sense that I'm satisfied with, I mean there are a lot of words,
but I don't know how to convert that into something more quantitative,
but can you have a notion of assimilation?
That is to say you take these physics-based rules, which are part of the environment,
and then you build them into the body.
When I build them into the body, I have the ability to move by essentially coordination.
That was previously, this bee talked to that bee, which talked to that bee,
and they all moved together, but now I say, no, let me just make a super bee,
I connect them all together, now they become part of the organism, super organism.
So I'm not disagreeing with what you're saying.
I don't see a temporal path which tells you how to start here,
because these have been around, as I said, for a hundred times longer than us.
They're multicellular. They solve, by the way, the same kind of problems that we solve
on the organismal level. I didn't talk about the physiology of respiration.
In insect respiration, it's very different from our respiration.
Small insects don't need lungs.
They don't need lungs because they can essentially interact directly with the environment
through spiracles, which means diffusive transport is good enough.
You become big, you have to change your rules.
So I'm not disagreeing at all with you.
I guess my concern is, is it really a discrete setting,
because I sort of think of this as a whole spectrum of solutions.
Let's imagine, if the termite mound now said, right, and you just stomp about
and move around in the environment, at that point these principles are kind of useless,
because that degree of integration is not going to be achieved by advection and diffusion anymore.
That's why we have neuron, long neurons.
So in other words, there really is a distinction that comes in once you have these more structured interactions.
So I would say that transition is not as discrete as I think what I'm hearing you say.
This is a distributed solution.
I don't know whether you're saying that you also have possibilities for centralized solutions,
centralized brains. If you're not saying that, then I think we don't disagree.
But if you are, then I would say, I'm not sure that I agree.
It's not central.
Because you can think about cephalopods.
Just this idea that advection and diffusion, we don't have a nervous system that does its work.
I don't do vision by advection and diffusion.
I didn't talk only about advection and diffusion.
I talked about there are all kinds of other things that are mechanical.
There's movement. There's all kinds of other things as well.
I mean, I gave you a couple of examples where you can have active movement,
which can essentially solve problems and morphogenesis.
And if you ask me questions about vision, I mean, understanding how the orientation dominance columns arise.
Actually, it is advection and diffusion coupled with stimuli,
which lead to ocular dominance columns arising.
We can have...
Dominance columns arrive through a strict connectivity of neurons through reciprocal inhibition.
That's how ocular dominance columns arrive.
There is an underlying connectivity that gives...
Yeah, but how do you get the connectivity in the first place?
Fair enough.
I mean, but that's part of...
You can't put the connectivity in. You've got to get the connectivity out.
We should continue.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
