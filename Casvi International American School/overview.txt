1. **Project Overview:** The MYP project for 10th graders is designed to facilitate their transition from the Middle Years Programme (MYP) to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). Students are encouraged to undertake a personal project that reflects their interests and relates to their future aspirations.

2. **Your Project:** You chose to create a trailer for your personal project because you wanted to convey a deep message effectively to a broader audience. The topic of your trailer is the ethical implications of how large tech companies like Google or Facebook handle user data. Your project aims to highlight the lack of oversight in this area.

3. **Interview Opportunity:** You have an interview scheduled for tomorrow, which suggests there might be follow-up or further engagement on your project's theme or its impact.

4. **Ethical Message and Personal Pride:** The message behind your choice of the circle symbol in your project is to raise awareness about privacy and data use by big tech companies. You believe that people tend to behave better when they are being watched, which aligns with societal norms and expectations.

5. **Future Aspirations:** Your personal pride comes from envisioning yourself creating a marketing agency or business focused on image design, logos, and branding for other companies or businesses. This experience has helped you realize your passion for this field, which could influence your future career path.

6. **Fashion Design Project:** Another student in the MYP project chose to create a dress as their personal project, reflecting their interest in fashion. They started by crafting a pattern from recycled fabric to test the fit and design, and then transferred this to final fabric to produce the finished product. The result is a dress they have designed and created, potentially sparking an interest in pursuing fashion studies in the future.

In summary, your MYP project has allowed you to explore a topic of personal interest that could influence your career choices while also developing skills relevant to the IBDP. Your approach to the project has been thoughtful and practical, with a clear focus on ethical messaging and personal development. The fashion design project showcased another student's passion for fashion, demonstrating the wide range of interests and creativity that MYP projects can inspire.
