Hey what's up guys welcome back to Too Much Tech and in today's video we're going to be
taking a look at the brand new Skullcandy Indie Wireless Earbuds.
This is going to be Skullcandy's interpretation of what an AirPods competitor should be and
honestly speaking for a little bit less than half the price of the brand new AirPods with
the wireless charging case you actually get a really compelling package and that's what
we're going to be talking about today basically just judging Skullcandy on how good of a job
they did at making their ultimate Skullcandy AirPods competitor.
And during this entire review I want you to keep in mind that these headphones only cost
about 80 bucks not on sale and I'm pretty sure that in the near future they will go
on sale maybe 10, 15, 20 bucks off at some point and so that'll just make them even more
of a more compelling offer as opposed to AirPods.
So obviously the first thing I want to talk about I did not do a live unboxing of these
I was actually out and about when I got them so just kind of pulled them out of the box
and test them out real quick.
Honestly speaking you guys really didn't miss much there wasn't really too much in the box
they're just the earbuds at the top the case at the bottom they were all out and you just
put the earbuds in the case that was about it box the presentation everything it was
it was okay you know it's pretty decent the box is really nice quality you guys probably
don't care about the box too much and neither do I really long as the package arrived safely
which it did.
Now the pairing process this is something that is never going to get easier than AirPods
like it's really easy all you do is you press connect with the AirPods on your iPhone and
that's it.
Now with these it's a little bit different all you have to do is take out both the earbuds
press the touch sensor and hold it on the right earbud and then they'll pop up on your
device you hit it in the pairs but just making sure that you realize that anytime that you
pull the headphones out after that they connect just like AirPods you never have to go through
that pairing process again.
Let's go ahead and talk about the design real quick because this is going to be the main
difference between this and the AirPods so the AirPods obviously are designed just to
be like a real easy you know you slip it in slip it out but these are more earbuds style
so you do have the little gel tip that obviously goes in your ear and it does give you a nice
isolated sound stage that the AirPods did not give you.
So number one I think that they look a little bit better because they do come in black the
AirPods do look really clean but so do these they just have a little bit of a different
design style to them and I really do like the approach that Skullcandy took this time
around as opposed to their last attempt.
You do have these like optional wing tips that you can use I tried it I didn't like it and
I lost them but you do get three different size earbuds in the box so that's really nice
because you can adjust it to whatever your preferred ear tip size is and they'll be comfortable
for you and isolate a lot of noise.
As far as the features go you do get some really long battery life they advertise I think it's
like 16 hours of battery life on the case I haven't charged these up since I got it about
a week and a half ago and I still don't have to worry about charging because they still
work, they haven't died yet neither of the buds have died when I'm listening to them
for about you know a couple hours at a time before I go ahead and put them back in their
case to charge so I really haven't had to worry about battery life as well which is
a good sign.
They're also IPX4 water resistant as well and you don't have to worry about sweat or
rain a little bit of water they're gonna be fine and you also have these really easy touch
controls to use if you want to turn up your volume just tap the left or right side to
turn up or down the volume if you want to skip a song or rewind all you do is you hold
the left or right side and you'll either rewind or skip that song if you want to pause all
you do is just double tap the right it plays or pauses the music that you're currently
listening to.
The only thing that I thought was kind of weird is that if you only want to listen to one
bud at a time it has to be the right one you can't just listen to the left one because
I guess that the right bud is the bud that it uses for pairing and connecting to your
device so that's the only bud that you can use if you just want to have your one ear
bud in.
As far as the audio quality goes the audio quality is definitely really good I would
pretty much say is but I'm par with maybe about $40 or $50 pair of earbuds and then
obviously you know you got the premium that you have to pay for them being wireless and
wireless charging and all that stuff which I don't mind at all.
I think it sounds pretty good especially because they're the inner type of earbuds they isolate
the outside noise really well and you do get to experience that audio quality a little
bit more.
The only thing I can really say about the audio quality is that I wish it was just a little
bit louder it's really the only gripe that I have concerning the audio quality other
than that the listening experience is good.
Now there's only two bad things that I have to say about the Skullcandy Indie so the first
bad thing is just that the microphone quality is absolutely terrible just have a quick listen
I'll let it speak for itself.
Alright guys so just give you guys a quick sound test on the Skullcandy Indie wireless
headphones let me know what you guys think in the comment section below I'll let you
guys determine your own opinions.
And just for reference this is the mic on an iPhone so you can really tell the difference.
And then the second bad thing that I have to say about the Skullcandy Indie why does it
have micro USB in 2019 like I feel like this should have a USB-C charger that would just
be so nice like I had to you know find another adapter to plug in the micro USB like I'm
so used to just using either lightning from my iPhone or USB-C for Android or just other
devices in general and it's like I gotta find a micro USB cable to charge these yes one
comes in the box but it's like really really short I'm like why can't we just use USB-C
but yeah that's really the only two things that I can say is just the mic is bad and
I wish it had USB-C other than that for 80 bucks this is a fantastic air pod replacement
they're really easy to use you don't have to go through the pairing process once which
is really not that bad once you get the hang of it yeah after that you just get some really
solid wireless earbuds that isolate a lot of noise water resistance you can use them
at the gym or outside you don't really have to worry about losing them because they stay
in your ears extremely well so especially for 80 bucks these really are not a bad choice
at all and even in the future you may even be able to find them for 70 or 60 bucks maybe
even 50 bucks in the near future once they get released at a lot more retailers and they
start going on sale can't beat it really can't beat it they did a really good job they're
also black and they look fantastic I mean how much more stealth can you get they look
good they sound great and they work well it's really all I have to say thank you guys so
