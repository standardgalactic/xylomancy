1. **Legal Reasons for Limiting Internet Access**: Developers have limited the internet access of models like ChargeGPT due to legal concerns, primarily to prevent unauthorized scraping of copyrighted content from paywall websites. This issue is more about legal challenges than technical ones.

2. **Current Internet Access**: As of now, ChargeGPT has some level of internet access and can interact with public data sources like Reddit, but it won't infringe on copyright by providing paywall content.

3. **Personalized GPT Use**: If one were to upload personal data such as Facebook archives or emails to train a personal GPT assistant, it could generate responses in a style consistent with one's past communications. However, it's important to consider privacy and data security when uploading sensitive information.

4. **Personal Assistant Characteristics**: A personal GPT assistant can be programmed to answer in a specific tone or style by providing explicit instructions during the training process. For a more tailored experience, fine-tuning with technical expertise is recommended but requires additional effort.

5. **Practical Experience**: The most valuable aspect of working with AI systems like GPT is to develop an intuition for how they function and what they can do. This comes from hands-on experience and experimentation with the technology.

6. **Feedback**: The presentation was well-received, with participants expressing that it was one of the most useful and practical AI sessions they've attended. Dipan appreciated the engagement and the questions raised by the attendees.

7. **Next Steps**: Dipan will send out the recording and presentation to Dina and all participants, including links and additional slides not covered during the live session. The aim is to provide as much information and resources as possible for further learning and exploration of AI systems like GPT.
