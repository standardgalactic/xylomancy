This video is about the exponent rules, rules that govern expressions like two to the fifth
or x to the n. Two to the fifth is just shorthand for two times two times two times two times
two, written five times, and similarly x to the n is just x multiplied by itself n times.
When we write these expressions, the number on the bottom that's being multiplied by itself
is called the base, and the number at the top telling us how many times we're multiplying
the base by itself is called the exponent. Sometimes the exponent is also called the
power. The product rule says that a five x to the power of n times x to the power of
m, that's the same thing as x to the n plus m power. In other words, when I multiply two
expressions with the same base, then I can add their exponents. For example, if I have
two cubed times two to the fourth, that's equal to two to the seventh. And that makes
sense, because two cubed times two to the fourth means I multiply two by itself three
times, and then I multiply that by two multiplied by itself four times. And in the end, I have
two multiplied by itself seven times, which is two to the seventh. I'm just adding up
the number of times as multiplied in each piece to get the number of times as multiplied
total. The quotient rule says that a five x to the n power divided by x to the m power,
that's equal to x to the n minus m power. In other words, if I divide two expressions
with the same base, then I can subtract their exponents. For example, three to the sixth
divided by three squared is going to be three to the six minus two, or three to the fourth.
And this makes sense, because three to the six means I multiply three by itself six times,
and then I divide that by three multiplied by itself twice. So when I cancel out threes,
I have four threes left. Notice that I have to subtract the number of threes on the bottom
from the number of threes at the top to get my number of threes remaining. That's why I
subtract my exponents. The power rule tells us if I have x to the n power raised to the
m power, that's the same thing as x to the n times m power. In other words, when I raise
a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents. For example, five to the fourth cubed is equal
to five to the four times three, or five to the 12th. And this makes sense, because five
to the fourth cubed can be thought of as five to the fourth times five to the fourth times
five to the fourth. Expanding this out some more, that's five times five times five times five,
times the same thing, times the same thing again. So I have three groups of four fives,
which is a total of three times four, or 12 fives. The next rule involves what happens when I
raise a number or a variable to the zeroth power. It turns out that anything to the zeroth power is
equal to one. Usually this is just taken as a definition. But here's why it makes sense to me.
If you have something like two cubed divided by two cubed, well, certainly that has to equal one,
anything divided by itself is just one. But using the quotient rule, we know that this is the same
thing as two to the three minus three, because when we divide two things with the same base,
we get to subtract their exponents. Therefore, this is the same thing as two to the zero. So two
to the zero has to equal one in order to make it work with the quotient rule. And the same argument
shows that anything to the zeroth power has to be equal to one. What happens when we take something
to a negative power? x to the n is equal to one over x to the n. Again, most people just take
this as a definition of a negative exponent. But here's why it makes sense. If I take something
like five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh, then by the product rule, this has to
equal five to the seven plus negative seven, which is five to the zero. And we just said that that
is equal to one. Now I have the equation five to the seventh times five to the negative seventh
equals one. If I divide both sides by five to the seventh, I get that five to the negative seventh
has to equal one over five to the seventh. So that's where this rule about negative exponents
comes from. It has to be true in order to be consistent with the product rule.
Finally, let's look at a fractional exponent. What does an expression like x to the one over
n really mean? Well, it means the nth root of x. For example, 64 to the one third power
means the cube root of 64, which happens to be four. And nine to the one half means the square
root of nine, which is usually written without that little superscript up there. Now the square
root of nine is just three. Fractional exponents also make sense. For example, if I have five to the
one third, and I cube that, then by the power rule, that's equal to five to the one third times three,
which is just five to the one or five. So in other words, five to the one third is the number
that when you cube it, you get five. And that's exactly what's meant by the cube root of five.
The cube root of five is also a number that when you cube it, you get five.
The next rule tells us we can distribute an exponent over a product. In other words, if we
have a product x times y all raised to the nth power, that's equal to x to the n times y to the n.
For example, five times seven all raised to the third power is equal to five cubed times seven
cubed. And this makes sense, because five times seven all raised to the cube power can be expanded
as five times seven times five times seven times five times seven. But if I rearrange the order
of multiplication, this is the same thing as five times five times five times seven times seven times
seven or five cubed times seven cubed. Similarly, we could distribute an exponent over a quotient.
If we have the quotient x over y all raised to the n power, that's the same as x to the n over y to
the n. For example, two sevenths raised to the fifth power is the same thing as two to the fifth
over seven to the fifth. This makes sense, because two sevenths to the fifth can be expanded
as two sevenths multiplied by itself five times, which can be written rewritten as two multiplied
by itself five times divided by seven multiplied by itself five times. And that's two to the fifth
over seven to the fifth as wanted. We've seen that we can distribute an exponent
over multiplication and division. But be careful, because we cannot distribute an exponent
over addition or subtraction. For example, a plus b to the n is not generally equal to
a to the n plus b to the n. A minus b to the n is not generally equal to a to the n minus
b to the n. And if you're not sure, just try an example with numbers. For example, two plus three
squared is not the same thing as two squared plus three squared. And two minus three squared
is definitely not equal to two squared minus three squared.
In this video, I gave eight exponent rules, which I'll list again here. There's the product rule,
the quotient rule, the power rule, the zero exponent, the negative exponent, the fractional
exponent, and there are the two rules involving distributing exponents across multiplication
and division. In another video, I'll use these exponent rules to rewrite and simplify
expressions involving exponents. In this video, I'll work out some examples of simplifying
expressions using exponent rules. I'll start by reviewing the exponent rules.
The product rule says that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you add
the exponents. The quotient rule says that when you divide two expressions with the same base,
you subtract the exponents. The power rule says that when you take a power to a power,
you multiply the exponents. The power of zero rule says that anything to the zero power
is one, as long as the base is not zero. Since zero to the zero is undefined, it doesn't make
sense. Negative exponents, to evaluate x to the minus n, we take the reciprocal one over x to the
n. To evaluate a fractional exponent, like x to the one over n, we take the nth root of x.
We can distribute an exponent over a product. a times b to the n is equal to a to the n times b
to the n. And we can distribute an exponent over a quotient. a over b to the n is a to the n over
b to the n. In the rest of this video, we'll use these exponent rules to simplify expressions.
For our first example, we want to simplify three times x to the minus two divided by x to the
fourth. There are several possible ways to proceed. For example, we could use the negative
exponent rule to write x to the minus two as one over x squared. All that gets divided by x to the
fourth still. Notice that we only take the reciprocal of the x squared. The three stays where it is,
and that's because the exponent of negative two only applies to the x, not to the three.
Now, if we think of three as three over one, we have a product of two fractions in our numerator,
and so we evaluate that by taking the product of the numerators times the product of the
denominators, which is three over x squared, all divided by x to the fourth. I can think of
x to the fourth as x to the fourth over one. So now I have a fraction over a fraction,
which I can evaluate by multiplying by the reciprocal. That simplifies to three times one
divided by x squared times x to the fourth, which is three over x to the sixth using the
product rule, since x squared times x to the fourth is equal to x to the two plus four, or x to the
six. An alternate way of solving this problem is to start by using the quotient rule.
I can rewrite this as three times x to the minus two over x to the fourth, and by the quotient
rule, that's three times x to the minus two minus four, or three times x to the minus six.
Now, using the negative exponent rule, x to the minus six is one over x to the six,
and this product of fractions simplifies to three over x to the six, the same answer I got before.
The second problem can be solved in similar ways. Please pause the video and try it before going on.
One way to simplify would be to use the negative exponent rule first and rewrite y to the minus
five as one over y to the fifth. Thinking of this as a fraction divided by a fraction, I can multiply
by the reciprocal and get four y cubed y to the fifth over one. By the product rule,
the numerator here is four y to the eighth, and so my final answer is just four y to the eighth.
Alternatively, I could decide to use the quotient rule first. As in the previous problem, I can
write this as four y cubed minus negative five by the quotient rule, and so that's four y to the
eighth as before. I'd like to show you one more method to solve these two problems, kind of a
shortcut method before we go on. That shortcut relies on the principle that a negative exponent
in the numerator corresponds to a positive exponent in the denominator. For example,
the x to the negative two in the numerator here after some manipulations became an x to the positive
two in the denominator. Furthermore, a negative exponent in the denominator is equivalent to a
positive exponent in the numerator. That's what happened when we had the y to the negative five
in the denominator and translated into a y to the positive five in the numerator. Sometimes people
like to talk about this principle by saying that you can pass a factor across the fraction bar
by switching the sign of the exponent, that is making a positive exponent negative
or a negative exponent positive. Let's see how this principle gives us a shortcut for solving
these two problems. In the first problem, three x to the minus two over x to the four, we can move
the negative exponent in the numerator and make it a positive exponent in the denominator. So we
get three over x to the four plus two or x to the six. In the second example, for y cubed over y to
the minus five, we can change the y to the minus five in the denominator into a y to the five in
the numerator and get our final answer of four y to the three plus five or eight. We'll use this
principle again in the next problems. In this example, notice that I have y's in the numerator
and in the denominator and also z's in the numerator and in the denominator. In order to
simplify, I'm going to try to get all my y's either in the numerator or the denominator and
similarly for the z's. Since I have more y's in the denominator, let me move this y to the three
downstairs and make it a y to the negative three. I'm using the principle here that
a positive exponent in the numerator corresponds to a negative exponent in the denominator.
Now since I have a positive exponent on z in the numerator and a negative exponent in the
denominator and I want to get rid of negative exponents, I'm going to pass the z's to the
numerator. A z to the minus two in the denominator becomes a z to the plus two in the numerator.
Notice that my number seven doesn't move and when I do any of these manipulations,
because it doesn't have an exponent and the exponent of negative two, for example,
only applies to the z, not to the seven. Now that I've got all my z's in the numerator
and all my y's in the denominator, it's easy to clean this up using the product rule.
And I have my simplified expression. In this last example, we have a complicated expression
raised to a fractional power. I'm going to start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.
I can bring all my y's downstairs and all my x's upstairs and get rid of negative exponents at the
same time. In other words, I can rewrite this as 25x to the fourth. I'll bring the y to the
minus five downstairs and make it y to the fifth on the denominator. Bring the x to the minus six
upstairs and make it x to the sixth, the numerator, and then I still have the y cubed
on the denominator. All that's raised to the three-halves power.
Using the product rule, I can rewrite the expression on the inside of the parentheses
as 25x to the tenth over y to the eighth.
Recall that we're allowed to distribute an exponent across a product or across a quotient.
When I distribute my three-halves power, I get 25 to the three-halves times x to the tenth
to the three-halves divided by y to the eighth to the three-halves. Now the power rule tells me
when I have a power to a power, I get to multiply the exponents. So I can rewrite this as 25 to
the three-halves times x to the tenth times three-halves over y to the eighth times three-halves.
In other words, 25 to the three-halves times x to the fifteenth over y to the twelfth.
Finally, I need to rewrite 25 to the three-halves. Since three-halves can be thought of as three
times one-half or as one-half times three, I can write 25 to the three-halves as 25 to the three
times one-half or as 25 to the one-half times three. Well, using the power rule in reverse,
I can think of this as 25 cubed to the one-half or as 25 to the one-half cubed.
Since when I take a power to a power, I multiply the exponents. 25 cubed to the one-half might be
hard to evaluate, since 25 cubed is a huge number. But 25 to the one-half is just the square root
of 25. So I have the square root of 25 cubed or 5 cubed, which is 125. Therefore, my original
expression is going to be 125x to the 15 over y to the twelfth. In this video, we use the exponent
rules to simplify complicated expressions. This video goes through a few tricks for simplifying
expressions with radicals in them. Recall that this notation means the nth root of x. So this
notation here means the cube root of eight, the number that when you cube it, you get eight. That
number would be two. When we write the root sign without a little number, that just means
the square root. So the two is implied. In this case, the square root of 25 is five, since five
squared is 25. Let's start by reviewing some rules for radical expressions. First, if we have the
radical of a product, we can rewrite that as the product of two radicals. For example, the square root
of nine times 16 is the same thing as a square root of nine times the square root of 16. You can
check that both of these evaluate to 12. Similarly, it's possible to distribute a radical sign
across division. The radical of a divided by b is the same thing as the radical of a divided by
the radical of b. For example, the cube root of 64 over eight is the same thing as the cube root
of 64 over the cube root of eight. And you can check that both of these evaluate to two.
You have to be a little bit careful, though, because it's not okay to distribute a radical
sign across addition. In general, the nth root of a plus b is not equal to the nth root of a
plus the nth root of b. And similarly, it's not okay to distribute a radical across subtraction.
If you're ever in doubt, you can always check with simple examples. For example, the square root
of one plus one is not the same thing as a square root of one plus a square root of one.
The right side evaluates to one plus one or two and the left side is square root of two and your
rational number. The second expression to show that that fails, I don't think it'll work to use
the square root of one minus one, it'll actually hold in that case. But I can show it's false by
using say the square root of two minus one, which does not equal the square root of two minus the
square root of one. You might notice that these rules for radicals, the ones that hold and the
ones that don't hold, remind you of rules for exponents. And that's no coincidence.
Because radicals can be written in terms of exponents. For example, if we look at the first
rule, we could rewrite this, the nth root of a times B is the same thing as the one over nth power.
And by exponent rules, I can distribute an exponent across multiplication. And so this
radical rule can be restated completely in terms of an exponent rule. Similarly, the second rule
can be restated in terms of exponents as a over B to the one over n is equal to a to the one over
n divided by B to the one over n. We can use the relationship between radicals and exponents
to rewrite a to the m over n. a to the m over n is the same thing as a to the m
with the nth root taken. It's also the same thing as the nth root of a all taken to the
mth power. To see why that's true, think about exponent rules. So a to the m over n is the
same thing as a to the m taken to the one over nth power. That's because when we take a power to a
power, we multiply exponents and m times one over n is equal to m over n. But a one over nth power
is the same thing as an nth root. And therefore, this expression is the same thing as this
expression. And that proves the first equivalence. The second equivalence can be proved similarly
by writing a to the m over n as a to the one over n times m. Again, this is worked because
when I take the power to the power, I multiply exponents one over n times m is the same thing
as m over n. But now, these two expressions are the same, because the one over nth power is the
same as the nth root. One mnemonic for remembering these relationships is flower over root. So flower
is like power and root is like root. So that tells us we can write a fractional exponent,
the m becomes the power and the n becomes the root in either of these two orders.
Now let's use these rules in some examples. If we want to compute 25 to the negative three
halves power, well, first I'll use my exponent rule to rewrite that negative exponent as one over
25 to the three halves power. Next, I'll use the power of a root mnemonic to rewrite this as
25 to the third power square rooted or as 25 square rooted to the third power.
I wrote the twos there for the square root for emphasis, but most of the time people will omit
this and just write the square root without a little number there. Now I could use either of
these two equivalent expressions to continue, but I'd rather use this one because it's easier
to compute without a calculator. The square root of 25 is just five. Five cubed is 125. So my answer
is one over 125. If I tried to compute the cube of 25 first, I'd get a huge number. In general,
it's usually easier to compute the root before the power when you're working without a calculator.
Now let's do an example simplifying a more complicated expression with exponents in it.
I want to take the square root of all this stuff. And since I don't really like negative exponents,
I'm first going to rewrite this as the square root of 60x squared y to the six over z to the 11th.
So I'll change that negative exponent to a positive exponent by moving this
factor to the denominator. Now when you're asked to simplify a radical expression, that generally
means to pull as much as possible out of the radical sign. To pull things out of the square root sign,
I'm going to factor my numbers and try to rewrite everything in terms of squares as much as possible
since the square root of a square, those two operations undo each other. So I'll show you
what I mean. First, I'll factor 60. So 60 is going to be two squared times three times five.
And I'll just copy everything over for now. Now I'll break things up into squares as much as
possible. So I've got a two squared times three times five. I've already got an x squared. I'll
write the y to the six as y squared times y squared times y squared. And I'll write the z to the
11th as z squared times z squared, I guess five times one, two, three, four, five times one extra
z. That should add up to z to the 11th if I add all those exponents together. Now I know that I can
distribute my radical sign across multiplication and division. So I'll write this with a zillion
different radicals here. And every time I see the square root of something squared, I can just
cancel those square roots and the squares out and get what's what's left here. So
so after doing that cancellation, I get two times the square root of three times five times x times
y times y times y over z times itself, I guess five times times the square root of z. And now I can
clean that up with exponents. I'll write that as the square root of 15. I guess two times the square
root of 15 times x times y cubed over z to the fifth, the square root of z. I'm going to leave
this example as is. But sometimes people prefer to rewrite radical expressions without radical
signs in the denominator. That's called rationalizing the denominator. I won't do it here, but I'll show
you how to do it in the next example. This example asks us to rationalize the denominator. That means
to rewrite as an equivalent expression without radical signs in the denominator.
To get rid of the radical sign in the denominator, I want to multiply my denominator by
square root of x. But I can't just multiply the denominator willy-nilly by something
unless I multiply the numerator by the same thing, so that I'm just multiplying my expression by one
in a fancy form and I don't change the value of my expression. Now if I just multiply together
numerators, 3x square root of x, and multiply denominators, square root of x times square root
of x is the square root of x squared, square root of x squared is just x. Now I can cancel my x's
from the numerator and denominator and my final answer is three times the square root of x. I
rationalize my denominator and the process got a nicer looking expression. In this video, we went
over the rules for radicals and we simplified some radical expressions by working with fractional
exponents, pulling things out of the radical sign, and rationalizing the denominator.
Hi class, happy snow day. Since class is canceled, I'm putting together this video with some
additional examples on simplifying radicals that I would have done in class. I hope this will help
you complete your assignment that's due tonight. Let's start with this example, asking us to simplify
the product of two radicals. I could simplify each radical separately and then multiply things
together, but I think it'll save me trouble if I multiply first and then simplify. So
I'm going to multiply these together since the product of two radicals is the radical of the
product, assuming everything's positive. I can rewrite my expression as the square root of,
let's see, five times 15, that's going to be 75, x times x cubed, that's x to the fourth, because
when I multiply two expressions, I add the exponents and y to the seventh times y cubed, that's going
to be y to the tenth, since seven plus three is ten. Now I want to simplify by pulling as much out
of the square root sign as I can. If 75 were a perfect square, I could just take the square root
of it, but since it's not, I'm going to factor it. So 75, let's see, that's 25 times three and 25
is five times five, so I can write that as five squared times three. Now I can write my square
root, let's see, so that's five squared times three times x to the fourth times y to the tenth.
Now since I know that the square root of anything squared is just that original thing,
assuming variables are positive, I can maybe rewrite this as by breaking everything up into
a bunch of squares. So let's see, I already have a square here, there's no hope for the three.
The x to the fourth, I can write that as x squared times x squared, right, that makes four x's,
and y to the tenth, I'm going to need five y squareds to get 10 y's out of that. One, two,
three, y squared, y squared. Now splitting up the square root back into a product of a bunch of
square roots, every time I see the square root of something squared, I just replace it with a
thing. So that's five, I still have the square root of three, that gives me x, x, y, y, y, y, y,
and I can rewrite that as five squared of three times x squared y to the fifth. So that's one
way to simplify this expression. Alternatively, I could complete this problem a little bit faster
the following way. I could go ahead and break up my five squared times three times x to the fourth
times y to the tenth. I'm going to break that up, go ahead and break that up as a product of square
roots. Now, the square root of five squared is certainly five, square root of three stays the
same, square root of x to the fourth is going to be x squared. There are a couple ways to see that.
One way is a square root of x fourth, that's x to the fourth to the one half power, since square
roots are the same as half powers. And now I can multiply my exponents to get my x squared.
Or alternatively, I can think of that because the square root of x to the fourth, that's the
square root of x squared squared. Since I take a power of power and multiply my exponents,
square root of something squared is just a thing. So that's x squared. Similarly, the square root of
y to the tenth, that's going to be y to the fifth. Notice I'm just taking half of the exponent. And
you can see that the same way. That's because if I do the square root of y to the tenth, that's
the same thing as y to the tenth to the one half, which is y to the 10 times one half, or y to the
fifth. Or alternatively, you can think of this as the square root of y to the tenth is the square
root of y to the fifth squared, which is y to the fifth. So if it weren't for all that little
side work I did, that would have this would have been a faster way to get to the same answer as before.
The next few examples have to do with rewriting expressions by rationalizing denominators. Please
pause the video for a moment and see if you can decide if these two expressions represent the same
thing or different things. In fact, they represent the same thing. And we can see that, that we can
transform a to look like b by doing something called rationalizing denominator, trying to get all the
square roots out of the denominator at the expense of maybe putting some more squares in the
numerator. So to rationalize the denominator in this case, since there's just that one, that one
piece with square roots in it, I'm going to multiply both the top and the bottom by the square root
of y, the thing that has the square root around it. If I multiply the bottom by the square root
of y, I have to multiply the top also so I won't change the value of my expression. This way I'm
just multiplying by one in a fancy form. Now, when I multiply fractions, I multiply the numerator,
and I multiply the denominator. Well, let's see the square root of y times the square root of y,
that's the square root of y squared, which is the same thing as just y. So I can bring my square
roots together and get three square root of xy over five y, which is exactly the second expression.
Here are two even crazier expressions. The last one's especially crazy. Again, try to decide if
these two represent the same thing or represent a different thing. Kind of surprisingly, they actually
represent the same thing still. And we can transform one to two by again rationalizing the
denominator. This time we're going to use something called the conjugate. And that's because we have
a difference in this case of two expressions, one of which has a square root in it. So when I have
the difference of two expressions, one of which with a square root in it, I find the conjugate
by taking the sum of those two expressions. If instead I had had the sum of two expressions,
then the conjugate would be the difference. Okay, so I'm going to multiply the top and the bottom
by this conjugate of the denominator. So let me move down here and rewrite with more space.
Once again, I have to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same thing so that
I'm not changing the value of my expression. I'm just multiplying by one in a fancy form.
Now let's look at what happens in the denominator first. I have to multiply three by three,
three by the square root of a negative square root of a by three, and negative square root of a by
square root of a. So that's going to give me three times three is nine plus three square root of a
minus three square root of a minus square root of a squared. So in a moment that I'll simplify to
these things cancel. So that'll be nine minus square root of a squared is a notice how I've
gotten rid of the square root of the denominator, which is why it's called rationalizing the
denominator. We get rid of the, I don't know, irrational numbers, the radical signs. Okay,
let's look at the numerator. So again, we're going to have four terms, this times this,
this times that, b times three, b times square root of a. That gives us 15a plus 5a square root of a
plus 3b plus b square root of a. Now that's starting to look similar to this expression here.
And in fact, we can see that it's exactly the same thing by turning our radicals into exponents.
So let's see, we still have the 15a. This is the same thing as 5a times a to the one half,
we still got the 3b, and we've got b times a to the one half. And now let's see a times a to the
one half here, that's really, I can add my exponents. So that's going to be 5a to the one
plus one half is three halves, 3b, b, a to the one half. And that's exactly what I have
in this expression, just in a slightly different order. So these really are the same, kind of weird.
Please pause the video and try your hand at rationalizing the denominator of this expression.
Since we have a sum of two expressions in the denominator, we want to multiply the numerator
and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. So that's square root of a minus one.
Now when we multiply out the numerator, we'll get four terms, square root of a squared,
let's see, minus the square root of a. And now we have seven times the square root of a.
And finally, seven times minus one, that's minus seven. On the denominator, we get the square root
of a squared minus the square root of a plus the square root of a minus one. Notice how the square
root things cancel, just like before, that's the whole magic of using the conjugate, it makes
those square roots cancel out. So now on the numerator, square root of a squared is a minus
the square root of a plus seven square root of a, that's a net of six square root of a minus seven.
And then on the denominator, we have a minus one. We've gotten rid of the square roots on the
denominator, rationalize the denominator. I'm happy leaving the square root in the numerator,
but if you want to, you can change it to a exponent instead, it's really up to you.
That's all the examples I have today. I hope you enjoy the snow, which hasn't started yet for me.
And please do spend some time to finish your Alex objective if you haven't done it already.
Goodbye. This video goes over some common methods of factoring. Recall that factoring
an expression means to write it as a product. So we could factor the number 30 by writing it as
six times five, where we could factor it more completely by writing it as two times three times
five. As another example, we could factor the expression x squared plus five x plus six by
writing it as x plus two times x plus three. In this video, I'll go over how I get from here to
here, how I know how to do the factoring. But for right now, I just want to review how I can go
backwards, how I can check that the factoring is correct. And that's just by multiplying out or
distributing. If I distribute x plus two times x plus three, then I multiply x by x, that gives me
x squared, x times three gives me three x, two times x gives me two x and two times three gives
me six. So that simplifies to x squared plus five x plus six, which checks out with what I started
with. So you can think of factoring as the opposite of distributing out. And you can always check
your factoring by distributing or multiplying out. A bit of terminology, when I think of an
expression as a sum of a bunch of things, then the things I sum up are called the terms. But if I
think of the same expression as a product of things, then the things that I multiply together
are called factors. Now let's get started on techniques of factoring. When I have to factor
something, I always like to start by pulling out the greatest common factor. The greatest common
factor means the largest thing that divides each of the terms. In this first example,
the largest thing that divides both 15 and 25x is five. So the GCF is five. So I pull the five out,
and then I divide each of the terms by that number. And so I get three plus five x.
Pause the video for a moment and see if you can find the greatest common factor
of x squared y and y squared x cubed. The biggest thing that divides both x squared y and y squared
x cubed is going to be x squared times y. One way to find this is to look for the power of x
that's smallest in each of these terms. So that's x squared. And the power of y that's smallest in
each of these terms is just y to the one or y. Now if I factor out the x squared y from each of
the terms, that's like dividing each term by x squared y. If I divide the first term by x squared
y, I just get one. If I divide the second term by x squared y, I'm going to be left with an x and a y.
I'll write this out on the side just to make it more clear y squared x cubed over x squared y,
that's like two y's and three x's on the top and two x's and a y on the bottom. So I'm left with
just an x and a y. So I'll write the x y here and I factored my expression. As always, I can check
my answer by multiplying out. So if I multiply out my factored expression, I get x squared y is the
first term and the second term, I get x there. Now let's see three x's multiplied together and two y's
multiplied together. And that checks out with what I started with. The next technique of factoring,
I'd like to go over, is factoring by grouping. In this example, notice that we have four terms.
Factoring by grouping is a handy method to look at if you have four terms in your expression,
you need to factor. In order to factor by grouping, I'm first going to factor out the greatest common
factor of the first two terms, and then separately factor out the greatest common factor of the last
two terms. The greatest common factor of x cubed and three x squared is x squared. So I factor out
the x squared and I get x plus three. And now the greatest common factor of four x and 12 is just four.
So I factor out the four from those two terms. Notice that the factor of x plus three now appears
in both pieces. So I can factor out the greatest common factor of x plus three. I think I'll factor
it out on the left side instead of the right. And now I have an x squared from this first piece. And I
have a four from this second piece. And that completes my factoring by grouping. You might
wonder if we could factor further by factoring the expression x squared plus four. But in fact,
as we'll see later, this expression, which is a sum of two squares x squared plus two squared
does not factor any further over the integers. Next, we'll do some factoring of quadratics.
A quadratic is an expression with a squared term, just a term with x in it, and a constant term
with no x's in it. I'd like to factor this expression as a product of x plus or minus some
number times x plus or minus some other number. The key idea is that if I can find those two
numbers, then if I were to distribute out this expression, those two numbers would have to
multiply to give me my constant term of eight. And these two numbers would end up having to add
to give me my negative six, because when I multiply out, this number will be a coefficient of x and
this number will be also another coefficient of x, they'll add together to the negative six.
So if I look at all the pairs of numbers that multiply together to give me eight,
so that could be one and eight, two and four, four and two, but that's really the same thing
as I had before. And that's sort of the same thing I had before. I shouldn't forget the negatives,
I could have negative one, negative eight, or I could have negative two, negative four, those
also multiply together to give me eight. Now I just have to find, see if there's a pair of these
numbers that add to negative six, and it's not hard to see that these ones will work. So now I can
write out my factoring as that would be x minus two times x minus four. And it's always a good
idea to check by multiplying out, I'm going to get x squared minus four x minus two x plus eight,
and that works out to just what I want. Now the second example is a bit more complicated because
now my leading coefficient, my coefficient of x squared is not just one, it's the number 10.
Now there are lots of different methods for approaching a problem like this, and I'm just
going to show you one method, my favorite method that uses factoring by grouping. But to start out,
I'm going to multiply my coefficient of x squared by my constant term, so I'm multiplying 10 by
negative six, that gives me negative 60. Now I'll also take my coefficient of x, the number 11,
and write that down here. Now I'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to give me negative
60, and add to give me 11. You might notice that this is exactly what we were doing in the previous
problem, it's just here we didn't have to multiply the coefficient of x squared by eight, because the
coefficient of x squared was just one. So to find the two numbers that multiply to negative 60 and
add to 11, you might just be able to come up with them in your head thinking about it, but if not,
you can figure it out pretty systematically by writing out all the factors, pairs of factors,
that multiply to negative 60. So I can start with negative one and 60, negative two and 30, negative
three and 20, and keep going like this until I have found factors that actually add together
to give me the number 11. And now that I look at it, I've already found them,
15 minus four gives me 11. So I don't have to continue with my chart of factors.
Now once I've found those factors, I write out my expression 10x squared, but instead of writing
11x, I write negative 4x plus 15x. Now I copy down the negative six. Notice that negative 4x plus 15x
equals 11x, that's how I chose those numbers. And so this expression is, evaluates as the same as
this expression, I haven't changed my expression. But I have turned it into something that I can
apply factoring by grouping on look, I've got four terms here. And so if I factor out my greatest
common factor of my first two terms, that's, let's see, I think it's 2x. So I factor out the 2x,
I get 5x minus two. And then I factor out the greatest common factor of 15x and negative six,
that would be three, I get a 5x minus two again, this is working beautifully. So I have a 5x minus
two in each part. And so I put the 5x minus two on the right, and I put what's left from these terms
in here. So that's 2x plus three. And I have factored my expression.
There are a couple of special kinds of expressions that appear frequently, that it's
handy to just memorize the formula for. So the first one is the difference of squares.
If you see something of the form a squared minus b squared, then you can factor that as a plus b
times a minus b. And let's just check that that works. If I do a plus b times a minus b and multiply
that out, I get a squared minus a b plus b a minus b squared and those middle two terms cancel out.
So it gives me back the difference of squares just like I want it. So for this first example,
if I think of x squared minus 16 as x squared minus four squared, then I can see that's a
difference of squares. And I can immediately write it as x plus four times x minus four.
And the second example, nine p squared minus one, that's the same thing as three p squared minus one
squared. So that's three p plus one times three p minus one.
Notice that if I have a sum of squares, for example,
x squared plus four, which is x squared plus two squared, then that does not factor.
The difference of squares formula doesn't apply. And there is no formula that applies for a sum of
squares. There is, however, a formula for both a difference of cubes and a sum of cubes. The
difference of cubes formula a cube minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared.
The formula for the sum of cubes is pretty much the same, you just switch the negative and positive
sign here and here. So that gives us a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared. As usual,
you can check these formulas by multiplying out. Let's look at one example of using these formulas,
y cube plus 27 is actually a sum of two cubes because it's y cubed plus three cubed. So I can
factor it using the sum of cubes formula by plugging in y for a and three for b.
That gives me y plus three times y squared minus y times three plus three squared. And I can clean
that up a little bit to read y plus three times y squared minus three y plus nine. So in this video,
we went over several methods of factoring. We did factoring out the greatest common factor.
We did factoring by grouping. We did factoring quadratics. And we did a difference of squares.
And we did a difference and a sum of cubes. In more complicated problems, you may need to apply
several of these techniques in order to get through a single problem. For example, you might need to
start by pulling out a greatest common factor and then do a factoring of quadratics or something
similar. Now go forth and factor. This video gives some additional examples of factoring.
Please pause the video and decide which of these first five expressions factor and which one does
not. The first expression can be factored by pulling out a common factor of x from each term.
So that becomes x times x plus one. The second example can be factored as a difference of two
squares. Since x squared minus 25 is something squared minus something else squared. And we know
that anytime we have something like a squared minus b squared, that's a plus b times a minus b.
So we can factor this as x plus five times x minus five. The third one is a sum of two squares.
There's no way to factor a sum of two squares over real numbers. So this is the one that does not
factor. Just for completeness, let's look at the next two. This next one does factor by grouping.
When we factor by grouping, we pull the biggest common factor out of the first two terms, that would
be an x squared. That becomes x squared times x plus two. And then we factor as much as we can out
the next two terms, that would be a three times x plus two. Notice that the x plus two factor now
occurs in both of the resulting terms. So we can pull that x plus two out and get x plus two times
x squared plus three. We can't factor any further because x squared plus three doesn't factor.
Finally, we have a quadratic. This also factors. And I like to factor these also using a factoring
by grouping trick. So first, what I do is I multiply the coefficient of x squared and the constant term.
Five times eight is 40. I'll write that on the top of my x. Now I take the coefficient of the x term,
the coefficient of the x term, that's negative 14. And I write that on the bottom part of the x.
Now I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to 40 and add to negative 14. Sometimes I can just
guess numbers like this. But if not, I start writing out factors of 40. So factors of 40,
I could do one times 40. Well, now I just noticed I'm trying to add to a negative number. So if I
use two positive factors, there's no way they're going to add to a negative number. It's better
for me to use negative numbers that factor 40. And negative times a negative still multiplies to 40,
but they have a chance of adding to a negative number. So but negative one and negative 40,
of course, don't work. They don't add to negative 14. They add to negative 41. So let me try some
other factors. The next biggest number that divides 40 besides one is two. So I'll try negative two
and negative 20. Those add to negative 22. That doesn't work. Next one that divides 40 would be
four. So I'll try negative four and negative 10. Aha, we have a winner. So negative four plus
negative 10 is negative 14. Negative four times negative 10 is positive 40. We've got it. All
right. So the next step is to use factoring by grouping. We're going to first split up this
negative 14x as negative 4x minus 10x and carry down the 8 and the 5x squared. Notice that this
works because I picked negative 4 and negative 10 to add up to negative 14. So so negative 4x minus
10x will add up to negative 14x. So I've got the same expression just just expanded out a little
bit. Now I have four terms I can do factoring by grouping. So I can group the first two terms and
factor out the biggest thing I can. That would be an x times 5x minus 4. And now I'll factor the
biggest thing I can out of these two numbers, including the negative. So that becomes, let's
see, I can factor out a negative two and that becomes 5x minus four since negative two times
minus four is eight. All right, I've got the same 5x plus four in both my terms. So factoring by
grouping is going swimmingly. I can factor out the 5x minus four from both those terms and I get
the x minus two. And I've factored this quadratic. If I want to, of course, I can always check my work
by distributing out by multiplying out. So a check here would be multiplying 5x times x is
5x squared 5x minus times minus two is minus 10x minus four times x is minus 4x and minus four times
minus two is plus eight. So let's see this does check out to exactly what it should be. So that was
the method of factoring a quadratic. And all of these factor except for the sum of squares.
So we saw that factoring by grouping is handy for factoring this expression here. It was also
handy for factoring the quadratic indirectly after splitting up the middle term into two terms. So
how can you tell when an expression is appropriate to factor by grouping? There's an easy way to
tell that it might be a candidate. And that's that it has four terms. So if you see four terms or
in the case of quadratic, you can split it up into four terms, then that's a good candidate for
factoring by grouping because you can group the first two terms group the second two terms factoring
by grouping all won't always work on on expressions with four terms. But but that's like the first
thing to look for. So let's just review what are the same main techniques of factoring. We saw
these on the previous page. We saw there was pull out common factors. There's difference of squares.
There's factoring by grouping. There's factoring quadratics.
And one more that I didn't mention is factoring sums and differences of cubes.
That uses the formulas a cube minus b cubed is a minus b times a squared plus a b plus b squared.
And a cubed plus b cubed is a plus b times a squared minus a b plus b squared.
One important tip when factoring. I always recommend doing this first pull out the common
factors first. That'll simplify things and making the rest of factoring easier. One more tip is
that you might need to do several of these factoring techniques in one problem. For example,
you might have to first pull out a common factor then factor a difference of squares. And then you
might notice that one of your factors is itself a difference of squares and you have to apply
a difference of squares again. So don't stop when you factor a little bit keep factoring as far as
you can go. Here are some extra examples of factoring quadratics for you to practice. Please
pause the video and give these a try. For the first one let's multiply two times negative 14.
That gives us negative 28 and then we'll bring the three down in the bottom of the x. Now we're
looking for two numbers that multiply to negative 28 and add to three. Well to multiply two numbers
to get a negative 28 will need one of them to be negative and one of them to be positive. So let's see.
One negative 128 or one negative 28 those don't work. Let's see negative 214 or two negative
14 those don't work. Hey I just noticed the positive number had better be bigger than the
negative number so they add to a positive number. Let's see what comes next. How about
negative 4 times 7 4 times negative 7. I think 4 negative 4 times 7 will work. So I'll write
those here negative 4 7. Copy down the 2 z squared and I'll split up the 3 z into negative 4 z plus
7 z and then minus 14. Now factoring by grouping pull out a 2 z that becomes z minus 2 pull out a
7 and that becomes z minus 2 again looking good. I've got 2 z plus 7 times z minus 2 as my factored
expression. My second expression I could work at the same way drawing my x and factoring by grouping
that kind of thing but it's actually going to be easier if I notice first that I can pull out a
common factor from all of my terms. That'll make things a lot simpler to deal with. So notice that
a 5 divides each of these terms and in fact I'm going to go ahead and pull out the negative 5 because
I don't like having negatives in front of my squared term. So I'm going to pull out a common
factor of negative 5. Again it would work if I forgot to do this but it would be a lot more
complicated. So negative 5 v squared this becomes minus no this becomes plus 9v since 9 times negative
5 is negative 45 and this becomes minus 10 since negative 10 times negative 5 is positive 50. Now
I can start my x and my factoring by grouping or I can use kind of a shortcut method which you may
have seen before. So I can just put v's here and then I know that whatever numbers go here
they're going to have to multiply to the negative 10 and they're going to have to add to the 9.
So that would be plus 10 and a minus 1 will do the trick. Those are all my factoring examples
for today. I hope you enjoy your snow morning and have a chance to spend some time working in Alex.
Bye. This video is about working with rational expressions. A rational expression is a fraction
usually with variables in it something like x plus 2 over x squared minus 3 is a rational expression.
In this video we'll practice adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing rational expressions
and simplifying them to lowest terms. We'll start with simplifying to lowest terms.
Recall that if you have a fraction with just numbers in it something like 21 over 45 we can
reduce it to lowest terms by factoring the numerator and factoring the denominator
and then canceling common factors. So in this example the 3's cancel and our fraction reduces
to 7 over 15. If we want to reduce a rational expression with variables in it to lowest terms
we proceed the same way. First we'll factor the numerator that's 3 times x plus 2 and then factor
the denominator. In this case it factors to x plus 2 times x plus 2. We could also write that as x plus
2 squared. Now we cancel the common factors and we're left with 3 over x plus 2. Definitely a
simpler way of writing that rational expression. Next let's practice multiplying and dividing.
Recall that if we multiply two fractions with just numbers in them we simply multiply the
numerators and multiply the denominators. So in this case we would get 4 times 2 over 3 times 5 or
8 fifteenths. If we want to divide two fractions like in the second example then we can rewrite it
as multiplying by the reciprocal of the fraction on the denominator. So here we get
4 fifths times 3 halves and that gives us 12 tenths but actually we could reduce that fraction to
6 fifths. We use the same rules when we compute the product or quotient of two rational expressions
with the variables in them. Here we're trying to divide two rational expressions so instead
we can multiply by the reciprocal. I call this flipping and multiplying
and now we just multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.
It might be tempting at this point to multiply out to distribute out the numerator and the denominator
but actually it's better to leave it in this factored form and factor it even more completely.
That way we'll be able to reduce the rational expression to cancel the common factors. So
let's factor it even more. The x squared plus x factors as x times x plus 1 and x squared minus
16 that's a difference of two squares that's x plus 4 times x minus 4. The denominator is already
fully factored so we'll just copy it over and now we can cancel common factors here and here
and we're left with x times x minus 4. This is our final answer.
Adding and subtracting fractions is a little more complicated because we first have to find a
common denominator. A common denominator is an expression that both denominators divide into.
It's usually best at the long run to use the least common denominator which is the smallest
expression that both denominators divide into. In this example if we just want a common denominator
we could use 6 times 15 which is 90 because both 6 and 15 divide evenly into 90 but if we want the
least common denominator the best way to do that is to factor the two denominators. So 6 is 2 times 3
15 is 3 times 5 and then put together only the factors we need for both 6 and 15 to divide our
number. So if we just use 2 times 3 times 5 which is 30 we know that 2 times 3 will divide it
and 3 times 5 will also divide it and we won't be able to get a denominator any smaller because
we need the factors 2, 3, and 5 in order to ensure both these numbers divide it.
Once we have our least common denominator we can rewrite each of our fractions in terms of that
denominator. So 7, 6 I need to get a 30 in the denominator so I'm going to multiply that by
5 over 5. I multiply by the factors that are missing from the current denominator in order to
get my least common denominator of 30. For the second fraction 4 fifteenths 15 times 2 is 30 so
I'm going to multiply by 2 over 2. Now I can rewrite this as 35 thirtieths minus 8 thirtieths
and now that I have a common denominator I can just subtract my two numerators and I get 27 thirtieths.
If I factor I can reduce this to 3 squared over 2 times 5 which is 9 tenths.
The process for finding the sum of two rational expressions with variables in them
follows the exact same process. First we have to find the least common denominator. I'll do that
by factoring the two denominators. So 2x plus 2 factors as 2 times x plus 1, x squared minus 1
that's a difference of 2 squared so that's x plus 1 times x minus 1. Now for the least common
denominator I'm going to take all the factors I need to get an expression that each of these
divides into so I need the factor 2, I need the factor x plus 1, and I need the factor x minus 1.
I don't have to repeat the factor x plus 1, I just need to have it one time
and so I will get my least common denominator 2 times x plus 1 times x minus 1. I'm not going
to bother multiplying this out, it's actually better to leave it in factored form to help me
simplify later. Now I can rewrite each of my two rational expressions by multiplying
by whatever is missing from the denominator in terms of the least common denominator.
So what I mean is I can rewrite 3 over 2x plus 2. I'll write the 2x plus 2 as 2 times x plus 1,
I'll write it in factored form. And then I notice that compared to the least common denominator
I'm missing the factor of x minus 1. So I multiply the numerator and the denominator
by x minus 1. I just need it in the denominator but I can't get away with just multiplying by
the denominator without changing my expression. I have to multiply by it on the numerator and
the denominator so I'm just multiplying by 1 in a fancy form and not changing the value here.
So now I do the same thing for the second rational expression. I'll write the denominator
in factored form to make it easier to see what's missing from the denominator. What's missing
in this denominator compared to my least common denominator is just the factor 2.
So I'll multiply the numerator and the denominator by 2. Now I can rewrite everything so the first
rational expression becomes 3 times x minus 1 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 and the second one
becomes 5 times 2 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1. Notice that I now have a common denominator
so I can just add together my numerators. So I get 3 times x minus 1 plus 10 over 2 times x plus
1 x minus 1. I'd like to simplify this and the best way to do that is to leave the denominator
in factored form but I do have to multiply out the numerator so that I can add things together.
So I get 3x minus 3 plus 10 over 2 times x plus 1 x minus 1 or 3x plus 7 over 2 times x plus 1 x
minus 1. Now 3x plus 7 doesn't factor and there's therefore no factors that I can cancel out so
this is already reduced as much as it can be. This is my final answer.
In this video we saw how to simplify rational expressions to lowest terms
by factoring and canceling common factors. We also saw how to multiply rational expressions
by multiplying the numerator and multiplying the denominator. How to divide rational expressions
by flipping and multiplying and how to add and subtract rational expressions by writing them
in terms of the least common denominator. This video is about solving quadratic equations.
A quadratic equation is an equation that contains the square of the variable say x squared but no
higher powers of x. The standard form for a quadratic equation is the form ax squared plus bx
plus c equals 0 where a, b, and c represent real numbers and a is not 0 so that we actually have
an x squared term. Let me give you an example. 3x squared plus 7x minus 2 equals 0 is a quadratic
equation in standard form. Here a is 3, b is 7, and c is minus 2. The equation 3x squared equals
minus 7x plus 2 is also a quadratic equation. It's just not in standard form. The key steps
to solving quadratic equations are usually to write the equation in standard form and then either
factor it or use the quadratic formula which I'll show you later in this video.
Let's start with the example y squared equals 18 minus 7y. Here our variable is y and we need to
rewrite this quadratic equation in standard form. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides
and adding 7y to both sides. That gives us the equation y squared minus 18 plus 7y equals 0
and I can rearrange a little bit to get y squared plus 7y minus 18 equals 0. Now I've got my equation
in standard form. Next I'm going to try to factor it. So I need to look for two numbers
that multiply to negative 18 and add to 7. Two numbers that work are 9 and negative 2 so I can
factor my expression on the left as y plus 9 times y minus 2 equals 0. Now anytime you have two
quantities that multiply together to give you 0, either the first quantity has to be 0 or the second
quantity has to be 0 or I suppose they both could be 0 in some situations. This is really handy
because that means that I know that either y plus 9 equals 0 or y minus 2 equals 0. So I can as my
next step set my factors equal to 0. So y plus 9 equals 0 or y minus 2 equals 0 which means that y
equals negative 9 or y equals 2. It's not a bad idea to check that those answers actually work by
plugging them into the original equation. Negative 9 squared does that equal 18 minus 7 times negative
9 and you can work out that it does and similarly 2 squared equals 18 minus 7 times 2. In the next
example let's find solutions of the equation w squared equals 121. This is a quadratic equation
because it's got a square of my variable w. I can rewrite it in standard form by subtracting 121
from both sides. Notice that a is equal to 1, b is equal to 0 because there's no w term and c is
equal to negative 121 in the standard form aw squared plus bw plus c equals 0. Next step I'm
going to try to factor this expression. So since 121 is 11 squared this is a difference of two
squares and it factors as w plus 11 times w minus 11 is equal to 0. If I set the factors equal to 0
I get w plus 11 equals 0 or w minus 11 equals 0 so w equals minus 11 or w equals 11. In this example
I could have solved the equation more simply. I could have instead said that if w squared is 121
then w has to equal plus or minus the square root of 121. In other words w is plus or minus 11.
If you solve the equation this way it's important to remember the plus or minus
since minus 11 squared equals 121 just like 11 squared does. Now let's find the solutions
for the equation x times x plus 2 equals 7. Some people might be tempted to say that oh if two
numbers multiply to equal 7 then one of them better equal 1 and the other equal 7 or maybe negative 1
negative 7 but that's faulty reasoning in this case because x and x plus 2 don't have to be whole
numbers. They could be crazy fractions or even irrational numbers. So instead let's rewrite
this equation in standard form. To do that I'm first going to multiply out so x times x is x
squared x times 2 is 2x that equals 7 and I'll subtract the 7 from both sides to get x squared
plus 2x minus 7 is 0. Now I'm looking to factor it so I need two numbers that multiply to negative
7 and add to 2. Since the only way to factor negative 7 is as negative 1 times 7 or 7 times
negative 1 it's easy to see that there are no whole numbers that will work so there's no way
to factor this expression over the integers. Instead let's use the quadratic equation.
So we have our leading coefficient of x squared is 1 so a is 1, b is 2 and c is minus 7 and we're
going to plug that into the quadratic equation which goes x equals negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. Different people have different ways of remembering
this formula. I'd like to remember it by seeing it x equals negative b plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a but you can use any new monarchy like. Anyway plugging in here
we have x equals negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 2 squared minus 4 times 1 times
negative 7. It's important to remember the negative 7 there all over 2 times 1. Now 2 squared is 4
and 4 times 1 times negative 7 is negative 28 so this whole quantity under the square root sign
becomes 4 minus negative 28 or 32 so I can rewrite this as x equals negative 2 plus or minus the
square root of 32 all over 2. Since 32 is 16 times 2 and 16 is a perfect square I can rewrite this
as negative 2 plus or minus the square root of 16 times the square root of 2 over 2 which is negative
2 plus or minus 4 times the square root of 2 over 2. Next I'm going to split up my fraction
as negative 2 over 2 plus or minus 4 square root of 2 over 2 and then simplify those fractions.
This becomes negative 1 plus or minus 2 square root of 2 so my answers are negative 1 plus 2
square root of 2 and negative 1 minus 2 square root of 2 and if I need a decimal answer for any
reason I could work those out on my calculator. As our final example let's find all real solutions
for the equation 1 half y squared equals 1 third y minus 2. I'll start as usual by putting it in
standard form so that gives me 1 half y squared minus 1 third y plus 2 equals 0. I could go ahead
and start trying to factor or use the quadratic formula right now but I find fractional coefficients
kind of annoying so I'd like to get rid of them by doing what I call clearing the denominator that
means I'm going to multiply the whole entire equation by the least common denominator. In this
case the least common denominator is two times three or six so I'll multiply the whole equation
by six. I have to make sure I multiply both sides of the equation but in this case six times zero
is just zero and when I distribute the six I get three y squared minus two y plus 12 equals zero.
Now I could try to factor this but I think it's easier probably just to plunge in and use the
quadratic formula so I get x equals negative b that's negative negative two or two plus
reminds the square root of b squared minus four times a times c all over two a. Working out the
stuff on the square root sign negative two squared is four and here we have let's see 144.
So this simplifies to x equals two plus or minus the square root of four minus 144 that's negative
140 all over six. Well if you're concerned about the negative number under the square root sign
you should be. We can't take the square root of a negative number and get and and get a real
number as our answer there's no real number whose square is a negative number and therefore
our conclusion is we have no real solutions to this quadratic equation.
In this video we solved some quadratic equations by first writing them in standard form
and then either factoring or using the quadratic formula. In some examples factoring doesn't work
it's not possible to factor the equation but in fact using the quadratic formula will always work
even if it's also possible to solve it by factoring. So you can't really lose by using the
quadratic formula it's just sometimes it'll be faster to factor instead. This video is about
solving equations with absolute values in them. Recall that the absolute value of a positive
number is just the number but the absolute value of a negative number is its opposite. In general
I think of the absolute value of a number as representing its distance from zero on the number
line the number four and the number negative four are both at distance four from zero and so the
absolute value of both of them is four. Similarly if I write the equation the absolute value of x
is three that means that x has to be three units away from zero on the number line
and so x would have to be either a negative three or three. Let's start with the equation three times
the absolute value of x plus two equals four. I'd like to isolate the absolute value part of the
equation. I can do this by starting with my original equation subtracting two from both sides
and dividing both sides by three.
Now I'll think in terms of distance. On a number line the absolute value of x is two thirds means
that x is two thirds away from zero so x could be here or here at negative two thirds or at two
thirds and the answer to my equation is x is negative two thirds or two thirds. I can check my answers
by plugging in. Three times the absolute value of negative two thirds plus two I need to check
if that equals four. Well the absolute value of negative two thirds is just two thirds so this
is three times two thirds plus two which works out to four. Similarly if I plug in positive two thirds
it also works out to give me a correct answer. This second example is a little different because
the absolute value sign is around a more complicated expression not just around the x.
I would start by isolating the absolute value part
but it's already isolated. So I'll just go ahead and jump to thinking about distance
on the number line. So on my number line the whole expression three x plus two is supposed
to be at a distance of four from zero. So that means that three x plus two is here at four
or three x plus two is at negative four. I'll write those as equations. Three x plus two equals four
or three x plus two is minus four and then I can solve. So this becomes three x equals two or x
equals two thirds and over here I get three x equals minus six or x equals minus two. Finally
I'll check my answers. I'll leave it to you to verify that they both work. A common mistake on
absolute value equations is to get rid of the absolute value signs like we did here and then
just solve for one answer instead of solving for both answers. Another mistake sometimes people
make is once they get the first answer they just assume that the negative of that works also
but that doesn't always work. In the first example our two answers were both the negatives of each
other but in our second examples our two answers were not just the opposites of each other one was
two thirds and the other was negative two. In this third example let's again isolate the absolute
value part of the equation. So starting with our original equation we can subtract 16 from both sides
and divide both sides by five or equivalently multiply by one-fifth.
Now let's think about distance on the number line. We have an absolute value
needs to equal negative three so that means whatever is inside the absolute value sign
needs to be at distance negative three from zero. Well you can't be at distance negative three from
zero. Another way of thinking about this is you can't have the absolute value of something and end
up with a negative number absolute value is always positive or zero so this equation doesn't actually
make sense and there are no solutions to this equation. In this video we solved absolute value
equations. In many cases an absolute value equation will have two solutions but in some cases it'll
have no solutions and occasionally it'll have just one solution. This video is about solving
rational equations. A rational equation like this one is an equation that has rational expressions in
it in other words an equation that has some variables in the denominator. There are several
different approaches for solving a rational equation but they all start by finding the least common
denominator. In this example the denominators are x plus three and x we can think of one as
just having a denominator of one. Since the denominators don't have any factors in common
I can find the least common denominator just by multiplying them together.
My next step is going to be clearing the denominator. By this I mean that I multiply
both sides of my equation by this least common denominator x plus three times x. I multiply it
on the left side of the equation and I multiply by the same thing on the right side of the equation.
Since I'm doing the same thing to both sides of the equation I don't change the value of the
equation. Multiplying the least common denominator on both sides of the equation is equivalent to
multiplying it by all three terms in the equation. I can see this when I multiply out
I'll rewrite the left side the same as before pretty much and then I'll distribute the right side
to get x plus three times x times one plus x plus three times x times one over x. So I've actually
multiplied the least common denominator by all three terms of my equation. Now I can have a blast
cancelling things. The x plus three cancels with the x plus three on the denominator. The
here are nothing cancels out because there's no denominator and here the x in the numerator
cancels with the x in the denominator. So I can rewrite my expression as x squared equals x plus
three times x times one plus x plus three. Now I'm going to simplify. So I'll leave the x squared
alone on this side I'll distribute out x squared plus three x plus x plus three. Hey look the x
squares cancel on both sides and so I get zero equals four x plus three. So four x is negative
three and x is negative three fourths. Finally I'm going to plug in my answer to check. This is a
good idea for any kind of equation but it's especially important for a rational equation
because occasionally for rational equations you'll get what's called extraneous solutions. Solutions
that don't actually work in your original equation because they make the denominator zero. Now in
this example I don't think we're going to get any extraneous equations because negative three fourths
is not going to make any of these denominators zero. So it should work out fine when I plug in.
If I plug in
I get this. I can simplify the denominator here negative three fourths plus three. Three is 12
fourths that becomes nine fourths and this is one. I'll flip and multiply to get minus
four thirds. So here I can simplify my complex fraction. It ends up being negative three ninths
and one minus four thirds is negative one third. So that all seems to check out.
And so my final answer is x equals negative three fourths. This next example looks a little
trickier and it is but the same approach will work. First I'll find the least common denominator.
So here my denominators are c minus five c plus one and c squared minus four c minus five. I'm going
to factor that as c minus five times c plus one. Now my least common denominator needs to have
just enough factors to that each of these denominators divide into it. So I need the factor
c minus five. I need the factor c plus one and now I've already got all the factors I need for
this denominator. So here is my least common denominator. Next step is to clear the denominators.
So I do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by my least common denominator. In fact,
I can just multiply each of the three terms by this least common denominator.
I went ahead and wrote my third denominator in factored form to make it easier to see what cancels.
Now cancelling time dies. This dies and both of those factors die. Canceling out the denominators,
the whole point of multiplying by the least common denominator, you're multiplying by something that's
big enough to kill every single denominator. So you don't have to deal with denominators anymore.
So you don't have to deal with denominators anymore. Now I'm going to simplify by multiplying out.
So I get, let's see, c plus one times four c, that's four c squared plus four c. Now I get minus
just c minus five. And then over here I get three c squared plus three. I can rewrite the minus
quantity c minus five as minus c plus five. And now I can subtract the three c squared from both
sides to get just a c squared over here. And the four c minus c that becomes a three c.
And finally I can subtract the three from both sides to get c squared plus three c plus two
equals zero. I've got myself a quadratic equation. It looks like a nice one that factors. So this
factors to c plus one times c plus two equals zero. So either c plus one is zero or c plus two is
zero. So c equals negative one or c equals negative two. Now let's see, we need to still check our
answers. Without even going to the trouble of calculating anything, I can see that c equals
negative one is not going to work. Because if I plug it in to this denominator here, I get a
denominator of zero, which doesn't make sense. So c equals minus one is an extraneous solution.
It doesn't actually satisfy my original equation. And so I can just cross it right out.
c equals negative two. I can go if I go ahead and that doesn't make any of my denominator zero. So
if I haven't made any mistakes, it should satisfy my original equation. But I'll just plug it in to be
sure. And after some simplifying, I get a true statement. So my final answer is c equals negative
two. In this video, we solved a couple of rational equations using the method of finding
the least common denominator, and then clearing the denominator. We cleared the denominator by
multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common denominator or equivalently multiplying
each of the terms by that denominator. There's another equivalent method that some people prefer.
It still starts out the same, we find the least common denominator, but then we write all the
fractions over that least common denominator. So in this example, we'd still use the least
common denominator of x plus three times x. But our next step would be to write each of
these rational expressions over that common denominator by multiplying the top and the
bottom by the appropriate things. So one, in order to get the common denominator of x plus
three x, I need to multiply the top and the bottom by x plus three times x, one over x,
I need to multiply the top and the bottom just by x plus three, since that's what's missing
from the denominator x. Now if I simplify a little bit, let's see, this is x squared over that
common denominator. And here I have just x plus three times x over that denominator. And here I
have x plus three over that common denominator. Now add together my fractions on the right side.
So they have a common denominator. So this is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And now
I have two fractions that have that are equal that have the same denominator. Therefore,
their numerators have to be equal also. So the next step is to set the numerators equal.
So I get x squared is x plus three times x plus x plus three. And if you look back at the previous
way we solved this equation, you'll recognize this equation. And so from here on, we just continue
as before. When choosing between these two methods, I personally tend to prefer the
clear the denominators method because it's a little bit less writing. You don't have to,
you get rid of those denominators earlier, you don't have to write them as many times.
But some people find this one a little bit easier to remember, a little easier to understand,
either of these methods is fine. One last caution, don't forget at the end to check your solutions
and eliminate any extraneous solutions. These will be solutions that make the
denominators of your original equations go to zero. This video is about solving radical equations.
That is, equations like this one that have square root signs in them or cube roots or any other kind
of radical. When I see an equation with a square root in it, I really want to get rid of the square
root. But it'll be easiest to get rid of the square root. If I first isolate the square root.
In other words, I want to get the term with the square root in it on one side of the equation
by itself and everything else on the other side of the equation. If I start with my original
equation x plus the square root of x equals 12, and I subtract x from both sides, then that does
isolate the square root term on the left side with everything else on the right.
Once I've isolated the term with the square root, I'm going to get rid of the square root.
And I'll do that by squaring both sides of my equation. So I'll take the square root of x equals
12 minus x and square both sides. Now the square root of x squared is just x, taking the square
root and then squaring those operations undo each other. To work out 12 minus x squared, I'll
write it out and distribute 12 times 12 is 144. 12 times minus x is minus 12 x. I get another
minus 12 x from here. And finally minus x times minus x is positive x squared. So I can combine
my minus 12 x's that's minus 24 x. And now I can subtract x from both sides to get zero equals
144 minus 25 x plus x squared. That's a quadratic equation. I'll rewrite it
in a little bit more standard form here. So now I've got a familiar quadratic equation
with no radical signs left in my equation. I'll just proceed to solve it like I usually do for
a quadratic. I'll try to factor it. So I'm going to look for two numbers that multiply to 144 and
add to minus 25. Well, I know I'm going to need negative numbers to get to negative 25. And in
fact, I'll need two negative numbers. So they still multiply to a positive number. So I'll start
listing some factors of 144. I could have negative one and a negative 144 negative two and negative
72 negative four negative 36 and so on. Once I've listed out the possible factors, it's not hard to
find the two that add to negative 25. So that's negative nine and negative 16. So now I can factor
my quadratic equation as x minus nine times x minus 16 equals zero. That means that x minus
nine is zero or x minus 16 is zero. So x equals nine or x equals 16. I'm almost done. But there's one
last very important step. And that's to check the solutions so that we can eliminate any extraneous
solutions. An extraneous solution is a solution that we get that does not actually satisfy our
original equation. And extraneous solutions can happen when you're solving equations with radicals
in them. So let's first check x equals nine. If we plug in to our original equation, we get nine
plus the square root of nine and we want that to equal 12. Well, the square root of nine is three,
and nine plus three does indeed equal 12. So that solution checks out. Now let's try x equals 16.
Plugging in we get 16 plus the square root of 16. And that's supposed to equal 12. Well, that says 16
plus four is supposed to equal 12. But that most definitely is not true. And so x equals 16 turns
out to be extraneous solution. And our only solution is x equals nine.
This next equation might not look like an equation involving radicals. But in fact, we can think of
a fractional exponent as being a radical in disguise. Let's start by doing the same thing we
did on the previous problem by isolating. This time we'll isolate the part of the equation
that involves the fractional exponent. So I'll start with the original equation,
two times p to the fourth fifths equals one eighth, and I'll divide both sides by two. Or
equivalently, I can multiply both sides by one half. That gives me p to the fourth fifths equals
one sixteenth. And I've effectively isolated the part of the equation with the fractional exponent
as much as possible. Now, in the previous example, the next step was to get rid of the radical. In
this example, we're going to get rid of the fractional exponent. And I'm going to actually do
this in two stages. First, I'm going to raise both sides to the fifth power.
That's because when I take an exponent to an exponent, I multiply my exponents. And so
that becomes just p to the fourth equals one sixteenth to the fifth power. Now I'm going to
get rid of the fourth power by raising both sides to the one fourth power or by taking the fourth
root. There's something that you need to be careful about though, when taking an even root,
or the one over an even number power, you always have to consider plus or minus your answer.
It's kind of like when you write x squared equals four, and you take the square root of both sides,
x could equal plus or minus the square root of four, right, x could equal plus or minus two,
since minus two squared is for just as well as two squared. So that's why when you take an even root
or a one over an even power of both sides, you always need to include the plus or minus sign.
When it's an odd root or one over an odd power, you don't need to do that.
If you had something like x cubed equals negative eight, then x equals the cube root of negative
eight, which is negative two would be your only solution. You don't need to do the plus or minus
because positive two wouldn't work. So that aside explains why we need this plus or minus power.
And now p to the four to the one fourth, when I raise a power to a power and multiply by exponents,
so that's just p to the one, which is equal to plus or minus one sixteenth to the fifth power
to the one fourth power. Now I just need to simplify this expression. I don't really want to
raise one sixteenth to the fifth power, because 16 to the fifth power is like a really huge number.
So I think I'm actually going to rewrite this first as p equals plus or minus one sixteenth.
I'll write it back as the five fourths power again. And as I continue to solve using my exponent rules,
I'm going to prefer to write this as one sixteenth to the fourth root to the fifth power,
because it's going to be easier to take the fourth root. Let's see the fourth root of one
sixteenth, this is the same thing as the fourth root of one over the fourth root of 16,
raise all that to the fifth power, fourth root of one is just one, and the fourth root of 16 is two,
raise that to the fifth power. That's just going to be one to the fifth over two to the fifth,
which is plus or minus one thirty seconds.
The last step is to check answers. So I have the two answers, p equals one thirty second,
and p equals minus one thirty second. And if I plug those both in
one thirty second to the fourth fifth power, that gives me two times one to the fourth fifth power
over thirty two to the fourth fifth power, which is two times one over thirty two fifth
root of to the fourth power, fifth root of 32 is two, raise that to the fourth power,
I get 16, so this is two times one sixteenth, which is one eighth, just as we wanted in the
original equation up here. Similarly, we can check that the p equals negative one thirty second
actually does satisfy the equation. I'll leave that step to the viewer.
So our two solutions are p equals one over thirty two, and p equals minus one over thirty two.
I do want to point out an alternate approach to getting rid of the fractional exponent.
We could have gotten rid of it all in one fell swoop by raising both sides of our equation
to the five fourths power. Five fourths is the reciprocal of four fifths. So when I use my
exponent rules and say that when I raise the power to the power, I multiply my exponents,
that gives me p to the four fifths times five fourths is plus or minus one sixteenth to the
five fourths. In other words, p to the one power, which is just p is plus or minus one sixteenth
to the five fourths. So that's an alternate and possibly faster way to get to the solution.
Once again, the plus or minus comes from the fact that when we take the five fourths power,
we're really taking an even root, a fourth root. And so we need to consider both positive and negative
answers. This video is about solving radical equations, that is, equations like this one
that have square root signs in them, or cube roots, or any other kind of radical.
In this video, we solved radical equations by first isolating the radical sign or the fractional
exponent, and then removing the radical sign or the fractional exponent by either squaring
both sides or taking the reciprocal power of both sides. This video is about solving inequalities
that have absolute value signs in them. Let's look at the inequality absolute value of x is less
than five on the number line. Thinking of absolute value as distance, this means that the distance
between x and zero is less than five units. So x has to live somewhere in between negative five
and five. We can express this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative
five is less than x, which is less than five. Or we can use interval notation, soft bracket
negative five, five, soft bracket. Both of these formulations are equivalent to the original one,
but don't involve the absolute value signs. In the second example, we're looking for the values of x
for which the absolute value of x is greater than or equal to five. On the number line,
this means that the distance of x from the zero is got to be bigger than or equal to five units.
A distance bigger than five units means that x has to live somewhere over here, or somewhere over
here, where it's farther than five units away from zero. Of course, x could also have a distance
equal to five units. So I'll fill in that dot and shade in the other parts of the number line
that satisfy my inequality. Now I can rewrite the inequality without the absolute value symbols
by saying that x is less than or equal to negative five, or x is greater than or equal to five.
I could also write this in interval notation,
soft bracket negative infinity, negative five, hard bracket. And the second part is hard bracket
five, infinity, soft bracket. I combine these with a U for union, because I'm trying to describe
all these points on the number line together with all these other points.
Let's take this analysis a step further with a slightly more complicated problem.
Now I want the absolute value of three minus two t to be less than four.
An absolute value less than four means a distance less than four on the number line.
But it's not the variable t that lives in here at a distance of less than four from zero,
it's the whole expression three minus two t. So three minus two t lives somewhere in here. And I
can rewrite this as an inequality without absolute value signs by saying negative four is less than
three minus two t is less than four. Now I have a compound inequality that I can solve the usual
way. First, I'll subtract three from all three sides to get negative seven is less than negative
two t is less than one. And now I'll divide all three sides by negative two. Since negative two
is a negative number, this reverses the directions of the inequalities. Simplifying I get seven halves
is greater than t is greater than negative one half. So my final answer on the number line
looks like all the stuff between negative a half and seven halves,
but not including the endpoints and an interval notation I can write this soft bracket negative
a half seven halves soft bracket. Please pause the video and try the next problem on your own.
Thinking in terms of distance, this inequality says that the distance between the expression
three minus two t and zero is always bigger than four. Let me draw this on the number line.
If three minus two t has a distance bigger than four from zero, then it can't be in this region
that's near zero, it has to be on the outside in one of these two regions.
That is three minus two t is either less than negative four, or three minus two t is bigger than
four. I'll solve these two inequalities separately. The first one subtracting three from both sides,
I get negative two t is less than negative seven, dividing by negative two, I get t is bigger than
seven halves. And then on the other side, I get negative two t is greater than one. So t is less
than negative one half. I had to flip inequalities in the last step due to dividing by a negative
number. So let's check this out on the number line again. The first piece says that t is greater than
seven halves. I'll draw that over here. And the second piece says that t is less than negative
one half. I'll draw that down here. Because these two statements are joined with an or,
I'm looking for the t values that are in this one, or in this one. That is, I want both of these
regions put together. So in interval notation, this reads negative infinity to negative one
half, soft bracket union, soft bracket seven halves to infinity. This last example looks
more complicated. But if I simplify first and isolate the absolute value part, it looks pretty
much like the previous ones. So I'll start by subtracting seven from both sides. And then I'll
divide both sides by two. Now I'll draw my number line. And I'm looking for this expression 4x plus
five to always have distance greater than or equal to negative three from zero. Wait a second.
Distance greater than or equal to negative three well distance is always greater than or equal to
negative three it's always greater than or equal to zero. So this in fact is always true.
And so the answer to my inequality is all numbers between negative infinity and infinity. In other
words, all real numbers. When solving absolute value inequalities, it's good to think about distance.
An absolute value of something that's less than a number means that whatever's inside the absolute
value signs is close to zero. On the other hand, an absolute value of something being greater than
a number means that whatever's inside the absolute value sign is far away from zero. Because its
distance from zero is bigger than a certain number. Drawing these pictures on the number line is a
helpful way to rewrite the absolute value inequality as an inequality that doesn't contain
an absolute value sign. In this case, it would be negative three is less than x plus two is less
than three. And the other case, it would be either x plus two is less than negative three or x plus
two is greater than three. This video is about solving linear inequalities. Those are inequalities
like this one, that involve a variable here x, but don't involve any x squared or other higher
power terms. The good news is, we can solve linear inequalities just like we'd solve linear equations
by distributing, adding and subtracting terms to both sides and multiplying and dividing by
numbers on both sides. The only thing that's different is that if you multiply or divide
by a negative number, then you need to reverse the direction of the inequality. For example,
if we had the inequality negative x is less than negative five, and we wanted to multiply both sides
by negative one to get rid of the negative signs, we'd have to also switch or reverse the inequality.
With this caution in mind, let's look at our first example. Since our variable x is trapped in
parentheses, I'll distribute the negative five to free it from the parentheses. That gives me
negative five x minus 10 plus three is greater than eight. Negative 10 plus three is negative seven.
So I'll rewrite this as negative five x minus seven is greater than eight. Now I'll add seven to
both sides to get negative five x is greater than 15. Now I'd like to divide both sides by negative
five. Since negative five is a negative number, that reverses the inequality. So I get x is
less than 15 divided by negative five. In other words, x is less than negative three.
If I wanted to graph this on a number line, I just need to put down a negative three,
an open circle around it, and shade into the left. I use an open circle because x is strictly less
than negative three and can't equal negative three. If I wanted to write this in interval
notation, I've read it as soft bracket, negative infinity, negative three, soft bracket. Again,
the soft bracket is because the negative three is not included. This next example is an example
of a compound inequality. It has two parts, either this statement is true or this statement is true.
I want to find the values of x that satisfy either one. I'll solve this by working out each part
separately, and then combining them at the end. For the inequality on the left, I'll copy it over
here. I'm going to add four to both sides, then subtract x from both sides, and then divide both
sides by two. I didn't have to reverse the inequality sign because I divided by a positive number.
On the right side, I'll copy the equation over, subtract one from both sides, and divide both
sides by six. Nine six is the same as three halves. Now I'm looking for the x values that
make this statement true, or make this statement true. Let me graph this on a number line.
x is less than or equal to negative two, means I put a filled in circle there,
and graph everything to the left. x is greater than three halves, means I put an empty circle here,
and shade in everything to the right. My final answer includes both of these pieces, which I'll
reshade in green, because x is allowed to be in either one or the other. Finally, I can write
this in interval notation. The first piece on the number line can be described as soft bracket
negative infinity, negative two hard bracket. And the second piece can be described as soft
bracket three halves, infinity soft bracket. To indicate that x can be in either one of these
pieces, I use the union sign, which is a U. That means that my answer includes all x values in
here together with all x values in here. This next example is also a compound inequality,
this time joined by an and. The and means I'm looking for all y values that satisfy both this
and this at the same time. Again, I can solve each piece separately.
On the left, to isolate the y, I need to multiply by negative three halves on both sides.
So that gives me y is less than negative 12 times negative three halves, the greater than
flipped to a less than because I was multiplying by negative three halves, which is a negative number.
If I clean up the right side to get y is less than 18. On the right side, I'll start by subtracting
two from both sides. And now I'll divide by negative four, again, a negative number,
so that flips the inequality. So that's why is less than three over negative four, in other
words, why is less than negative three fourths. Again, I'm looking for the y values that make
both of these statements true at the same time. Let me graph this on the number line.
The y is less than 18. I can graph that by drawing the number 18.
I don't want to include it. So I use an empty circle and I shaded everything to the left.
The statement y is less than negative three fourths. I need to draw a negative three fourths.
And again, I don't include it. But I do include everything on the left.
Since I want the y values, for which both of these statements are true, I need the y values
that are in both colored blue and colored red. And so that would be this part right here. I'll
just draw it above so you can see it easily. So that would be all the numbers from negative three
fourths and lower, not including negative three fourths. Since those are the parts of the number
line that have both red and blue colors on them. In interval notation, my final answer will be
soft bracket negative infinity to negative three fourths soft bracket.
As my final example, I have an inequality that has two inequality signs in it negative three is
less than or equal to six x minus two is less than 10. I can think of this as being a compound
inequality with two parts negative three x is less than or equal to six x minus two. And at the
same time, six x minus two is less than 10. I could solve this in two pieces as before. But
instead, it's a little more efficient to just solve it all at once by doing the same thing to all
three sides. So as a first step, I'll add two to all three sides. That gives me negative one is
less than equal to six x is less than 12. And now I'm going to divide all three sides by six to
isolate the x. So that gives me negative one six is less than or equal to x is less than two.
If we'd solved it instead in two pieces above, we'd end up with the same thing, because we'd get
negative one six is less than or equal to x from this piece. And we'd get x is less than two on
this piece. And because of the and statement, that's the same thing as saying negative one six is
less than equal to x, which is less than two. Either way we do it. Let's see if what it looks
like on the number line. So on the number line, we're looking for things that are between two
and negative one six, including the negative one six, but not including the two. In interval
notation, we can write this as hard bracket negative one six to soft bracket. In this video,
we solved linear inequalities, including some compound inequalities joined by the conjunctions
and and or. Remember, when we're working with and we're looking for places on the number line,
where both statements are true. That is, we're looking for the overlap on the number line.
In this case, the points on the number line that are colored both red and blue at the same time.
When we're working with or statements, we're looking for places where either one or the other
statement is true or both. On the number line, this corresponds to points that are colored either red
or blue or both. And in this picture, that would actually correspond to the entire number line.
In this video, we'll solve inequalities involving polynomials like this one. And inequalities
and inequalities involving rational expressions like this one.
Let's start with a simple example, maybe a deceptively simple example. If you see the inequality
x squared is less than four, you might be very tempted to take the square root of both sides and
get something like x is less than two as your answer. But in fact, that doesn't work.
To see why it's not correct, consider the x value of negative 10. Negative 10 satisfies
the inequality x is less than two, since negative 10 is less than two. But it doesn't satisfy the
inequality x squared is less than four, since negative 10 squared is 100, which is not less than
four. So these two inequalities are not the same. And it doesn't work to solve a quadratic inequality
just to take the square root of both sides. You might be thinking part of why this reasoning is
wrong is we've ignored the negative two option, right? If we had the equation x squared equals four,
then x equals two would just be one option, x equals negative two would be another solution.
So somehow our solution to this inequality should take this into account. In fact, a good way to
solve an inequality involving x squared or higher power terms is to solve the associated equation
first. But before we even do that, I like to pull everything over to one side so that my inequality
has zero on the other side. So for our equation, I'll subtract four from both sides to get x squared
minus four is less than zero. Now, I'm going to actually solve the associated equation,
x squared minus four is equal to zero. I can do this by factoring to x minus two times x plus two
is equal to zero. And I'll set my factors equal to zero, and I get x equals two and x equals minus
two. Now, I'm going to plot the solutions to my equation on the number line. So I write down negative
two and two, those are the places where my expression x squared minus four is equal to zero.
Since I want to find where x squared minus four is less than zero, I want to know where this
expression x squared minus four is positive or negative. A good way to find that out is to plug
in test values. So first I'll plug in a test value in this area of the number line, something less
than negative two, say x equals negative three. If I plug in negative three into x squared minus four,
I get negative three squared minus four, which is nine minus four, which is five. That's a positive
number. So at negative three, the expression x squared minus four is positive. And in fact,
everywhere on this region of the number line, my expression is going to be positive, because it
can't jump from positive to negative without going through a place where it's zero. I can figure out
whether x squared minus four is positive or negative on this region, and on this region of the number
line, by plugging in test values similarly. A value to plug in between negative two and two,
a nice value is x equals zero, zero squared minus four, that's negative four, a negative number. So
I know that my expression x squared minus four is negative on this whole interval. Finally, I can
plug in something like x equals 10, something bigger than two. And I get 10 squared minus four.
Without even computing that, I can tell that that's going to be a positive number. And that's all that's
important. Again, since I want x squared minus four to be less than zero, I'm looking for the
places on this number line, where I'm getting negatives. So I'll shade that in on my number
line, it's in here, not including the endpoints, because the endpoints are where my expression
x squared minus four is equal to zero. And I want it strictly less than zero. I can write my answer
as an inequality, negative two is less than x is less than two, or an interval notation as soft
bracket negative two to soft bracket. Our next example, we can solve similarly. First, we'll
move everything to one side, so that our inequality is x cubed minus five x squared minus six x is
greater than or equal to zero. Next, we'll solve the associated equation by factoring. So first,
I'll write down the equation. Now I'll factor out an x. And now I'll factor the quadratic.
So the solutions to my equation are x equals zero x equals six and x equals negative one.
I'll write the solutions to the equation on the number line.
So that's negative one, zero, and six. That's where my expression x times x minus six times
x plus one is equal to zero. But I want to find where it's greater than or equal to zero. So again,
I can use test values. I can plug in, for example, x equals negative two, either to this version of
expression, or to this factored version. Since I only care whether my answer is positive or negative,
it's sometimes easier to use the factored version. For example, when x is negative two,
this factor is negative. But this factor x minus six is also negative when I plug in negative two
for x. Finally, x plus one when I plug in negative two for x, that's negative one, that's also negative.
And a negative times a negative times a negative gives me a negative number.
If I plug in something between negative one and zero, say x equals negative one half,
then I'm going to get a negative for this factor, a negative for this factor, but a positive for
this third factor. Negative times negative times positive gives me a positive. For a test value
between zero and six, let's try x equals one. Now I'll get a positive for this factor, a negative
for this factor, and a positive for this factor. Positive times a negative times a positive gives
me a negative. Finally, for a test value bigger than six, we could use say x equals 100. That's
going to give me positive, positive, positive. So my product will be positive. Since I want values
where my expression is greater than or equal to zero, I want the places where it equals zero
and the places where it's positive. So my final answer will be close bracket negative one to zero,
close bracket union, close bracket, six to infinity. As our final example, let's consider the
rational inequality, x squared plus six x plus nine divided by x minus one is less than or equal to
zero. Although it might be tempting to clear the denominator and multiply both sides by x minus one,
it's dangerous to do that. Because x minus one could be a positive number, but it could also be
a negative number. And when you multiply both sides by a negative number, you have to reverse
the inequality. Although it's possible to solve the inequality this way by thinking of cases where
x minus one is less than zero or bigger than zero, I think it's much easier just to solve the same
way as we did before. So we'll start by rewriting so that we move all terms to the left and have
zero on the right. Well, that's already true. So the next step would be to solve the associated
equation. That is x squared plus six x plus nine over x minus one is equal to zero.
That would be where the numerator zero x squared plus six x plus nine is equal to zero. So where x
plus three squared is zero or x equals negative three. There's one extra step we have to do for
rational expressions. And that's what you need to find where the expression does not exist.
That is, let's find where the denominator is zero and that's at x equals one.
I'll put all those numbers on the number line, the places where my rational expression is equal
to zero, and the place where my rational expression doesn't exist. Then I can start in with test values,
for example, x equals minus four, zero and two work. If I plug those values into this expression
here, I get a negative answer, a negative answer and a positive answer. The reason I need to
conclude the values on my number line where my denominator zero is because I can my expression
can switch from negative to positive by passing through a place where my rational expression
doesn't exist, as well as passing by passing through a place where my rational expression
is equal to zero. Now I'm looking for where my original expression was less than or equal to zero.
So that means I want the places on the number line where my expression is equal to zero,
and also the places where it's negative. So my final answer is x is less than one
or an interval notation negative infinity to one. In this video, we solved polynomial and
rational inequalities by making a number line and using test values to make a sign chart.
The distance formula can be used to find the distance between two points if we know their
coordinates. If this first point has coordinates x1, y1, and the second point has coordinates
x2, y2, then the distance between them is given by the formula the square root of x2 minus x1
squared plus y2 minus y1 squared. This formula actually comes from the Pythagorean theorem.
Let me draw a right triangle with these two points as two of its vertices.
Then the length of this side is the difference between the two x coordinates.
Similarly, the length of this vertical side is the difference between the two y coordinates.
Now the Pythagorean theorem says that for any right triangle with sides labeled a and b and
hypotenuse labeled c, we have that a squared plus b squared equals c squared. Well, if we apply that
to this triangle here, this hypotenuse is the distance between the two points that we're looking
for. So Pythagorean theorem says the square of this side length, that is x2 minus x1 squared
plus the square of this side length, which is y2 minus y1 squared has to equal the square of
the hypotenuse, that is d squared. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation,
we get the square root of x2 minus x1 squared plus y2 minus y1 squared is equal to d.
We don't have to worry about using plus or minus signs when we take the square root because
distance is always positive. So we've derived our distance formula. Now let's use it in an example.
Let's find the distance between the two points negative one five, negative one five maybe over
here and four two. This notation just means that p is the point with coordinates negative one five
and q is the point with coordinates four two. We have the distance formula.
Let's think of p being the point with coordinates x1 y1 and q being the point with coordinates
x2 y2. But as we'll see it really doesn't matter which one is which.
Plugging into our formula, we get d is the square root of x2 minus x1. So that's four minus negative
one squared. And then we add y2 minus y1. So that's two minus five squared.
Working out the arithmetic a little bit four minus negative one that's four plus one or five squared
plus negative three squared. So that's the square root of 25 plus nine or the square root of 34.
Let's see what would have happened if we'd called this first point x2 y2 instead and the second
point x1 y1. Then we would have gotten the same distance formula, but we would have taken negative
one minus four and added the difference of y squared. So that's y2 five minus two squared.
So that gives us the square root of negative five squared plus three squared, which works out to the
same thing. In this video, we use the distance formula to find the distance between two points.
When writing down the distance formula, sometimes students forget whether this is a plus or minus
and whether these are pluses or minuses. One way to remember is to think that the distance formula
comes from the Pythagorean theorem. That's why there's a plus in here. And then a minus in here
because we're getting the difference between the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides.
The midpoint formula helps us find the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment
as long as we know the coordinates of the endpoints. So let's call the coordinates of this
endpoint x1 y1 and the coordinates of this other endpoint x2 y2. The x coordinate of the midpoint
is going to be exactly halfway in between the x coordinates of the endpoints.
To get a number halfway in between two other numbers, we just take the average.
Similarly, the y coordinate of this midpoint is going to be exactly halfway in between the y
coordinates of the endpoints. So the y coordinate of the midpoint is going to be the average of
those y coordinates. So we see that the coordinates of the midpoint are x1 plus x2 over 2 y1 plus
y2 over 2. Let's use this midpoint formula in an example. We want to find the midpoint of the
segment between the points negative one five and four two. Let me draw the line segment between them.
So visually the midpoint is going to be somewhere around here. But to find its exact coordinates,
we're going to use x1 plus x2 over 2 and y1 plus y2 over 2, where this first point is coordinates
x1 y1 and the second point has coordinates x2 y2. It doesn't actually matter which point you decide
is x1 y1 and which one is x2 y2. The formula will still give you the same answer for the midpoint.
So let's see I take my average of my x coordinates. So that's negative one plus four over two and the
average of my y coordinates. So that's five plus two over two. And I get three halves seven halves
as the coordinates of my midpoint. In this video, we use the midpoint formula to find the midpoint
of a line segment, just by taking the average of the x coordinates and the average of the y
coordinates. This video is about graphs and equations of circles. Suppose we want to find
the equation of a circle of radius five centered at the point three two. It'll look something like this.
For any point x y on the circle, we know that the distance of that point x y from the center
is equal to the radius, that is five. From the distance formula, that distance of five
is equal to the square root of the difference of the x coordinates.
That's x minus three squared plus the difference of the y coordinates. That's y minus two squared.
And if I square both sides of that equation, I get five squared is this square root squared.
In other words, 25 is equal to x minus three squared plus y minus two squared
since the square root and the squared undo each other. A lot of times people will write the x minus
three squared plus y minus two squared on the left side of the equation and the 25 on the right
side of the equation. This is the standard form for the equation of this circle. The same reasoning
can be generalized to find a general equation for a circle with radius r centered at a point h k.
For any point with coordinates x y on the circle, the distance between the point
with coordinates x y and the point with coordinates h k is equal to the radius r.
So we have that the distance is equal to r, but by the distance formula, that's the square root
of the difference between the x coordinates x minus h squared plus the difference in the y
coordinates y minus k squared. Squaring both sides as before we get r squared is the square root
squared canceling the square root and the squared and rearranging the equation that gives us x minus
h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared. That's the general formula for a circle
with radius r and center h k. Notice that the coordinates h and k are subtracted here. The
two squares are added because they are in the distance formula and the radius is squared on the
other side. If you remember this general formula, that makes it easy to write down the equation for
a circle. For example, if we want the equation for a circle of radius six and center at zero
negative three, then we have r equals six and h k is our zero negative three. So plugging into the
formula, we get x minus zero squared plus y minus negative three squared equals six squared.
Or simplified, this is x squared plus y plus three squared equals 36.
Suppose we're given an equation like this one, and we want to decide if it's the equation of a
circle. And if so, what's the center and what's the radius? Well, this equation matches the form
for a circle x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared. If we let h be five,
y be negative six, since that way, subtracting a negative six is like adding a six.
Five must be our r squared. So that means that r is the square root of five. So this is our radius.
And our center is the point five negative six. And this is indeed the equation for a circle,
which we could then graph by putting down the center and estimating the radius, which is a little
bit more than two. This equation might not look like the equation of a circle, but it actually
can be transformed to look like the equation of a circle. We're trying to make it look like
something of the form x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared.
First, I'd like to get rid of the coefficients in front of the x squared and the y squared. So I'm
going to divide everything by nine. This gives me x squared plus y squared plus eight x minus two y
plus four equals zero. Next, I'm going to group the x terms together, the x squared and the eight x.
So I'll write x squared plus eight x. I'll group the y terms together, the y squared minus two y.
And I'll subtract the four over to the other side. This still doesn't look much like the equation of a
circle. But as the next step, I'm going to do something called completing the square. I'm going
to take this coefficient of x eight, divide it by two and then square it. In other words, eight over
to squared, that's four squared, which is 16. I'm going to add 16 to both sides of my equation.
So add the 16 here. And on the other side. Now I'm going to do the same thing to the coefficient
of y negative two divided by two is negative one square that and I get one. So now I'm going to add
a one to both sides, but I'll put it near the y terms. So add a one there. And then to keep things
balanced, I have to add it to the other side. On the right side, I have the number 13. On the left
side, I can wrap up this expression x squared plus eight x plus 16 into x plus four squared.
To convince you that's correct. If we multiply out x plus four times x plus four, we get x squared
plus four x plus four x plus 16 or x squared plus eight x plus 16. The same thing we have right here.
Similarly, we can wrap up y squared minus two y plus one as
y minus one squared. Again, I'll work out the distribution down here. That's y squared minus
y minus y plus one or y squared minus two y plus one, just like we have up here. If you're wondering
how I knew to use four and minus one, the four came from taking half of eight. And the minus one
came from taking half the negative two. Now we have an equation for a circle in standard form.
And we can read off the center, which is negative four, negative one, and the radius,
which is the square root of 13. It might seem like magic that this trick of taking
half of this coefficient and squaring it and adding it to both sides, let's us
wrap up this expression into this expression, that's perfect square. But to see why that works,
let's take a look at what happens if we expand out x minus h squared, the thing that we're
trying to get to. So if we expand that out, x minus h squared, which is x minus h times x
minus h, which multiplies out to x squared minus hx minus hx plus h squared, or x squared minus
two hx plus h squared. Now if we start out with this part, with some x squared term and some
coefficient of x, and we're trying to decide what to add on in order to wrap it up into x minus h
squared, the thing to add on is h squared here, which comes from half of this coefficient
squared, right, because half of negative two h is eight negative h, square that you get the h
squared. And then when we do wrap it up, it's half of this coefficient of x that appears
right here. This trick of completing the square is really handy for turning an equation for a
circle in disguise into the standard equation for the circle. In this video, we found the standard
equation for a circle, x minus h squared plus y minus k squared equals r squared, where r is the
radius, and hk is the center. We also showed a method of completing the square. When you have
an equation for a circle in disguise, completing the square will help you rewrite it into the
standard form. This video is about graphs and equations of lines. Here we're given the graph
of a line, we want to find the equation. One standard format for the equation of a line is y
equals mx plus b. Here m represents the slope and b represents the y intercept, the y value
where the line crosses the y axis. The slope is equal to the rise over the run, or sometimes this
is written as the change in y values over the change in x values, or in other words, y two minus y
one over x two minus x one, where x one, y one, and x two, y two are points on the line.
While we could use any two points on the line to find the slope, it's convenient to use points
where the x and y coordinates are integers, that is points where the line passes through
grid points. So here would be one convenient point to use. And here's another convenient point to use.
The coordinates of the first point are one, two, and the next point, this is let's see five, negative
one. Now I can find the slope by looking at the rise over the run. So as I go through a run of this
distance, I go through a rise of that distance, it's actually going to be a negative rise or a fall
because my line is pointing down. So let's see counting off squares, this is a run of one, two,
three, four squares and a rise of one, two, three, so negative three. So my slope is going to be
negative three over four. I got that answer by counting squares, but I could have also gotten
it by looking at the difference in my y values over the difference in my x values. That is, I could
have done negative one minus two, that's from my difference in y values, and divide that by my
difference in x values, which is five minus one, that gives me negative three over four as before.
So my m is negative three fourths. Now I need to figure out the value of b, my y intercept. Well,
I could just read it off the graph, it looks like approximately 2.75. But if I want to be more accurate,
I can again use a point that has integer coordinates that I know it's exact coordinates.
So either this point or that point, let's try this point. And I can start off with my equation y
equals mx plus b, that is y equals negative three fourths x plus b. And I can plug in the point
one two, for my x and y. So that gives me two equals negative three fourths times one plus b.
Solving for b, let's see that's two equals negative three fourths plus b. So add three fourths to
both sides, that's two plus three fourths equals b. So b is eight fourths plus three fourths,
which is 11 fourths, which is actually just what I eyeballed it to be. So now I can write out my
final equation for my line y equals negative three fourths x plus 11 fourths by plugging in for m and
b. Next, let's find the equation for this horizontal line. A horizontal line has slope zero. So if we
think of it as y equals mx plus b, m is going to be zero. In other words, it's just y equals b,
y is some constant. So if we can figure out what that that constant y value is, it looks like it's
two, let's see that's three, three and a half, we can just write down the equation directly,
y equals 3.5. For a vertical line, like this one, it doesn't really have a slope. I mean,
if you tried to do the rise over the run, there's no run. So I guess you'd be dividing by zero and
get an infinite slope. But but instead, we just think of it as an equation of the form x equals
something. And in this case, x equals negative two. Notice that all of the points on our line have
the same x coordinate of negative two and the y coordinate can be anything. So this is how we
write the equation for a vertical line. In this example, we're not shown a graph of the line,
we're just told that it goes through two points. But knowing that it goes through two points is
enough to find the equation for the line. First, we can find the slope by taking the difference
in y values over the difference in x values. So that's negative three minus two over four minus one,
which is negative five thirds. So we can use the standard equation for the line, this is called the
slope intercept form. And we can plug in negative five thirds. And we can use one point,
either one will do, we'll still get the same final answer. So let's use one two and plug that in
to get two equals negative five thirds times one plus B. And so B is two plus five thirds, which is
six thirds plus five thirds, which is 11 thirds. So our equation is y equals negative five thirds x
plus 11 thirds. This is method one. Method two uses a slightly different form of the equation.
It's called the point slope form. And it goes y minus y not is equal to m times x minus x not,
where x not y not is a point on the line. And m again is the slope. So we calculate the slope
the same way, by taking a difference in y values over difference in x values. But then we can simply
plug in any point. For example, the point one two will work, we can plug one in for x not and two in
for y not in this point slope form, that gives us y minus two is equal to minus five thirds x minus
one. Notice that these two equations while they may look different are actually equivalent, because
if I distribute the negative five thirds, and then add the two to both sides,
I get the same equation as above.
So we've seen two ways of finding the equation for the line, using the slope intercept form,
and using the point slope form. In this video, we saw that you can find the equation for a line
if you know the slope. And you know one point. You can also find the equation for the line if
you know two points, because you can use the two points to get the slope, and then plug in one of
those points to figure out the rest of the equation. We saw two standard forms for the equation of a
line. The slope intercept form y equals mx plus b, where m is the slope, and b is the y intercept.
And the point slope form y minus y not equals m times x minus x not, where m again is the slope,
and x not y not is a point on the line.
This video is about finding parallel and perpendicular lines.
Suppose we have a line of slope three fourths, in other words, the rise
over the run is three over four. Then any other line that's parallel to this line will have the
same slope, the same rise over run. So that's our first fact to keep in mind. Parallel lines
have the same slopes. Suppose on the other hand, we want to find a line perpendicular to our original
line with its original slope of three fourths. A perpendicular line, in other words, a line at a
90 degree angle to our original line, will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, the opposite
reciprocal of our original slope. So we take the reciprocal of three fourths, that's four thirds,
and we make it its opposite by changing it from positive to negative.
So I'll write this as a principle that perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal
slopes. To get the hang of what it means to be an opposite reciprocal, let's look at a few examples.
So here's the original slope, and this will be the opposite reciprocal, which would represent
the slope of our perpendicular line. So for example, if m one was two, then the opposite
reciprocal, reciprocal of two is one half opposite means I change the sign. If the first slope turned
out to be say negative one third, the reciprocal of one third is three over one or just three. And
the opposite means I change it from a negative to a positive. So my perpendicular slope would be
three. One more example, if I started off with the slope of say seven halves, then the reciprocal
of that would be two sevenths, and I change it to an opposite reciprocal by changing the positive
to a negative. Let's use these two principles in some examples. In our first example, we need
to find the equation of a line that's parallel to this one, and goes through the point negative three
two. Well, in order to get started, I need to figure out the slope of this line. So let me put
this line into a more standard form the the slope intercept form. So I'll start with three y minus
four x plus six equals zero, I'm going to solve for y to put it in this this more standard form. So
I'll say three y equals four x minus six, and then divide by three to get y equals
four thirds x minus six thirds is divided all my terms by three, I can simplify that a little
bit y equals four thirds x minus two. Now I can read off the slope of my original line. And one is
four thirds. That means my slope of my new line, my parallel line will also be four thirds. So my
new line will have the equation y equals four thirds x plus B for some B, of course, B will
probably not be negative two like it was for the first line, it'll be something else determined by
the fact that it goes through this point negative three two. To figure out what B is, I'll plug in
the point negative three two for negative three for x and two for y. So that gives me two equals
four thirds times negative three plus B, and I'll solve for B. So let's see first let me just simplify
so two equals this is negative 12 thirds plus B or in other words, two is negative four plus B.
So that means that B is going to be six. And my my parallel line will have the equation y equals
four thirds x plus six. Next, let's find the equation of a line that's perpendicular to a
given line through and go through a given point. Again, in order to get started, I need to find
what the slope of this given line is. So I'll rewrite it. Well, first, I'll just copy it over
six x plus three y equals four. And then I can put it in the standard slope intercept form by
solving for y. So three y is negative six x plus four, divide everything by three, I get y equals
negative six thirds x plus four thirds. So y is negative two x plus four thirds. So on my original
slope of my original line is negative two, which means my perpendicular slope is the opposite
reciprocal. So I take the reciprocal of negative two that's negative one half and I change the
sign so that gives me one half as the slope of my perpendicular line. Now my new line,
I know it's going to be y equals one half x plus B for some B, and I can plug in my point on my new
line. So one for y and four for x and solve for B. So I get one equals two plus B. So B is negative
one. And so my new line has equation one half x minus one. These next two examples are a little
bit different, because now we're looking at a line parallel to a completely horizontal line.
Let me draw this line y equals three. So the y coordinate is always three, which means that my
line will be a horizontal line through that height at height y equals three. If I want something
parallel to this line, it will also be a horizontal line. Since it goes through the point negative
two one, let's see negative two one, it has to go through that point there.
It's going to have always have a y coordinate of one the same as the y coordinate of the point
it goes through. So my answer will just be y equals one. In the next example, we want a line
that's perpendicular to the line y equals four, another horizontal line y equals four.
But perpendicular means I'm going to need a vertical line. So I need a vertical line that
goes through the point three, four. Okay. And so I'm going to draw vertical line there. Now vertical
lines have the form x equals something for their equation. And to find what x equals, I just need
to look at the x coordinate of the point I'm going through this point three, four. So that x
coordinate is three and all the points on this, this perpendicular and vertical line have x
coordinate three. So my answer is x equals three. In this video, we use the fact that
parallel lines have the same slope, and perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal
slopes to find the equations of parallel and perpendicular lines. This video introduces
functions and their domains and ranges. A function is a correspondence between input numbers,
usually the x values, and output numbers, usually the y values, that sends each input number to
exactly one output number. Sometimes a function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you
can feed in x values as input and get out y values as output. So a non mathematical example of a
function might be the biological mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output
their biological mother. This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person
in this case gets sent to exactly one output person, because if you take any person they just
have one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function, but if I change things around
and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer going
to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They could have
a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any number of situations.
So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then you'd
get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not
be a function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations,
not in terms of mothers. So for example, we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.
This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation
that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.
We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x as input
and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,
we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since f of two
means two squared plus one f of two is going to equal five. Similarly, f of five means I plug in
five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful to evaluate
a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this case, remember,
the functions value on any expression is just what you get when you plug in that whole expression
for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus three squared plus one.
We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one or a squared plus six a plus 10.
When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important to keep the parentheses when you
plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole expression. For example, it would be wrong
to write f of a plus three equals a plus three squared plus one without the parentheses,
because that would imply that we were just squaring the three and and not the whole expression a plus
three. Sometimes a function is described with a graph instead of an equation. In this example,
this graph is supposed to represent the function g of x. Not all graphs actually represent functions.
For example, the graph of a circle doesn't represent a function. That's because the graph
of a circle violates the vertical line test, you can draw a vertical line, and I'll intersect the
graph in more than one point. But our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test. Any vertical
line intersects the graph and at most one point. That means it's a function because every x value
will have at most one y value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate g of two. Note that two
is an x value. And we'll use the graph to find the corresponding y value. So I look for two on
the x axis, and find the point on the graph that has that x value. That's right here. Now I can
look at the y value of that point looks like three, and therefore g of two is equal to three.
If I try to do the same thing to evaluate g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an x value,
I look for it on the x axis. But there's no point on the graph that has that x value.
Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not exist. The question of what x values
and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range. The domain of
a function is all possible x values that make sense for that function. The range is the y values
that make sense for the function. In this example, we saw that the x value of five didn't have a
corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five is not in the domain of our function
g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at the x values that correspond to points
on the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x axis,
and see what x values are hit. It looks like we're hitting all x values starting at
negative eight and continuing up to four. So our domain is the x's between negative eight
and four, including those end points, or we can write this in interval notation as negative eight,
comma four, with square brackets. To find the range of the function, we look for the y values
corresponding to points on this graph. We can do that by taking the shadow or projection of the
graph onto the y axis. We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three.
So our range is wise between negative five and three, or an interval notation negative five,
three, with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,
one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the
domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values
it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they
make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,
we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero, since we can't divide by zero.
We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign
negative, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude
values that make expression inside any even root negative, because we can't take an even root
of a negative number, even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number.
Later, when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we have to
make. But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's apply
them to a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs,
but we do have a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero.
In other words, we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero.
If we solve x squared minus four x plus three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring.
And that gives us x equals three or x equals one. So we need to exclude these values.
All other x values should be fine. So if I draw the number line, I can put on one and three and
just dig out a hole at both of those. And my domain includes everything else on the number line.
In interval notation, this means my domain is everything from negative infinity to one
together with everything from one to three together with everything from three to infinity.
In this second example, we don't have any denominators to worry about, but we do have a
square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values that make three minus two x less than zero.
In other words, we can include all x values for which three minus two x is greater than or equal
to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is greater than equal to two x. In other words, x
is less than or equal to three halves. I can draw this on the number line
or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is included. And that's because
three minus two x is allowed to be zero. I can take the square root of zero. It's just zero. And
that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function that involves both a
square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about. I need the denominator
to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign to be greater than
or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition means that x is not equal
to three and x is not equal to one. And the second condition means that x is less than or equal to
three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions on the number line. x is not equal to three and x
is not equal to one means we've got everything except those two dugout points. And the other
condition x is less than or equal to three halves means we can have three halves and everything
to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to be legit for our function, we need both of
these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect these conditions with an and. And that
means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are colored both red and blue. So I'll
draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves to one. I have to dig out one
because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can continue for all the things that are
colored both both colors red and blue. So my final domain is going to be let's see negative infinity
up to but not including one together with one but not including it to three halves and I include
three halves since that was colored both red and blue also. In this video, we talked about
functions, how to evaluate them and how to find domains and ranges. This video gives the graphs
of some commonly used functions that I call the toolkit functions. The first function is the function
y equals x. Let's plot a few points on the graph of this function. If x is zero, y is zero. If x is
one, y is one. And so on y is always equal to x doesn't have to just be an integer can be any real
number. And we'll connecting the dots we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at
the graph of y equals x squared. If x is zero, y is zero. So we go through the origin again. If x is
one, y is one. And if x is negative one, y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four
and the x value of negative two gives a y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola.
Notice that this function is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y
axis, the left side looks like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because
when you square a positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you square its
mirror image x value of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed, I'll call that a cubic.
Let's plot a few points when x is zero, y is zero, when x is one, y is one, when x is negative one,
y is negative one, two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative two is
going to give us negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like this.
This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry
around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words, turn the paper
upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd symmetry is
because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the corresponding
negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of
the the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example, y equals
a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or
equal to zero, because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in a few
x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is two,
and connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.
The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,
x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one,
two two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting
a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.
y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable
x is in the exponent. If I plot a few points,
two to the zero is one, two to the one is two, two squared is four, two to the minus one is one
half. I'll plot these on my graph. And let me fill in a few more points. So let's see,
two cubed is eight, that's way up here. And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth.
Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped like this.
You might have heard the expression exponential growth when talking about, for example, population
growth. This is function is represents exponential growth. It grows very, very steeply. Every time
we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate. We could also look at a function
like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x, where e is just a number
about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the bigger base makes us rise a little
more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x. It's not defined when x is zero.
But I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two,
one over one is one, and one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape
in the first quadrant. But I haven't looked at negative values of x, when x is negative,
one over negative one is negative one, one over negative a half is negative two. And I get
a similar looking piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola.
And it's also an odd function, because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry. If I turn the
page upside down, it'll look exactly the same. Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared.
Again, it's not defined when x is zero. But I can plug in points like one half or x, let's see one
over one half squared is one over one fourth, which is four. And one over one squared, one over two
squared is a fourth. It's pretty much like the previous function, it's just a little bit more
extreme rises a little more steeply falls a little more dramatically. But for negative
values of x, something a little bit different goes on. For example, one over negative two squared is
just one over four, which is a fourth. So I can plot that point there. And one over negative one
squared, that's just one. So my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant,
not the third quadrant. This is an example of an even function. Because it has perfect mirror
symmetry across the y axis. These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape
of each of them. That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug
in points. That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions. If we change the equation of a function,
then the graph of the function changes or transforms in predictable ways.
This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.
To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some
typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x, y equals x squared,
y equals the absolute value of x and so on. If you're not familiar with those graphs,
I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.
I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function, the square root
of x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus
two is the same thing as the square root of x minus two. g of quantity x minus two means we plug
in x minus two everywhere we see an x. So that would be the same thing as the square root of
quantity x minus two. In this second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the
function because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the
first example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function. We're doing the square root
function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying
by three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire
three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x. In the next
example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function. This is just three times the square
root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of minus x. This might look a little odd
because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number. But remember that if x itself
is negative, like negative two, then negative x will be negative negative two or positive two. So
we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case. Let me record which of
these are inside and which of these are outside of my function. In this next set of examples,
we're using the same function g of x is square root of x. But this time we're starting with an
expression with square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x. So the first example,
the plus 17 is on the outside of my function, because I'm taking the square root of x first
and then adding 17. So I can write this as g of x plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x
and adding 12 first, then I take the square root of the whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x
first, that's on the inside of my function. So I write that as g of the quantity x plus 12.
Remember that this notation means I plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign,
which gives me exactly square root of x plus 12. And this next example, I'm doing the square root
first and then multiplying by negative 36. So my minus 36 multiplication is outside my function.
I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x. Finally, in this last example, I take x multiply
by a fourth and then apply the square root of x. So that's the same thing as g of
one fourth x. My one fourth x is on the inside of my function. In other words, it's inside the
parentheses when I use function notation. Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations
of this function. y equals the square root of x goes through the point zero zero one one and four
two since the square root of four is two and looks something like this.
In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus two, notice that the minus two is on the
outside of the function. That means we're going to take the square root of x first and then subtract
two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero and compute the square root of zero, that's
then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative two.
An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y value
that's decreased by two. One minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four, which under
the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero. Its y
value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two, one goes
with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph. Because I subtracted two on
the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two, which brought my graph down
by two units. Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity x minus two.
Now we're subtracting two on the inside of our function, which means we subtract two from x first
and then take the square root. In order to get the same y value of zero as we had in our blue graph,
we need our x minus two to be zero, so we need our original x to be two. In order to get the
y value of one that we had in our blue graph, we need to be taking the square root of one. So we
need x minus two to be one, which means that we need to start with an x value of three. And in order
to reproduce our y value of two from our original graph, we need the square root of x minus two to
be two, which means we need to start out by taking the square root of four, which means our x minus
two is four, so our x should be up there at six. If I plot my x values with my corresponding
y values of square root of x minus two, I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved
horizontally to the right by two units. To me, moving down by two units makes sense because
we're subtracting two. So we're decreasing y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside,
that kind of does the opposite of what I expect. I might expect it to move the graph left. I might
expect the x values to be going down by two units. But instead, it moves the graph to the right.
Because the x units have to go up by two units in order to get the right square root when I then
subtract two units again. The observations we made for these transformations of functions
hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,
like in our example y equals the square root of x minus two, those numbers affect the y values
and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect,
so subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by
two. Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example, y equals the square root of
quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and result in a horizontal motion. These motions
go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember, the minus two on the inside actually
shifted our graph to the right. If it had had a plus two on the inside, that would actually
shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are called translations, but
multiplying like something like y equals three times the square root of x, that would result
in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,
and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph
vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the square
root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign
results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals the square root of x,
and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection in
the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign. A reflection
in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis. If instead I want to graph y
equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside means a vertical
reflection, a reflection across the x axis.
Pause the video for a moment and see if you could describe what happens
in these four transformations. In the first example, we're subtracting four on the outside
of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or shift, and since we're on the
outside of the function, it affects the y values, that's moving us vertically. So this transformation
should take the square root of graph and move it down by four units. That would look something
like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the inside. That's still a translation,
but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go the opposite direction we expect,
we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look something like this.
In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative sign,
both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.
So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three. The negative sign means we
reflect in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically
before I apply the minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction.
Finally, in this last example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function.
We know that multiplication means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside,
it's a horizontal motion, and it does the opposite of what we expect. So instead of
shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's actually going to stretch by the reciprocal,
a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something like this. Notice that stretching
horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking vertically by a factor of one half.
And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the square root of one fourth x is the
same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root of x, which is the same thing as
one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see algebraically that a vertical shrink by
a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of four, at least for this
function, the square root function. This video gave some rules for transformations of functions,
which I'll repeat below. Numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values,
or vertical motions. Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values,
and result in horizontal motions. Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.
Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks.
And putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection, a horizontal reflection,
if the negative sign is on the inside, and a vertical reflection if the negative sign is on the
outside. Knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to
sketch graphs of much more complicated functions, like y equals three times the square root of x
plus two, by simply considering the transformations one at a time. A quadratic function is a function
that can be written in the form f of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c, where a b and c are real
numbers. And a is not equal to zero. The reason we require that a is not equal to zero is because
if a were equal to zero, we'd have f of x is equal to bx plus c, which is called a linear function.
So by making sure that a is not zero, we make sure there's really an x squared term,
which is the hallmark of a quadratic function. Please pause the video for a moment and decide
which of these equations represent quadratic functions. The first function can definitely
be written in the form g of x equals ax squared plus bx plus c. In fact, it's already written in
that form, where a is negative five, b is 10 and c is three. The second equation is also a quadratic
function, because we can think of it as f of x equals one times x squared plus zero times x plus
zero. So it is in the right form, where a is one, b is zero and c is zero. It's perfectly fine for
the coefficient of x and the constant term to be zero for a quadratic function. We just need
the coefficient of x squared to be nonzero, so the x squared term is preserved. The third equation
is not a quadratic function. It's a linear function, because there's no x squared term.
The fourth function might not look like a quadratic function, but if we rewrite it by expanding out
the x minus three squared, let's see what happens. We get y equals two times x minus three times x
minus three plus four. So that's two times x squared minus three x minus three x plus nine
plus four. Continuing, I get two x squared minus 12 x's plus 18 plus four. In other words,
y equals two x squared minus 12 x plus 22. So in fact, our function can be written in the right
form, and it is a quadratic function. A function that is already written in the form y equals
a x squared plus b x plus c is said to be in standard form. So our first example, g of x,
is in standard form. A function that's written in the format of the last function, that is,
in the form of y equals a times x minus h squared plus k for some numbers a, h, and k,
that's said to be in vertex form. I'll talk more about standard form and vertex form in another
video. In this video, we identified some quadratic functions and talked about the difference between
standard form and vertex form. This video is about graphing quadratic functions.
A quadratic function, which is typically written in standard form, like this, or sometimes in
vertex form, like this, always has the graph that looks like a parabola. This video will show how
to tell whether the parabola is pointing up or down, how to find its x intercepts, and how to
find its vertex. The bare bones basic quadratic function is f of x equals x squared. It goes to
the origin since f of zero is zero squared, which is zero, and it is a parabola pointing upwards,
like this. The vertex of a parabola is its lowest point if it's pointing upwards, and its highest
point if it's pointing downwards. So in this case, the vertex is at zero zero. The x intercepts are
where the graph crosses the x axis, in other words, where y is zero. And in this function,
y equals zero means that x squared is zero, which happens only when x is zero. So the x
intercept, there's only one of them, is also zero. This second function, y equals negative three x
squared, also goes through the origin since the function's value when x is zero is y equals zero.
But in this case, the parabola is pointing downwards. That's because thinking about
transformations of functions, a negative sign on the outside reflects the function
vertically over the x axis, making the parabola instead of pointing upwards, reflecting to point
downwards. The number three on the outside stretches the graph vertically by a factor of three, so
it makes it kind of long and skinny, like this. In general, a negative coefficient to the x squared
term means the parabola will be pointing down, whereas a positive coefficient, like here the
coefficients one, means the parabola is pointing up. I'll write that rule over here. So if a is
bigger than zero, the parabola opens up. And if the value of the coefficient a is less than zero,
then the parabola opens down. In this second example, we can see again that the vertex is at zero
and the x intercept is x equals zero. Let's look at this third example.
If we multiplied our expression out, we'd see that the coefficient of x squared would be two,
a positive number. So that means our parabola is going to be opening up.
But the vertex of this parabola will no longer be at the origin. In fact, we can find the parabola's
vertex by thinking about transformations of functions. Our function is related to the function
y equals two x squared by moving it to the right by three and up by four. Since y equals two x
squared has a vertex at zero zero, if we move that whole parabola, including the vertex right by
three and up by four, the vertex will end up at the point three four. So a parabola will look
like something like this. Notice how easy it was to just read off the vertex when our quadratic
function is written in this form. In fact, any parabola, any quadratic function written in the
form a times x minus h squared plus k has a vertex at hk by the same reasoning. We're moving the
parabola with a vertex at the origin to the right by h and up by k. That's why this form
of a quadratic function is called the vertex form. Notice that this parabola has no x intercepts
because it does not cross the x axis. For our final function, we have g of x equals five x squared
plus 10 x plus three. We know the graph of this function will be a parabola pointing upwards
because the coefficient of x squared is positive. To find the x intercepts, we can set y equals zero.
Since the x intercepts is where our graph crosses the x axis, and that's where the y value is zero.
So zero equals five x squared plus 10 x plus three. I'm going to use the quadratic formula to solve
that. So x is negative 10 plus or minus a square root of 10 squared minus four times five times three
all over two times five. That simplifies to x equals negative 10 plus or minus a square root of 40
over 10, which simplifies further to x equals negative 10 over 10 plus or minus a square root of 40
over 10, which is negative one plus or minus two squared of 10 over 10, or negative one plus or
minus squared of 10 over five. Since the square root of 10 is just a little bit bigger than three,
this works out to approximately about negative two-fifths and negative eight-fifths. So somewhere
around right here. So our parabola is going to look something like this. Notice that it goes
through crosses the x axis at y equals three. That's because when we plug in x equals zero
into here, we get y equal three. So the y intercept is at three. Finally, we can find the vertex.
Since this function is written in standard form, the y equals ax plus a squared plus bx plus c form
and not in vertex form, we can't just read off the vertex like we could before. But there's a trick
called the vertex formula, which says that whenever you have a function in a quadratic function
in standard form, the vertex has an x coordinate of negative b over 2a. So in this case, that's an
x coordinate of negative 10 over two times five or negative one, which is kind of like where I put
it on the graph. To find the y coordinate of that vertex, I can just plug in negative one into my
equation for x, which gives me y equals five times negative one squared plus 10 times negative one
plus three, which is negative two. So I think I better redraw my graph a little bit to put
that vertex down at a y coordinate of negative two, where it's supposed to be.
Let's summarize the steps we use to graph these quadratic functions.
First of all, the graph of a quadratic function has the shape of a parabola.
The parabola opens up if the coefficient of x squared, which we call a is greater than zero,
and down if a is less than zero. To find the x intercepts, we set y equal to zero, or in other
words, f of x equal to zero, and solve for x. To find the vertex, we can either read it off
as HK, if our function is in vertex form, or we can use the vertex formula
and get the x coordinate of the vertex to be negative b over two a, if our function is in
standard form. To find the y coordinate of the vertex in this case, we just plug in the x coordinate
and figure out what y is. Finally, we can always find additional points on the graph by plugging in
values of x. In this video, we learned some tricks for graphing quadratic functions.
In particular, we saw that the vertex can be read off as HK, if our function is written in vertex
form, and the x coordinate of the vertex can be calculated as negative b over two a, if our function
is in a standard form. For an explanation of why this vertex formula works, please see it in my other
video. A quadratic in standard form looks like y equals ax squared plus bx plus c, where a, b,
and c are real numbers, and a is not zero. A quadratic function in vertex form looks like y
equals a times x minus h squared plus k, where a, h, and k are real numbers, and a is not zero.
When a function's in vertex form, it's easy to read off the vertex. It's just the ordered pair,
HK. This video explains how to get from vertex form to standard form and vice versa.
Let's start by converting this quadratic function from vertex form to standard form.
That's pretty straightforward. We just have to distribute out.
So, if I multiply out the x minus three squared, I get minus four times x squared minus six x plus
nine plus one. Distributing the negative four, I get negative four x squared plus 24x minus 36 plus
one. So that works out to minus four x squared plus 24x minus 35. And I have my quadratic function
now in standard form. Now let's go the other direction and convert a quadratic function
that's already in standard form into vertex form. That is, we want to put it in the form of g of x
equals a times x minus h squared plus k, where the vertex is at HK. To do this, it's handy to use
the vertex formula. The vertex formula says that the x coordinate of the vertex is given by negative
b over two a, where a is the coefficient of x squared, and b is the coefficient of x. So in this
case, we get an x coordinate of negative eight over two times two or negative two. To find the y
coordinate of the vertex, we just plug in the x coordinate into our formula for g of x. So that's
g of negative two, which is two times negative two squared plus eight times negative two plus six.
And that works out to be negative two by coincidence. So the vertex for our quadratic function
has coordinates negative two, negative two. And if I want to write g of x in vertex form, it's going
to be a times x minus negative two squared plus minus two. That's because remember, we subtract
h and we add k. So that simplifies to g of x equals a times x plus two squared minus two. And finally,
we just need to figure out what this leading coefficient a is. But notice if we were to
multiply distribute this out, then the coefficient of x squared would end up being a. So therefore,
the coefficient of x squared here, which is a has to be the same as the coefficient of x squared
here, which we can immediately also call a. In other words, our a down here needs to be two.
So I'm going to write that as g of x equals two times x plus two squared minus two, lots of twos
in this problem. And that's our quadratic function in vertex form. If I want to check my answer,
of course, I could just distribute out again, I get two times x squared plus four x plus two
minus two, in other words, two x squared plus eight x plus six, which checks out to exactly what I
started with. This video showed how to get from vertex form to standard form by distributing out
and how to get from standard form to vertex form by finding the vertex using the vertex formula.
Suppose you have a quadratic function in the form y equals ax squared plus bx plus c. And you want
to find where the vertex is when you graph it. The vertex formula says that the x coordinate
of this vertex is at negative b over two a. This video gives a justification for where that formula
comes from. Let's start with a specific example. Suppose I wanted to find the x intercepts and
the vertex for this quadratic function. To find the x intercepts, I would set y equal to zero and
solve for x. So that's zero equals three x squared plus seven x minus five. And to solve for x, I use
the quadratic formula. So x is going to be negative seven plus or minus the square root of seven
squared minus four times three times negative five, all over two times three.
That simplifies to negative seven plus or minus the square root of 109 over six. We could I could
also write this as negative seven six plus the square root of 109 over six, or x equals negative
seven six minus the square root of 109 over six. Since the square root of 109 is just a little bit
bigger than 10, this can be approximated by negative seven six plus 10 six and negative seven six
minus 10 six. So pretty close to I guess about one half over here and pretty close to about
negative three over here. I'm just going to estimate so that I can draw a picture of the function.
Since the leading coefficient three is positive, I know my parabola is going to be opening up
and the intercepts are somewhere around here and here. So roughly speaking, it's going to look
something like this. Now the vertex is going to be somewhere in between the two x intercepts. In fact,
it's going to be by symmetry, it'll be exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts. Since
the x intercepts are negative seven six plus and minus 100 square root of 109 over six,
the number halfway in between those is going to be exactly negative seven six.
Right, because on the one hand, I have negative seven six plus something. And on the other hand,
I have negative seven six minus that same thing. So negative seven six will be exactly in the middle.
So my x coordinate of my vertex will be at negative seven six. Notice that I got that number from
the quadratic formula. More generally, if I want to find the x intercepts for any quadratic function,
I set y equal to zero and solve for x using the quadratic formula negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. The x intercepts will be at these two values,
but the x coordinate of the vertex, which is exactly halfway in between the two x intercepts,
will be at negative b over 2a. That's where the vertex formula comes from. And it turns out that
this formula works even when there are no x intercepts, even when the the quadratic formula
gives us no solutions, the vertex still has the x coordinate negative b over 2a.
And that's the justification of the vertex formula.
This video is about polynomials and their graphs. Recall that a polynomial is a function like this
one, for example, whose terms are numbers times powers of x. I'll start with some definitions.
The degree of a polynomial is the largest exponent. For example, for this polynomial,
the degree is 4. The leading term is the term with the largest exponent. In the same example,
the leading term is 5x to the fourth. It's conventional to write the polynomial in descending
order of powers of x, so the leading term is first. But the leading term doesn't have to be
the first term. If I wrote the same polynomial as y equals, say, 2 minus 17x minus 21x cubed
plus 5x fourth, the leading term would still be the 5x to the fourth, even though it was last.
The leading coefficient is the number in the leading term. In this example, the leading
coefficient is 5. Finally, the constant term is the term with no x's in it. In our same example,
the constant term is 2. Please pause the video for a moment and take a look at this next example
of polynomial. Figure out what's the degree, the leading term, the leading coefficient, and the
constant term. The degree is again 4, since that's the highest power we have. And the leading term
is negative 7x to the fourth. The leading coefficient is negative 7 and the constant term is 18.
In the graph of the polynomial shown here, the three marked points are called turning points
because the polynomial turns around and changes direction at those three points.
Those same points can also be called local extreme points or they can be called local
maximum and minimum points. For this polynomial, the degree is 4 and the number of turning points
is 3. Let's compare the degree and the number of turning points for these next three examples.
For the next three examples, for the first one, the degree is 2 and there's one turning point.
For the sixth example, the degree is 3 and there's two turning points. And for this last
example, the degree is 4 and there's one turning point. For this first example and the next two,
the number of turning points is exactly one less than the degree. So you might conjecture that this
is always true. But in fact, this is not always true. In this last example, the degree is 4,
but the number of turning points is 1, not 3. In fact, it turns out that while the number of
turning points is not always equal to the degree minus 1, it is always less than or equal to the
degree minus 1. That's a useful fact to remember when you're sketching graphs or recognizing graphs
of polynomials. The end behavior of a function is how the ends of the function look as x gets bigger
and bigger heads towards infinity, or x gets goes through larger and larger negative numbers
towards negative infinity. In this first example, the graph of the function goes down as x gets
towards infinity, and as x goes towards negative infinity. I can draw this with two little arrows
pointing down on either side, or I can say in words that the function is falling as we had left
and falling also as we had right. In the second example, the graph rises to the left and rises
to the right. In the third example, the graph falls to the left, but rises to the right. And in the
fourth example, it rises to the left and falls to the right. If you study these examples and others,
you might notice there's a relationship between the degree of the polynomial, the leading coefficients
of the polynomials, and the end behavior. Specifically, these four types of end behavior
are determined by whether the degree is even or odd, and by whether the leading coefficient
is positive or negative. When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient is positive,
like in this example, where the leading coefficient is one, we have this sorts of end
behavior rising on both sides. When the degree is even, and the leading coefficient is negative,
like in this example, we have the end behavior that's falling on both sides.
When the degree is odd, and the leading coefficient is positive, that's like this example, with the
degree three and a leading coefficient three, then we have this sort of end behavior.
And finally, when the degree is odd, and the leading coefficient is negative, like in this
example, we have this sort of end behavior. I like to remember this chart just by thinking
of the most simple examples, y equals x squared, y equals negative x squared, y equals x cubed,
and y equals negative x cubed, because I know by heart what those four examples look like.
Then I just have to remember that any polynomial with an even degree and positive leading coefficient
has the same end behavior as x squared. And similarly, any polynomial with even degree
and negative leading coefficient has the same end behavior as negative x squared,
and similar statements for x cubed and negative x cubed. We can use facts about turning points and
end behavior to say something about the equation of a polynomial just by looking at its graph.
In this example, because of the end behavior, we know that the degree is odd. We know that the
leading coefficient must be positive. And finally, since there are one, two, three, four turning points,
we know that the degree is greater than or equal to five. That's because the number of turning points
is less than or equal to the degree minus one. And in this case, the number of turning points we said
was four. And so solving that inequality, we get the degree is bigger than or equal to five.
Putting some of that information together, we see that the degree could be five, or seven, or nine,
or any odd number greater than or equal to five. But it couldn't be, for example, three or six,
because even numbers and also numbers less than five are right out. This video gave a lot of
definitions, including the definition of degree, leading coefficients, turning points, and end
behavior. We saw that knowing the degree and the leading coefficient can help you make predictions
about the number of turning points and the end behavior, as well as vice versa. This video is
about exponential functions and their graphs. An exponential function is a function that can be
written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x, where a and b are any real numbers,
as long as a is not zero, and b is positive. It's important to notice that for an exponential function,
the variable x is in the exponent. This is different from many other functions we've seen.
For example, a quadratic function like f of x equals three x squared has the variable in the
base. So it's not an exponential function. For exponential functions, f of x equals a times b
to the x, we require that a is not equal to zero, because otherwise, we would have f of x equals zero
times b to the x, which just means that f of x equals zero. And this is called a constant function,
not an exponential function, because f of x is always equal to zero.
In an exponential function, we require that b is bigger than zero, because otherwise,
for example, if b is equal to negative one, say, we'd have f of x equals a times negative one to the
x. Now, this would make sense for a lot of values of x. But if we tried to do something like f of
one half, with our b's negative one, that would be the same thing as a times the square root of
negative one, which is not a real number. We'd get the same problem for other values of b,
if the values of b were negative. And if we tried b equals zero, we'd get a kind of
ridiculous thing a times zero to the x, which again is always zero. So that wouldn't count as an
exponential either. So we can't use any negative bases, and we can't use zero bases if we want an
exponential function. The number a in the expression f of x equals a times b to the x is called the
initial value. And the number b is called the base. The phrase initial value comes to the fact that
if we plug in x equals zero, we get a times b to the zero. Well, anything to the zero is just one.
So this is equal to a. In other words, f of zero equals a. So if we think of starting out
when x equals zero, we get the y value of a. That's why it's called the initial value.
Let's start out with this example, where y equals a times b to the x, an exponential function,
and we've set a equal to one and b equals the two. Notice that the y intercept, the value when x is
zero, is going to be one. If I change my a value, my initial value, the y intercept changes.
The function is stretched out. If I make the value of a go to zero and then negative,
then my initial value becomes negative and my graph flips across the x-axis.
Let's go back to an a value of say one and see what happens when we change b.
Right now, the b value, the base is two. If I increase b, my y intercept sticks at one,
but my graph becomes steeper and steeper. If I put b back down close to one, my graph becomes
more flat. At exactly one, my graph is just a constant.
As b gets into fractional territory, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, my graph starts to slope the other way.
It's decreasing now instead of increasing, but notice that the y intercept still hasn't changed.
I can get it more and more steep as my b gets farther and farther away from one. Of course,
when b goes to negative territory, my graph doesn't make any sense.
So a changes the y intercept and b changes the steepness of the graph so that it's, whether
it's increasing for b values bigger than one and decreasing for values of b less than one.
We'll summarize all these observations on the next slide.
We've seen that for an exponential function, y equals a times b to the x, the parameter or number
a gives the y intercept. The parameter b tells us how the graph is increasing or decreasing.
Specifically, if b is greater than one, the graph is increasing. And if b is less than one, the
graph is decreasing. The closer b is to the number one, the flatter the graph. So for example,
if I were to graph y equals 0.25 to the x and y equals 0.4 to the x,
they would both be decreasing graphs since the base for both of them is less than one.
But 0.25 is farther away from one and 0.4 is closer to one. So 0.4 is going to be flatter and 0.25
is going to be more steep. So in this picture, this red graph would correspond to 0.25 to the x
and the blue graph would correspond to 0.4 to the x.
For all these exponential functions, whether the graphs are decreasing or increasing,
they all have a horizontal asymptote along the x axis, in other words, at the line y equals 0.
The domain is always from negative infinity to infinity. And the range is always
from zero to infinity, because the range is always positive y values.
Actually, that's true if a is greater than zero. If a is less than zero, then our graph flips over
the x axis, our domain stays the same, but our range becomes negative infinity to zero.
The most famous exponential function is f of x equals e to the x. This function is also sometimes
written as f of x equals x of x. The number e is Euler's number, and it's approximately 2.7.
This function has important applications to calculus and to some compound interest problems.
In this video, we looked at exponential functions, functions of the form a times b to the x,
where the variable is in the exponent. We saw that they all have the same general shape,
either increasing like this, or decreasing like this, unless a is negative, in which case they
flip over the x axis. They all have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero, the x axis.
In this video, we'll use exponential functions to model real world examples.
Let's suppose you're hired for a job. The starting salary is $40,000, with a guaranteed
annual raise of 3% each year. How much will your salary be after one year? Two years,
five years, and in general after t years. Let me chart out the information. The left column
will be the number of years since you're hired, and the right column will be your salary.
When you start work, that's zero years after you're hired, your salary will be $40,000.
After one year, you'll have gotten a 3% raise. So your salary will be the original $40,000 plus
3% of $40,000, .03 times $40,000. I can think of this first number as one times $40,000,
and I can factor out the $40,000 from both terms to get $40,000 times one plus $0.03.
Let me rewrite this as $40,000 times $1.03. This is your original salary
multiplied by a growth factor of $1.03. After two years, you'll get a 3% raise
from your previous year's salary. Your previous year's salary was $40,000 times $1.03,
but you'll add 3% of that. Again, I can think of the first number as one times $40,000 times $1.03,
and I can factor out the common factor of $40,000 times $1.03 from both terms to get $40,000
times $1.03 times one plus $0.03. Let me rewrite that as $40,000 times $1.03 times $1.03,
or $40,000 times $1.03 squared. We can think of this as your last year's salary
multiplied by the same growth factor of $1.03. After three years, a similar computation will give
you that your new salary is your previous year's salary times that growth factor of $1.03. That
can be written as $40,000 times $1.03 cubed. And in general, if you're noticing the pattern
after T years, your salary should be $40,000 times $1.03 to the T power. In other words, your
salary after T years is your original salary multiplied by the growth factor
of $1.03 taken to the T power. Let me write this as a formula. S of T, where S of T is your salary,
is equal to $40,000 times $1.03 to the T. This is an exponential function, that is,
a function of the form A times B to the T, where your initial value A is $40,000,
and your base B is $1.03. Notice that your base is the amount that your salary gets multiplied
by each year. Given this formula, we can easily figure out what your salary will be after, for
example, five years by plugging in five for T. I worked that out on my calculator to be $46,370.96
to the nearest cent. Exponential functions are also useful in modeling population growth.
The United Nations estimated that the world population in 2010 was $6.79 billion,
growing at a rate of 1.1% per year. Assuming that the growth rate stayed the same and will
continue to stay the same, we'll write an equation for the population at T years after the year 2010.
1.1% written as a decimal is 0.011. So if we work out a chart as before, we see that after
zero years since 2010, we have our initial population, $6.79 billion. After one year,
we'll take that $6.79 billion and add 1.1% of it, that is 0.011 times 6.79. This works out to
6.79 times 1 plus 0.011 or 6.79 times 1.011. Here we have our initial population
of 6.79 billion and our growth factor of 1.011. That's how much the population
got multiplied by in one year. As before, we can work out that after two years,
our population becomes 6.79 times 1.011 squared since it got multiplied by 1.011 twice. And after
two years, it'll be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T power. So our function that models population
is going to be 6.79 times 1.011 to the T. Here, T represents time in years since 2010.
Just for fun, I'll plug in T equals 40. That's 40 years since 2010. So that's the year
2050. And I get 6.79 times 1.011 to the 40th power, which works out to 10.5 billion.
That's the prediction based on this exponential model.
The previous two examples were examples of exponential growth. This last example is an
example of exponential decay. The drug Cerroquel is metabolized and eliminated from the body
at a rate of 11% per hour. If 400 milligrams are given, how much remains in the body 24 hours later?
I'll chart out my information where the left column will be time in hours
since the dose was given. And the right column will be the number of milligrams of Cerroquel
still in the body. Zero hours after the dose is given, we have the full 400 milligrams in the body.
One hour later, we have the 400 milligrams minus 11% of it. That's minus 0.11 times 400.
If I factor out the 400 from both terms, I get 400 times 1 minus 0.11, or 400 times 0.89.
The 400 represents the initial amount. The 0.89, I'll call the growth factor,
even though in this case, the quantity is decreasing, not growing. So really, it's kind of a shrink factor.
Let's see what happens after two hours. Now I'll have 400 times 0.89. My previous amount,
it'll again get multiplied by 0.89. So that's going to be 400 times 0.89 squared. And in general,
after t hours, I'll have 400 multiplied by this growth or shrinkage factor of 0.89
raised to the t power. Since each hour, the amount of Cerroquel gets multiplied by 0.89,
that number less than one. I'll write my exponential decay function as f of t equals 400
times 0.89 to the t, where f of t represents the number of milligrams of Cerroquel in the body,
and t represents the number of hours since the dose was given.
To find out how much is in the body after 24 hours, I just plug in 24 for t.
This works out to about 24.4 milligrams. I hope you noticed the common form for the functions
used to model all three of these examples. The functions were always in the form f of t equals
a times b to the t, where a represented the initial amount, and b represented the growth factor.
To find the growth factor b, we started with the percent increase or decrease.
We wrote it as a decimal. And then we either added it or subtracted it from one,
depending on whether the quantity was increasing or decreasing. Let me show you that as a couple
examples. In the first example, we had a percent increase of 3% on the raise. As a decimal, I'll
call this r, this was 0.03. And to get the growth factor, we added that to 1 to get 1.03. In the
world population example, we had a 1.1% increase. We wrote this as 0.011 and added it to 1
to get 1.011. In the drug example, we had a decrease of 11%. We wrote that as a decimal.
And we subtracted the 0.11 from one to get 0.89. In fact, you can always write the growth
factor b as 1 plus the percent change written as a decimal. If you're careful to make that
percent change negative when the quantity is decreasing and positive when the quantity is
increasing, since here one plus negative 0.11 gives us the correct growth factor of 0.89,
which is less than one. As a good check, remember that if your quantity is increasing,
the base b should be bigger than one. And if the quantity is decreasing,
then b should be less than one. Exponential functions can also be used to model bank accounts and
loans with compound interest, as we'll see in another video. This video is about interpreting
exponential functions. An antique car is worth $50,000 now, and its value increases by 7% each
year. Let's write an equation to model its value x years from now. After one year, its value
is the 50,000 plus 0.07 times the 50,000. That's because its value has grown by 7% or 0.07 times
50,000. This can be written as 50,000 times one plus 0.07. Notice that adding 7% to the
original value is the same as multiplying the original value by one plus 0.07 or by 1.07.
After two years, the value will be 50,000 times one plus 0.07 squared or 50,000 times
1.07 squared. That's because the previous year's value is multiplied again by 1.07.
And in general, after x years, v of x, the antique car's value will be 50,000
times 1.07 to the x. That's because the original value of 50,000 gets multiplied by 1.07
x times one time for each year. If we dissect this equation, we see that the
number of 50,000 comes from the original value of the car. The 1.07, which I call the growth factor,
comes from 1 plus 0.07. The 0.07 being the percent increase written as a decimal.
So the form of this equation is an exponential equation, v of x equals a times b to the x,
where a is the initial value, and b is the growth factor. But we could also write this as a times
one plus r to the x, where a is still the initial value, but r is the percent increase written
as a decimal. This same equation will come up in the next example. Here, my Toyota Prius is
worth only 3,000 now, and its value is decreasing by 5% each year. So after one year, its value
its value will be 3000 minus 0.05 times 3000. That is 3000 times 1 minus 0.05.
I can also write that as 3000 times 0.95. Decreasing the value by 5% is like multiplying
the value by one minus 0.05 or by 0.95. After two years,
the value will be multiplied by 0.95 again. So the value will be 3000 times 0.95 squared.
And after x years, the value will be 3000 times 0.95 to the x. So my equation for the value
is 3000 times 0.95 to the x. This is again an equation of the form v of x equals a times b to
the x, where here a is 3000, the initial value, and b is 0.95. I'll still call that the growth factor,
even though we're actually declining in value, not growing. Now remember where this 0.95 came
from, it came from taking one and subtracting 0.05 because of the 5% decrease in value.
So I can again write my equation in the form a times, well this time times 1 minus r to the x,
where r is our 0.05, that's our percent decrease written as a decimal. Please take a moment to
study this equation and the previous one. These say that when you have an exponential function,
the number here is the initial value. If it's written in this form, b is your growth factor,
but you can think of b as being either 1 minus r, where r is the percent decrease,
or 1 plus r, where r is the percent increase. In this example, we're given a function f of x
to model the number of bacteria in a Petri dish, x hours after 12 o'clock noon. We want to know
what was the number of bacteria at noon and by what percent the number of bacteria is increasing
every hour. We can see from the equation that the number of bacteria is increasing and not decreasing
because the base of the exponential function, 1.45, is bigger than 1. Notice that our equation,
f of x equals 12 times 1.45 to the x has the form of a times b to the x, or we can think of it as
a times 1 plus r to the x. Here a is 12, b is 1.45, and r is 0.45. Based on this familiar form,
we can recognize that the initial amount of bacteria is going to be 12, 12,000 since those are
our units. And this value 1.45 is our growth factor, what the number of bacteria is multiplied by
each hour, while r, the 0.45 is the rate of increase, in other words, a 45 percent increase
each hour. So our answers to the questions are 12,000 and 45 percent. In this example,
the population of salamanders is modeled by this exponential function, where x is the number of
years since 2015. Notice that the number of salamanders is decreasing because the base of
our exponential function, 0.78, is less than 1. So if we recognize the form of our exponential
function, a times b to the x, or we can think of this as a times 1 minus r to the x, where a is
our initial value, and r is our percent decrease written as a decimal. Our initial value is 3000.
So that's the number of salamanders zero years after 2015. Our growth factor b is 0.78. But if I
write that as 1 minus r, I see that r has to be 1 minus 0.78, or 0.22. In other words, our
population is decreasing by 22 percent each year. In this video, we saw that exponential functions
can be written in the form f of x equals a times b to the x, where a is the initial value.
And b is the growth factor. We also saw that they can be written in the form a times 1 plus r
to the x when the amount is increasing. And as a times 1 minus r to the x when the amount is
decreasing. In this format, r is the percent increase or the percent decrease written as a decimal.
So a 15 percent increase will be an r value of 0.15 and a growth factor b
of 1.15. Whereas a 12 percent decrease will be an r value of 0.12 and a b value of 1 minus
0.12 or 0.78. These observations help us quickly interpret exponential functions.
For example, here, we have an initial value of 100 and a 15 percent increase.
And here, we have an initial value of 50 and a 40 percent decrease.
Exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts.
Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3 percent interest every year.
If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have accumulated after 10 years?
Because 3 percent of the money that's in the bank is getting added each year,
the money in the bank gets multiplied by 1.03 each year. So after one year,
the amount will be 200 times 1.03 after two years, 200 times 1.03 squared and after t years,
200 times 1.03 to the t power. So the function modeling the amount of money,
I'll call it p of t, is given by 200 times 1.03 to the t. More generally, if you invest
$8 at an annual interest rate of r, for t years,
in the end, you'll have p of t equals a times 1 plus r to the t. Here, r needs to be written as a
decimal, so 0.03 in our example for the 3 percent annual interest rate. Going back to our specific
example, after 10 years, the amount of money is going to be p of 10, which is 200 times 1.03 to the
10, which works out to $268.78 to the nearest cent. In this problem, we've assumed that the
interest accumulates once per year. But in the next few examples, we'll see what happens when
the interest rate accumulates more frequently, twice a year, or every month, for example.
Let's deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.5 percent annual interest compounded semi-annually.
This means two times a year, or every six months.
A 4.5 percent annual interest rate compounded two times a year means that we're actually getting
4.5 over 2 percent interest every time the interest is compounded, that is, every six months.
That's 2.25 percent interest every half a year. Note that 2.25 percent is the same as 0.0225 as a
decimal. So every time we earn interest, our money gets multiplied by 1.0225. Let me make a chart of
this. After zero years, which is also zero half years, we have our original $300.
After a half a year, that's one half year, our money earns interest one time. So we multiply
the 300 by 1.0225. After one year, that's two half years, our money earns interest two times.
So we multiply 300 by 1.0225 squared. Continuing this way, after 1.5 years, that's three half years,
we have 300 times 1.0225 cubed, and after two years, or four half years, we have 300 times
1.0225 to the fourth. In general, after t years, which is 2t half years, our money will grow to 300
times 1.0225 to the 2t power, because we've compounded interest 2t times. Our formula for our
amount of money is p of t equals 300 times 1.0225 to the 2t, where t is the number of years.
To finish the problem, after seven years, we'll have p of seven dollars, which is 300 times 1.0225
to the 2 times 7, or 14 power, and that works out to 409 dollars and 65 cents to the nearest cent.
In this next example, we're going to take out a loan for $1,200, an annual interest rate of
6% compounded monthly. Although loans and bank accounts might feel different, they're mathematically
the same. It's like from the bank's point of view, they're investing money in you and getting
interest on their money from you. So we can work them out with the same kind of math.
6% annual interest rate compounded monthly means you're compounding 12 times a year.
So each time you compound interest, you're just going to get 6 over 12% interest.
That's 0.5% interest. And as a decimal, that's 0.005. Let's chart out again what happens.
Time zero, of course, you'll have the original loan amount of $1,200. After one year, that's 12
months, your loan has had interest added to it 12 times. So it gets multiplied by 1.005 to the 12th.
After two years, that's 24 months, it's had interest added to it 24 times. So it gets
multiplied by 1.005 to the 24th power. Similarly, after three years or 36 months,
your loan amount will be 1200 times 1.005 to the 36th power. And in general, after two years,
that's 12 T months. So the interest will be compounded 12 T times. And so we have to raise the
1.005 to the 12 T power. This gives us the general formula for the money owed is P of T equals 1200
times 1.005 to the 12 T, where T is the number of years. In particular, after three years,
we'll have to pay back a total of 1200 times 1.005 to the 12 times 3 or 36 power, which works out to
$1,436.02 to the nearest cent. These last two problems follow a general pattern. If A is the
initial amount of the loan or bank account, and R is the annual interest rate compounded
N times per year, then our formula for the amount of money is going to be A times 1 plus R over N
to the NT. This formula exactly matches what we did in this problem. First, we took the interest
rate R, which was 6%, and divided it by the number of compounding periods each year, 12. We wrote
that as a decimal and added one to it. That's where we got the 1.005 from. We raised this to not to
the number of years, but to 12 times the number of years. That's the number of compounding periods
per year times the number of years. And we multiplied all that by the initial amount of money, which was
1,200. This formula for compound interest is a good one to memorize, but it's also important to be
able to reason your way through it, like we did in this chart. There's one more type of compound
interest, and that's interest compounded continuously. You can think of continuous compounding as the
limit of compounding more and more frequently. 10 times a year, 100 times a year, 1,000 times a
year, a million times a year. In the limit, you get continuous compounding. The formula for continuous
compounding is P of t equals a times e to the RT, where P of t is the amount of money. T is the time
in years. A is the initial amount of money. And R is the annual interest rate, written as a decimal.
So 0.025 in this problem from the 2.5% annual interest rate.
E represents the famous constant Euler's constant, which is about 2.718. So in this problem,
we have P of t is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 t. And after five years, we'll have P of five,
which is 4,000 times e to the 0.025 times five, which works out to $4,532.59 to the nearest cent.
To summarize, if R represents the annual interest rate, written as a decimal, that is 2% would be
0.02. And T represents the number of years. And A represents the initial amount of money. Then for
just simple annual interest compounded once a year, our formula is P of t is A times 1 plus R to the
T. For compound interest compounded n times per year, our formula is P of t is A times 1 plus R over
n to the nt. And for compound interest compounded continuously, we get P of t is A times e to the
rt. In this video, we looked at three kinds of compound interest problems. Simple annual interest,
interest compounded n times per year, and continuously compounded interest.
This video introduces logarithms.
Logarithms are a way of writing exponents. The expression log base A of B equals C
means that A to the C equals B. In other words, log base A of B is the exponent that you raise A to
to get B. The number A is called the base of the logarithm. It's also called the base when we write
it in this exponential form. Some students find it helpful to remember this relationship. Log base
A of B equals C means A to the C equals B by drawing arrows A to the C equals B.
Other students like to think of it in terms of asking a question. Log base A of B asks
what power do you raise A to in order to get B?
Let's look at some examples. Log base two of eight is three, because two to the three equals eight.
In general, log base two of y is asking you the question, what power do you have to raise two to
to get y? So for example, log base two of 16 is four, because it's asking you the question
two to what power equals 16? And the answer is four. Please pause the video and try some of these
other examples. Log base two of two is asking what power do you raise two to to get two? And the answer
is one. Two to the one equals two. Log base two of one half is asking two to what power gives you
one half. Well, to get one half, you need to raise two to a negative power. So that would be two to
the negative one. So the answer is negative one. Log base two of one eighth means what power do we
raise two to in order to get one eighth? Since one eighth is one over two cubed, we have to raise two
to the negative three power to get one over two cubed. So our exponent is negative three. And that's
our answer to our log expression. Finally, log base two of one is asking two to what power equals
one? Well, anything raised to the zero power gives us one. So this log expression evaluates to zero.
Notice that we can get positive, negative, and zero answers for our logarithm expressions.
Please pause the video and figure out what these logs evaluate to.
To work out log base 10 of a million, notice that a million is 10 to the sixth power. Now we're asking
the question, what power do we raise 10 to to get a million? So that is, what power do we raise 10 to
to get 10 to the sixth? Well, of course, the answer is going to be six.
Similarly, since 0.001 is 10 to the minus three, this log expression is the same thing as asking
what's log base 10 of 10 to the minus three? Well, what power do you have to raise 10 to
to get 10 to the minus three? Of course, the answer is negative three.
Log base 10 of zero is asking, what power do we raise 10 to to get zero?
Well, if you think about it, there's no way to raise 10 to an exponent to get zero.
Raising 10 to a positive exponent gets us really big positive numbers.
Raising 10 to a negative exponent is like one over 10 to a power. So that's giving us
tiny fractions, but there's still positive numbers, we're never going to get zero.
Even if we raise 10 to the zero power, we'll just get one. So there's no way to get zero and the log
base 10 of zero does not exist. If you tried on your calculator using the log base 10 button,
you'll get an error message. Same thing happens when we do log base 10 of negative 100, we're
asking 10 to what power equals negative 100. And there's no exponent that will work.
And more generally, it's possible to take the log of numbers that are
greater than zero, but not for numbers that are less than or equal to zero. In other words,
the domain of the function log base a of x, no matter what base you're using for a,
the domain is going to be all positive numbers.
A few notes on notation. When you see ln of x, that's called natural log,
and it means the log base e of x, where e is that famous number that's about 2.718.
When you see log of x with no base at all, by convention, that means log base 10 of x,
and it's called the common log. Most scientific calculators have buttons
for natural log and for common log. Let's practice rewriting expressions with logs in them.
Log base three of one ninth is negative two can be rewritten as the expression three to the negative
two equals one ninth log of 13 is shorthand for log base 10 of 13. So that can be rewritten as 10
to the 1.11394 equals 13. Finally, in this last expression, ln means natural log or log base e.
So I can rewrite this equation as log base e of one over e equals negative one. Well,
that means the same thing as e to the negative one equals one over e, which is true.
Now let's go the opposite direction. We'll start with exponential equations and rewrite them as logs.
Remember that log base a of b equals c means the same thing as a to the c equals b.
The base stays the same in both expressions. So for this example, the base of three in the
exponential equation is going to be the same as the base in our log. Now I just have to figure
out what's in the argument of the log and what goes on the other side of the equal sign.
Remember that the answer to a log is an exponent. So the thing that goes in this box should be my
exponent for my exponential equation, in other words, you. And I'll put the 9.78 as the argument
of my log. This works because log base three of 9.78 equals you means the same thing as
three to the you equals 9.78, which is just what we started with.
In a second example, the base of my exponential equation is e. So the base of my log is going to be
e. The answer to my log is an exponent. In this case, the exponent three x plus seven.
And the other expression, the four minus y becomes my argument of my log.
Let me check log base e of four minus y equals three x plus seven means e to the three x plus
seven equals four minus y, which is just what I started with. I can also rewrite log base e
as natural log. This video introduced the idea of logs and the fact that log base a of b equals c
means the same thing as a to the c equals b. So log base a of b is asking the question
what power or exponent do you raise a to in order to get b?
In this video, we'll work out the graphs of some log functions and also talk about their
domains. For this first example, let's graph a log function by hand by plotting some points.
The function we're working with is y equals log base two of x. I'll make a chart of x and y values.
Since we're working this out by hand, I want to pick x values for which it's easy to compute
log base two of x. So I'll start out with the x value of one, because log base two of one is zero.
Log base anything of one is zero.
Two is another x value that's easy to compute log base two of two, that's asking what power do I
raise two to to get two? Well, and the answer is one. Other powers of two are easy to work with.
So for example, log base two of four, that saying what power do I raise two to to get four?
So the answer is two. Similarly, log base two of eight is three, and log base two of 16 is four.
Let me also work with some fractional values for x. If x is one half, then log base two of one half,
that saying what power do I raise two to to get one half? Well, that needs a power of negative one.
It's also easy to compute by hand, the log base two of one fourth and one eighth log base two of
log base two of one fourth is negative two, since two to the negative two is one fourth.
And similarly, log base two of one eighth is negative three. I'll put some tick marks on
my x and y axes. Please pause the video and take a moment to plot these points.
Let's see, I have the point one zero. That's here to one. That's here for two. That is here.
And then eight three, which is here. And the fractional x values one half goes with negative one
and one fourth with negative two, one eighth with negative three. And if I connect the dots,
I get a graph that looks something like this. If I had smaller and smaller fractions,
I would keep getting more and more negative answers when I took log base two of them. So
my graph is getting more and more negative. My y values are getting more and more negative
as x is getting close to zero. Now I didn't draw any parts of the graph over here with
negative x values, and I didn't put any negative x values in my chart. That omission is no accident,
because if you try to take the log base two or base anything of a negative number,
like say negative four or something, there's no answer. This doesn't exist because there's no
power that you can raise two to to get a negative number. So there are no points on the graph for
negative x values. And similarly, there are no points on the graph where x is zero, because you
can't take log base two of zero, there's no power you can raise two to to get zero.
I want to observe some key features of this graph. First of all, the domain is x values
greater than zero. In interval notation, I can write that as a round bracket, because I don't
want to include zero to infinity. The range is going to be the y values. Well, they go all the
way down into the far reach of the negative numbers. And the graph gradually increases y
values getting bigger and bigger. So the range is actually all real numbers, or an interval
notation negative infinity to infinity. Finally, I want to point out that this graph has a vertical
asymptote at the y axis, that is, at the line x equals zero. I'll draw that on my graph with a
dotted line. A vertical asymptote is a line that our functions graph gets closer and closer to.
So this is the graph of y equals log base two of x. But if I wanted to graph say,
y equals log base 10 of x, it would look very similar. It would still have a domain
of x values greater than zero, a range of all real numbers, and a vertical asymptote at the y
axis. It would still go through the point one zero, but it would go through the point 10 one,
instead, because log base 10 of 10 is one. It would look pretty much the same, just a lot flatter
over here. But even though it doesn't look like it with the way I've drawn it, it still gradually
goes up to and towards infinity. In fact, the graph of y equals log base any a of x for a bigger
than one looks pretty much the same. And has the same three properties. Now that we know what the
basic log graph looks like, we can plot at least rough graphs of other log functions without plotting
points. Here we have the graph of natural log of x plus five. And again, I'm just going to draw a
rough graph. If I did want to do a more accurate graph, I probably would want to plot some points.
But I know that roughly, a log graph, if it was just like y equals ln of x,
that would look something like this. And it would go through the point one zero,
with a vertical asymptote along the y axis. Now if I want to graph ln of x plus five, that just
shifts our graph up by five units. It'll still have the same vertical asymptote since a vertical
line shifted up by five units is still a vertical line. But instead of going through one zero,
it'll go through the point one five. So I'll draw a rough sketch here.
Let's compare our starting function, y equals ln x, and the transformed version,
y equals ln x plus five, in terms of the domain, the range, and the vertical asymptote.
Our original function, y equals ln x, had a domain of zero to infinity.
Since adding five on the outside affects the y values, and the domain is the x values,
this transformation doesn't change the domain. So the domain is still from zero to infinity.
Now the range of our original y equals ln x
was from negative infinity to infinity. Shifting up by five does affect the y values,
and the range is talking about the y values. But since the original range was all real numbers,
if you add five to all set of all real numbers, you still get the set of all real numbers. So in
this case, the range doesn't change either. And finally, we already saw that the original vertical
asymptote of the y axis x equals zero. When we shift that up by five units, it's still the vertical
line x equals zero. In this next example, we're starting with a log base 10 function.
And since the plus two is on the inside, that means we shift that graph left by two.
So I'll draw our basic log function. Here's our basic log function. So I'll think of that as
y equals log of x going through the point one zero. Here is its vertical asymptote. Now I need
to shift everything left by two. So my vertical asymptote shifts left. And now it's at the line
x equals negative two, instead of at x equals zero. And my graph, let's see my point one zero
gets shifted to, let's say negative one zero, since I'm subtracting two from the axis. And
here's a rough sketch of the resulting graph. Let's compare the features of the two graphs drawn
here. We're talking about domains, the original had a domain of from zero to infinity. But now
I've shifted that left. So I've subtracted two from all my x values. And here's my new domain,
which I can also verify just by looking at the picture. My range was originally from negative
infinity to infinity. Well, shifting left only affects the x value. So it doesn't even affect
the range. So my range is still negative infinity to infinity. My vertical asymptote was originally
at x equals zero. And since I subtract two from all my x values, that shifts it to x equals negative
two. In this last problem, I'm not going to worry about drawing this graph. I'll just use algebra
to compute its domain. So let's think about what's the issue when you're taking the logs of things?
Well, you can't take the log of a negative number or zero. So whatever's inside the argument of the
log function, whatever's being fed into log had better be greater than zero. So I'll write that
down. We need two minus three x to be greater than zero. Now it's a matter of solving an inequality.
Two has got to be greater than three x. So two thirds is greater than x. In other words, x has
to be less than two thirds. So our domain is all the x values from negative infinity
to two thirds, not including two thirds. It's a good idea to memorize the basic shape
of the graph of a log function. It looks something like this goes through the point one zero and has
a vertical asymptote on the y axis. Also, if you remember that you can't take the log
of a negative number or zero, then that helps you quickly compute domains for log functions.
Whatever's inside the log function, you set that greater than zero and solve.
This video is about combining functions by adding them, subtracting them, multiplying them, and
dividing them. Suppose we have two functions f of x equals x plus one and g of x equals x squared.
One way to combine them is by adding them together. This notation, f plus g of x means the function
defined by taking f of x and adding it to g of x. So for our functions, that means we take x plus one
and add x squared. I can rearrange that as the function x squared plus x plus one. So
f plus g evaluated on x means x squared plus x plus one. And if I wanted to evaluate f plus g
on the number two, that would be two squared plus two plus one or seven. Similarly, the notation f
minus g of x means the function we get by taking f of x and subtracting g of x. So that would be x
plus one minus x squared. And if I wanted to take f minus g evaluated at one, that would be one
plus one minus one squared or one. The notation f dot g of x, which is sometimes also written just
as f g of x, that means we take f of x times g of x. In other words, x plus one times x squared,
which could be simplified as x cube plus x squared. The notation f divided by g of x means I take
f of x and divide it by g of x. So that would be x plus one divided by x squared.
In this figure, the blue graph represents h of x. And the red graph represents the function p of x.
We're asked to find h minus p of zero. We don't have any equations to work with, but that's okay.
We know that for any x, h minus p of x is defined as h of x minus p of x.
So for x equals zero, h minus p of zero is going to be h of zero minus p of zero.
Using the graph, we can find h of zero by finding the value of zero on the x axis
and finding the corresponding y value for the function h of x. So that's about 1.8.
Now, p of zero, we can find similarly by looking for zero on the x axis and finding the corresponding
y value for the function p of x. And that's a y value of one. 1.8 minus one is 0.8. So that's our
approximate value for h minus p of zero. If we want to find p times h of negative three,
again, we can rewrite that as p of negative three times h of negative three. And using the graphs,
we see that for an x value of negative three, the y value for p is two.
And the x value of negative three corresponds to a y value of negative two for h.
Two times negative two is negative four. So that's our value for p times h of negative three.
In this video, we saw how to add two functions, subtract two functions, multiply two functions,
and divide two functions in the following way.
When you compose two functions, you apply the first function.
And then you apply the second function to the output of the first function. For example,
the first function might compute population size from time in years. So its input would be
time in years, since a certain date, and its output would be number of people in the population.
The second function, g, might compute health care costs as a function of population size.
So it will take population size as input, and its output will be health care costs.
If you put these functions together, that is compose them, then you'll go all the way from
time in years to health care costs. This is your composition, g composed with f.
The composition of two functions, written g with a little circle f of x, is defined as follows.
g composed with f of x is g evaluated on f of x. We can think of it schematically in this diagram.
f acts on a number x, and produces a number f of x. Then g takes that output f of x,
and produces a new number g of f of x. Our composition of functions g composed with f
is the function that goes all the way from x to g of f of x. Let's work out some examples,
where our functions are defined by tables of values. If we want to find g composed with f of 4,
by definition, this means g of f of 4. To evaluate this expression, we always work from the inside
out. So we start with the x value of 4, and we find f of 4 using the table of values for f of x.
When x equals 4, f of x is 7. So we can replace f of 4 with the number 7.
Now we need to evaluate g of 7. 7 becomes our new x value in our table of values for g.
The x value of 7 corresponds to the g of x value of 10. So g of 7 is equal to 10.
We found that g composed with f of 4 is equal to 10. If instead we want to find f composed with g of 4,
well we can rewrite that as f of g of 4, and again work from the inside out. Now we're trying to find
g of 4. So 4 is our x value, and we use our table of values for g to see that g of 4 is 1.
So we replace g of 4 by 1, and now we need to evaluate f of 1. Using our table for f values, f of 1 is 8.
Notice that when we've computed g of f of 4, we got a different answer than when we computed f of g of 4.
And in general, g composed with f is not the same thing as f composed with g.
Please pause the video and take a moment to compute the next two examples.
We can replace f composed with f of 2 by the equivalent expression f of f of 2.
Working from the inside out, we know that f of 2 is 3, and f of 3 is 6.
If we want to find f composed with g of 6, rewrite that as f of g of 6. Using the table for g,
g of 6 is 8. But f of 8, 8 is not on the table as an x value for the f function. And so there is no f
of 8. This does not exist. We can say that 6 is not in the domain for f composed with g.
Even though it was in the domain of g, we couldn't follow all the way through and get a value for f
composed with g of 6. Next, let's turn our attention to the composition of functions
that are given by equations. p of x is x squared plus x, and q of x is negative 2x.
We want to find q composed with p of 1. As usual, I can rewrite this as q of
p of 1 and work from the inside out. p of 1 is 1 squared plus 1, so that's 2.
So this is the same thing as q of 2. But q of 2 is negative 2 times 2 or negative 4,
so this evaluates to negative 4. In this next example, we want to find q composed with p of
some arbitrary x. I'll rewrite it as usual as q of p of x and work from the inside out.
Well, p of x, we know the formula for that, that's x squared plus x. So I can replace my p of x
with that expression. Now, I'm stuck with evaluating q on x squared plus x. Well, q of
anything is negative 2 times that thing. So q of x squared plus x is going to be
negative 2 times the quantity x squared plus x. What I've done is I've substituted in the whole
expression x squared plus x, where I saw the x in this formula for q of x. It's important to use
the parentheses here, so that we'll be multiplying negative 2 by the whole expression and not just
by the first piece. I can simplify this a bit as negative 2x squared minus 2x. And that's my
expression for q composed with p of x. Notice that if I wanted to compute q composed with p of 1,
which I already did in the first problem, I could just use this expression now,
negative 2 times 1 squared minus 2, and I get negative 4 just like I did before.
Let's try another one. Let's try p composed with q of x. First, I write this p of q of x
working from the inside out, I can replace q of x with negative 2x. So I need to compute p of negative
2x. Here's my formula for p. To compute p of this expression, I need to plug in this expression
everywhere I see an x in the formula for p. So that means negative 2x squared plus negative 2x.
Again, being careful to use parentheses to make sure I plug in the entire expression in for x.
Let me simplify. This is 4x squared minus 2x. Notice that I got different expressions for
q of p of x and for p of q of x. Once again, we see that q composed with p is not necessarily
equal to p composed with q. Please pause the video and try this last example yourself.
Rewriting and working from the inside out, we can replace p of x with its expression
x squared plus x, and then we need to evaluate p on x squared plus x. That means we plug in
x squared plus x everywhere we see an x in this formula. So that's x squared plus x quantity
squared plus x squared plus x. Once again, I can simplify by distributing out that gives me x to
the fourth plus 2x cubed plus x squared plus x squared plus x or x to the fourth plus 2x cubed
plus 2x squared plus x. In this last set of examples, we're asked to go backwards.
We're given a formula for a function of h of x, but we're supposed to rewrite h of x as a
composition of two functions f and g. Let's think for a minute which of these two functions gets
applied first. f composed with g of x, let's see, that means f of g of x. And since we evaluate
these expressions from the inside out, we must be applying g first, and then f.
In order to figure out what what f and g could be, I like to draw a box around something inside my
expression for h. So I'm going to draw a box around x squared plus seven. Then whatever's
inside the box, that'll be my function g of x, the first function that gets applied.
Whatever happens to the box, in this case, taking the square root sign,
that becomes my outside function, my second function f. So here we're going to say g of x is
equal to x squared plus seven. And f of x is equal to the square root of x. Let's just check and
make sure that this works. So I need to check that when I take the composition, f composed with g,
I need to get the same thing as my original h. So let's see, if I do
f composed with g of x, well, by definition, that's f of g of x, working from the inside out, I can
replace g of x with its formula, x squared plus seven. So I need to evaluate f of x squared plus
seven. That means I plug in x squared plus seven into the formula for for f. So that becomes the
square root of x squared plus seven. Tada, it works because it matches my original equation.
So we found a correct answer, a correct way of breaking h down as a composition of two functions.
But I do want to point out, this is not the only correct answer. I'll write down my formula for h
of x again. And this time I'll put the box in a different place. I'll just box the x squared.
If I did that, then my inside function, my first function, g of x would be x squared. And my second
function is what happens to the box. So my f of x is what happens to the box. And the box gets
added seven to it, and taken the square root. So in other words, f of x is going to be the square
root of x plus seven. Again, I can check that this works. If I do f composed with g of x, that's f of
g of x. So now g of x is x squared. So I'm taking f of x squared. When I plug in x squared for x,
I do in fact get the square root of x squared plus seven. So this is an alternative, correct solution.
In this video, we learned to evaluate the composition of functions by rewriting it and working from
the inside out. We also learned to break apart a complicated function into a composition of two
functions by boxing one piece of the function and letting the first function applied in the
composition, let that be the inside of the box. And the second function applied in the composition
be whatever happens to the box. The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the
inverse of tying your shoes would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds
two to a number would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces
inverses and their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words,
f of two is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one.
The inverse function for f written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does.
Since f takes two to three, f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript
negative one of three is two. Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.
And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,
f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart.
Notice that the chart of values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse
of x are closely related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond
to the y values for f inverse of x and the y values for f of x correspond to the x values
for f inverse of x. That leads us to the first key fact, inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue. Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f
inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see what kind of symmetry you observe in this
graph. How are the blue points related to the red points? You might have noticed that the blue
points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror line y equals x. So our second key fact
is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained from the graph of y equals f of x
by reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because inverses reverse the roles of y and x.
In this same example, let's compute f inverse of f of two. This open circle means composition. In
other words, we're computing f inverse of f of two. We compute this from the inside out. So that's f
inverse of three since f of two is three and f inverse of three we see as two.
Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of three and that means we take f of f inverse of three.
Since f inverse of three is two, that's the same thing as computing f of two, which is three.
Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions.
You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number,
you get back to the very same number you started with. And similarly, if you take f of f inverse
of any number, you get back to the same number you started with. So in general, f inverse of f of x
is equal to x and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical way of saying that
f and f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed.
Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes
the work that f does. You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function.
Now we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of
function, which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x. Similarly, if we compute
f inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed, and we get back to x again. So the cube root
function really is the inverse of the cubing function. When we compose the two functions,
we get back to the number that we started with. It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of
finding inverses of functions besides guessing and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses
reverse the roles of y and x. So if we want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals five
minus x over three x, we can write it as y equals five minus x over three x, reverse the roles of y
and x to get x equals five minus y over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's multiply
both sides by three y, bring all terms with y's in them to the left side, and all terms without y's
in them to the right side, factor out the y and divide to isolate y.
This gives us f inverse of x as five over three x plus one. Notice that our original function
f and our inverse function f inverse are both rational functions, but they're not the reciprocals
of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is not usually equal to one over f of x.
This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus one, that does mean one over two,
but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the reciprocal.
It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any function you might
encounter, is there always a function that is its inverse? In fact, the answer is no.
See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.
The word function here is key. Remember that a function is a relationship between x values and
y values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.
One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x
equals x squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function,
note that for the x squared function, the number two and the number negative two
both go to the number four. So if I had an inverse, it would have to send four
to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function. It might be easier to understand
the problem when you look at a graph of y equals x squared. Recall that inverse functions reverse
the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x. But when I flip the green
graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph is not the graph of a function
because it violates the vertical line test. The reason it violates the vertical line test
is because the original green function violates the horizontal line test
and has two x values with the same y value. In general, a function f has an inverse function
if and only if the graph of f satisfies the horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line
intersects the graph in at most one point. Pause the video for a moment and see which
of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. In other words, which of the four
corresponding functions would have an inverse function? You may have found that graphs a and b
violate the horizontal line test. So their functions would not have inverse functions.
But graphs c and d satisfy the horizontal line test. So these graphs represent functions that
do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test are sometimes called one-to-one
functions. Equivalently, a function is one-to-one if for any two different x values, x1 and x2,
the y values f of x1 and f of x2 are different numbers. Sometimes, as I said, f is one-to-one
if whenever f of x1 is equal to f of x2, then x1 has to equal x2. As our last example, let's try to
find p inverse of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus 2 drawn here. If we graph p inverse
on the same axis as p of x, we get the following graph simply by flipping over the line y equals x.
If we try to solve the problem algebraically, we can write y equal to square root of x minus 2,
reverse the roles of y and x, and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding 2.
Now, if we were to graph y equals x squared plus 2, that would look like a parabola. It would look
like the red graph we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.
But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.
We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than
or equal to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x,
y was only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and
p inverse, we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus 2 is greater than
or equal to zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number.
This corresponds to x values being greater than or equal to 2, or an interval notation,
the interval from 2 to infinity. The range of p we can see from the graph is all y values greater
than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph, we see
the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero
to infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to 2, or the interval
from 2 to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain
of p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse, and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p
inverse. This makes sense because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f
inverse of x is the x values for f inverse, which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f.
The range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the domain
of f. In this video, we discussed five key properties of inverse functions.
Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph of y equals f of x
reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse, we get the identity
function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f, that brings x to x.
In other words, f and f inverse undo each other. The function f of x has an inverse function,
if and only if the graph of y equals f of x satisfies the horizontal line test.
And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse, and the range of f is the domain of f
inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be important when we study exponential
functions and their inverses, logarithmic functions.
