Ready? Yes, ma'am.
Put a little red ink in front of the old stars
and then begin to chat like Laura Jean Libby.
Good. You'll come this way.
Awesome.
Awesome?
Say, I'm already running for office in this town.
I would like to know if you got a gel.
Sister, I've been a heumat all my life.
It's made me just a little bit.
Oh, you should not feel this way.
You should be cheerful.
Yes.
Baby, I see where I'm going to be putty
in your hands in no time.
Really?
You like some dinner, eh?
Mm-hmm, very good.
To you.
My friend.
To you, machacho.
Nice, eh?
Yeah, that's the rest of the meal.
Do you want me to tell your fortune, eh?
Yeah? Sister?
If that's in the system, give me the work.
Hey, my daughter, huh?
Ah, what is this, huh?
Hey, that's my traveling bag.
Now I tell your fortune, eh?
Are you good at it, baby?
Good. Anything I tell you,
you can't believe it.
Ah, look, the first one, you are lucky.
Yeah, I think you're saying that she's another natural.
There is a very beautiful girl coming into your life.
Beautiful face.
The most beautiful eyes.
Her teeth.
She is a dream.
And what a figura.
Figura?
Yeah, she got a shape just like Bennett.
Bennett? That's another one, isn't it?
You are going to fall madly in love with her.
Going to?
Come here.
Tell me, y'all.
You make a lot of money, eh?
I'm not for two, and maybe three, you know?
You like to look ahead, don't you?
You are a very wrong man.
Yeah? Well, you ain't doing so bad yourself.
Listen, baby.
I'm going to be transferred next month to Governor's Island.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Where is that?
Back to civilization.
New York, right at your front door, excuse me.
Oh, I'd like to see it.
Do you take me there?
Sister, that's the idea that's been relevant
through my mind this very minute.
You and me are New York together.
Say you love it.
A New York city.
Why, in New York, you can get a glass of beer that high
for a nickel.
A knife, too.
And the bowery.
Baby, you ain't seen nothin' till you see the bowery.
Finest street in the wild, salons and dance halls everywhere.
Free lunch.
Or you can eat for nothin'.
And the finest whiskey, 10 cents a throw.
You can pour it yourself.
They got pretty clothes for girls, Daddy.
Clothes?
Baby, you can get the swallows' parachutes in the world there
for two dollars.
And hats.
Well, you can get a hat for a dollar and a quarter
with a feather that long.
And petticoats.
Baby, when you see the petticoats,
every color under the sun.
Girls show them on rainy days.
Oh, rainy days.
That's when you'll see the size.
Hot cum meter.
I would love to see it.
Yeah?
You and me together.
Is it a girl?
Yes, it is a girl.
What's the deal with that kid?
One of the biggest women.
But Antonio, for God's sake!
You must be kidding me.
You mind your own business.
Imagine that they come back and kill us all.
You get out. Get out quick.
Yes, devil.
Pa, I hate that old woman.
She's always so nosy.
She's always spying on me.
Yes.
Where's your account?
Far from here?
No, not very far.
I would love to see it.
You take me there?
Sure. You got a horse?
No. But I ride with you, eh?
Ah, that suits me, baby.
See, I get my shot, eh?
All right.
Why did we do it last time we left?
I am ready.
Yeah?
Oh, uh...
Don't you want to leave a note for, uh...
somebody?
Why would you say that?
Well, I thought the old woman might worry.
Oh, let her worry.
I hope she worries the rest of her life.
The old cat.
Come on, baby.
Adel, nice to have you in the camp, eh?
Eh?
Yeah. Pointlessly nice.
There'll be a hard time.
That's the Zisco kid, all right?
No!
What do you reckon you're going to get for them, steers?
About 4,000?
5,000 on his head and 4,000 in his pocket.
That's 9,000 for us.
Very good.
All we've got to do is to fill him in the hills
and give him both barrels in the back.
Well, it's the easiest money we ever got.
Now, he's heading through to Coyote Wells.
Now, come on.
Let's take to the past.
Andy!
Andy, Andy!
This is a plate.
I'll just wait for him up in the bluff.
Thank you for the money, my friends.
Goodbye. Good luck.
Ben, have you ever seen that fellow before?
No, I don't believe that I ever have.
Well, take a good look at him because you'll never see him again.
Those three cattle rushers have been waiting for him.
Two to one, they'll get him.
Beat them to it.
Bring them down the first chant you've got.
There he is.
Give it to him, Art.
Hey!
Yo, Coyote, yo.
How am I going to make this piece of shit?
These other two fellows don't talk no more.
Hey!
They say such love is inevitable, such wonderful love baby,
and they don't ever find you like this waltz.
The bowery, the bowery, I'll never go there any more.
Go on, sister, try it.
You're going to slow, boys.
Why, sister?
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Give her a cord, girl.
Now, tada, the bowery.
The bowery.
The bowery.
No, no, not the bowery, the bowery.
Go on, baby, now.
Tada, the bowery, the bowery.
They say such things, and they do such things on the bowery.
The bowery.
I don't think I'd go there some more.
I don't think I'd go there some more.
Sweetheart, you got a voice like a Brooklyn sparrow.
I don't understand this.
You tell me what a nice place is for you,
and that you're going to take me there to show it to me?
Then in the songs you say, you don't think you go there some
more.
How do you make that out, eh?
I never thought of that.
Woo!
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you going, huh?
I don't think you'll play, friend.
I come right back.
All right, baby.
Don't be long, baby.
Sweet as a peat.
I got some workers.
I got to get your credit card.
You can't take them.
I love them duty for once I go together.
How do you mean together?
You fellas know where we come up here.
Well, sure.
Hey, that's a piece.
Now, this, yeah, needs to belong to the fiscal kids,
see?
But when I came into her life, things changed.
It's a piece of cake.
Cut that out.
Ember Sherrill.
Ember Sherrill.
Nicky.
Nicky.
Yeah?
What do you want, sweetheart?
Come here.
Oh, practically there.
What's on your mind, sir, sir?
No, I know why you come to my house.
You come there looking for someone.
That's right, baby.
I was looking for you.
Not the first time.
The first time you come looking for a man, a bandit.
How do you know?
I am not blind.
Here is a patent offering.
They were for him.
I'm bigger than they were.
Is that the reason you make love to me?
To get the mom of the money?
No, no, no, no, no.
No need to lie.
You are a piece.
I hope he peels you.
Hey, baby.
No, Nicky.
No, Nicky.
No, Nicky.
No, Nicky.
Hey, wait a minute, sister.
That's the number level with this girl.
Oh, he ain't.
He plays them all.
He's serious this time.
This morning, he asked me if I knew anything about buying furniture on the installment plan.
No.
He wanted to know how much it would cost to furnish a flat in Flatbush.
Say, don't let that fool you.
Six weeks, let him out with any girl.
Say, listen.
He buys wedding rings like you and me buy bananas.
That is, if we bought bananas.
How much of this we want?
$5,000.
Say, you didn't think I would figure on any part of that, did you?
What do you mean?
Well, I was going to turn the whole amount over to you.
Oh, I did not know I did.
$5,000.
All for me?
Why?
I'll get a promotion out of this.
And a girl, huh?
That's enough of me, baby.
You'll get the money, all of it.
$5,000.
All these things I could buy with you.
I'll get a promotion out of this.
And a girl, huh?
That's enough of me, baby.
$5,000.
All these things I could buy with you.
See you soon.
Hey, the sergeant's framing a nice surprise on this bandit.
Only going to take his life and his gal.
That's all.
He ain't out of it yet.
Don't worry, don't worry.
He's the best shot in the army.
Well, he'll have to be.
What I hear of this Cisco kid is true.
Yeah?
When do you expect a Cisco kid to come back?
Son, what a loopy is not very far.
Yes, he will be back soon.
Maybe you better take me home, eh?
I'll tell you this.
You will never capture him alive.
Yeah?
Well, I ain't figuring on capturing him alive.
I'll tell you that.
I'll be rich, rich, and I'll be gonna have...
All right, baby.
Maybe you've got a better man to you than these, eh?
This is the best one I got.
This is the rarest.
These come from the Soviet.
Eh?
How much you take for him?
$100 in bone.
That is fine. I buy him.
My girlies, you know I ride many miles just to find you.
I say to myself, eh, I cannot go home
unless I bring something nice for me and the Maratha.
Thank you.
I can see her in this now.
Beautiful light angels.
Adios!
Adios!
Adios!
Adios!
Adios!
Adios!
In the house!
Adios!
Adios!
Well, baby, that's what I call a perfect evening.
Fun.
I love no one but you.
My darling.
I'm gonna keep those shoes.
I never, never love you.
I swear to you.
I swear to you.
I swear to you.
This is my love.
He will come back soon.
He will kill you on sight.
You must not let him find you here.
He is a beast.
I wish you were dead.
You must kill him.
He told me he would never be tough to the life.
He is desperate.
Oh, I wish you were dead.
Will I get these rewards money soon?
Yeah, sure you will.
Just as soon as I identify him.
I will send you a note by the old woman.
When he returns.
Maybe, maybe tonight.
About 10 o'clock.
My love.
So long, my machata.
10 o'clock.
Yaqui, my friend.
You remember I told you.
I was a great lady, man.
That is not going now.
I am not as good as I think I am.
And maybe I never was.
County Island. Brooklyn.
The Bournemouth.
Five thousand dollars.
You're not.
And my gal to the town.
And my gal, she's young.
And she's pretty.
And she's ready to settle down.
I'll hold on.
And you need that.
To my lover.
I was afraid something might have happened to you.
I was afraid you might not come back.
I would not disappoint you.
And know how anxious you have been for me to come back.
Sonia.
Tell me.
Have there been anybody here looking for me today?
No, no, no.
No?
No.
Sonia Maria, these law is closing in around me.
Tonight I am sure that these, these life I live,
he does not say but, but like the man who is caught in the,
in the whirlpool, I cannot get out.
That is what a thief comes to know.
He cannot rob out his past.
He may be able to get away from these people to hunt for him,
but he can never get away from himself.
I go on, Sonia, till the chapter is finished,
but I know in the end I will pay.
Sonia, we will go far away tonight together, huh?
To Portugal, sonia.
I try.
I try to start all over again just for you.
I will be grand.
But I cannot get ready.
I cannot get ready.
I cannot get ready.
But I cannot get ready tonight.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, my nana.
Well, you get ready for long, long journey.
Get me wine.
Get me vino.
I'll get you wine, okay?
I put my fortune for us.
Juanita!
Juanita!
Where'd you been?
It's a merchant.
In the wagon?
True, in the wagon.
This way.
Where'd you been?
It's a merchant.
In the wagon?
True in the wagon.
Listen, take this note of salt here.
Write in the wagon to its top, you know where it is?
Hurry, quick, it's very important.
Don't make talk.
I'll explain to you when you get back.
Here, quick.
Hey, hey!
Real tough.
Hey, listen.
Why don't you follow the chains
Those fellas changed the bill of fare once in a while.
Beans, beans, beans.
General Grants have let us have peas.
What I'm memory that boy is gone.
Eggs.
Why don't you get some eggs?
Say, do you know that eggs cost 15 cents a dozen?
Do you have to buy them?
Well, what do you want me to do? Lay them?
You can't do that.
No.
Four soldiers.
Six on a six.
Men are old, Sonia Maria.
You can get any man you want.
I did not tell you I was for Yoma.
You got something for me?
A little prize of your life.
Look.
Amantia.
From Serbis.
I did lovely.
Little Jovo, my lovely.
To Jovo, my faithful, loyal, cunning,
loyal, constant sweet heart.
To your eyes with their warm devotion.
And to your lips with their warm kisses.
And to the heart of you and all the other girls in the world who
who are true, my dream.
To you, my brave caballero.
The bravest of the brave, my lovely.
That's got it, Sonia.
The wine was so strong it makes me cough.
It don't make me cough.
The old woman.
Listen, you better be careful, Sonia.
You know you'll be able to get some trouble.
Now listen, you fellas, keep quiet.
No funny business.
Now you understand?
I don't know.
What's the name of the girl?
Who is the old woman?
Ah, she lives with a girl.
Well, he better look out for them, Farnin.
They do things different.
Sir.
What's the name of the girl?
Rathias, Sonia Maria.
They do things different.
Sir.
Sir.
Rathias, Sonora, I guess I know who it's from.
He is here, but he is going away tonight.
He is frightened.
He thinks the party knows his hiding place.
When he goes, he will be disguised as a Goyle.
He will wear my clothes and on his head a large white manseller.
I will wear his clothes and ride away.
Come at ten o'clock tonight.
Do not fail.
Shoe quick and straight.
A hundred kisses, Sonia Maria.
Gee, here's something else.
Remember, he will wear a large white manseller.
You will be able to see it from a distance.
You get the idea, boys?
The bandit's gonna try to escape tonight in a Goyle's clothes.
Well, it is empty.
Do you have more?
No, no.
I have had enough.
The job's finished, boys.
I get my men tonight.
Get them alone.
You better let us go with you, sir.
No, sir.
I've got a particular reason for why they're trying this trick all by myself.
So long, boys.
The old sergeant's got a new gal and she's a pepper.
We ought to go along with him anyway.
No, no.
Didn't I tell you he was the best shot in the army?
Oh, well.
I think it is getting dangerous for me to stay here.
I better go.
I send for you.
No, no.
You must not go.
You must not.
I will not let you.
I will not let you.
You must stay here tonight.
I'm afraid to be here alone.
Tomorrow you can go.
But I will not let you go tonight.
Such anxiety he is touching.
You are so beautiful.
I could not refuse you anything.
We should have gone to Portugal tonight.
I better look around outside to make sure there is no danger.
Somebody is out there.
Adios, my beautiful angel.
That is what you are and what you will be an angel.
When I ride away, you stand outside where I can see you and wave goodbye to me.
And I know you'll love me.
If it is to be the end, I want to know that you are thinking only of me.
My beautiful angel.
One person to wave to me when I ride away.
That is it.
Her flirting days are over and she is ready to settle down.
I know you will try and grant me.
Though your kisses are divine,
I wonder if you are mine.
Oh, some time I adore you madly and some night.
