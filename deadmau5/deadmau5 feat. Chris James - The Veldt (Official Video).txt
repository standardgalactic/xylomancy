Look what they made and they made it for me
Happy technology
Outside the lion's room
Feeding on remains
We'll never leave
Look at us now
So in love with the way we are
Here
The world will let the children away
The world will let the children away
Every night they rock us to sleep
Did you know family?
Is it real or is it a dream?
Can you believe in machines?
Outside the beating of sun
Can you hear the screams?
We'll never leave
Look at us now
So in love with the way we are
Here
The world will let the children away
The world will let the children away
Here
The world will let the children away
Here
The world will let the children away
Here
Here
The world let the children away
Here
The world let the children away
Here
The world will let the children away
