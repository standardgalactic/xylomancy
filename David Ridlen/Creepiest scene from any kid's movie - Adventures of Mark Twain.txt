Fame is a vapor. The only earthly certainty is oblivion.
Welcome to the Mysterious Stranger.
What?
What?
Hello.
Who are you?
An angel.
What's your name?
Satan.
Uh oh.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Only it's sure a sorry name for an angel.
Oh wow.
Please come in.
Christian.
Come on.
Amazing. It's like an island.
Did you see that?
How'd you learn to do that?
I didn't learn it at all.
It comes naturally to me like other curious things.
Are you hungry?
Sure am.
What kind of fruit do you like the most?
Oranges.
Apples.
Grapes.
Oh.
Where'd he go?
What happened to him?
There.
Oh boy.
Can we help?
You may make some people.
I'll make the king and queen.
I'm gonna make a soldier.
Look at that little village.
There. Here's a buddy.
Now we'll give them life.
Moving.
Looks like my pap on Saturday night.
Look they're moving.
There's like bigger people.
Yeah.
I find you humans quite interesting.
Even though you are a worthless greedy lot.
How annoying that sound is.
Fools.
What fascinations there are on this planet.
Strange mortals with curious customs.
We'll have a storm now and an earthquake if you like.
You must stand aside out of danger.
Wait.
I love you.
I can do no wrong for I do not know what it is.
You murdered them.
Never mind them.
People are of no value.
We could make more sometime if we need them.
Life itself is only a vision.
A dream.
Nothing exists.
Say empty space and you.
And you are but a thought.
I want to go home.
I reckon I'm getting out of here.
Not that way.

We're only waiting for the right moment now.
Right moment for what?
Yeah.
Becky, do you swear not to tell?
Sure.
On your grandmother's bones?
Well, do ya?
Yeah.
We're gonna hijack this balloon.
What?
Hijack?
Can't you see it?
