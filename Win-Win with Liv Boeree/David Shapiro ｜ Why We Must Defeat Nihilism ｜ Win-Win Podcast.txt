So just like Malik, competition, status games, all of these are permanent features of humanity,
epistemic tribes, permanent feature of humanity. We cannot get away from that.
So rather than pathologizing it, because as Young said, that which resists,
that's what, yeah, if you resist it, you persist. But then also, as you noted earlier,
if you try and suppress something, it comes out in another way. And sometimes it comes out
in a destructive way. And so we need to welcome, we need to integrate all of these aspects of
ourselves by deep pathologizing it by saying, this is actually natural, healthy, and good.
I don't have to be ashamed of this. There's nothing to be guilty about.
We welcome all of these aspects of humanity back, and we become a whole species again.
Hello, my friends, and welcome to the Win Win podcast. Today's episode is all about nihilism,
what it is, and why it's so destructive for society. Because I am speaking to David Shapiro.
David is a technologist by training, starting out in automation engineering before pivoting
to AI research. However, he's probably best known for his YouTube channel, where he explores topics
around technology, philosophy, and meaning to help people better navigate what he calls
the fourth industrial revolution of AI. And so I reached out to see if he would
come on Win Win as a guest, because as you'll see, a lot of his content and thinking is very
closely related to what I've been trying to do on this channel, particularly around these concepts
of Molek and its antidote Win Win, and more generally around designing systems and aligning
incentives with what we actually want. As you can imagine, this conversation digs into a lot of that
stuff. And we also explore what he calls post nihilism as a solution to this nihilistic crisis,
this crisis of meaning and disenfranchisement that seems to be plaguing our current society.
So lots of juicy stuff. Really excited to share this one with you. Let's dig in.
Dave, thank you so much for joining. I first came across your work when I was
on some kind of YouTube spiral, as often is the case. And I saw a video saying,
Molek is losing by someone called David Shapiro. And I was like, who's this guy? And why does he
believe this? I don't think anything could have peaked my interest more. Obviously, the algorithm
is working. And because obviously the last few years, so much of my work has been around this
concept of Molek and as a way of framing the many problems that we seem to be facing.
So I guess to sort of get started, I'd love to hear, well, first of all, what is your definition
of Molek? And secondly, why you think it is losing? I think probably the best place to start
is how I came to you first. So in my YouTube journey, I started talking about narratives and
misalignments. And one of the questions that I kept getting very early in my own independent
research on alignment is whose values are you aligning to? And then the question emerged,
well, how do you align humanity? And I'm like, that's a really good question. So I started reading
about history, philosophy, economics, just everything that I could consume. And I started
talking about this on my channel. And I had like, after one video, I had like 15 comments of people
saying, you're talking about Molek. And I'm like, what the heck is this? And so then I just do,
like, I think it was just like a naive Google search. I'm like, what is Molek? And then you
popped up and I'm like, oh, this is cool. And so then I like binged your videos. And I was like
in a fugue state for like three days, as I was like, what is Molek? What is the meaning crisis?
What is the meta crisis? And I was on chat GPT, like furiously like, okay, is this a good analogy?
And so to answer your question, my definition of Molek, it is a combination of narratives.
So like neoliberalism is a narrative. And neoliberalism is a coordinating narrative of
this is how we achieve prosperity. This is how the world is supposed to work.
Another part of it is neurobiological failures. So that's what leads to attention economy and
attention engineering. Basically, you can hijack adrenaline and dopamine with outrage with,
you know, thirst trapping content and that sort of stuff. There's a few other components, but those
are the two primary components. It's just the limitations of human neuro neuro cognition
and the power of narratives. Yeah, it's interesting. Because that's like, in many ways,
a kind of deeper descriptive definition of Molek than what? Because the way I define it is basically
it's the kind of the demon god of competition gone wrong. Another way you could phrase it is like
the god of negative sum games, basically these like lose lose situations, where the incentives
acting on the individual actors make them act in such a way. So they think they're acting in their
own sort of short term self interest. But when everyone does it in aggregate, it creates this
kind of race to the bottom with all these negative externalities. And it actually arose from, so
to be clear, I would not the person who can take credit for the Molek meme. I mean, it actually
comes from the Bible, but the person to who I think most recently in modern times related it to
our like current civilizational issues is Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex, or Astral Codex
10 is the meme is the is the blog now, where he basically described it as this force of where
the game theoretic incentives of a situation pushes us to sacrifice more and more of our
other important values, because we're optimizing for one narrow metric. And in that process,
we sacrifice too much other stuff. So what the way you've described it, it sounds like it's,
it's actually something even deeper, because you know, if I call it it's competition gone wrong,
you're like, well, what are the forces that make competition go wrong? So as you said, it's like
this this biological dopamine hijacking. And then what was the other one you said?
So broader narratives, and then just those attention mechanisms of neurobiological failures,
because here's the thing, and I agree, like all of all of what you said 100% agree with.
And what I was trying to do to unpack this was, okay, what is the biological features or failures
or aspects of humans? What is in our evolutionary history? What is in our culture that is making
it so that we don't understand the incentives? And like, because here's, here's kind of where
I'm coming from, here's like kind of the, I guess, TLDR is in many cases, once you have coordination,
because look at communism versus capitalism, communism, which, you know, central price
management versus free market price discovery and price coordination. Once you have the right
narrative, the incentives kind of line up correctly. So that's why I say it's primarily
a narrative problem. And so there's, you know, you have capitalism versus communism versus
socialism versus fascism and democracy, and there's all these different narratives.
And so every system that you adopt, whether it's a political system, economic system,
education system, there's always going to be a trade off in terms of stability of the system.
So I got this actually from Daniel Schmockenberger. So by synthesizing all of these different
narratives, I was like, okay, what's the attractor state here? And why are we moving towards a
particular attractor state? So like, you're probably familiar with the meme, like late
stage capitalism. So late stage capitalism is an example of, okay, the narrative of neoliberalism
is moving us towards this end state. And that is a stable end state that we're intrinsically
inevitably moving towards because of the interaction between that narrative of neoliberalism
and democracy and a few other things, as well as the intrinsic just reward system of human
brains. But if you change the game, you change the system, so incentive alignment, you know,
game A, game, game B, or infinite versus finite games, then you can really fundamentally,
drastically change the behaviors of all players. Ultimately, it seems like what we're all talking
about is this, we've all got a sense that there's something off in society, something is clearly
going wrong. And it's manifesting through the way the rate at which we're disrupting our environment
faster than it can replenish itself. This this growing sort of isolationism and combativeness,
it seems, between people, the internet feels increasingly hostile in many ways.
That's not obviously discounting the many great things that is happening like it. It's like,
it's like two concurrent things are happening. It seems like things are getting simultaneously
worse in many domains, but also much better in other domains. So it's like, what is, you know,
which, how do we have more of this and less of that? So you discuss Daniel's meta crisis
as a way of framing it, Molek. And then you also talk about John Viveki's meaning crisis,
which I think by the sounds of things maps sort of closest to your actual sort of core
philosophy, which is about nihilism and specifically post nihilism. So can you explain
both what the meaning crisis is and what, how that relates to your sort of philosophy that
you're trying to build? Yeah. So as kind of a, maybe not a jumping off point, but a tangent,
is we're in the midst of a great disintegration or deconstruction, depending on which
verbiage you pull from. So over the last five centuries, basically since the invention of
the printing press, the Renaissance, we have been in a trend of, of rational inquiry of
increasing and it's driven by, by three kind of primary engines. We talked about this before.
So there's human curiosity that is an intrinsic force of our biology. It's evolved, it's
predates humanity. So curiosity combined with technological advancements. So printing press,
radio, television, internet, those are kind of feeding off of each other. And then the third
force is actually cognitive dissonance. And so cognitive dissonance actually drives us to say,
hey, these two ideas don't really fit together. And one generation after another,
you discard the stuff that is irreconcilable. And so what happened is you started with the
Renaissance and then you get enlightenment and then finally modernism. And at the same time,
so you have this, this like, these almost inverse curves. So you have the curve of rational inquiry
going up and then, and secularism going up while the old narratives. So again, it all comes back
to narratives. So the ontological and epistemic frameworks of religion are being deconstructed
bit by bit. And we don't have anything to replace it with. So the, what we tried to replace it with
is the three global narratives right now, which is science, democracy and capitalism.
So that's why people say like, oh, capitalism, or, you know, people worship the dollar,
like that is from a narrative perspective, from what's going on in people's brain,
that is actually not a bad way of describing it as like, we worship democracy, we worship money,
because that is what has been proposed as the global coordinating narrative, which has replaced
Christianity by and large, you know, Islam, Christianity, the Abrahamic religions.
When did this specifically start? Do you think this, this detachment from religion,
or this rejection of religion, is it, is it coinciding with the Enlightenment?
The first major shot across the bow was Martin Luther and the, the, the Protestant Reformation.
So that was saying, hey, Catholic dogma, no, like we need to reform the narratives that we're
putting forth in terms of morality and meaning and that sort of stuff. And so then you have the
Protestant Reformation, that was really kind of the first departure from the oldest ontological
and epistemic frameworks. And then from there, you know, you had alchemy was banned, you know,
for instance, when I was touring France a decade ago, there's like hidden like vaults and warrens
that all the wealthy people had where they would practice alchemy during the Renaissance.
They banned it.
It was, you would get executed for practicing alchemy because it was seen as against the church.
Wow.
So, but, you know, and then it didn't actually do anything or work.
Well, I mean, so actually alchemy is the predecessor of modern chemistry was the idea of
I'm going to futz around with substances and olympics and fire and see what happens.
And that process was eventually refined and reformed. And then once it was decriminalized,
it was brought into the university systems. And then they're like, hey, this is actually kind
of cool. We can do stuff with it. And that gave rise to modern science. So that actually led to
that. What the scientific method evolved out of, do you think?
Pretty much. I mean, it wasn't just one independent thing, but like that idea of
rational inquiry, because again, human curiosity, plus technology plus cognitive dissonance,
we figure stuff out. That is how we went from the Stone Age to agriculture to Iron Age, Stone,
or steel, steam and fourth industrial revolution that we're in right now.
So to me, I see it as these are inevitable like consequences of just human biology just
playing out. So that's why I call Molek is like, okay, we evolved to throw spears on planes and
go hunting and fishing. And so we are out of our natural environment. We are a fish out of water
right now, which is why we have those neurobiological failures. But the superpower that we have,
and this comes from, you've all know a Harari, the superpower that we have is the ability to
coordinate with narratives. So to kind of tie it all up with a bow, the reason that Molek is losing
is because we know this now. We know the power of narratives. We know how to construct narratives.
I can list, you know, like here's eight rules to construct a powerful, compelling narrative.
We can systematically start creating and deconstructing and reconstructing new narratives.
And once you do that, once everyone has a new model to believe in that isn't just
capitalism, science and democracy, we need a fourth narrative, something about meaning.
And that like, okay, what is our new value system? And so, you know, like,
do you care about yourself? Do you care about your children? Like, what do you care about?
That is part of what I'm working on with post nihilism. And so I'm hoping my wish,
and I obviously can't do this by myself, that's why we're here. So thank you.
But in the long run, by working on this narrative and getting it out there and workshopping it,
we can find that kind of that third attractor state that Daniel Smoktenberger is looking for.
And I think that narratives are the keystone. That's the lynchpin to get there.
To define the third attractor state for people, that's essentially right now. It seems like we
have two attractors. One is, you know, we're facing all these big scary risks in technology,
whether it's like manmade pandemics or runaway AI or whatever the various technological risks
you're concerned about. And as these risks mount through the democratization of technology,
either we're going to go towards a sort of anarchic state, which is generally self-terminating,
or we're going to end up in some centralized control tyrannical state. So arguably, it's like
we're either going to end up in like this mass decentralization, which is not going to end
well for people, or over centralization, which is also like possibility of tyranny forever
terrifying. So we need a third option that like takes the best bits of both and presumably gets
rid of the worst bits of both, right? Exactly. To dig into this idea of post nihilism, can you
explain first of all what your definition of nihilism is? I think I have an intrinsic sense
of what it means, but actually whenever I've looked it up, it's like, oh, it doesn't seem like
people even specifically agree. So start off by defining that, and then can you explain what
post nihilism is? Yeah, for it to make the most sense, it probably be best to just tell you the
brief story of how I got to the nihilistic crisis and post nihilism. So starting five years ago,
I went through a really bad divorce, and my life was like mid 30s, and I'm just like,
I need to reinvent myself. And so I started reading all kinds of books on relationship
dynamics. I started fiction writing, I started saying like, how do I actually want to live?
And so what I now call that what I did kind of intuitively was I engaged in alignment.
And so I was like, okay, I'm aligning my life to my true self. I'm aligning to
my body's needs, my relational needs, my psychological needs. And so by reading all of
these various books on relationship dynamics and mental health and changing my career,
eventually changing my career, now I'm a writer, now I'm a YouTuber. What I learned with a pattern
that emerged, there's several key books that I read that kind of made me realize this particular
pattern. But because of those changes, because of those social changes that we were talking about
with the rise of science, the rise of secularism, the decline of older epistemic and ontological
frameworks, namely religion, they're not the only ones that that's a big one. Because of that,
and then you have, you add in things like social mobility. So you have jobs across the world,
people moving all over the place, you have the innovation of suburbs, nuclear family homes.
So there's all these different technologies and things that have caused this utter disintegration
of our social fabric. And so the first people to notice this was one was Eugene Rose or Seraphim
Rose. He was, he wrote against nihilism back in the 60s. So he was a, he was like a Bohemian
and like in New York. And so he was just like, yeah, like, you know, tear it all down. But then
he ended up as like an alcoholic, like just literally drinking himself to the death, to death
in the basement of like a flat in New York. And he, his salvation came from going back to
religion. And he said, and so he wrote a whole book saying, we are categorically like effed,
unless we all go back to religion. And Joseph Campbell, who wrote the power of myth and the
hero's journey. So his work inspired, you know, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, I guess,
Lord of the Rings predates him, but the same, same cycle, he more or less said the same thing,
not quite as dramatically, he was a little bit more refined in his, in his study, but he was,
he, his, his life's work was ultimately about the power of myth and the fact that all the old
myths are dying because they're not relevant anymore. And he said, what do we do next? And so
like, even some of his last interviews, he was so sweet and so humble, but like there was such a
profound sadness, because he knew he could see the writing on the wall saying, everything that we
have believed in is going away. And we don't have anything to replace it with. And so
seeing that, that grand pattern, the, the, you know, secure attachment patterns in children,
the fact that we have latchkey kids and children raised by screens, we have isolating suburbs,
all of this, I was like, Oh my God, this is what nihilism is. This is why nihilism is so popular
right now. And so what I did is I codified it, I defined it in what I call the nihilistic crisis
and the four abandonments, which by the way, sounds like a really cool heavy metal band.
So the nihilistic crisis and the four abandonments, no. So it's a cycle of,
it's a system of abandonment. So the first abandonment is childhood abandonment. So childhood
abandonment is, like I said, latchkey children, children raised by screens, not good enough
parents. So 50% of parents fail to rise to the level of good enough parenting.
Up on, defined upon what metric.
So that is, gosh, I can't remember the name of the psychologist who codified it,
but it was back in the fifties or sixties. So this term has been around for a while.
But basically, if parents rise to the level of good enough, that threshold,
they provide enough safety, security and warm positive regard for their children that their
children ultimately have what's called secure attachment. And so secure attachment is like,
you know that you're safe in relationships and you know that like your needs are going to get
met. That's basically from a toddler's perspective, I'm going to be taken care of. 50% of parents fail
to do that even to this day. And 20% of children grow up with what's called CEN, childhood emotional
neglect. So that is actually a clinically pathological level of emotional neglect. And
the studies actually say it's probably higher, like there's probably a lot going on detected.
So you have 20% is like suffering from profound emotional neglect. And then 50% are suffering
from at least inadequate parenting. So seeing that pattern, I said, okay, what are the physical
causes of that? Why is this suddenly an issue? And that's not to say that it wasn't an issue
before, but it's like we didn't invent it, like ADHD probably existed before we invented it.
But at the same time, we're aware of this and we're more acutely aware of it. And as I was
studying all this, I started seeing more and more manifestations in society. So you have
like the anti natalists out there that are like, you know, birth, like nobody should be born.
Life just sucks. And as you were saying earlier, in some metrics, life is getting better. But in
some, it's getting worse. So like, what is the disconnect? And I saw nihilism, which is a consequence
of it. It's not a force that exists out there. Nihilism is a consequence of these trends.
And so I see the pattern of childhood neglect playing out. And so that leads to social abandonment.
So social abandonment manifests in things like rugged individualism. It manifests in, you know,
socially isolating suburbs. It manifests in high levels of social mobility, where you leave your
hometown and never go back and you front your friend group keeps changing. And so we end up
with this like, I mean, we're basically all living as nomads, right? In today's world where
you might know people for a few years, but then they kind of come and go. And so our social
support network is basically like, you've kind of got to fend for yourself.
Right. Or at least it's who you have around you for now.
Right. For now. And some people are good at that. But I think that for most people,
our biology is really attuned to having the same people around you for decades. I think that's
really how most people just are meant to operate.
And also multi-generational. I mean, that's what we evolved out of, right? The tribe would have,
I mean, probably weren't that many grandparents, but people were having babies younger.
And so actually that reminds me, another point of evidence is actually from anthropology. So
throughout most of human history, and I mean like Stone Age, Paleolithic, and even pre-human,
the evidence is that basically humans lived in tribes of about six to 21 on average.
And so imagine that you and your dozen or almost two dozen closest friends and relatives do
everything together. Hunt, cook, clean, build structures, you know, you celebrate everything
together. That is, I think, our natural state. And how many people live like that? Like, there's
co-housing communities, there's co-living communities, but those are rare. And it often
requires a certain level of privilege, level of privilege, there we go, sorry, to live like that.
And if you don't have that privilege, then it's like, okay, the default path that society
offers you. So this is really where social abandonment comes in.
The default path that society offers you is you go to high school, you have your friends,
then everyone scatters to the wind to go to college. And then you're there for four to 10 years,
and then everyone scatters again. And then you're in your first job, and you're, you know,
God, one of the most cynical things, one of the, one of the most to me, most sickening
manifestations of social abandonment is that like, oh, work is your family, right? And like,
they start making fun of it in movies now, like the new Anne Hathaway movie that came out a couple
years ago. She's like, we're a family. And everyone's like, no, stop saying that. But that is because
we have been deprived of our tribe. And so, you know, bosses, corporations fill the void, try to,
right? But that's where I say capitalism is a pale imitation in terms of providing meaning,
because it is providing efficiency. It's meeting our physical needs, but it's not meeting our
spiritual needs or social needs. It's not meeting a lot of other needs. And so because we don't
have a good offering, that's why we have these, all these misalignments, because it's like, well,
you know, just a quick aside, like, if people spent more time in nature, if there was more
options to spend more time in nature, people would care about nature more and preserve nature more,
and they'd be healthier. That's why, like, all of my videos lately, I'm walking in the woods,
because it's like, I need 90 minutes of forest time every day, and I'm so much healthier. God,
when like, when we have rain for a few days, and I'm like stuck inside, I like feel like I'm just
decaying. No, I mean, I'm the same. Igor literally makes me go outside every day,
because otherwise I go crazy. He's like, have you been out yet? He has to take me like a dog
for a walk. So, okay, so that's the second one is the social abandonment. The third one you
listed, the four abandonments, is cosmic abandonment. So what's that? So cosmic abandonment is that
rise of secularism. That is, so, you know, as Nietzsche said, you know, God is dead, God remains
dead, we have killed him. That was not a, that was more of an observation rather than a declaration.
He was just like, oh, this is what we've done with the, and I trace personally, I trace a direct
line from the printing press to that statement, because that that constant deconstruction and
evaluation and democratization of information led to that moment. And so then we still haven't
replaced it. So on the one hand, there's the rise of secularism. But then on the other hand, we
have telescopes, we can see literally to the edge of the universe, and it's empty. And it's
terrifying, because we don't see anything like us. And so the universe, to most people, it is just a,
it is an axiomatic fact that we are alone. And that is terrifying, because that reminds us of
that childhood abandonment at a very, very deep unconscious level, is that we are alone, there
are no adults in the room, and no one is coming to help us. And that is why so many people believe
that we are irredeemably and irretrievably heading in the wrong direction. It's a visceral,
emotional truth. Do you think this, do you think nihilism existed in the highly religious days
of past? And if it did, how did it manifest? On an individual level, there are always people
who struggle and people who doubt. So even going back to, you know, ancient Greece and ancient Rome,
there were atheists back then, there are agnostics back then. And even in indigenous cultures, I'm
sure there were people who doubted. But in many of those cases, their lifestyles were so much more
grounded in their bodies. And their lifestyles were so much more grounded in the people around them.
And as I have started living like that, there is so much less like existential dread. It is,
I feel good today. Like a few days ago, as I was getting ready for this trip, and I was like,
nervous, and I couldn't sleep. I still felt so good in my body. I was just like, I'm gonna lay
here in bed. And I was like, I was like, I lay there for like five hours, not sleeping. But I was
like, I just feel so physically good. And I have so much hope and optimism. And it wasn't like,
just cognitive. It was a deep visceral experience. And I think that if more people lived like that,
then there would be a lot less of that nihilism. So again, I think that nihilism is a consequence
of these abandonments. Right. Well, we haven't, I'd love to dig into more of this like alignment
with the body in search and what you actually do, and what you've done to like, wake that up in
yourself. But first, we need to touch on the fourth one, which is self abandonment. Yes.
So what is that? So self abandonment is being seen more and more in various places.
The Japanese are great at naming things. So in Japan, it's called Hikikimori. And so the Hikikimori,
yeah, you know, I literally just came back from Japan and we learned about it. Igor was just like
obsessed with this concept. Yeah. So this is that is quintessential self abandonment. So that is
basically, it's typically young men who have just given up on themselves, because there's no job
prospects. There's no hope of attracting a woman. And so they lock themselves in their room, or at
least they feel that there isn't. Right. It's not necessarily true, but it's been sufficiently
hard enough. But it's a narrative. There's a name for it. There's a narrative attached to this
lifestyle. So you see what I mean? It all comes back to narratives. And do you think that's so
the creation of that narrative is actually a dangerous thing? No. So narratives are just us
putting a tag on it. It's like, oh, hey, we just observed a thing. It's just like when you go,
you know, a taxonomist just goes and labels like, I see a turtle. This is a turtle now.
So we observed this thing. So the Japanese observed this phenomenon, this trend, this hopelessness
and despair. And that's just one example. So another example is there's, there's like a kind of a
constant meme. So like at like Comic-Con and other conventions, like men that don't bathe and shower,
like that is another form of self abandonment where they just do not take care of themselves
physically. And that is them. So in psychology, this is called reenactment. So they're basically
reenacting their childhood abandonment the rest of their lives. God, I'm about to cry. Sorry.
Like it's just when you, when you, like when you see this, when you wake up to it, you see it
everywhere. Another kind of self abandonment that most that many people have is workaholism.
So that's what I'm recovering from. That's actually why I had to delay this is because I was still
suffering from burnout over several years of because, and here's again, where the narrative
of capitalism fails us because it says, in order to get your needs met, just work harder.
That is self abandonment. It's don't sleep in, wake up, go to work, ignore your body, ignore your
needs, work for the money. And that also rewards you. So this is, this is where I fundamentally
agree with you about Molek is the fundamental misalignment here is don't take care of yourself,
don't take care of the people you care about, don't don't even take care of nature, just make money.
Well, and it's specifically, it's the, the collapsing of all of those different virtues
and values and arguably metrics like money is easy. It's convenient because it's quanta,
it's easily quantified. It's, it's a quantification of value that it
claims to capture all of these other ones. But in that, in that reduction, it loses so much
because it is actually hard to quantify your personal wellbeing or your connection to nature,
your connection to your family and so on. It's, it's, it's not good at capturing those values.
So yeah, that's one of the definitions I like. I often use as well for describing Molek is it's
like, it's a complexity. It's that which curtailes emergent complexity in some way, because it feels
like if you look at the history of the universe or like a history of life on earth, it's started
off with the prokaryotic cells and then they, they started coordinating and you got the first
eukaryotic cells, which created multi cellular life, et cetera, et cetera. It's been this
at each step change, there's this new emergent thing that happens. And to me, like a truly
Maloccian process is one where it like caps out of it, its knee caps stops it in some way.
And I think that's where I am sensing this, this, this nihilism crisis is threatening to take us
because it's like, if you have a population that has become fully nihilistic and just like,
is a population of Kiko Mori's, there ain't new emergent stuff coming out of that. They're just
going to, like that population's done. And what new stuff can emerge, probably not very much.
No, that's absolutely relevant. So that is, that is one of the attractor states.
So now the, this is, I don't know if we'll disagree on this. So humans, again, with that
democratization of information, progress of technology, curiosity, cognitive dissonance,
also eventually you just kind of get fed up with it. And so we say, okay, this isn't working,
let's try something else. And so while one generation might not figure it out,
the next generation often does. And so like Japan is, is finally maybe possibly coming out
of the lost decade, which is more like the lost three decades now. And so eventually you say,
whatever we were doing is not working, let's try something else. And there is,
some of my audiences is a good chunk of them are younger than me. And so there's like Gen Z,
they're like, thank you, not someone who cares, and who is helping us figure it out. And that's
actually like kind of the center of my brand is like, we're going to figure this out, because I
believe that this problem is solvable. And it is solvable with that narrative. But again,
to your point, yes, I do agree that, that if this narrative persists,
then it could be self terminating. And of course, like what some people are afraid of is that it
will surf to self terminate in a way that is irrecoverable, like destruction of humanity.
I'm personally not afraid of that. But it's it, I do also predict that it will get worse
before it gets better, because the pain is not high enough. So there's, there's this concept
of, of like the pain, the devil, you know, right? If the devil you know is tolerable,
you'll stay with it. So it'll get worse before it gets better. But I think that it will get
better. And that's why, again, this is why I've made that assertion, Malik is losing is because
people like you and me are here communicating it, figuring it out, and, and like sowing the seeds.
And so then the seeds will take a little time to germinate. But then once they're ready,
like, I think that I think that our work is probably really timely.
Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what this podcast is about. That's why the name win-win,
I was like spending so much time dressing up as Malik and like trying to depict the,
the, the problem, which I think was important. But I was like, okay, but there's something in
me started being like, eh, I don't really want to dress up as that anymore. I'd rather like,
is there something else I can dress up as that's kind of like the solution to this? And like,
the name win-win kept coming to me. And it's like, if, if Malik's like red and black and like,
a very monomaniacal focus, win-win is like, popples and turquoise and greens and like
just wants to play and loves a bit of competition, then like, we'll shit talk you. But then it's
like, ah, we'll have a nice time and play. It's an infinite game. Exactly. It's the infinite
mindedness. Yeah, infinite game and sort of bought into a persona. So, yeah, no, exactly. And, and
so, okay, so you, so the TLDR of why you think Malik is losing, just so I have this right,
is because you think sufficient people like you, like me and like plenty of others are like
trying to create new narratives. And we're also finding each other.
Yeah. So to put it as succinctly as possible, I believe we have solved the problem. Now that,
now the next task is dissemination, is conversation.
But how have we solved it? Like, is maybe not, maybe not completely.
Yeah, I don't think these, I mean, you know, we've only got like, you know,
we're in the order of magnitude of 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. I mean, I feel like
my view counts are not as high as I would like them to be. I imagine you'd like yours to be
higher as well. I think your content deserves to have more views. Meanwhile, like someone who's
saying, we need to burn out, you know, we need to burn it all to the ground. And like,
why, why, you know, the world is doomed, etc. Those narratives are getting shit tons of views
as are like, AI is going to solve everything magically, like just take off all regulation.
And, you know, like the, it feels like the extremists, because really what we're arguing
for is like, kind of like these hybrid synthesis type viewpoints to create new
positive narratives. But the extremists, meanwhile, go out and just say they're like
extremist stuff and they dominate the attention sphere. So why is it that it's,
the problem has been solved? It doesn't feel like it sufficiently.
There is no force as powerful as an idea whose time has come.
And I think there's a lot of people that are ready. And it's just a matter of,
of articulating it clear enough and consistently enough and messaging and getting the right people
involved to repeat those messages. And then once it gets out there, so having studied,
studied narratives, having, having studied rhetoric and systems. What was it? Who was the guy that,
that figured out the human genome project? And it was like, we've only,
we've only sequenced 1% of the genome. Oh, we're most of the way done.
So we're, we're halfway there. So that means we're most of the way done,
but it's a matter of getting to that tipping point. And so getting,
getting to a narrative tipping point is if the narrative is compelling enough,
if the narrative is emotionally salient and resonant, if it is defensible, if it is,
if it is coherent and sound and if, and if it is accessible, then so if,
so I tie it up in a nice bow and say, post nihilism here, gift. And so that's why I'm
working on this book. And then it's not just a matter of articulating the problem because
articulating the problem is half the battle. So then the, the solution is like, okay,
what do you, what do you replace this nihilism and abandonment with? And that's what I call
radical alignment. Okay. So what is radical alignment? So I haven't quite distilled the
definition, but radical alignment is living in alignment with your true self and true needs.
And so one of the ways to think about this or the first kind of pillar is body first living.
So that's prioritizing what your like evolved animal needs are. So eat right, exercise, you know,
get fresh air, stuff that kind of everyone knows, but there's more to it than that.
Cause it's not just a matter of behaviors. It's also a matter of beliefs.
It's a matter of saying, Hey, I actually have a right to sleep in when I'm tired.
I have a right to leave work when I'm not happy here. And it's a matter of prioritizing ourselves.
So here's an example. They say it takes like 12,000 hours to indoctrinate students with,
with school, with education. I think it's 12,000. So what is particularly American schools are
really bad, but there's bells. You show up on time or you get punished. You're often forced to wake
up early. You're also forced to work after hours. So you're basically, we're programming students
from a very young age. Your body doesn't matter. Your time is not yours. You don't own you.
The system owns you. And so then from kindergarten to grade 12 to college, it's just like,
here is a, an assembly line of obedient drones. So that is the opposite of self alignment.
That is the opposite of body first living. That is saying you owe the system your productivity.
Sure, but doesn't, don't, but there's some virtues within that though, because it teaches you
a form of discipline or like, because I guess what I would be concerned about with this, like,
this body, like body first, me first approach is that, you know, I, if I want to just sleep in
all the time, I, then what, there are a lot of people out there who will like just then abuse
that or use it as an excuse to then not really get anything done, right?
Possibly. I mean, I am living in more alignment with what I need. And I am more productive than
I have ever been in my entire life. I mean, I frequently, I work seven days a week and I work,
I often wake up at five in the morning, work until about noon. So that's a seven hour day.
And I don't really take breaks. Well, no, I'd go for my walks to recording, but I'm hitting
multiple birds with one stone. Now, here's the thing though, while there might, you could argue
from one value system that there is merit in, in, in giving people a sense of discipline. Sure.
Punctuality. Punctuality, sure. But I mean, there's social pressures to, to, to achieve that.
So I read this book called The Status Game by Will Store. So this is, this is a keystone
piece of this idea. And that is that as a social species, all humans are status motivated. That
is like the fundamental signal in all of our operating systems. And there's three status
games. So there's dominance, which is like physical prowess and intimidation and sexual,
you know, gratification. It's basically the, the id. And then there is the success game. So that's
money. So getting money, getting grades, getting the car, everyone is, everyone is motivated by
that to some extent. And then there's the, what is it? The, the prestige game. So prestige is,
that's the game that like I'm playing, which it's about, are you renowned for being smart or
solving problems? Are you pious? So like in academia, like how many, how many citations you
have? Yeah, papers, citations. If you're religious, it's, you know, how high in the church are you
or how well known are you to be a follower of Christ or those sorts of things. All humans
play status games. And like we're kind of aware of it, like kind of in an unconscious background
level. And it's been true for all of human history. But by bringing that to more of the forefront
and saying, Hey, we need to align with our animal nature. We are social apes. And we say, Hey,
what if we just use these natural forces to actually get incentivize the behavior you want to see?
And so then what do you do is in this book, he talks about all kinds of different systems. So
like, for instance, the prison system, phenomenal natural experiment to look at how status plays
out because you can exchange favors, right, or, or goods. Like one of the things that is really,
really popular in prisons, if you have any expertise, like if you have medical expertise
or legal expertise, you're like immediately high status. If you are well connected and trusted,
respect is everything. And so you have this, this, this like incubation chamber of, okay,
how do status games play out if everyone is like disempowered in a certain way? Sports teams,
churches, schools, status games play out in all kinds of different ways. And right now,
money is the universal status signal, right? But it's only, that's only the success game.
So then why do people do CrossFit? That's the dominance game, because they want to have like
buff bodies and they want to be really, they look good in bikinis. That is a different status game.
And so this is one thing that I kind of came to as I was thinking, all right, what are the
long-term consequences of artificial intelligence? We all might end up without conventional jobs,
like work as we know it might go away or change fundamentally. So I was like, well,
what are people going to do? And so a lot of people are like, man, if I don't know what I would
do without my job. But I'm like, there's plenty of other status games to play. Like you can get
famous on YouTube, you can go do CrossFit, you can go become religious.
Become a gamer.
Right. Yeah. Become like that. I mean, God, some of my best friends, like that is their religion
is gaming or, you know, how much about anime, you know, or whatever your fandom is. So there's
so much we can do. And I'm like, well, why don't we just use this to, to gamify the behavior that
you want to see? And I think was it, it was, I think it was Japan. Somewhere recently, I saw
that they actually gamified cleaning up. They made it a competition of like, how much trash could
you collect? And it was like a race. So it's like, you can gamify this stuff. And if it becomes a
status game, people are going to do it anyways. So I think that, I think that by looking at that,
and those are all, these can all be infinite games, by the way.
Totally. The only thing I'd say is like in this like post scarcity world, I mean, truly post
scarcity utopia, like I just had Nick Bostrom on and we discussed this, like what,
how would people derive? Well, I mean, I guess you're claiming with post nihilism that you don't
even need to have meaning in order to live a happy life.
Sort of. I think that we are too locked in our heads. We're too intellectualizing of meaning,
and we're too cerebral about it. And this is, this is, I think, particularly an American
slash Western problem where it's like, we try and divorce the mind from the body.
But like the happiest that, that like I am and the happiest that people are is when you're having
fully embodied experiences. Like, you know, if you're at a rave or, you know, you're on a horse,
right? Like I remember on my, my first honeymoon, one of the things that we did was I was riding
horses through the surf in the Bahamas. You're not thinking about anything else other than I'm
not going to like, because you fall off the horse, you get like drowned and kicked in the head.
And it's just like that is, that is burned into my memory as an embodied experience. And I remember
getting super dehydrated the next day and like passing out in the cabin and thinking that a
beer was going to help. And I was even worse. So it took me like a day to get rehydrated.
But like those embodied experiences, that's where we get meaning from. Another one of my most
meaningful experiences in life was when I went to France to visit friends. I was internet friends,
and I just like went for two weeks. And we went to Paris, we went to Nantes, we went to see all
kinds of stuff. I was exhausted the entire time. I had heartburn the entire time because I was like
traveling and I wasn't used to it. But I don't care about any of that stuff. The meaning was
from connecting with these people that were like me and having this, this novel experience
that was just like, wow. And I still draw on that. That was 12 years ago. And like that is
a central anchor of like my life, of meaning in my life had nothing to do with intellectual
anything and just fully embodied. So radically aligning with your body's needs was the sort
of first. And it sounds like you're sort of going up the Maslow hierarchy of needs, right?
So what's the next level of alignment? So I'm still working on this model. So there's actually
quite a few models to draw from. So one is Roger Walsh's TLC, Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes.
So this is a pattern of eight different things that you can do. And I'm not going to be able
to remember all of them, but it's like time and nature, spiritual connection, rest and relaxation,
very, very pragmatic. Just like, if you do these eight things, you will be healthy and happy.
And like, by God, it works as you know, community service, giving back. So you do those things,
it works. Another one is SDT, so self-determination theory. So this is a psychological framework
that says you need competence, relatedness and autonomy. So those are the three fundamental
psychological needs. So if you work on those on a daily or weekly basis, you will feel like you
have a meaningful life. Ikegai, again, Japanese are great at naming things. If you live in alignment
with your Ikegai, which is the, that is the intersection of what is it? It's what you're
good at, what you can get paid for, what society needs and what you love. You do those four things,
you will have a meaningful life. And so I'm trying to grab, wrap my arms around all of these
existing frameworks. Some of them are very old. And you know, whether it's psychological needs,
body needs, spiritual needs, put them all together in a new system. I have a few ideas,
but I'm not quite there yet. That's the, I'm working on that on the next draft in my book.
So once you, once I have this new model, this new framework, it's like, you do this,
you will have a meaningful life. And in like side benefit, you will also value the things
and therefore make different decisions that lead to things like more environmental sustainability,
more political stability, those sorts of things, because it all starts with our animal self.
But we need a narrative over top of that that says, okay, we can all get along. And we basically
aim for the win-win where it's, we all live better and healthier, and it's better for the economy,
and it's better for the environment. That's kind of really what I'm looking for.
Yeah. So yeah, it sounds to me like it's a complete and coherent description of what I'm
trying to do as well with like, with win-win is kind of more of a like very surface level idea of
like, because for me, my, my sort of, I'm not saying in any way I'm enlightened far from it.
And I've got like plenty of misalignments going on inside myself all the time, you know, I'm,
I don't exercise as much as I would like. I don't work as hard as much blah, blah, blah. But
the big wake-up moment for me was recognizing my own relationship with competition. So I was
like living very much in this like scarcity. I saw everything as kind of zero sum contest.
And in many ways, you know, I don't, I'm not discounting that entirely because that drove me
to achieve the many things that I achieved and got me to a position that I'm in, which is great.
But there was this kind of, it wasn't like an individual light bulb moment, but it was this
period of time where I was like, wait, I need to fundamentally approach the world from a more
abundance perspective of like, don't assume that when someone else does well, that's coming from
a cost of me or vice versa. Like just like take a leap of faith that the universe is fundamentally
abundant and the world can be abundant. And through that leap of faith, it unlocks things. And I have
to say like things have just like the ripple effects of that have been very tangible.
That said, so it sounds like you're coming from, we need to start off at the bottom of
Maslow's hierarchy, do the body, the body stuff first and go from there. There's a school of
thought that they often call themselves the techno accelerationists or the EX or whoever who just
believe that actually, yes, okay, there's a lot, there's a lot of problems, but just doing more
of the same, which is like, let the techno-capital machine just keep running as fast as possible,
and technology will unlock that abundance that we need. And we'll just get all of our solutions
from that. So that seems a little incongruent with what you're claiming.
No, that's actually a necessary step. So the technology component, because remember,
a democratization of technology and the natural progress of technology led us to where we are.
That will create material abundance, more abundance than we already have. However,
and this is what I try and caution my audience and not anyone who listens,
is technology can make everything worse. It is an amplifier. The reason that the climate is in
crisis is because we invented new technology that is more destructive. AI and automation and quantum
computing and nuclear fusion is going to take that up to not even 11, it's taken up to a million.
So we need the right narratives. So a body-first, environment-first set of narratives to say,
okay, if you have the power of a God, like I think you all know Harari's latest book is
Homo Deus, so like the human God, that's what we're becoming. So we need to adopt a more,
enlightened sounds a little bit cheesy, but a refined narrative about who we are and what we are
and what we owe it to ourselves. And so another source of inspiration was Patricia Churchland,
who wrote Brain Trust. And so the concept that she focuses on is she's a philosopher turned
neuroscientist, very interesting background. And so she talks about spheres of caring. And so
from an animal perspective, your sphere of caring, you are at the center. You care about yourself
and your body most and you're hardwired to do this. And the closer you are to people,
the more you care about them. But what you realize when you have this more generative,
this more abundant mindset, the infinite game, is you actually care about everyone. And so that's
actually the core ethos that made me start my channel is, okay, this is going to go catastrophically
wrong within 20 years if I don't do something or if we all don't do something. So in my own best
interest, my sphere of caring is the entire planet. And so in that respect, so the simplest
definition of kindness is you operate in the best interest of the other. And so that is an
infinite narrative. Now, one thing I do want to push back on is that while one competition is
inevitable due to status games, and you can have infinite game mindset, you can have abundance
mindset, but because of human nature, because of the status game, many things are ordinal,
meaning it is a rank. So Nick Bosserman talked about this too in his book. So that means there
can only be the one richest man, there can only be the one, you know,
prettiest woman, there can only be the one top poker player. So I remember from a previous
podcast, you were talking about like, there's another up and coming woman, and you're like,
like, you know, because that's a status threat. Right. And so it doesn't do us any good to deny
that fact of our human nature. So we need to, this narrative needs to integrate the fact that,
yes, we can have an abundant mindset, but you also need to keep the animal happy, the little scarce
animal that's right. So you keep the stakes low enough in those ordinal status games where it's
like, Hey, if you lose on call of duty, the world isn't over. So what it sounds like you're saying
is that energy needs to go somewhere. You can't just, and I've noticed like, when I've tried to
like completely suppress that in myself, I actually end up getting miserable and probably
lash out at you or whoever and so on. Like, so I need to find outlets for that, which is why
we actually have like, we have regular games nights and I, you know, anything that can
harness that like, that that id essentially, and just steer it healthy outlets, the social
structure, you do it with people, you do it regularly, and you don't pathologize it. We
pathologize, we pathologize so much of our own nature. That's another component of self-abandonment
where it's like, sexuality has been deeply pathologized by the state religion for many
centuries, but it's like, actually, sexuality is part of our id and you suppress that and it
comes out in other ways. So I guess, though, with my concern around the like, the current status quo
of technological development, and it's not all, you know, there's plenty of centers around the
world and amazing companies building incredible things. That said, the vibe to me, and this is
just like vibes, but one thing I'd say I think I am good at is I'm really good at picking up on
vibes, okay, of certainly of competitive environments because I've just been around so many
different ones and I've spent so much time like trying to understand my own like weird pathologies
around it. What's going on in Silicon Valley right now, specifically in the Bay Area,
the vibe is off and I can't really fully put my finger on it. It's something related to, I think,
I imagine it's whether it's a bit chicken and eggy, but it's something around the city itself
when you, you know, there are people going to work in downtown SF in these incredible glass
palace towers, building world-changing technologies and don't get me wrong, some amazing stuff,
but they have to walk through a literal dystopian environment and the people
who have to walk past that every day are having to turn off a piece of their humanity.
Like, you can't, you can't help everyone and you're having to like, you're in this like,
sort of self-protection mode and I wonder like what that does to you psychologically to just
day in, day out, have to suppress your natural human instinct to go and help that person lying
face down on the street, like clearly out of their minds on drugs and shitting themselves,
you know? Like, what does that do to you? And like, that seems to me like a very,
like if I was to pick of all the environments with which to cede this potential new technological
God that may or may not like run off entire world, that's probably not the one. Like,
same as I wouldn't want to pick what on Ukraine right now or Israel-Palestine or anywhere where
there's like a lot of like conflict or suppression of like natural human instinct,
because one of our major natural human instincts is to care for the other. You see
your fellow human in a bad state, you want to go help them, but at the same time,
like no individual can fix what's going on in San Francisco right now. So, yeah, I'm curious
just to sort of spitball on you on like, do you sense that? I don't know if you spent much time
so San Francisco is one of the most interesting and that's being diplomatic and kind,
cities in the world, because I've been there. Definitely interesting. Yeah, it's not boring.
But so last time I was there, I did some math and I looked at what is the GDP of San Francisco?
And it's something like $2 billion per day. They have 8,000 to 20, 30,000 homeless, depending on
how you... So, a few thousand homeless people with $2 billion a day, that social abandonment is a
choice. That is part of the narrative of neoliberalism is that you need a certain amount of homeless
people to remind everyone else, this is how little you are cared about. That is there, that is the
stick, that is the riding crop to beat people over the head with in this Orwellian nightmare that
we are building. Now, the vibe is off because the Silicon Valley elite right now are having these
religious experiences that they're sharing on Twitter. Like what? So, like Sam Altman and Greg
Brockman and others feel the AGI and like, oh, they're just so full of themselves about,
we're going to solve everything, but they're solving one problem in a particular way. And yes,
historically speaking, it is they're correct that industrial revolutions tend to reshuffle
and democratize everything. Like, I would rather be alive today than 20 years ago than 100 years
ago. That is true and accurate, but at the same time, they are fundamentally not addressing
the fact of those homeless camps. Going through Oakland, when I did like, what was it, five,
six years ago, it looked like a wasteland. And I was just like, this is such a profound level
of abandonment. And then going through San Francisco, you know, all these various places,
I mean, there's places, you know, that look better that make Night City from cyberpunk
look actually pleasant. You know, it's like, this is where we're actually, we have to tone
it down because in reality, there's actually places way worse than in fiction. And so, yeah,
so there's that religious belief of this like Robotheism or this, you know, the Roco's Bath
List. And like, yes, we are going to, we are in the act of building what I think of is,
I call it a super organism, a digital super organism. Granted, the digital super organism
already exists. It's the internet. It's just going to get smarter. But what is this digital
super organism ultimately going to be capable of doing? And it's, you know, orders of magnitude
more than we can do today. At the same time, if you don't have a, if you don't have a narrative
that is pro life, and I don't mean that in like the religious, you know, abortion debate, but I mean
generative of all life that is, that is pro human or is biology.
Biology is the physical manifestation. Life is broader than that. Life is, I don't have a good
definition, but I think you maybe understand what I mean. It's more of the spiritual, the
embodied, the visceral experience of being alive. If you don't honor that at a broad
level, and I got that from Buddhism, I was studied Zen Buddhism for a few years. And so,
Zen Buddhism teaches you to honor like all life, starting with yourself and realizing that you
were part of all life. So that's, that's a big inspiration. Anyways, I kind of lost that train
of thought. I'm not sure where you want to go from there. No, I mean, yeah, well, you were talking
about the, yeah, like the Sam Altmans and Greg Brockman having these like, making these sort of
religious claims. Because I mean, that's the thing, they are becoming religious figureheads.
There's no other way, really, way to describe it. Like they are modern preachers.
Do a thought experiment with me real quick. Imagine Sam Altman as a high priest. High
priest Sam Altman, high priest Elon Musk, he's the pope. That is the religion that some of these
people have. That's why it feels weird. It feels like super icky when you think of it that way.
Because, and that's not to say, because I believe that these people have great intentions and some
of that they're very incredibly thoughtful people. If they had the right narrative,
and I'm not convinced that they don't have the right narrative, because what they say publicly
versus what they truly believe, it's difficult. You know, actions speak louder than words, I know.
But if they have the right narrative, if the vibe changes and they coordinate to this narrative,
it doesn't matter what they individually believe. Because ultimately, their behaviors, their choices,
as they play this broader, more infinite game, I think is what really matters.
Okay, so let's try and I want to make sure that we've really fully distilled down what
this narrative is sufficiently. You've talked about this need for living in alignment,
and also like these key axioms that we should probably be trying to align around. So curiosity
is one, you said, I think another one is this idea of like honoring the emergence,
honoring emergence as a thing almost, because that has been a like consistent theme of when
cool new stuff has emerged on planet Earth, it's because of this emergent that some of the
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. And it's like, it's almost like a fundamental,
like you can't predict it from prior. You don't know exactly what's going to come out until
it's like, oh, wow, this thing has now come along. Is there another axiom?
So yes, I'm glad you brought up emergence. So there's emergence and then convergence.
So emergence is a way of looking at the world that even just from the model of like physics,
fundamental particles and energy give rise to atoms and molecules that give rise to planets
and eventually us. And then we give rise to societies, constructs, super organisms and
narratives. So you have these like ontological strata is kind of what I call it. I don't know
if I came up with that term, but I borrowed it. And so emergence is definitely a critical
philosophical way of looking at things moving forward. Convergence is something that is also
really important. And so convergence is where you encircle the truth. Right now, it's very like
passe to say like, oh, well, how do you define that? Or nobody, truth is relative or whose
values do you align to? But the thing is, is while it can be difficult to say definitively,
this is the absolute truth here, or this is the absolute universal value, we are getting really
good at encircling these things. And this is where like me looking at it from my perspective
with post nihilism, you looking at it from Malik and Daniel looking at it from Metacrisis,
we are in the process of converging on what is the problem here. And not only clearly defining
the problem, also triangulating the solution. And so while there's still a gray area, there's still
a fog of war, we are converging. And so convergence is why I'm like, it feels like we got the right
we got the right units, we got the right, you know, army converging on it, we're going to encircle
this problem. And then it's going to be solved eventually. Now, time is still of the essence,
like there is still the possibility of failure. So I'm not, I'm a very sanguine person. I'm just
like, whatever, like we got this. But to be to be very like, I guess, Frank, like, yeah, there is
still the possibility of failure. One area you are focusing on on one of your channels is this
idea of mythic archetypes as a important building block of coming up with new narratives. So I'd
love to dig into like, why, why these archetypes have persisted so much. And what do you think
their value is in modern times? Because again, I imagine my hope with this, this conversation and
this wider podcast is, you know, I would love people to like be spreading specifically the
win-win hashtag. And that as a meme. But at the same time, the more win-win thing is if people
come up with an even more compelling narrative, like, like, you know, you through my work, you've
like started, you know, you said that was partly what inspired you to go into personalism. And
how can people draw upon mythic archetypes to better construct their own narratives?
Well, they can take a page out of your book because Malik is a quintessential mythic archetype.
All the old myths from ancient Greece, Rome, the Bible, all of those are mythic archetypes.
And what they are is their personifications or symbolic representations of things that we observe
and feel. Like I said, we didn't create them. We don't invent them. We just put a name to it.
And so I want to see if I can like break your brain for a minute. Thanos is Malik.
Yes. I mean, he's, he's pretty ineffective, actually, because I know this whole like, I'm
going to kill 50% of the living, you know, cull 50% of the population is like bro,
do you understand how exponentials work? Like in two generations, it's going to be back there
again. So this makes no sense. But yes, he's like trying to be a curtailer of complexity.
Right. So, but, but beyond that, he said, he says it repeatedly, I am inevitable.
So the idea that, right, right, that is, that is the connection between Malik and Thanos is
the inevitable destruction. And that, what he does and why, like that's, that's immaterial,
the fact that he is unstoppable. So an inexorable force, inevitable destruction. That is,
so Thanos, we have, we now have a global model for Malik and everyone has seen it as a big,
giant purple dude, right? With, you know, a fancy glove, because you have to,
you have to put these things into symbols. And so like the gloves, you know, the,
the different energies of reality. And so you could say like the mind stone is like human
fallibility. And there's, there's all kinds of ways you can read into it. Good, good archetypes
can be read many different ways. I see the reason that, that Thanos resonated and that,
that the, you know, MCU became one of the biggest things, not just because Disney did it,
but because Kevin Feige studied the same stuff I did. He's a, he's the showrunner for, for MCU.
Now obviously Disney has taken over and it's, you know, but when he was still at the helm,
he was studying the same things, Joseph Campbell, mythic archetypes, probably listening to the
same podcast that I was listening to where I got all these ideas. And so now we have a global
narrative to know like, okay, Thanos could represent everything from climate change to AI to Malik,
because that, that is the, that is the definition of that supernatural threat.
So the, the, that, that archetype, which there's many names you could put to it, but that archetype
is the unstoppable supernatural force. And there's actually, so there's the moment. So do you remember
when at the end of infinity war, when Tony Stark is trying to stab him with his, with his suit and
Thanos grabs the, grabs the blade, breaks it and stabs him with it. That is like word for word
from the mythic archetype. It's called the sword breaks. And so Tony Stark is the king archetype
in that story. And so he is the most powerful human we have. He is our avatar of salvation.
And he try, he throws everything that he has at Thanos. And it's like, all that for a drop
of blood, right? And then he tries to stab him, the sword breaks, and it is reversed on him. So
that is the most, most mythic thing that I have seen in cinema. And everyone's like,
it's just a popcorn movie. I'm like, Oh my God, you guys are missing it. And so the idea,
so like that moment, for instance, is like, why people like you and others are still afraid of
Molek is because that sword hasn't broken yet, because we haven't, we still haven't thrown
everything that we have at these problems and we see it coming. Yeah. I mean, I've always thought
about, it's like, if Molek is representing unhealthy competition, how do you defeat something
that would require defeat? You know, like, we don't want to be defeating. Like, we want to
break out of this need to defeat all the time. How do you defeat the enemy without becoming
the enemy yourself? But I think actually, it's unnecessarily like puritanical view of it. Like,
I think the archetype of win-win would be like, win-win is so powerful, it's not like,
it's not the inverse of Molek and my like little universe of mythic characters. It's
something on a higher dimensional plane. It's so powerful. And like, it's able to use collaboration
when it wants competition, coordination, all of the different, you know, methods of relating.
And it will see, like when some, when like a competition starts getting too big and starts
becoming like having so many negative externalities and turning Malochian basically, win-win will
see it and go, okay, that's enough. And then it will just slap it down. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, let's go and coordinate a little bit. But it's so like, wise and also fun loving that it
will even allow little pockets of occasional lose-lose stuff just to go on.
Let's see what you do with this. Yeah, exactly. Because it's also curious and it wants to have
like, it's like, well, this is a more interesting world if we have a little bit of Molek here and
there. So that's why I think it, initially, when I was thinking about this, I was like,
oh, yeah, no, it has to completely defeat Molek and then we'll never see it again. It's like,
nah, it can allow it now and then. It's just, it's so wise and it's so aligned with its higher virtue
of having a rich, complex, diverse universe full of all kinds of stuff. Like, kind of like the
culture series, you know, where it's just like, everything is so big and they've solved abundance.
It's like, well, yeah, as long as people follow these basic rules, it's like, you guys want to
live on a crazy planet where you eat each other's babies. I mean, I guess. And just, just only do
it there, please, you know. Keep it to yourself. Exactly. Just keep it yourself. But like, you
know, like maybe, but would like to show you better options. Like, look, like, you know,
to like my key axioms I always love and try and stick to is, so the infinite game, trying to like
keep the purpose of the real purpose of the best game is the game where you try and keep the game
going. And then the second one is Forest Landry's quote, if you're familiar with his work.
He wrote Eminent Metaphysics, which is very hard book to read, but he's written some other
stuff as well. And one of his quotes is, love is that which enables choice. And I think it's
so beautiful because it's like, what is a loving act? It is something where you enable others to
make more of their own better choices. So education, empowerment, et cetera.
I love that.
So like morphing those two together, that's, that's win-win for me.
That's perfect. So the thing that resonated most is when I got with my now wife, we were both in
bad shape and, you know, bad relationships, the pandemic, and we're just like, okay,
we need to take care of ourselves. And I told her when I was reading these relationship books,
like this mantra came into my mind. I said, I want you to be happy, healthy and whole.
And that became my single biggest relationship, like goal, like everything that I do is in
service to that. And then I was like, how do I appoint that at myself? And that is radical
alignment. And radical alignment is wanting that for yourself and wanting that for the other and
everyone else. Because again, like you said, if you switch from the zero sum from the, from the,
you know, I got mine, you have to lose. If you switch from that and you say, what if we find,
like, what if we want? Because it has to start, it has to start from the heart, like where you
want that for people. Where if you want that for everyone, and that's, that's the full ethos of
my channel is like, how do we find a solution that helps everyone be happy, healthy and whole?
Yeah. And exactly. So it's finding the win-win. And the other thing as well, because it like a
lot of, most people are stuck in sort of the win-lose, where it's like focusing on like doing
them, building themselves up. And sorry, it has to come at the cost of others. Or if they see someone
else doing well, then they are like, oh, this is costing me. But others actually flip it the other
way around. They lose win where they're like, oh, they're so overly focused on being like a giver
that they'll do it at the cost of themselves. And they think that, okay, I have to sacrifice
myself. And like, that is not, that is not optimal either. It's like the real, the best outcomes
are the ones where you benefit and others benefit. And they don't have to be these mutually exclusive
things. I can recommend a whole bunch of books on that. So William Urie, the power of a positive
no, he talks about that exactly. How do you establish a generative boundary? And so it's like,
you say yes to yourself. So it's a simple model. Yes, no, yes. You say yes to yourself. You say no
to an unreasonable demand. And then you say yes to a better solution. Love that. Yeah. Absolutely.
Like best, it's ostensibly a business book, but it applies to all relationships. It applies to
friends, business partners, lovers, what, children, even children, like parent-child
relationships, it applies to everything. Have you got an example where you've applied that?
Gosh, all the time. Like, let me see. It's weird because it's become so like automatic that I
don't think about it anymore. But like, actually, no, like when we're like negotiating like when
to come in and I thought about it when I was like, Hey, I'm really burned out. Can we switch to
remote instead? So I was like, I can't, I can't travel. I was not well enough to travel. So I had
to say yes to myself, no to something. And it wasn't, it wasn't an unreasonable demand that you
put on me. It was just an unreasonable thing that was the circumstance. Yeah. And so then I said,
what if we find something else? And then you countered. So this was the negotiation. You
countered. You say, well, we've got this other event coming up. Why don't we just do it then?
And I'm like, great. And this actually turned out to be better because imagine if I came a
month ago and I would have missed this great event. So this is actually a better solution.
So that is a perfect example of the yes and no yes model.
Complete tangent. And you don't have to answer this, but I'm curious. Do you want kids?
Oh my God, yes. I love children, but I have chronic fatigue.
Right.
So I would not be an adequate parent right now.
So with, how does chronic fatigue manifest? Because it's something I've heard a lot and I
don't fully understand it. And how are you trying to use your model of bodily alignment to fix it?
And have you seen any benefits from it?
Yeah. I finally, I think I'm cracking the code. So first is, I don't think that, well, one,
neurodiversity. So I was unmasking the fact that I'm like ADHD and HSP and a bunch of other things.
So I was living out of alignment with my actual like neurology, where I was pretending to be
something that I wasn't. So I started unmasking about two, two and a half years ago. And so living
in alignment to that saying, okay, these are my sensory needs. These are my social needs.
Let me just figure out how I need to live. Like, is it okay to eat? Like, I love pad thai. I eat it
like five times a week because it feels good. And it's just like, it doesn't hurt me as an HSP.
Like there's a lot of foods that hurt me.
What is HSP?
A highly sensitive person. So basically the gain is turned up to like 12. So everything is too
intense for me. So like, you know, before, before going out and being social, I have to like sing
my heart out in the car to like get my nervous system ready. So like just belting out everything
in the car on the way to social events, that sort of thing. A lot of people like me actually
end up banking on alcohol because it turns the game down. And that's what I did when I was in
my twenties, I would get to the bar and immediately start drinking. That was the only way that I
could socialize. And I'm like, this is not sustainable. Now I'm almost 40. And it's like,
there's a cost to that. But yeah, so that's, that's one example of how, of, of, of like that
alignment. Now more recently, so chronic fatigue, I don't know that I qualify as like,
like CFS because that's like, that's like my, that's a myalgia. It's like a brain inflammation.
But I do have to titrate my effort, like every day. And so that means, you know,
prioritizing rest a little bit more, all sorts of things to just make sure that I've got the
spoons. I don't know if you're familiar with spoon theory.
Nice.
Yeah. So I think that comes from, from multiple sclerosis patients. So they,
they came up with this model years and years ago, like on AOL message boards days. And so the idea
was to, to understand how much energy you have every day, imagine that you start the day with
like eight spoons. And everything that you do takes a spoon. And so whether it is make yourself
breakfast, that's a spoon. Whether it's go to work, that's six spoons. And so then like,
if you have eight spoons in the day, and you've already spent seven of them, you have one left
at the end of the day, how are you going to allocate that spoon? One of the things about MS
is if you overexert yourself, you get what's called an exacerbation, which means you permanently
lose a spoon. So you actually permanently lose ability to perform. So it's actually a medical
requirement to titrate your effort. So like my stepmom had has just still here, fibromyalgia
and lupus. And so this is a implement chronic inflammation disease. And so very similar thing
overexertion results in these exacerbations that depending on how well you take care of yourself,
they can get better over time. For me, it's just typical burnout. It's just, you know,
I worked too hard, not enough sleep, too much stress, too much anxiety, anger, you know,
from being mistreated, those sorts of things. So for me, I'm hopeful that I can get back to a
point. And so to your question, like what is working, I actually kind of discovered this
recently, which is the thing that I'm trying to optimize for is heart rate variability.
So heart rate variability is like, oh, hey, I started prioritizing that and my life has gotten
so much better. And so heart rate variability is the is the amount of variance between heartbeats.
Right. And it's a signifier of your ability to switch between parasympathetic and sympathetic,
right? Partly. It's actually the the shorthand is that it's a really good metric for stress,
for all stress. So it's the physiological stress that your body is under that includes emotional
stress. So physical, emotional, psychological, environmental, whatever, if your immune system,
like if you if you have like a bad cold or flu, like your heart rate variability go down,
if you're stressed out at work, it'll go down, if you drink, it'll go down. But for me, when I go
to sleep earlier, it goes up. When I spend more time in nature, it goes up. And you know, when I
eat right, it goes up. And so by by organizing my whole life around that one metric, I'm actually
getting energy back and getting it back fast. That's why I actually wear my fitbit all the time.
Okay, how can post-nitism help heal the culture wars?
We need to accept aspects of human nature. So this is kind of parallel to post-nitism. This is
part of part of my work in research is that is we naturally form epistemic tribes. So
Democrat, Republican, pro-life, pro-Palestine, these are all epistemic tribes. So an epistemic
tribe is a group of people that have a shared narrative about truth. That's all it is. And
so, you know, you might believe that the patriots are the best, that is your truth.
And humans naturally do this, like you form an epistemic tribe with people that you see every
day. So like you've got your people at work, you've got an epistemic tribe with your family,
you've got an epistemic tribe with bigger narratives, like, are you an American? Are
you a white guy? Are you a marine, right? All of these different epistemic tribes have
different narratives around truth and values and meaning and that sort of stuff. And right now,
when we pathologize, oh, it's all identity politics. This is what's wrong with,
that's natural. We've always had identity politics from Pericles getting, you know,
blamed for problems in ancient Athens to, you know, what was his name, the Russian dude who was like
thrown in the river. That's it. Yeah. So like, if you run a fowl of one epistemic tribe or another,
you get ostracized or executed. This is a permanent feature of humanity. So just like Malik,
competition, status games, all of these are permanent features of humanity, epistemic
tribes, permanent feature of humanity. We cannot get away from that. So rather than pathologizing
it, because as Young said, that which resists, that's what, yeah, if you resist it, you persist.
But then also, as you noted earlier, if you try and suppress something, it comes out in another
way. And sometimes it comes out in a destructive way. And so we need to welcome, we need to integrate
all of these aspects of ourselves. So this comes directly from Jungian theory, which is,
okay, we have this wounded part of self where we don't like competition or we don't like status
games or we don't, you know, and it's different for everyone. I'm not saying that the whole,
you know, everyone has the same kind of dysfunction. But as a society,
right now we have like identity politics is kind of one of the big ones out there.
By recognizing that this is a natural and healthy feature of humanity, that you, the people you
trust, the people that you find value with, that is healthy. Now, just as you found with competition,
it is a double-edged sword. Because without your competitiveness, we would not be here right now.
You wouldn't have 100,000 YouTube subscribers. Why? Because you want to win, right? And there's
nothing wrong with that. But by de-pathologizing it, by saying this is actually natural, healthy,
and good, I don't have to be ashamed of this. There's nothing to be guilty about. We welcome
all of these aspects of humanity back and we become a whole species again.
I mean, I think the reason why the culture wars have gotten so bad, though, is in part because,
yes, the nihilism crisis and so on, but the technology is directly amplifying it. The
current technological systems that we have, like our economic model is the media mollock,
as I call it, is rewarding, directly financially rewards those who trigger the limbic systems
and stir up tribalism, gets people angry, that taps into this and amplifies it beyond what it
should normally be. I don't see how we fix this without a rapid and vast redesign of the techno
incentive system that we currently have going on on the internet.
Yeah. So two things. One is not the first time this has happened. Again, it all starts with the
printing press. So printing press shattered the hegemony of the church. And from then until
Jordan Peterson today, religion is dying and kids these days, right? So we've had this
disintegration that goes back to the origin of the nihilistic crisis. So not the first time
society has felt like it's coming unraveled. Ray Dalio says it comes in waves based on debt
cycles. The fourth turning says it comes in waves based on intergenerational patterns.
So you and I, we are the lucky millennials. We are this century's greatest generation.
We're the hero archetype, which is why we are here, because the last time this was around,
these were the people that won World War II. So there was a global crisis. And of course,
this is just theory. So in the fourth turning theory, it is the millennial generation is the,
is the, you know, we're the same as the G.I. Joe's that, you know, fought in World War II,
the Rosie, the Riveters that boosted the industrial capacity to fight the axis of evil.
So from that perspective, if you look at it from that lens, this is a natural repeating
cadence of humanity. And what we are doing, the narratives we are spreading,
it's, it's not unlike how the civil rights movement and the hippie movement of the 60s,
that was a deconstruction of certain things, racism and sexism. We're, we're working on
deconstructing and reconstructing something else right now. Now you and I, unfortunately,
probably will not, we'll live to see the results of our work, but we're not going to be the primary
benefactors. We're doing this for people younger than ourselves. And so Gen Z, you know, the young
people that are the most checked out, they're the equivalent of the silent generation. And the
silent generation is, you look at them very similar to Gen Z, they're just like, whatever,
this whole thing is completely like, we don't care anymore. So then their descendants, the ones
after them is going to be the equivalent of the boomers, the ones that come up in the next wave
of abundance in about 20 years. And so we've got five to 20 years more of pain, according to that
theory. And according to Ray Dalio, we've got about five to 10 more years of pain before things
start to just magically feel better. So it would be flippant of me to say, it'll work itself out,
but that's kind of how some of these models propose that it'll do. Like we keep doing what
we're doing, and it'll work itself out. Now, what I will say is you are correct that the,
that the internet has a mind of its own. It is an attention seeking entity. The internet
feels like an aggregate of some type. Yeah. So the way that I view it is the internet is the
planet's nervous system. That is, that is the super organisms nervous system. Right now it's
only got the intelligence of an amoeba. It's cancer and it just wants to grow. And so the
internet wants attention. It is optimized for passing data. So what does it want to do? It
wants to pass more data. So the internet invented Facebook and Netflix and everything else that
just passes data. So that's what it's for. It doesn't have a brain. So this is where I'm really
hopeful as part of the super organism metaphor is that AI is actually growing a brain.
Right. It's a neocortex or whatever. Exactly. Exactly. Maybe not even that much. It's just
like the, well, I guess it's got a limbic system already, you say, but it's very reptilian-y.
Yeah. Yeah. We're at the reptile phase and then we're going to, we're building the mammalian
phase where at least we can have a little bit more authority or agency or the internet can
have a collective willpower that actually represents something that is good. So one of my,
one of my friends, one of my Patreon supporters, he was on a recent podcast episode of mine,
he said, the way to, the way to solve alignment for ourselves is you use your smart brain to
trick your dumb brain into doing the right thing. And so what I'm hoping is that as the
internet gets smarter with more artificial intelligence, with more of these narratives,
the smart part of the internet will be like, Hey, actually, maybe we should just shut down
social media or fundamentally change. I don't know what the, what the change is going to be,
but we, maybe we should change something that just creates new affordances and new incentives.
And that'll actually be better. And so for me personally, like, and this is why I have a fair
amount of optimism that once people are shown a better way and the, and the affordances, the
systemic structural changes are made and some of the narratives change, it's just like, Oh,
wait, actually, if I do this instead, then I'll be happier. So like, here's an example of a really
simple structural change. I sent my phone to grayscale. So there's less color. So it's less
addictive. Like it's literally just tricking the physiology of my retina and, and occipital in my
brain to just say, Oh, this is boring. And now it's not interesting. People can do the same
thing. You, you switched to, if you want to quit vaping, like this is, this is how I quit vaping
because I did it briefly years ago. And I just switched to zero nicotine. And then it's no
longer chemically rewarding. So I had the habit and then my brain's like, let's just taste weird.
And then you set it down. So you deprogram yourself. So there's all these little tricks
that you can do to use your smart brain to, to reprogram your dumb brain, your, your addictive
brain or your animal brain. And I'm hoping that the internet can do the same thing. And so
to itself. Yeah. So the obstacle is the way. So AI is a problem because we agree. It can amplify
everything, destroy everything. But I think that if used correctly, that will also be the
structural change that can result in these better decisions. No, I mean, I completely
agree. And that's why I'm neither a doomer or a pure accelerationist. It's like,
I think we will do better if we build a steering wheel and also a gas pedal and also a brake.
That's usually the fastest way you get around a racetrack. The doomers say no, no more acceleration,
just pure brake, plus steering, I guess. And the, the accelerations are like,
get rid of the steering wheel and the brake and just like the race track will take us,
take you magically there. And I was like, no, that obviously doesn't make any sense.
And I think what is interesting is about this now compared to say a hundred years ago,
what, you know, our, our generations are repeating this cycle that happened sort of
around World War II or whatever, is that the variance might, what concerns me and what feels
different about this time around is that the variance is so high that if we do end up having
a World War, we do end up having this go, you know, AI go wrong or any of these other really
powerful technologies that we are now unlocking is that it will literally just break the playing
field. That's possible. And that's what really, really scares me. And I don't think, and I don't
think it's clear. Like if, if, if things were like somewhat capped to and contained to like a
specific continent or something like that, okay, it would be bad and be horrible, but
we're playing a game. Like as we talked earlier, like things are simultaneously getting
better and better in many aspects and then worse and worse than others. So there's the variance,
the amplitude, the tension, exactly the amplitude of the wave is getting more and more and more.
And that is likely to be a breaking point. Is there any like some self-correcting mechanism
that could be created or apply in, in creating this kind of third attractor state?
So I think that there are some natural ones. So there's, there's natural ones and then there's
ones that we can choose. And so I actually have this hypothesis. Are you familiar with like,
if it bleeds, it leads? Deeply. I was like the main thread of my, uh, media mollic film.
Right, right. So if it bleeds, it leads basically, I think it was 140 years ago was when the, the,
the, the, uh, term was coined. And if, if it, if it activates your limbic system,
it gets your attention and it's you, you perceive it. I think what is it four times more intensely
than good news or more depending on now in our evolutionary past, this was a good thing because
it's like, Oh, hey, your tense burning down. That's more important than whether or not you
have your steak is ready. Right. Or if there's a tiger, that's more important than, you know,
whether or not you're wanting to get in the mood with your, you know, your, uh, partner.
So we have this attention mechanism that, that pulls your attention towards the worst possible
thing. Now, as the blast radius of news has gotten bigger and faster, because to your point
about cadence and, and, and, uh, the, the cycles, right, the, the amplitude of the wave. So not
only is, is everything happening faster, the intensity is, is larger and the scope, the,
the scope is larger. So we are not evolved for this. So at the same time, and, and so going back
to like, um, Ukraine, so that's been the last few years, Israel, Palestine gets global attention
in a way that was not even possible during World War II, because it still took time.
It was more of a trickle feed of, of news. Now we get TikTok videos of frontline stuff,
and it's horrifying. And I actually think I'm looking forward to a freaking omics episode 30
years from now where maybe like our, our, our outrage at these things, bringing our attention
to it, to the protests on campuses actually was the way that solved it.
The horrors of war. This is the first time we're like actually seeing, you know,
people think that this war is worse than any, you know, any others. It's like, no,
this is more present. Yeah, exactly. The war is like, it is the first time it has been like
televised in 4k and like live stream, you know, or effectively live. You can watch people.
Yeah. You're watching innocents getting maimed. And I mean, it's also true of October 7th in many
ways. Like more, okay, September 11th, you've got the image of the planes going into the building,
but you didn't actually see the individuals getting like dying. Whereas you saw that with
October 7th, which made everyone crazy. And now we're seeing it with, with what's happening in
Palestine, which made people even crazier. And it's like, so you're arguing that like actually
this, even though it's horrible and it's making, it's creating this like, in many ways, spreading
the flames of the conflict around the world on you, you hope that in the long run, this is
still going to be a net positive because it makes us go, it makes us realize that actually war is the
enemy. Yeah. So as you, so to borrow from young again, and for you and for all the purists out
there, I'm American, it's young. So, so as young said, it creates psychic energy. So not psychic is
in like, you know, but like psych psychological energy. And until you discharge that psychic
energy, it stays there, you need to do something with it. And so that's why you see people setting
up pro and anti, you know, like anti Zionists and pro Palestine and like all everything in between.
That is because it is in our nature that that, that like our biology gives us energy. Like,
you know, when I was preparing to come for this trip, I could not sleep. I have had like probably
10 hours of sleep in the last five days. No, it's a little bit more than that. But it's because my,
because it was so important, my brain is like, you need energy to figure everything out. And so
likewise, you see Ukraine, you see Russia, whichever side you're on, the fact that there's
engagement and that conversation is happening. And like this is again, this is why I want people
to learn more about epistemic tribes is because whether you're pro or anti Israel, pro or anti
Palestine, the fact that people have the energy to engage in the conversation, there is no apathy.
Apathy is the enemy. Because apathy is nihilism. Exactly. If you, if you don't care, or if you
enjoy it, destruction lust, if you say, let's make it worse, some people do want to make it
worse. Right. That's, that's the only thing I would say is that there's like, you know,
like the, the, the protests on, on campuses, those are started by people who truly care.
But then it feels like with all these, like every protest or every movement that goes beyond
a critical mass, you get the like, essentially the psychopaths or the, or like just the people
who are want them destructionists. I don't see how that's making the problem better. If anything
is making it worse. Well, so one humans have always been that way. There's always been different
levels of intellectual engagement or knowledge or whatever. There are the mavens, there are the,
the aggregators, the people who study it and then they disseminate ideas and create new,
new catchy, you know, catchy isms. I'm reading a book called made to stick, which is about how
do you make sticky ideas? How do you make something that resonates? So like click it or ticket,
you know, it rhymes and everyone, everyone knows that here in America. I don't know if you have
anything like that in England. Yeah. So buckle up, you know, yeah. So click it or ticket, you know,
just dare to say no to drugs, whatever, you know, like we have all these different programs.
What happens is, is narratives get distilled over time. And so it's like,
basically what I, the kind of the formula that I look for is X is good or bad. So therefore more
or less of X is better. So it's like, war is bad. Therefore, less war is, is better. Now,
yes, there are always going to be the rabble rousers and the lunatics who are just like,
yeah, just burn it down. Cause they're like adrenaline junkies and all they want is that
energy. And that's like, they actually serve a role. They serve a purpose. And I'm not going
to like argue that like they're always good. No, in aggregate, in the long run, these things
kind of get distilled down over time. And the, these memes kind of get embedded like loose
lip sync ships, right? We still remember that from World War two. So these, these things,
you can deliberately workshop them. A lot of them just get distilled. Like, you know,
what is it? The one that came out against Disney, like go woke, go broke,
exactly the same thing. Narratives get distilled. And so this is a, it becomes a rallying cry.
It becomes a principle of value that certain epistemic tribes can rally around. And I've,
so for some background, I observed this trend because I was on like debate forums for many
years, like starting back in like 2006. And so I saw the rise of like the like marriage equality
here in America. And I was like, where did the argument go? It's gone. I've seen the cycle.
And we're doing the same thing with trans rights right now. So it's like, all these things just
kind of come in cycles. And what you have is you in, in this discourse, this high velocity
discourse, and now it's even faster because you have TikTok, it's not debate forums that
requires typing and reading. It's just 30 second videos. So you have people deconstructing, like
so and so said this, and this is why they're wrong. And what the pattern that I noticed is that
people never concede defeat. They just abandon the battlefield. They just move on. They stop arguing.
And so by, by like the cessation of conflict, that's when this new idea gets embedded in the
zeitgeist. And so like defensive marriage act, I remember when that came down, it wasn't surprising
to me because I saw the public discourse for the years leading up to it. And I was just like,
all these conservatives and Republicans and anti gay people that I've been arguing with,
they just quit the ghost town because they, like they gave up, like they, they, they, they
seeded the battlefield. And we're going to see the same thing. And to be fair, some of these take a
lot longer to pan out because like we were, we went to the LBJ presidential library and there
was a political cartoon from 1967 of LBJ, like trying to defend Israel against Middle East.
And it's just like same exact thing that has been happening. So that has a lot of geopolitical
tension that takes more decades to pan out. But again, something will change eventually,
the narrative will get distilled and a lesson will be embedded in the zeitgeist. And then
everyone moves on. It's the weirdest phenomenon once you've lived through it. And I'm waiting for
that to happen with trans rights. So right now we're in the place where trans rights is getting
more like vociferous, it's getting more violent on both sides, you know, like trans rights matter
or trans lives matter, sorry, is, is an example. And like you actually see the, the like anti trans
bills materially cost lives. And so then eventually society will say enough is enough,
they'll draw a line in the sand. We saw the same thing with civil rights. We've seen the
same thing with women's rights. Eventually society comes to consensus. And it's not magical,
there's nothing magical about it. It's through newspaper, it's through conversations,
but it can take time. And it's not obvious because it doesn't happen. Like as we don't have a big
enough perspective to see it happen, except in hindsight. So what you're sort of saying is that
if you were to like model this physically, you're, you're describing like a metronome that is
through sort of friction is getting like, you know, it starts like insufficient rights here.
So one wheel swing to their more rights. And then like over time, it'll sort of settle in a calm state
on some issues. Okay. Because my intuition is that kind of almost like the opposite is
happening. Like, so I would argue it seems, seems to me now that like transphobia or like
anti-trans sentiment is actually higher now than it was 15 years ago when, before all this stuff
started, because even though like there might be like technically more protections for trans people
now than there were about then, because like society tried to like over index on it because
there's like, again, there's like this kind of energy of like, you know, it was born out of like,
okay, these people were like historically oppressed or like not taken seriously or not given
sufficient rights within society, we need to do something to fix it. But it became like, again,
this like bandwagon effect of like mindless, like corporate, you know, every corporate,
every single big company does the like, had the trans flag or, you know, out for a day and so on.
And this was like, it's like capitalism latched onto it for profits, essentially, which made it
become became like a new doctrine. And when it became a doctrine, then you couldn't question it.
And that's when then the energy, the counter movement comes up. Whereas I, well, wait, but
what about women's sports and so on? Like, where there are like genuine overcorrect, at least to
me, it seems like there are overcorrections going on. So I don't know, like, I'm not sure I would
like that to be true, that it's like, okay, yes, over time, we're going to move on and it'll settle
down. But it feels again, like the variance is actually increasing, the amplitude is getting
more and more and more. Yeah, because we're not at the end of the cycle. So you have,
it's like a tremor. It's like a bigger, it's like a bigger cycle going on. And so like, here's,
here's an example. And I'll credit my wife for always pushing back on this, because she'll point
out that history is not linear. There are setbacks. So right now, the overturning of Roe versus Wade,
the a century of women's rights, finally, the traditionalist people, that epistemic tribe
said enough is enough, we need to pull back some power and go back to patriarchy. Patriarchy is
a narrative. Feminism is a narrative. Again, everything comes down to narratives. And so,
patriarchy is right now trying to reassert itself against women's empowerment, at least here in
America. Other nations are going in different directions. Trans rights is a relatively recent
thing in terms of, when I say that, I mean, in terms of visibility. So when you have the visibility
increase, that creates like a magnifying effect. It's like, it's like you put a drop of sugar
water and all the ants show up. And so that's why we're seeing that trend. But 10, 15 years from
now, I would suspect that like, it's going to be, trans rights in particular is going to be in the
rearview mirror. Women's rights, gender rights, that is a, that is millennia in the making. And
so we might have centuries more debate around gender equality, racial equality, those sorts of
things, religious equality. Because again, you know, at the founding of America, what, 250 years
ago, you know, we said all men are created equal, but it was like only a certain kind of men.
Right.
Right. And, and, but, but we've been doubling down on that principle of democracy. So again,
narratives, equality before the law, we are currently testing that here in America. Do we
believe in equality before the law? It's not perfect. We haven't implemented it, but that
principle remains true. And so by doubling down on these really simple distilled principles,
equality before the law, you know, human rights, you know, natural, natural human rights,
these kinds of ideas, democracy, these, these, these narratives with their distilled, like,
kind of constitution of principles, we can coordinate around those. Now, it's messy. So
actually, this is, this is one of the, one of the quintessential hallmarks of a functioning
democracy is they are loud and they are messy. When there is no debate, that's bad. Because then
the state or church or someone does not even allow it. So the fact that we have debates,
the fact that we have, you know, riots at universities, that is an unfortunate, that's
the, you know, it's the give and take. That's a double edge, sort of a functioning democracy is,
okay, let's,
It's going to be some chaos now.
Right. Like, you know, round three fight, like get in the octagon and hash it out. You know,
it's like, it's like a parent kind of letting their children fight amongst themselves until
they work it out, not necessarily the best, but it's a natural process.
So is there anything that you are a full on maximalist on? Because it sounds like
you are largely a moderate, again, you're someone like everything in moderation,
including moderation, right? I do please subscribe to that.
That said, is there anything we should just be fully maxing out on?
I don't think so. I'm trying, I'm checking in with myself like as a gut check, no.
I learned a lot from Chinese philosophy, which is like,
it's better to underreact than overreact. That's one of the core principles of Taoism
is just like you variance reducing.
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Because yeah, if you, if you over correct, so there's,
actually, my dad was a pilot. So there's what's called a pilot induced oscillation.
And do you know what this is from physics?
It's probably like you, your plane's going that way. So you do this and now it's like,
oh shit, more and so on.
Yeah, yeah. So depending on the way that a plane is designed, it will, if it's a top wing,
then, or if it's the wings kind of go up, then it'll naturally kind of settle into a stable
configuration with gravity down. Now, jet fighters are intrinsically unstable.
They're designed to be unstable so they can change orientation very quickly.
Now there's a delay in the, so there's, there's several, there's several delay factors.
So there's the pilot's reaction, there's the plane's physical reaction, and then there's the
actual like orientation in space. So you got three different reaction times.
And so if, you know, pilot, you know, tries to correct because you get a wobble or a shimmy or
something, there's actually cases in the 60s or 70s, kind of when NASA was doing some of the more
cutting edge test flights of like the pilot induced oscillation getting so bad that like the
pilot like actually got a concussion from the side of the canopy.
And so they're like, okay, we need to put a control mechanism to reduce these oscillations.
And I think that to bring that analogy around, I think that will probably come up with some
technological like AI based solutions to help reduce the oscillation intensity on the internet.
But maybe not. But even so, I think that, I think that there are some self-correcting
mechanisms in human biology. Plus people get tired of it.
Is there any call to action or message you'd like to leave the win-win audience with?
Your own audience, which is like, I'm hoping we're going to like.
So thought experiment, I did this in one of my videos. Imagine that a super powerful benevolent
alien race comes and says, you guys suck at taking care of yourself. We're going to take
care of you now. Think about everything that that super powerful benevolent alien race would do,
and then do it for yourself. That's radical alignment.
So there we go. Huge thank you to David for coming out to Austin to film this.
And thank you to you all for tuning in. Do go check out his channel. I highly recommend a binge.
He's got like six different YouTube channels now. His main one, which focuses on AI and I think
also like Moloch and systems design, but then he also has a specific systems designing one,
one on mythopoetic archetypes, so many different channels. They're all links below.
I've also linked some of my favorite and most informative videos that I sort of binged. It's
it's just truly delightful to meet someone who has both been inspired by myself, but also has
inspired me so much. So yeah, it was a it was a fun meeting and melding of minds. I hope something
useful came out of it for you all as well. So on that note, if you enjoyed this, go give him a
subscribe. If you're one of David's subscribers watching this, come join me win win. Yeah, I'll
see you next time.
