I'm not perfect, but I'm a little inhibition Breaking down walls with every vision
I'm flawed, but that's my ammunition I rise again, no competition
I've been through the storm, I've danced in the rain Fought with the demons, embraced all the pain
They try to box me in, but I break the frame No script for my life, I rewrite the game
I'm rough around the edges, scarred but alive I miss fit on fire, I always survive
I'm a rebel with the cause, heart full of grit If you look me in the eyes, you see I don't quit
I'm not perfect, but I'm a little inhibition Breaking down walls with every vision
I'm flawed, but that's my ammunition I rise again, no competition
I walk to my own beat, I never cavorn Flipping the script, I create the storm
You can try to decode me, I'm a mystery My flaws and my power, I make history
I'm not here for perfection, I'm here for the ride Turning chaos into my pride
Made from the struggle, born from the fight I shine in the dark, I thrive in the night
I'm real, I'm raw, I own my mistakes Every crack in my armor, every heart that aches
I stand tall, even when I fall Limitless spirit, hear my call
I'm not perfect, but I'm a little inhibition Breaking down walls with every vision
I'm flawed, but that's my ammunition I rise again, no competition
I'm the limited edition, one of a kind Imperfectly crafted
With a free mind, no need for perfection No need for praise
In my own way, I set the world ablaze
