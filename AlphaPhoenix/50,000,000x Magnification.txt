All right, so hey there everybody. I am back in the Microscopy Suite in the
materials department at UCSB and I'm going to show you some atoms. So this
huge like car-sized box and these four monitors, the huge cylinder behind those
four monitors and some more equipment that's behind that back wall, together
constitute an instrument called a scanning transmission electron microscope or
stem. And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works. So my last
Microscopy video was making a play button, which was kind of a joke, but
today I'm going to be doing some real research. I'm going to be looking for a
specific defect in a crystalline material called tin selenide. And I'm not
sure that I'm going to be able to find it, but either way I'll learn something. So
this is going to be like real research happening right before your eyes on
YouTube today.
Now in order to actually blast electrons all the way through a sample of
material in order to image its atoms, that sample needs to be really really
really thin. Imagine you know shining a piece of light through a piece of light
trying to shine a light through a piece of paper. You can see some light through
a piece of paper, but now imagine trying to shine a light through a piece of
plywood. It's just not going to work. So they're both the same thing. They're both
cellulose, but one is a lot thicker and a lot denser. So when you're trying to
make a transmission sample that you can shoot electrons all the way through, it
needs to more resemble a sheet of paper, except a bunch of orders of magnitude
thinner. I didn't actually film the sample preparation, but if you remember
the focused ion beam from one of my previous videos, that's the machine that
you use to create these unreasonably impossibly thin samples. For reference,
the sample I'm about to look at here is mounted on this tiny flake of copper, but
to see it, we're going to have to zoom in. On this flake of copper, there is
actually a crescent shape, and in the crescent shape there are a few metal
posts. If you zoom in on one of those posts, you can see a bump on the side.
That's my sample. Looking even closer, hopefully you can appreciate how this
entire sample is a vanishingly thin flag of material. It's about six
micrometers tall, 14 micrometers long, and between 50 and 100 nanometers thin at
the spot where I'll be imaging. Somewhere in the range of about 150 atoms thick,
and this is what we'll be shooting electrons through to cast our shadows.
Even though this copper crescent is like vaguely 100,000 times larger than the
dimension we care about on the sample it's holding, it's still small enough
that it's a pain to work with. So to help, we've got these fancy vacuum tweezers.
Basically a tiny hose that sucks up the sample like a piece of cardboard stuck
to a shop vac. This is more than a little finicky, and while trying to bend around
to give the camera a good view, I actually dropped it the first time.
Ah, crud. Something like this could only happen when I tried to film it.
Thankfully the sample itself was all right. It's also worth appreciating that
even this tiny sample stage is itself a miniature engineering marvel. It's
designed to tilt the sample in two directions without translating it in
X, Y, or Z by more than a couple microns. It's absurdly precise. This is actually
some microscope footage from a time that the holder actually broke. I swear I was
not pushing on the clip any harder than I should have been. But you can see that
the hinge here that broke isn't a normal ball bearing or something like that.
It's actually a ruby, like literally a polished gemstone that runs in a groove.
So now that the sample is mounted inside of this chuck, if you'll follow me
around the corner, in here we have the actual microscope. Like all electron
microscopes, the stem here is basically just a big multi-compartment vacuum
chamber, which means that this thing, when I load it into the chamber, needs to be
able to stop all of the air from rushing in behind it. When I put this in, it's
actually going to create a seal at this O-ring, and then I'm going to have to
wait for a few minutes while it pumps out the airlock before I can push it all
the way into the microscope.
There we go. That was the pump start. And don't worry, if I made trying to load that
sample look awfully tedious, just wait till I get to the part where I focus the
microscope for an hour. Just like that. Air pressure pushes it right on in. I don't
even have to do anything. A transmission electron microscope is basically casting
shadows with a beam of electrons. You're shooting a high-energy beam of
electrons all the way through a material, and you're projecting whatever gets
through out onto a screen and looking at that image. Now because it is so much
easier to visualize this when you don't use electrons, I'm going to be doing a
demonstration with photons. If I have a point source of light, like this flashlight
with a piece of poster board with a pinhole in it, any shape that I put in
front of the light casts a shadow on this screen. And critically, the shadow is
actually magnified based on the relative distances between the source, object, and
screen. Huge wrench. Small wrench. Big wrench. Small wrench. I need to get out more.
But if you notice, the edges of this shadow are a little bit fuzzy. If we try to
look at something really tiny, let's say these ball bearings are like atoms being
imaged in a microscope, this method doesn't really let us see anything. One of
the multiple problems here is that the pinhole isn't actually a very good point
source. It's almost the same size as the features that we're trying to image. So
light from one edge of the pinhole and light from the other edge of the pinhole
actually cast very slightly different overlapping shadows. And in order to
accurately image the atoms then, all our electrons would need to originate from a
point in space that's smaller than an atom. And we can't do that. If we're
slightly more clever, we can use lenses to project a sharp image, even with a
less than perfect source of light. Here I've set a lens so that as light exits
this pinhole, it's actually made into a nearly parallel beam. That parallel beam
passes through the ball bearings and a shadow is created. And then we can take
that beam and if everything is lined up just right, blow it up to project a
larger shadow on the screen. Once we send it through here, it gets smaller, comes
down to a point and then blows up and expands out here. So we have a magnified
image on the screen. Remarkably sharp. Much, much better than I thought I'd get
with this. Those are our atoms. Just imagine that instead of a flashlight with
a pinhole, we have an electron gun powered by a huge high voltage power
supply. And instead of glass lenses, we have really big electromagnets that
bend that beam of electrons as it's passing through the microscope. Now
compared to our flashlight model, the electron gun is at the top of this
system and it's focused by a series of magnetic lenses capable of bending the
electron beam onto the sample and then through the sample and then through more
lenses that expand that image into a camera. Now when we turn this whole
shebang on, we literally just get a shadow image of the copper crescent. Pretty
cool, right? Yeah, so here you can really see that the place where there is
nothing like this, you know, you can just see bright because that's where the
electrons are hitting uninhibited. This thing is the big chunk of copper that
the electrons can't get through so it looks black and this is the sample which
is so thin that it's electron transparent and it actually sort of looks
gray because it'll let some electrons through, which is kind of the point. You
can see huge bits of strain and bending in the sample as it's sort of warping
around. It's really interesting. Right now what we need to do is basically get
the beam pointed at the sample and get the sample pointed at the beam. Getting
the beam pointed at the sample sounds pretty straightforward, but getting the
sample pointed at the beam, that's a weirder phrase. You need to remember that
we're dealing with a crystal, this perfect 3d grid of atoms in space. Now
earlier I used the ball bearings to emulate a single layer of atoms, but
what if I had two layers or three layers or ten layers? It gets a lot harder to
tilt the sample so you can look straight down a column of atoms. This is
another reason that we like to keep the samples really super thin. The sample
looks a lot different now because we're actually focused on it, which is, you
know, the first step. The next step is to get the sample tilted so that it's
actually pointed at us. The sample need not load in perfectly flat with respect
to the beam. The good news is that we can use the electrons passing through the
sample and making diffraction patterns to actually help us line this up. So you've
got this awesome starburst pattern called a Kokuchi pattern and basically just
want to line this up so that we're looking at the center of this starburst
which is called the zone axis. Make it look real starburst-y and not really. The
sample might be a little little thin for that. So I hope that explanation made
sense because I'm about to rip the rug out from underneath it. While it's
possible to image atomic scale features using this very technique where
you're basically casting shadows of atoms, all of these extra fringes and
patterns sometimes make it difficult to interpret what you're looking at, which
is why at some point somebody added one extra letter. High resolution
transmission electron microscopy becoming high resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy. Linguistically, almost the same. Physically,
mechanistically, completely different things. So as soon as I push this button
right here marked STEM, the microscope is going to switch modes and all of my
explanations so far and a lot of this talk of projected shadows is going to
have to change.
Alright, so now we've switched modes. Where TEM was pretty well represented by a
flashlight and some lenses to create big parallel beams, STEM or S TEM is
probably best represented by a laser mounted on a gimbal. And that is to
say, it's a lot more fun. So what does it mean to scan an image? Basically,
instead of taking the whole image at once, you're rastering the beam back and
forth, taking the image one pixel at a time. And in order to do that, the
electron beam isn't a parallel beam that covers the entire sample, illuminating
it at once. You actually focus the beam down to a point that is smaller than an
atom. So that's basically what's happening here, where the gimbal is
guiding this laser back and forth, rastering across our field of ping-pong
ball atoms. Sometimes the laser hits an atom and causes light to scatter in all
directions and sometimes the laser doesn't hit an atom, goes straight through
and runs into the back plate. So now I'm playing part of the microscope sensor. I
know where the gimbal is pointed at all times and I can tell whether or not the
beam is going through because I can look for the green dot on the piece of
cardboard. But I can't actually see the sample. In reality, this is because the
sample is microscopic and therefore basically invisible. But this is the
exact procedure that the computer does when it's rastering the beam over the
sample, trying to find atoms. You can tell that I'm making a couple mistakes in
counting here. Apparently my counting in my head is a little bit faster than the
gimbal actually does because I keep not having enough room at the end of my
rows. But as I fill this grid in, we can start to see the shape of the 16 ping-pong
balls that are forming our atoms. In a real microscope, what I'm doing here would
be known as a bright field image. I've just inverted it. So after minutes of
filling in grid spots, I now have my picture of atoms with some scattered
effects because I can't actually count. And if you imagine this happening really
fast where the computer guides a tiny beam of electrons across a sample line
by line over and over again, you can imagine that images can get formed
pretty quickly. In fact, that's what these scan lines are when you're, you know,
watching any image on the screen. It's going over and over and over again,
continuously refreshing the image one line at a time. It's actually scanning the
electron beam back and forth line by line to rebuild the picture. The real trick
now is that the beam needs to be focused to a small point as possible. If the beam
can illuminate multiple atoms at once, then you just get a blurred out signal
because you're always hitting something with the beam and always letting some of
the beam through. If I were to replace this laser with the flashlight from
before, you can see that no matter where the flashlight points, there's always
some light getting to the detector at the back, which means that it can't really
tell where the atoms are. The flashlight light is just too wide, which is why when
setting up a stem measurement, I take quite a long time here running through
all of these different modes, sort of oscillating the focus of the beam and
playing all sorts of tricks in order to get it focused down to a tight as spot
as possible. The smaller that that beam gets, the better the resolution of the
images that I'll be able to form. And there we go. Now when we focus, we have a
nice even beam. It gets really small, still a little bit of stig. See? And go
over here to stem. Now we're scanning. It's exciting. Got to zoom out a little bit,
and hopefully we will see the sample. There we go. Spin the scan around a little
bit and get it flat. So while on location, Brian struggles to focus and zoom in, let
me tell you what this sample actually is. If you've watched my previous video
about evaporating metals and making molecular beams, you may remember that
our lab specializes in depositing extraordinarily thin layers of crystals,
crystalline materials in this big vacuum chamber. That means that we end up with
these multi-layer sandwich kind of structures. If you slice a cross-section
out of one of these stacks, then you get to see all of the layers and find out if
your process worked. In this case, we started with a wafer of a semiconductor
called gallium arsenide. Deposited an extremely thin layer of lead selenide
and then a reasonably thick layer of tin selenide. These two layers on top are
actually the weird carbon and platinum slurry that I talked about in the FIB
video that basically just get welded to the top of the stack to protect it
while I get it ready for the microscope. So you can mostly ignore those. But this
substrate, the gallium arsenide, that's the place with the highest structural
quality because we didn't make it. But that means that it's the easiest place to
see atoms. So now, if we want to see atoms, all we got to do is zoom in and look
at that. Atoms. Not very focused atoms. I'm moving diff shift. Oh wait a minute, I
got a line. Shoot, I didn't reach help. Iterative. Lots of steps need to be done
more than once. It's getting bigger, getting smaller, getting smaller, getting bigger.
Turn it back. Man, this is a bendy film. Piece of junk. Who made this?
There we go, look at that. Atoms. These are gallium and arsenic atoms, to be
precise. If you're wondering how this grid of dots actually corresponds to the
gallium arsenide unit cell, like the crystalline pattern, we're actually
looking at it from a diagonal, like this. And then, if all the atoms were a little
bit blurry, there you go. So each of these fuzzy blobs is actually two adjacent
columns of atoms. One column of arsenics and one column of gallium. So if you're
not convinced by looking at all of these really fuzzy little blobs, here is a much
better picture. This is probably my favorite stem picture that I've ever
taken. And after a much longer exposure time, a lot of, you know, waiting for all
the drift to go away and stuff like that, and quite a bit of processing in Matlab
after the fact, you can very clearly see the double columns of atoms here. We call
them dumbbells of gallium arsenide. And in the top, you'll notice that the pattern
is actually different. It doesn't have the dumbbells. This is lead selenide, which
forms a completely different crystal structure. And what's happening in
between these two weird sort of fuzzy blobs that look like dislocations but
aren't really dislocations, I think is really interesting, but unfortunately it
is outside the scope of this YouTube video. So when I was filming this video, I
was actually looking at tin selenide, which is a different material. And tin
selenide has layers. So I passed through the gallium arsenide, the lead selenide,
and now the tin selenide. Let's try to find some some cool looking defects. Although
it appears we've lost our focus. This sample is not flat. Holy mackerel. Oh, I had it
for a second. Here we go. Check it out, atoms. In order to get a good picture of
this, what I actually need to do is take a bunch of images and then stack them. So
it's microscopy. Looking at the smallest of things has a surprising overlap with
astrophotography, where you're looking at the largest of things. So right now, I'm
taking a sequence. So it's going to take a whole bunch of pictures. And you can
notice that the whole frame is shifting a little bit each time. So that's the
drift that you need to correct for. The same way that stars in the sky move
slowly. And you need to correct for that. So tin selenide is this layered
structure. So you can see once we do a little bit of the correction here, this
is two layers of atoms that are glued together. And then below it is two layers
of atoms that are glued together. And then below it are two layers of atoms that
are glued together. So you get this sort of double layer structure going through
the whole material. I'm looking for a location where that layered thing gets
screwed up in a very particular way. And that's a layer. Yeah, this is not what
I'm looking for. It's cool. It's atoms, but it's not what I'm looking for.
We got a gap. We got a gap. We got a gap. We got a gap. We got a gap. We got a gap.
We got a gap. We got a gap. We got a gap. All the way across. Okay, no.
Possibly another hyper dislocation. I think those must be common, which
itself would be interesting. So the actual defect I'm looking for is basically
a hiccup in the layered structure of the material. Because each layer of tin
selenide is two atoms tall, and because of some weird stuff happening at the
interface, we expected that it was possible to get one region of the crystal
shifted with respect to the rest. And in particular, we thought this shift
might only be one atom tall, which would actually be half of a layer, meaning
that the top of one layer was bonded to the bottom of the next layer and so on,
creating this weird zipper structure at the boundary. Unfortunately, even if the
sample is chock full of these, getting one lined up in a place where I can
photograph it requires quite a bit of luck and quite a bit of tedium.
God, it's an ugly picture. That is absolutely what I'm looking for. Okay, unless the
tilt over here is so significant that it's making this not look like what it
should look like, which I guess is possible. I'm going to assume that I'm not
tilted right, and I'm going to pray that I can get back to this exact same spot
later. Okay, that big white dot. It's next to that big white dot.
Oh, oh, oh. Yes! I got one. Look at this. That's between two layers, and then it's
in the middle of a layer, and then unfortunately it's right next to another
defect, which actually splits it apart again. So this is like a, this is like a
two partial dislocations right here. It breaks it and then it fixes it. Oh, it's
so cool. Oh, this will be, this will be clean down here.
Neat.
Can't tell but I'm grinning. This was annoying. I think this is the first time
that I've ever gone out looking for a particular defect. Like, I want to see
this thing and wasn't sure that it existed. This was like three hours of
tedious focusing on a really old, this was like a more than a year old sample
that came out of the fib, and it's all like warped and stuff, which means it's
really difficult to focus on, and it kept losing focus continuously, but I did
it. Now I get to say in a paper that this defect exists in Tinceline, because I
have a picture of it. That is science.
