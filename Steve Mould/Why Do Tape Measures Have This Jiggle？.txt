Why can't tape-measure manufacturers get their act together
and make a tab that doesn't jiggle like this?
Just attach the thing securely for goodness' sake.
It's so annoying.
Well, that's what I used to think until I found out
that that jiggle is deliberate.
It enables you to take an accurate measurement
by pushing the tab against the surface
or by hooking the tab against the surface.
Because the tab itself has some thickness,
if it wasn't for the jiggle,
you would get a different measurement
in those two scenarios.
In fact, that travel of the tab exactly compensates
for the thickness of the tab.
How cool is that?
