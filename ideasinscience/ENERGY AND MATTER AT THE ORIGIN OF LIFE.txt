My� City Technology will touch on some of the same themes as Peter's.
I'm pleased to say from a similar point of view a lot of the time, not all the time.
Just to establish where we're at for the astrobiologists in the audience.
This is essentially what's going in us right now.
These are the mitochondria in our own cells.
What's going on as we respire is we're stripping electrons from food
and we're passing them down a chain of proteins,
a respiratory chain inside a membrane ultimately to oxygen.
Cywelio cymoedd carre, goneBC is powering the extrusion of protons across the membrane so this is a proton type membrane
And her is the ATP synthase that Peter was talking about.
It's the flow of protons through the ATP synthase which is driving ATP synthases
Now you can get ridatof food and have hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen and electron donor her
You can get ridatof reaction of nitrogen and nitric oxide or sulfate or something

This does not give any direct insights into the origin of life.
However, if the last universal common ancestor has had of the
that it points back beyond Lucra and it begs the question
was how did it arise in cells before Lucra?
This is a tree that is from Bill Martin about 1998.
waves at ynеннымaz beth yw'r dde種u hyn,
a there's two aspects of this I'd like to raise,
one of them is that eukarynitsis
are really arising in a hem 58
event a there was an archaeon host cell,
this is now looking increasingly likely,
we don't really know exactly which group,
but it's something to do with the loc objective perhaps,

which is not necessarily the common ancestor will be in these do dues so again this is
corresponding to
a what people were saying the common ancestor of the bacteria in the archaea

independence from events. You'll notice that the bottom on the way to say why got is
its to do it with the paradoxical traits
of the bacteria in the archaea.
So, we know they share a common ancestor.
There's no question about that.
The universal genetic code, the ribosomes,
most of the enzymes and genes, therefore,
involved in transcription and translation,
parts of intermediary metabolism,
like the Krebs cycle, for example,
and the requirement for chemiosmotic coupling
and the ATP synthase.
They all go back to this common ancestor,
so they're all present in Luca.
What's different, though, and this is not easy to interpret,
the cell membrane in bacteria and archaea
is fundamentally different.
It's very similar in its biophysical properties,
but it's fundamentally different in its chemistry
and a lot of the enzymes required to form it.
So, the cell wall, as well.
So, really, the entire barrier
between the inside of a cell and the external world
that's different in bacteria and archaea.
So, it begs the question,
well, what did their common ancestor actually have then?
Now, it almost certainly had a membrane of some sort.
We just can't constrain exactly what sort.
It must have had a membrane
because it had proteins,
membrane proteins, like the ATP synthase.
Even DNA replication
has quite a lot of divergence
between the bacteria and the archaea.
There's not a lot of homologous in those enzymes,
is my understanding.
Respiratory chains,
Rolfgang will say more about this.
It's very difficult to reconstruct
the origin of the respiratory chain
because of lateral gene transfer.
There are different pathways of heme and quinone synthesis,
which suggests it might have arisen independently.
This is just to give you a sense with the membrane.
So, this is the archaeal membranes here.
So, these are isoprenes in the tail here.
Then we have an ethobond to a head group,
which is a glycerol 1 phosphate head group.
And this is our own type of membrane,
fatty acids via an estobond to glycerol 3 phosphate.
Now, the difference between fatty acids and isoprenes,
you could ascribe that to adaptation
to different environments.
But this difference in stereochemistry here
is very difficult to ascribe to any selective advantage
of glycerol 1 phosphate over glycerol 3 phosphate.
It looks as if they were simply independently originated
in that common ancestor.
And it implies that Luca,
whatever she did have,
did not have a phospholipid membrane,
a lipid membrane of some sort,
but not necessarily with a glycerol phosphate head group.
Now, what the ancestors are,
what the deepest branching roots of these domains
are, there is really very little,
if any, agreement about this at all.
I think that's from a phylogenetic point of view.
From a biochemical point of view,
I would say that it points to the methanogens or archaea
and the acetogens of bacteria
as possibly the deepest branches.
The reason I say that's got nothing to do with phylogenetics
and everything to do with how they actually grow.
So both grow from hydrogen and carbon dioxide
via a pathway, the acetal CoA pathway.
There's only six known pathways of carbon fixation
right across all of life.
And this is the only one which is shared
in the bacteria in the archaea.
So that looks as if it's going back to that common ancestor.
It has other nice properties too.
It's short, it's only a few steps, linear,
so you don't have problems with declining substrate
at each steps of a cycle.
It's exagonic, so it's actually releasing energy
and I'll say more about that.
There's a lot of iron, sulphur, nickel,
sulphur catalysts involved in there.
And it's obligately chemiosmotic,
but it doesn't require quinones or cytochroms.
The problem is that again,
there's a very deep divergence
between the mechanisms of iron pumping,
between the way in which they produce,
in fact, a methyl group,
but that's coupled to iron pumping.
That differs fundamentally
between the methanogens and the acetogens.
So again, it's begging the question.
Well, one interpretation,
which is my favourite interpretation to this is,
well, the problem is that membrane biologetics
are universal, but the membranes themselves are not,
and potentially neither is the active proton pumping machinery.
So this paradox could be resolved
if life originated in an environment
where there were natural proton gradients
across inorganic barriers.
Like these vents, for example,
so this is Lost City,
which was discovered in the year 2000.
And it's an alkaline hydrothermal vent
formed not by reactions between water and magma,
but between rock, essentially,
between minerals like olivine,
which are extremely common in interstellar dust,
I'm told, as well as in the mantle of the earth.
So relatively cool interactions
between water and olivine,
the olivine is oxidised,
releasing hydrogen charged,
and hydrothermal fluid is charged with hydroxide ions.
So quite strongly alkaline around about pH 11 or thereabouts.
And we see similar things.
So I'm told in cellar dust that the pH is around about 11.
That's often taken to be serpentinisation as well.
There's detection of methane on Mars,
is often attributed to serpentinisation.
And the chances are as well on Europa and so on,
there is serpentinisation going on.
All it really requires is water and rock
and an atmosphere with CO2.
So from an astrobiology point of view,
these conditions should be extremely common,
perhaps as common as billions of exoplanets
in the Milky Way alone.
So these conditions were pointed out by Mike Russell,
20 years, more than 20 years ago now.
He referred to them as electrochemical flow reactors
and pointed out this was 10 years before
that Lost City was even discovered.
They should be saturated,
serpentinisation gives rise to
millimolar quantities of hydrogen, CO2,
the early oceans we think would have been richer in CO2.
There should be temperature gradients,
but relatively mild temperature gradients.
We don't have temperatures of 400 degrees,
as you see in black smoke events.
They tend to be 50 to 100 degrees
or thereabouts that kind of temperature range.
What you have is a microporous labyrinth
and you can see this is aragonite today,
but in the Hadean, in the absence of oxygen,
and with ferudinous oceans,
there are lots of ferosion around,
there should have been, we think,
catalytic iron, nickel, sulfide minerals in these walls.
And perhaps the most important thing
from the point of view of this talk, pH gradients.
The fluids coming in, the hydrothermal fluids
are around about pH 11.
The early oceans, we don't know their pH,
but five to seven is probably reasonably conservative,
relatively acidic because there's so much CO2 around.
So that means that the structure of these inorganic pores,
and think of this as a pore deep within the vent
rather than at the very edge,
so we have hydrothermal fluids in the inside of this,
we have an inorganic barrier,
and then percolating in from the oceans,
we also have relatively acidic ocean waters.
And this is analogous to the structure of a cell.
So here we have the cell membrane,
this is what bacteria and archaea are doing,
is there pumping protons across the cell membrane outside,
so we have a proton gradient between the outside
and the inside in both cases.
And it's a pH gradient of around about equivalent
to three pH units in both cases.
So both the magnitude and the polarity of this gradient
are equivalent, which is interesting.
It doesn't mean anything necessarily,
but it begs the question of how could natural proton gradients
across inorganic barriers drive anything at all?
Well, the clue might be in the methanogens themselves,
and this is how they are generating methane
in the first place.
So this is going on in your own intestines now,
and cows obviously contribute a great deal of methane
to the atmosphere.
What they're doing, and this has worked from Rolf Tower
over the last five or six years,
is they're taking a pair of electrons from hydrogen
and they're bifocating the electron pair.
So they're coupling an hexagonic reduction
of a heterodydysulfide group here
to an endagonic reduction of the ferrodoxin.
The ferrodoxin's reducing the CO2,
ultimately through to a methyl group attached to a cofactor.
It's transferred to a separate cofactor,
and then it acquires that same electron again
from the heterodydysulfide and it's released as methane.
So we have a cycle going on here,
which is just releasing methane,
and the only thing that's conserved
is a proton gradient across the membrane.
In actual fact, it's very often a sodium gradient,
but they have sodium proton anti-porters,
which means that it's very easy to convert a sodium gradient
into a proton gradient.
What do they use it for,
and here it seems they do use the proton gradient
rather than the sodium gradient,
while they use it directly to reduce ferrodoxin
via a membrane protein called the energy converting hydrogenase,
which is powered by the proton motive force.
The ferrodoxin again reduces the CO2
through to the methyl group,
and we have also running from that same proton motive force
at the ATP synthase.
So this is essentially it
as far as driving metabolism is concerned in methanogens.
So the whole process of methanogenesis
and electron bifurcation is generating a gradient.
This gradient is free of charge if you're in a vent,
which has natural proton gradients,
and so natural proton gradients
potentially could drive both an ATP synthase
and perhaps more plausibly at a very early stage of evolution
and energy converting hydrogenase.
It's again, it's an iron sulfur protein,
membrane-bound,
driving the reduction of ferrodoxin
and other iron sulfur protein.
And this is just a highlight
that, in fact, you can't even see.
There's shading around a lot of these.
A lot of the proteins involved in electron bifurcation
and carbon metabolism and methanogens and acetogens
are iron sulfur proteins
with structures which are reminiscent of grigite,
the mineral grigite,
which you would expect to find in that kind of vent.
So the reaction between hydrogen and CO2
to produce organic matter
under strictly anoxic conditions is exogonic.
So to produce total cell biomass down here,
so this is delta G is minus 1,000 or so,
it's not millivolts.
I can't remember what the unit is, Jules-Program.
Nuclear tides are up here,
so it's endogonic to produce nuclear tides.
There has to be some form of coupling in this system
to generate nuclear tides,
but amino acids and fatty acids should be formed
fairly spontaneously under that set of conditions.
Of course, they're not.
They don't form very easily at all under these conditions.
And the reason is there's an endogonic barrier
to get through the first couple of steps
of reduction of CO2.
This is the geochemical pathway
to get up to formaldehyde here,
and then it's exogonic after that.
What methanogens actually do is suppress
that initial energetic barrier
using the proton motive force,
using the ionic gradient here.
And that's what you have free of charge in the vents,
which begs a hypothesis
which we've been trying to test.
This is the problem
from the point of view of reduction potential in millivolts.
The reduction potential of the hydrogen proton pair
is not sufficiently reducing,
is not low enough,
this is an inverted scale of minus 600,
not enough to reduce CO2 through to formaldehyde.
It's not going to happen spontaneously.
But that's at pH seven.
The Nernst equation says that the reduction potential
of protons are involved depends on pH.
And so what we actually have in the vents,
this is conservative again,
pH 10 of hydrogen proton reduction potential falls
to about minus 600,
whereas CO2 at pH six through to formaldehyde
rises to about minus 480 or thereabouts.
So under those conditions,
hydrogen ought to be able to reduce CO2.
The trouble is mixing.
How do you stop mixing?
Well, the answer is exactly the barriers
that you find between the pores in these vents.
So on one side of the barrier,
we have hydrogen in alkaline conditions,
on the other side we have CO2 or bicarbonate
in relatively acidic conditions.
And the question is,
would you expect to see a transfer of electrons
through these semiconducting iron sulfur minerals
in the barrier?
That of course would accumulate a charge,
but because we have mixing in the system,
you would expect to dissipate that charge.
So the question is, does it work?
And we built a very simple reactor,
a benchtop reactor,
it's only about nine centimetres in diameter.
To try and simulate,
this is in an aerobic hood,
so strictly anoxic conditions,
these precipitating vent-like structures,
which are reflecting our simulated hydrothermal fluids
and simulated early acidic oceans.
These are the minerals that we form in there,
so this is very similar to McKinnawite,
disored in McKinnawite nanocrystals of that.
And the question is, well,
does it actually reduce CO2 or bicarbonate?
The answer is yes,
we're getting a small amount of formate,
we're getting a certain amount of formaldehyde,
especially in the precipitates themselves.
So this is down at the bottom,
is HPLC grade water,
above that is the ferrous chloride solution,
so we do get some reduction going on
just in ferrous chloride solution,
but that's not surprising,
ferrous iron can act as an electron donor.
This is in the solution within the reactor itself,
so we're getting a small increase in formaldehyde,
but in the precipitates themselves,
over a couple of hours,
we're seeing quite a substantial,
this is up to about 120 micromolar concentration
we're getting.
So reasonable production of formaldehyde
under those conditions,
and it does seem to depend on the pH gradient.
They are, though, low yield,
and most of the reactions that we've been doing
have been low yield.
There is a very neat way in these vents
of increasing, not the yield,
but the concentration by a process
that Dieter Brown has talked about
over the last 10 years,
also called thermophoresis,
where you have thermal gradients
within this micro porous network,
and you would expect to concentrate organics
really anything up to 10 to the 12 fold
from Dieter's initial simulations.
Whoops.
Sorry, I seem to have jumped right to the end somehow.
So we tried doing the same thing
in a more open system in our reactor itself
using a ceramic foam,
and we generate heat gradients
with at least a suggestion of convection going on there,
but the proof is in the pudding.
Do we actually concentrate organics
on what we used initially was quinine,
simply because it's UV fluorescent,
and this is, in fact,
quinine concentrating to about 30 million fold,
precipitating as pellets of quinine.
So this is effectively just infusing
a very low nanomolar concentrations of quinine
and concentrating it up to millimolar concentrations
in a completely open system.
If you switch the heat off,
you don't see any concentration at all.
It simply leaves the entire system.
So that's a way of concentrating
not really over several orders of magnitude.
That makes it far more likely
that you'll have interactions between molecules,
even if they're formed at fairly low yield
in the first place.
And that, just for the last couple of minutes,
I'll mention some recent work of being doing,
looking at whether or not acetyl phosphate
can operate as an analogue,
if you like, a mimic of ATP.
So acetyl-CoA, I mentioned the acetyl-CoA pathway.
This is the business end of it.
Here's ATP, adenosine triphosphate.
These are not molecules that you would associate
with the first stages of a biogenesis.
But there are much simpler analogs.
So this is acetyl phosphate,
which might potentially do the same job as ATP.
Thioacetic acid and methyl thioacetate
have a thioester bond
and potentially could do a similar job to acetyl-CoA.
So the question is, could it actually work
as an ATP mimetic?
We've shown that we can actually synthesise it
under these conditions,
especially pH 7s are relatively neutral conditions.
We still get a reasonable amount at pH 8.
We get nothing at all at pH 11.
But because you have continuous mixing going on
in these vent systems,
you don't necessarily have to insist
that it's going to be pH 11.
It could be really anything between pH 5 and pH 11.
So we're getting reasonable amounts,
especially in the presence of magnesium.
And I should just note here
that if we haven't yet shown every step
of the pathway to making acetyl phosphate,
we're still working on that now.
But the assumption is that the first steps
of reducing CO2 through to the formaldehyde
and beyond onto methyl sulfide, we hope,
means that the synthesis of acetyl phosphate
should also be powered
ultimately by the proton gradient itself.
Can it phosphorylate things?
Yes, to a degree, again, fairly low yields.
So this is looking initially at ribose here,
at different temperatures, 20 degrees C and 50 degrees C.
And this is adenosine, phosphorylating adenosine
to adenosine monophosphate, again, 20 degrees C
and 50 degrees C.
So, yes, it's about a one to 2% yield, that's all,
but it is able to do it in water with nothing else.
And this is looking at the polymerization of amino acids
so far we've not succeeded with nucleotides.
But with glycine, this is forming di-glycine
or a more strictly di-keto-piperazine,
which is a cyclic form of di-glycine.
This is TMP for comparison.
And this is using acetyl phosphate.
So we're getting a yield of 30% to 40% or so
really within minutes to hours,
and it tends to last for around about a week.
So what we're doing, and this is the final slide,
is this is the acetyl CoA pathway,
starting with hydrogen and CO2,
taking you through to acetyl CoA.
The next step is going to pyruvate
into an incomplete reverse Krebs cycle here.
Most of those steps involve carboxylation
or hydrogenation powered by ATP.
There's the stars showing ATP power.
So can this be done
abiotically one reaction at a time through to these?
So most nucleotide bases, for example,
are produced in methanogens from amino acids and so on.
That's all. I'm happy to take questions.
Thank you.
