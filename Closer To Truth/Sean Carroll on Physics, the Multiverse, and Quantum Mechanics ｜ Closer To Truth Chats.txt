I would like to be able to understand why the laws of physics look the way they do,
but as in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will probably just turn out to be
an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as the reason why the universe exists.
Welcome to Closer to Truth. I'm speaking with physicist and philosopher of physics,
Sean Carroll, about his superb, valuable new book, Quanta and Fields, the second in Sean's
acclaimed series, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. It is the clearest introduction to
quantum mechanics and related topics with the real math that is both comprehensive and accessible,
which sounds like an oxymoron, but for Sean it is not. Sean, good to see you again.
Robert, thanks very much for having me on. Always good to be here.
I love the book. It's what I've been looking for. I learned a lot. I need to learn more,
but before we dive in, let's start with one of the possible implications of quantum theories,
the many-worlds interpretation, which we'll talk about later in depth, but just briefly,
because I read in the April 9th issue of New Scientist Magazine an article that headlines
the multiverse could be much, much bigger than we ever imagined, and it considers innumerable
subsystems of the world. You're quoted quite extensively, quite well, as taking this seriously.
Why do you take that seriously? Well, many worlds in general is a wonderful and
compelling idea. I take it seriously because it's the most straightforward implication of
the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics.
Every other version of the foundations of quantum mechanics either changes the Schrodinger equation
sometimes or adds new elements to it or something like that. Let me just be super duper clear for
the listeners. I wrote a whole book about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
and why it's good. In these books and the biggest ideas, I don't talk about it that much. I'm much
more focused on what we truly believe that we understand, not speculations that go beyond
our current knowledge. Right. No, that's clear from the book. But in the article, it talks about
the idea of subsystems where any two aspects of the world, what I'm doing here on Earth and
something that just happened in an Alpha Centauri, could be looked upon as a subsystem. Does that in
any way expand the traditional Hugh Everett, traditional interpretation of many worlds?
Because that was the implication of the article. Well, I think that it depends on what you mean
by the interpretation. At its very most basic level, Everett is just saying there's something
called the quantum state, which everyone agrees there is, the vector in Hilbert space, if you
want to be technical about it, but the wave function of the universe, if you want to be poetic,
and it always obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's it. That's the entirety of the interpretation.
Everything else is commentary, including the fact that there are many worlds. And so there is a long
running debate among people who care about the Everett interpretation about what counts as a world.
Where do we draw the dividing line between the different worlds? And so we're thinking about
the possibility that you can be pretty comprehensive in dividing it up into a very large number of
worlds. But the important thing is this doesn't change the Everett interpretation at all. It's
only a question of, is this more a more convenient way of thinking about it for we limited human
beings? Okay, well, there'll be more to come of many worlds. We'll get into it later in more
depth, but it is certainly a fascinating. We'll conduct our discussion in three parts. First,
I want to go through each chapter of the book just to get an overall high level sense of quantum
fields. Then I'm going to pick out several of what I think are interesting issues from the
book that we can discuss in some depth. And then finally, we'll have sort of some speculations about
the implications of quantum mechanics and the nature of reality, all good, close to the true
subjects. But first, let me give a serious, a little quick bio. Sean Carroll is the Homewood
Professor of Natural Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, a joint appointment between physics
and philosophy. Sean's research has focused on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation,
shifting to more foundational questions in quantum mechanics. In addition to the biggest ideas in
the universe series, he is the author of many bestselling books, including Something Deeply
Hidden, The Big Picture, and From Eternity. To now, he is the host of the popular Minescape
podcast. Sean, lots to cover. Again, we're going to use the chapters of your book as a framework.
So let's look for a high level discussion in the in the overview, which is just to give some
fundamentals. Just define a quanta and fields by contrasting it with what we know from classical
physics. Yeah, you know, it's a three volume series that we're in the middle of here. Volume
one was space, time, and motion, classical physics. Volume two is quantum physics, but that has to
include modern ways of thinking about quantum physics, which are based on quantum field theory.
So a lot of the book is about quantum field theory. Okay. And how, what is the major contrast
between quanta and field? So define each of those terms briefly.
The idea of quanta comes from the fact that we actually in the formulation of the theory,
quantum mechanics, we don't think about a lattice or discreteness or pixels or anything like that.
Everything is smooth and continuous. But when we observe it, the world appears to us in lumps,
in particles, which we call quanta. And fields are the fact that the thing that we quantize
to get our best picture of nature are fields that fill all of space rather than particles
that have a definite location. Okay. And that's a very significant point. A major part of the book
and we'll get into that. Okay. Chapter one is on the wave function, giving the position and
momentum of every constituent, specifies a classical system, and giving the wave function
specifies the quantum state of a system. Yeah, this was a dramatic change because Isaac Newton,
we thought, had laid down the law for classical mechanics. What the world is, is some things with
positions and momenta. Quantum mechanics comes along and says, no, there's something called the
wave function. And we can figure out how to predict things as best we can from it. But it's an utterly
different thing than Newton would have thought. And for the wave function, that is not a design as
a representation of reality. It means it is reality. It's a big difference in science.
We don't agree. No one knows. I think that reality is completely represented by the wave function.
In other words, reality is reality. But the wave function is in a mathematical one-to-one
correspondence with reality. Others think that it's only part of reality or it has nothing to do
with reality. So that's where opinions differ. Okay, sounds like a big difference. So you bring
up the Schrodinger equation very briefly. Describe it. The Schrodinger equation is what replaces
in quantum mechanics f equals ma from classical mechanics, the equation of motion Newton's
second law. It's the thing that says, okay, I've told you what the world is. Newton would have
said positions in momentum. Quantum mechanics says it's a wave function. Now tell me how it
evolves, how it changes over time. That's what the Schrodinger equation does. Great. And one
other point from this chapter, which comes out as important, is when you use the Hamiltonian,
which you discussed in your first book, in quantum mechanics, that becomes an operator.
And so give us just some sense of what an operator is in terms of a mathematical function
that characterizes quantum mechanics versus classical mechanics. Yeah, so I was happy enough
in book one to talk about something called the Hamiltonian, which is a fancy way of saying
the energy of a system as a function of the positions and momenta of everything. So you have
some complicated arrangement of stuff, and the Hamiltonian is one number. It's the energy of
that particular arrangement of stuff. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian, like many other things,
is not a number. It's an operator, which means I start with a wave function with some quantum
mechanical state, and the Hamiltonian operates on that to give me a different wave function.
And then I can do things with it like plug it into the Schrodinger equation.
Good. So that's a very significant difference. Okay. Chapter two is on measurement. Let's start
very quickly as what is the measurement problem? Well, this is the big thing for the foundations
of quantum mechanics, right? Because if all that had happened when we invented quantum mechanics was
to replace positions and momenta with wave functions, that would be slightly annoying,
but we would deal with it. Waves are things that physicists know how to deal with very, very well.
The problem is that when you look at a quantum system, it doesn't look like a wave function.
It looks like particles or something like that. So the measurement problem is what do you mean
when you say look at a system? What exactly happens? What counts as a measurement?
What can make it happen? What kind of agents can make it happen? Why are measurements important
at all? Yeah, and many people extrapolate that significantly to say there has to be a conscious
observer. And this has great philosophical implications about the nature of reality or the
nature of consciousness, which I don't think we agree with. Well, I don't agree with it. I'm not
going to put words in anyone else's mind. Well, I think we mean you and I. Yeah, right. So, you know,
we don't know what the answer to this measurement problem is, but it's not that we have no good
ideas. We have lots of good ideas. And what we teach our students is not very good, is not very
sensible. It's not very coherent. It's just that when you measure something, the wave function
suddenly changes. It collapses. But you're not allowed to ask what it means to do a measurement,
to what counts as a measurement. So it's good enough. That sort of half-baked version of quantum
mechanics is good enough to win many, many Nobel prizes. But it's not quite precise and clear
enough to be a well-formulated theory of reality. In this chapter, just give some sense of what
Hilbert space is and how that compares with regular space and why that's important in quantum
mechanics. Yeah, it's too bad that the word space is used here. And I blame the mathematicians for
this. They consider any set with interesting structures on it to be called a space, right?
So the space of all possible blah, blah, blah. Very different than the three-dimensional space
that you and I live in. So Hilbert space is the mathematical space where all of the wave functions
live. Every possible quantum state of the universe is an element of Hilbert space. And John von Neumann,
the famous physicist and mathematician, showed that mathematically, Hilbert space is a vector space.
That means that quantum states are vectors. You can add them together. You can, they have a direction.
They have a magnitude. They don't have a direction in physical space. In the three-dimensional world,
they have a direction in this gigantically dimensioned thing called Hilbert space.
Chapter three, entanglement. A very interesting point you make is that when we think classically,
we think particles. And when we think in quantum, we first think of the quantum state, then particles.
Yeah. And importantly, when you have more than one particle in classical mechanics,
it's not a big deal. You just add more particles. You describe each particle individually. The
classical world is separable. You can treat each part of it all by itself and then add in what its
interactions are with the rest of the world. Entanglement in quantum mechanics says the quantum
world is not like that. There are not separate quantum states for different parts of the universe.
There is only one wave function for the whole universe all at once. And that has important
experimental implications. You can measure one part of the universe and that tells you something
about the possible measurement outcome somewhere else. Chapter four is on Fields, a very important
part of the book because quantum field theory, as you state, is the single best way to describe the
universe at its deepest known level. So quantum field theory really becomes the foundation out of
which quantum mechanics and particles emerge. Yeah. And I want to emphasize there's 12 chapters in
the book and only three of them are about quantum mechanics by itself. We move very quickly on to
Fields because it's such a rich, amazingly deep subject. And so in this chapter, chapter four,
we just make our lives very, very simple. We say, what if there was just one field in the universe
and it didn't interact with anything else? It's all by itself. And what we show is that when you
apply the rules of quantum mechanics to that situation, that field acts like a collection
of particles. Or more specifically, because quantum mechanics lets us consider super positions of
different things, like Schrodinger's cat being partly awake and partly asleep, you can have a
quantum field representing zero particles and also one particle and also two particles, etc,
all the way up all at once. And significantly, then particles are really the quantized
excitation of fields as opposed to entities in themselves. This is, I think, one of the most
fundamental points. Absolutely. It surely is. As I say in the book, if you were a physicist
working at the end of the 1800s, you would have been forgiven for thinking we were almost done
with physics. Classical mechanics seemed pretty good. And you could divide the world into particles
and fields, particles like electrons or atoms, fields like the electromagnetic field, the
gravitational field, and so on. And quantum field theory unifies all of that. It's all fields.
But when you look at fields, when you measure them in precisely the right way, they appear to
us as particles. So it's really only one thing going on deep down. So the implication that
particles are quantized, excitation of fields answers a fundamental question. And with all the
number of electrons in the universe or protons tend to the 80 or whatever the number is,
how could they all be exactly the same? Because it just seems impossible. But when you think of them
as not as entities that we have to explain why they're all the same, but they're all the product
of a field, the answer becomes obvious. You know, you're right. There are about 10 to the 80th
electrons in the observable universe. You got the right number there. I'm very impressed. That was
very nice. And you're also right that the reason why every electron is identical to every other
electron is because fundamentally, the world is not made of electrons or other particles. It's made
of fields. And there's something called the electron field. And when you poke at it and make a little
vibration that shows up to us as an electron particle, but the underlying field has the same
physical properties no matter when or where you are in the universe. So every electron looks
identical to us. And not only look, but they actually are. They actually are. And quantum
mechanics has a lot to say about that. Yes. Chapter five, interactions. Well, of course,
this is where things truly become exciting and mind bending because in the previous chapter,
we showed that if you had just one field all by itself, not interacting with anything, it would
look like particles, but there's nothing to look at it, right? In order to look at it, you need
other fields interacting with it. And that's where we get to talk about Feynman diagrams.
Feynman was the one who really showed us how to think about interacting quantum fields.
Two electrons come close together. They interact by tossing back and forth some photons or some
other particles. They scatter off to go elsewhere. Sometimes the answer is infinity, which worries
you. That'll be another chapter. But the point is there is a recipe for going from some specific
kind of interactions that you specify dynamically to all these little pictures of what happens,
which gives you a way of calculating your quantum mechanical probabilities.
On a simple look, Feynman diagrams just seem almost Lego simplistic. Why are they so powerful
when they look so simple? Well, that's a great question. And one of the motivations behind
writing this book is to move beyond the idea that Feynman diagrams are just cartoons, right?
Because in a book like this, my grand ambition is to show people the equations, to unveil
the specific quantitative relationships beneath the metaphors and analogies that we usually get.
So in a traditional popular science treatment, including ones that I've given myself,
you will draw a Feynman diagram and you'll say, this represents this interaction, blah, blah, blah.
But you're left a little unsatisfied because, you know, why do I have to draw that diagram?
So here in this book, we explain that every diagram is a number. Diagrams can be used to
calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes, basically to calculate the wave function for this particular
process. And from that, we can get the probability of observing that process. So they're not just
cute little pictures of what happens. They're fiercely quantitative ways of measuring and
characterizing the probability that something happens.
Chapter six, effective field theory.
This is my favorite chapter. I don't know if it's going to be anybody else's favorite chapter,
but you know, we alluded to the fact that these Feynman diagrams, which are supposed to help us
calculate things, can easily lead to trouble because you calculate a number and the number is infinity.
And this seems bad. And so Feynman and Schwinger and Tom and Aga won the Nobel Prize for wrestling
with this, showing us that we could get away with it. But it always seemed a little unsatisfying.
The process called renormalization. Feynman himself was not happy with renormalization
throughout his life. It just sounds like a fudge factor.
It does sound like that. But basically, it was all figured out by Ken Wilson in the 60s and 70s.
And somehow the world doesn't know about this. And the world should know about this.
What Wilson said is that the reason why Feynman diagrams give you infinity is because you're
including particles with infinitely big energies. And you don't know what's going on when particles
have infinitely big energies. Maybe space time doesn't exist or something like that.
So he showed us how to just remove those unwanted, ill understood parts from our Feynman diagrams.
And we are left with what is called an effective field theory because they are very, very effective.
Chapter seven, which is one of my favorite chapters, which you call scale. And you introduce the idea
of scale by saying the number of nucleons of basic Newtonian protons and various orders of
magnitude. Human DNA or bacteria would have 10 to the 12th. A human being would have 10 to the 28th.
The earth would have 10 to the 51. The sun would have 10 to the 57. So that's a million times
more. Exponent of 6 is a million. And so the earth is roughly a millionth the size of the sun,
which is right. Milky Way Galaxy, 10 to the 70th. I think that looks like 10 trillion suns,
which is more than the number of stars in the galaxy. But there's a lot of gas and other stuff.
So that's order of magnitude, right? And then the whole observable universe, 10 to the 80th,
which is 10 billion galaxies, seems actually low. Because I think that 10 trillion, so maybe
it should be 10 to the 82nd. But you see this beautiful hierarchy. And to me, that's the best,
simplest way to get a sense of the structure of reality. I mean, it's literally breathtaking.
Yeah, you know, this chapter is kind of a reward. It's a little respite. You know,
you've just done the last couple chapters are pretty heavy going. It's a lot. And so we want to
like put it together. And as you see, as you say, reflect on the beautiful structure that comes out
of this, because this talk about quantum mechanics and field theory, sometimes it said, this describes
the world of the very small, but actually describes the whole world, including the very big, he says
you don't need it to describe most features of galaxies or stars. You need it when you get down
to subatomic particles, but they all fit in to the quantum field theory framework.
An interesting point in this chapter, which is a great way to understand how the world works,
is the fact that we know that that protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, three quarks,
different colors or characteristic strangeness. And they come together in different ways. And we
think that's what composes it. And they're held together with the boson, the force of
gluons. But the point that you make, which is the critical point is that if you took out all the
quarks and only had the equivalent masses of the force, which is the gluons, the total mass
wouldn't get that much less. I mean, that's an astounding idea. Yeah, you know, this is why
it's necessary and useful to think about quantum field theory, because sometimes when you have
an electron going through your bubble chamber or whatever, you don't need to think about the
details of quantum field theory, you can just think of it as a particle moving in a certain
trajectory. But inside a proton or a neutron, the world is very different from the world of our
intuition of particles and so forth. So we're told once again, in a pop science level, that a
proton has three quarks inside. But the mass of the proton is much bigger than the sum of the masses
of those quarks. And also another thing that I go through in the book is there's something called
the Compton wavelength of a particle, which is roughly the size you can squeeze its wave function
down to. And the Compton wavelength of a quark is much bigger than the size of the proton that it
squeezed into. So what is going on here? And the answer is that you should read the book, because
it's all about quantum field theory, and it all does make sense. Okay, so now I'm going to go
quickly through some of the later chapters. Eight is symmetry. Symmetry is very important. Whenever
you hear things like the standard model is an SU three cross SU two cross you one gauge theory.
What do all of those symbols mean? What do all those words mean? It's all about symmetry and group
theory. And that's why I explained this in the book. Chapter nine is gauge theory, which is a
particular kind of field theory. That's right. So the previous chapter was about the mathematics
of symmetry. Gauge theories are putting that mathematics to work in quantum field theory.
It is the existence of certain kinds of symmetries gauge symmetries that give rise to the forces of
nature. The reason why there are forces is because of a symmetry in the underlying quantum field theory.
And this transformation can be done at every at any point in space time. That's what the word gauge
means in gauge symmetry. It means that I have red, green and blue quarks, for example. That's a three
dimensional space and I can rotate it. That's a symmetry in SU three symmetry. But I can rotate
it separately at every point in space time. And that means I need a new field to be able to connect
them. That field turns out to be the glue on which holds particles together. One of the points you
made out a little difficulty with is from gauge theory. You can derive the idea that the force
carrying particles are naturally massless like the like the photon, etc. I didn't quite get that.
How you so quickly get to that conclusion, which is obviously important.
Yeah, it is. So we talk about in earlier chapters what it looks like when a field has a mass. It
all comes down to the dynamics of the field. It's a way for the field to interact with itself
so that its particles move slower than the speed of light and have what we would call a mass. The
more force you put on them, the more they accelerate like F equals MA in Newton's laws. Now gauge
symmetries come along and there's a symmetry there which very, very tightly restricts the possible
terms you can write down in the equations of motion for these particles. And it turns out
that the particular kind of interaction you need to give those particles a mass is forbidden
by the symmetry. It would break the symmetry if you just naively wrote it down. Well, you can
write it down. People did and they're like, ah, now it's not gauge invariant anymore. So that
symmetry not only gives rise to a new force, but it implies that the particles carrying that force
should be massless, whether they're photons or gravitons or gluons. Chapter 10 phases.
This is a big one because I just told you that gauge symmetries imply that force carrying
particles are massless. But in nature, we have things called the W and Z bosons which are force
carrying particles which are not massless. What's going on with that? And the answer is that gauge
theories can appear in different phases, very analogous to like the phases of water being ice or
liquid or vapor. There's different ways to apparently break the symmetry, not really break it but hide
it. And that gives masses to the W and Z bosons not to mention particles like the electron and the
quarks. I'm very familiar. Most people are with the standard model of particle physics. Stephen
Weinberg particularly personifies that. You introduced the idea or explained the idea of core
theory as well. So how does the standard model articulate with core theory? I borrowed that
term from Frank Wilczek who introduced it and it's basically a way of reminding you that gravity is
less of a bad fit than you might think. We have this thing we say we don't understand quantum
gravity etc etc. What would be more accurate to say is that we don't have a full complete final
theory of quantum gravity. We don't have a theory of quantum gravity that includes black holes or
the big bang or things like that. But as long as gravity is relatively weak like here like all the
solar system including the sun the earth etc. We're nowhere near making a black hole. Gravity is
pretty weak. Under those circumstances we understand quantum gravity fine. So the core theory is just
the standard model of particle physics plus gravity in that weak field regime.
Okay so the standard model is a subset of core theory with the asterisk that this applies
to low levels of gravity. Yeah that's exactly right. Okay good. Okay chapter 11 on matters
bringing things together. Well matter is a you know could mean almost anything but what I took it
to mean but I wanted to explain was why when you have certain kinds of fields bosons like the Higgs
boson or the photon or whatever they can pile on top of each other and give you a classical force
field whereas other kinds of particles fermions like electrons and neutrinos and quarks they take
up space. They make up matter. The table in front of you or whatever has a certain solidity a certain
density because some particles take up space. I explain why in this chapter. Okay and that's why
I can't my hand don't pass. I can't indigitate. I can't put my hand through a table and that's
because the difference between the matter and the forces. The reason why you can punch somebody
effectively is ultimately because electrons do not want to be in the same quantum state. Yes.
Okay chapter 12 Adams. Yeah so for the final chapter we put it all together and we answer
the question if there's all these particles out there you know Higgs bosons and top quarks and
whatever why are you and I made of so few particles electrons protons neutrons you know a couple of
force-carrying particles. So we talked about the dynamics of these particles and how they decay
into each other. What are the stable final particles. Why do neutrons become stable inside
a nucleus but not outside a nucleus. How does it all fit together to make up the periodic table
of the elements. And the the big question of a baryon asymmetry where in the early universe
I think you say there were 10 billion anti-baryon particles versus 10 billion plus one baryon and
therefore all the 10 billion cancelled out but the one left over out of 10 billion becomes the
entire universe. That's exactly right and we don't know why and I'm going to be very honest
I'm not going to tell you why in this book because I'm sticking to things that we know
that's when we don't know the answer to. Yeah and that you said it before but it's an important
point about the book. We have these very speculative ideas you've dealt with it in other books but
this book is really the depth of the understanding of what we do know what we're sure of and how
that works. Okay let's go into our second part which is just taking some of the issues that are
just fascinating and dealing and let's start with wave particle duality and in particular the
celebrated double slit experiment and why is that so important. Yeah you know wave particle
duality is honestly overrated I think Edward Whitten once said the battle is over the waves
have won the world is clearly made of waves but it appears like particles under certain
circumstances that's the magic of quantum measurement so what the world is is very wave very field
like but under the right circumstances when you measure something it looks like a particle
the double slit experiment is a famous example of that where you say a single electron can pass
through two slits and interfere with itself if you really just accept that electrons are not
particles they're described by wave functions that's the least surprising thing in the world
waves can interfere with each other. Right and how deeply do we understand that you know there's some
would speculate that the double split experiment is evidence for the many world interpretation
you wouldn't go that far would you. I would not go that far I think again all you need to believe
in is the reality of wave functions now some people don't some people think that wave functions are
just ways to calculate experimental outcomes and we should not attribute reality to them
and I think that those people have a very difficult time in explaining things like
the double slit experiment they can do it but they kind of have to bend over backwards to do it
so if you just trust the equations if you just believe what is sitting right in front of your
face here's a wave function here's the equation it obeys everything I think makes perfect sense
I don't think the double slit is especially mysterious. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle
is almost a household world and is used in many in many forms one of the highlights of the book
to me was understanding it in its deeper meaning and to really appreciate why it is the case so
give me a brief sense of that. Yeah you know it's again not a postulate of quantum mechanics
it's something that pops out of the formalism of quantum mechanics but it's fascinating to me
because Isaac Newton in his formulation of classical mechanics says very clearly you need
to tell me the position of something and its momentum and then I can predict where it will go
the state of something is its position and its momentum. Quantum mechanics comes along and says
my wave function is psi of x that is to say for every possible position of the particle
I can attach a wave function number and I would square that to get the probability
of observing it so where did p go what happened to momentum p is the letter that we use for momentum
how can you possibly capture everything there is about the system in terms of just the wave
function as a function of position so I explain the answer to that we know what the answer is
and the answer is remember quantum states are vectors in Hilbert space and basically when you
have a vector if you just do have x y and z then you have components of the vector you've chosen
a basis you're going to tell me what the vector is by giving you the components in quantum mechanics
the relationship between position and momentum is changing bases changing the fundamental axes
along which you measure your vector and then if you believe that if position is one kind of basis
momentum is a different kind of basis the uncertainty principle is automatically true
it's almost trivial in fact there are physicists out there will say oh it's just obvious you shouldn't
be worried about it because if you've rotated your vectors you can't be completely 100% in a
direction in one basis and also complete 100% along an axis in the different basis because
they're rotated with respect to each other so that's an example it's a great example where a little bit
of math I think makes everything much much clearer and it pops out as you said it's a it's a it's a
forced realization as opposed to a brilliant new idea yeah I mean it was a brilliant new idea when
Heisenberg came up with it but honestly we understand quantum mechanics better now than we did in those
early days so it does you know once you understand what quantum mechanics is trying to tell you the
uncertainty principle just comes along for the ride you make a statement that entanglement helps us
understand measurement that was to me one of the most interesting statements in the book these are
two of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics obviously and you link them together
how does that happen yeah you know I actually struggled while writing the book with the fact
that we don't agree on the basic language with which to talk about quantum mechanics we don't
agree on whether wave functions are real or not and I decided that you know rather than
on every page saying well if you think this you would say this thing and then this you know that
would just drag it down so I said we're gonna talk as if wave functions are real I mean I happen to
think that they are I happen to think that is the right way to think about reality but it certainly
provides a much easier way of talking about what happens in quantum mechanics and if you accept
that then we have an answer to the question what do you mean by doing a measurement and the answer
is a measurement happens when a quantum mechanical system that again it can be in a superposition
like spin up and spin down at some fraction of each all by itself that's fine a measurement is
when that system becomes entangled with the rest of the world and that's when the two parts of the
superposition are no longer sort of living by themselves they're now related to everything
else in the universe that's what we call a measurement okay you also make the point we
talked about a little bit earlier of the wave function of the universe that and the basic idea
I think is that no matter how you define your system whether it's as you said two particles
or the entire universe there's still only one wave function of that system so give me some color
around that yeah you know this is one of the things that is very very difficult for people
to wrap their brains around because we look at the world around us we see many separate objects
that just seems to be pretty obvious and quantum mechanics to put it in closer to truth language
is more of a monist theory it says there's really only one thing the wave function of the entire
universe and so people struggle to understand it but what I would advocate is just accepting that
except that there is only one thing and ask the other way ask why does this one thing the wave
function of the universe appear to us as many things that's the surprising thing why does it
look like apparently the world is made of many separate things and there that's an answerable
question it comes down again to measurement what we call decoherence which is when these quantum
systems that are in a superposition become entangled with the rest of the world and it all
does ultimately make sense even if it doesn't come close to our everyday intuitions what is the
hierarchy problem well we mentioned before the core theory right the standard model of particle
physics plus gravity it's a theory that fits essentially all of the data that we have from
laboratory experiments here on earth it doesn't fit some things in outer space which is why we
need dark matter and dark energy etc but here on earth it does a very good job the problem is
even though it fits the data there are parameters coupling constants numbers inside the core theory
that are very very surprising that are not at all what we would expect if those numbers were just
chosen randomly the hierarchy problem refers to the fact that there are two parameters one is the
Planck scale the scale at which gravity becomes important okay 10 to the 18 billion electron
volts and then there is the mass of the Higgs boson which tells us the electroweak scale the
scale for particle physics if you like and that's at about a hundred billion electron volts but if
you read chapter six on effective field theory you will learn that particle physicists see no
reason why these two scales should be so different from each other you would naturally expect them
to be very similar to each other and they're different by a factor of 10 to the 16 which is just
a little crazy that's the hierarchy problem we still don't know the answer to it and also how
about the relationship between the powers of the forces between the electromagnetic and the
gravitational power of forces there's a huge difference once again if you're just imagining
a universe or a world you wouldn't think that'd be such a vast difference in in scale yeah this
this is where it becomes very very tricky because you have to ask you know how do you measure these
things like after all the electromagnetic force between two neutrons is zero but the electromagnetic
force between two protons is considerable gravity is different because everything is affected by
gravity so the difference in the strength of the forces is actually not something that physicists
spend a lot of time dwelling on that's harder to sort of know what your expectations should have been
there's something called the weak gravity conjecture that conjectures that there are good
reasons why gravity has to be the weakest force but honestly that's beyond the scope of the book here
so we're we're trying to stick to things in this book that everyone will still agree on 500 years
from now good well that that that's a challenge but i think that's a that's a very admirable one
in that and very clear in terms of the purpose of the book in that area of hierarchy and we have
the cosmological constant which as you point out very strongly is the vacuum energy of empty space
quote unquote but the the difference between the calculated theoretical value and the observational
value is as you say 10 to the minus one two two so that's 10 to the minus 122 zeros which is
the largest mismatch in in all of physics and all of reality in terms of the relationship between
theory and experimental observation and so what do we what do we look what does that tell us
well we we're not sure what it tells us to be perfectly honest again this is an open problem
i think that the contribution of a book like quanta and fields is that the reader can truly
understand the problem in a way that it's harder to do otherwise because once you understand what
quantum field theory is and once you understand how effective field theory works now you can follow
the argument that says something like the vacuum energy should be a certain number because it's
certainly not a clear crisp prediction right we actually don't know what the vacuum energy should
be we have rough back of the envelope expectations for what it should be and if it had been off by
10 to the two or 10 to the three then we would have dealt with that we would have rolled with that
and said okay that's how the cookie crumbles but when it's off by 10 to the 122 then we go you
know i bet there's a reason why i bet there's an explanation i bet this is not just luck right
and again i'm not going to tell you what the answer is in this book but i'm going to help
you appreciate why physicists think it's a real problem and the quantum field theory is the
foundation of what creates the problem in a sense a hundred percent you know quantum field theory is
super super super successful at fitting the data once you put in these incredibly finely tuned
seemingly unnatural parameters for certain parts of the laws of physics so it's kind of a weird
problem it's not the usual thing in science where we have a theory it makes a prediction and then the
experiment says no that's not it this is not a place where we have a prediction we have a feeling
we have vibes right and so the question of how seriously we should take that is a very good one
okay now we're going to part three which is pure speculation and so we want to emphasize that the
book gives everyone the the capacity to understand the what is real and what is known today and can
therefore look at speculative ideas from the found from the unified foundation that we have
of particularly quantum field theory so what comes now is pure speculation Sean
not you know we're just going to just ask your your your feelings and won't hold you to them if
you want to change it the next time we talk so the first one i've got to go back to the many
worlds interpretation which you have forcefully and and very strongly articulated and advocate
and i don't want to obviously there are differences there's you know pilot wave
bomi and mechanical all sorts of different explanations but i don't want to put that aside
i want to say okay if if the many worlds interpretation is real if that is the way reality is
you know how does it how does it work i mean there are 10 to the 80th the numbers of particles
maybe 10 to the 90th photons each one can can be analyzed in terms of the plank time of each one
and different relationship how do you deal with the way to even think about the number of worlds
is it you know 10 to the 80th or 90th factorial and in some sense per plank time i mean i just
want to get a sense of the the order of magnitude of how you think about many worlds yeah i mean
the real answer there is i don't think about all those other worlds that much again the worlds are
a prediction of the theory they're not what the theory is fundamentally about the theory says the
world the total world the whole universe what we can see what we can't is described by a quantum
mechanical wave function and that wave function obeys the schrodinger equation that's the theory
and we're trying to work out the consequences of that theory one of the consequences is when you do a
quantum mechanical measurement and again measurement can be defined independently of people or
consciousness it's just about becoming entangled with the rest of the world the world branches
into multiple somewhat classical looking parts the different parts look individually almost
classical but they're separate from each other because in one the spin was up and the other
was the spin was down i appreciate and understand all of that i'm just trying to get a sense of the
order of magnitude of the numbers if we take you know a a period of time one second could you
invite into the plank time how many different total worlds emerge from that given the number of
the particles in the observable universe right and i'm trying to convince you to not worry about
that that's the wrong question to worry about because let me let me say two things number one
we don't know is the answer because in order to know that you would have to know the dimensionality
of Hilbert space of the fundamental theory of everything and we don't know that right now you
give me some boundaries can you i'm trying i'm trying it could be infinite right for many simple
quantum mechanical systems the best description is in terms of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space
and in that case it would be strictly nonsensical to ask how many worlds are there it's like saying
how many points are there between zero and one but what you can do is compare the number of points
between zero and point one to the number of points between zero and one you can give the
relative amount of worlds with certain qualities and that many worlds is able to do very very well
but it's also possible that the magnitude of the dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite indeed
i think that quantum gravity suggests that it probably is finite at least
when you only consider our observable universe but the number is very big the dimensionality
of Hilbert space for our observable universe is something like 10 to the power of 10 to the
power of 120 okay so that's plenty of room for lots of worlds to happen we're not going to run
out of room anytime soon yeah so that's a question of the the phase space or the the capacity
which is obviously 10 to the 10 to the 120 is enormous but it doesn't say how many of those
occur every period of time can you put a bound on that if many worlds is correct within a period
of time one second take you know what is the the lower bound and what is the upper bound
is there any way you can do that no i can't because again the theory doesn't talk about worlds worlds
are things that human beings invent to talk about the wave function of the universe in a convenient
way okay two people might decide to divide up the wave function of the universe differently as long
as they agree on what the wave function of the universe is they're fine so the question of what
is the number of worlds is just like what is the number of colors okay let's go on to fine tuning
which has been extant in in physics it's been extant in science theology discussions how do
you view the fine tuning of the universe particularly in light of quantum field theory well i think
that the word fine tuning gets bounced around in at least two very very different senses very often
in the popular discourse it has something to do with life right that the universe is finally
tuned to allow for the existence of life but physicists will often use the word fine tuning
in a way that has nothing to do with life just to say that certain parameters like the mass of the
Higgs boson for example in our equations seem to be represented by adding up many different numbers
and the many different numbers are individually much bigger than the some of them that you get
for the Higgs boson and that's not impossible because some of the numbers are positive and some
of the numbers are negative but somehow they cancel out to give you a much smaller number than you
would expect and that's fine tuning to a physicist so i think that the fine tuning problems of physics
are important clues when we're moving forward to try to understand the laws of physics better
whether or not they have anything to do with life i would not be competent to talk about
and therefore your your feelings that nobody is is is competent to talk about that in in in a
fundamental sense well i'm all in favor of talking about it but be remaining humble that we don't know
the definition of life the conditions under which life started the total set of other possible
laws of physics that would allow for life or anything like that yeah and when we talk about
life that's sort of the end result i mean we're talking about structure to begin with why is
there any structure at all that seems to be fine tuned that if various parameters would be off by
some argument what it would be you wouldn't be able to have any structure at all everything would
collapse into a black hole or would or would fly apart without structure uh and why we we have this
so-called fine tuning so the question is from a quantum field theory point of view is there any
color that one can bring to that kind of question i don't think that quantum field theory really
tells us that much specifically about why and where and how complex structures can evolve
it gives us the basic ingredients out of which those complex structures evolve i will tell you
that i have a feeling that a lot of people are too quick to say that if conditions were different
complex structures would not be able to evolve because guess what we're very familiar with our
conditions and i don't think that i could hand most people the standard model of particle physics
and they would successfully predict the periodic table of the elements much less life and stars
and things like that so again i just want to be humble about the question if things were different
would we even be able to imagine life coming into existence i'm just not used to uh in our
conversations uh humility from either one of us so it's a little gotta gotta grow in your life
right try out new things put on new hats i'll take you as a role model and try to follow
your humility uh uh attracting uh persona um let's go to some basic closer to truth kinds
of questions we've talked about it before um we like to ask the question what exists by which we
mean what are the fundamental irreducible categories of reality as few as possible that are irreducible
yeah i mean of course i wish i knew the answer to that but my best guess is a quantum wave function
obeying the schrodinger equation i think that people get a little confused because they will
then want to know well a wave function of what when we're taught quantum mechanics those of us
who went through physics uh educations you start with you know a classical system here's a harmonic
oscillator here's the electromagnetic field and then you quantize it and you get a quantum theory
of that and i think that's a little bit misleading because nature doesn't work that way nature starts
quantum mechanical from the beginning and so my best guess as the fundamental thing that exists
is some kind of quantum state obeying some kind of schrodinger equation of course what
exact kind we're still trying to figure out the other question we ask is why is there
something rather than nothing why anything at all and i can put it in a different way is uh uh there
are uh are there brute facts beyond which we cannot uh proceed even in principle and if so
what is in that category of brute fact yeah i'm like 99 sure that there are brute facts and the
existence of the universe itself is one of them but i don't know exactly which facts are brute
facts and which ones are explicable i would like to be able to understand why the laws of physics
look the way they do but as in terms of why the universe exists i think that will probably
just turn out to be an ill-formed question i think that there's no such thing as the reason
why the universe exists okay that's been great shaw and i i loved it again i recommend the book
for everyone who really wants to understand um uh quantum mechanics and quantum field theory is the
foundation for all these kind of fun questions so now we we and i have a couple of uh uh short
questions and these are designed for stream of consciousness just give me a very quick answer
whatever comes to your mind so the first one is uh what do you think the best theory is to
integrate quantum mechanics and general relativity spacetime emerging from entanglement in the wave
function question two uh roughly how long do you think it'll be how many years will it be
to get a general consensus on a theory of everything whether it's it's uh what you just said in terms
of integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity or some other theory i mean do you
think this would be what happened in in in our lifetimes i'll say between 50 and 100 years okay
here's question three on a scale of one to ten your confidence level that the many world's
interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct and real nine point five and next on a scale of one
to ten your confidence level that the standard model of cosmology cosmic inflation the big bang
while it will certainly be refined but it will not be overthrown well i would say nine point nine
but i do not include inflation in the standard model that's a speculation okay uh last one on a
scale of one to ten your confidence level that the physical world is all there is that there is
no thing that is not physical nine point nine nine okay well your humility may have increased
since we began speaking but your opinion of the non-physical has not changed uh we can give you
consistency as well as humility once i once again i love the book everybody can learn a great deal
from it i liked how you actually concluded that to understand the particles were made of the forces
that how we interact is one of humanity's greatest achievements and you have this very
beautiful line at the end we can all be a little proud of that so i i love that thanks very much
i mean technically i concluded with an appendix where i talk about four yeh transforms but you're
being very nice to talk about the poetic side of the last chapter we want to give a little bit of
the soft side yeah good once again a quantum fields indeed the entire uh shon's entire series the
biggest ideas in the universe has my highest recommendation viewers can watch shon's 27 videos
and a tv episodes on closer to truth and over 1500 videos on cosmology and physics especially
their meaning and implications not all of which shon would agree with uh on the closer to truth
