Well this year has been strange as far as weather down here in Louisiana. We've had some
severe weather during the spring, during the summer, during the fall, and it's getting kind of crazy
here in the winter too. I don't know. It's like the world is coming to an end right? All this
climate change or whatever. It's for real I guess. But anyway today I wanted to talk to you guys about
evolving as a Linux user because sometimes people ask me how I ended up on things like
Arch Linux or Vim or Emacs or how did I get into the terminal and things like that. And
no one of the things with Linux. There's typically two types of users. There's those that
they just want to install something quick and easy and use it as is. They never want to look under
the hood and figure out how it works. And then there's the other group of Linux users that is
the tinkers. They do want to know how everything works. They want to take things apart and put
it back together again. And because you know Linux is full of these nerds that like to tear
things down and build it again. And that's why so many of us gravitate toward I guess not user-friendly
distributions like Arch Linux and the hundreds of distros based on Arch Linux or Gen2 and the
various distributions based on Gen2 and things like that Slackware. And you know that that's okay
if you're not there yet. I think a lot of people when they first come to Linux
they install Ubuntu or Linux Mint and then you know they I guess feel intimidated by
those that have gotten past the point of needing to use something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. And
it's not it's really not about elitism or arrogance or anything like that. Many of us use Arch Linux
is because for what we do using Arch or an Arch based Linux distribution is much much easier for us
than using something like Ubuntu or Linux Mint or OpenSusa. Why is that? Well when you're new
you're not going to be doing a lot of crazy things right like compiling your own software doing
extreme customizations of your desktop or window manager and things like that. Typically you just
want something that's really easy and quick to install and looks good out of the box and then
you're not going to touch it you know when you're a brand new user and that's okay. Once you get more
advanced though you really want to build your own system right and it becomes very limiting when you
use something like Ubuntu or Mint you know as opposed to something like Arch Linux because
let's take Ubuntu for example. Ubuntu comes with its own very customized GNOME desktop environment
and if you want to hack on it a little bit and change things it's tough. Ubuntu makes it really
tough also their desktop and the suite of applications everything is really tightly integrated together
and sometimes you can't separate those pieces because like the Ubuntu desktop is really almost
like a meta package a collection of things and sometimes it's really hard to separate some of
the stuff you don't want on the system from the stuff you do because of just the way these
user friendly distributions are built they package things in such a way it's really again it's
designed for the brand new user but for those of us that want to do more than just the real basics
Ubuntu is hard it's frustrating to use I mean it's it I save so much time using
Arch based distributions compared to Ubuntu because unlike Ubuntu and Mint and SUSA you know
Arch Linux has no they don't they don't have a dog in the fight as far as what they do with their
desktop environments if you want a desktop environment or a window manager you install the
one you choose it's not going to be themed or customized in any way unless you do it and
a lot of new users think well that's crazy I've got to put in all this work once I install this
window manager desktop environment yeah but you know that's that's what some of us signed up for
plus you only really have to do it one time you set up your window manager the way you want save
the configs and you always have your own configs after that it's always your desktop environment
if you will that you always reinstall there's no reason to to go to something like Ubuntu and
have to fight Ubuntu trying to take things apart and put it back together the way you want and
that's one of the real things about Arch Linux that's why the Arch philosophy they talk about
Arch Linux being simple right Arch Linux the Arch philosophy is all about simplicity and a lot of
people think well that's Arch is not simple because it's not user friendly well simple doesn't mean
user friendly simple means everything is simple by design right all the pieces have been separated
you know until they're smallest components basically and you pick and choose the parts you
want and you build that thing the way you want to make it look I think another reason that Arch
Linux is great is because it's rolling release right rolling release has really caught on when I
started in Linux you know 12 13 years ago as far as desktop use rolling releases were seen as kind of
a niche nobody took them seriously nobody thought they were quote stable you didn't see people running
them on a server ever like that was unheard of and really people are starting to come around to
the idea of rolling releases being the better model as opposed to static release distributions
I think Arch Linux has really changed the game there I think I think there's a reason why you're
seeing Ubuntu Ubuntu's popularity is starting to seriously decline people don't talk about it as
much I don't talk about it that often really unless Ubuntu has a big release I don't talk about it
much on the YouTube channel why there's really not much to say about it that's not that's not where
all the innovation is happening these days that's not where the action is the action is really these
days Arch right Arch dominates the desktop Linux world all the Arch based distributions Manjaro
is exploding in popularity Arco Linux is exploding in popularity mainstream Arch even though it's a
command line incidental you know is exploding in popularity there is a ton of people giving
Arch Linux a serious try that otherwise wouldn't have say five and definitely 10 years ago some
of the other benefits of Arch Linux you know why it has gained ground over things like Ubuntu and
Debian and Mint is their pragmatic stance as far as the repository of software you know Arch Linux
does not mind putting proprietary software in its repositories so they they are not free software
only purists now I'm a free software zealot but even I as a free software zealot don't mind them
having proprietary software available for their users in their repositories what I hate is Linux
distributions that install proprietary software out of the box on those distributions you know and
basically they're trying to force proprietary software on their users I don't like that but I
don't mind proprietary software being in the repos available for those that need it and want to use
it because not everybody cares about the free software movement I get that so I actually like
the pragmatic stance that Arch Linux takes in that regard and again I think that helps with
Arch Linux becoming so popular is the fact that there's so much software available on Arch Linux
that is tougher to get you know even on things like Ubuntu there's there's stuff that I install
that you know I have no problems installing on Arch Linux because I know I can find it
in the arch repositories or in the AUR the arch user repository or with Arch Linux you also have
flat packs snaps app images available if you want to use them and that's the other thing
they're not forced on you either with Ubuntu snap is pre-installed you're expected to use
with Linux Mint they have flat pack installed and you're expected to use flat packs well with
Arch Linux nothing is installed if you want to use snaps install it and set it up you're free to do
so same thing with flat pack if you want to use flat pack install it use it you're free to do so
but they don't care if you use it they don't care if you don't use it and I think that's the better
model I think again I think we're starting to see this real shift in desktop Linux where
really what used to be in a Ubuntu dominated game is really now dominated by Arch Linux and I love
it I love it because Arch Linux of course is a community distribution too it's not corporate
backed there's no company really calling the shots it's all about us the community building
something great and I think it's a model that that works anyway that's a enough of me rambling and
walking around here in the snow I I don't even know what in the hell I was going to talk about
when I turned on the camera I just started walking around and talking I hope some of this
incoherent myths that I said make sense at least when I put it on YouTube if it doesn't I do
apologize but you got to understand it's about 20 degrees right now and I am freezing my balls off
all right guys peace
