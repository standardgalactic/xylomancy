How are you doing? It's been such a, it's been a long time. It's, it's been a while.
Yeah, it's been a while. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm continuing to improve. It's, you know, this,
um, I, the long COVID really did a number on me. So I'm still, still recovering. It's
been years, but I'm still recovering. But a couple of doctors contacted me, um,
from Australia and said that they, they thought from my symptoms, they heard me on a podcast
and they said they thought from my symptoms that the heart wasn't the primary thing that
had been attacked, but it was my gut that the, um, the virus is a bacteriophage and that it
destroyed the, the bacteria that produce GABA and serotonin and other calming kinds of things and,
and promoted bacteria that produce amines that sort of overdrive the heart and lead to the failure
that I had. And so that's, so they put me on this really strict diet, vegetables and, and no,
basically almost no, it's almost like a total no carb kind of diet.
See, has that, has that, have you seen an impact?
Yeah, it's completely changed my gut and I, I actually, it's making a huge difference. So,
so this is, I mean, the virus attacks you wherever I guess you're weak. Um,
and it got me in the gut and the heart.
Excuse me. I'm glad you're doing better though. It's, uh, it's always great to
to know someone's doing better. And I mean, we need you out there to continue doing such great work.
Well, thank you. And then we need you to continue to do this great podcast and,
and of course the medical work that you do.
Thanks so much, Don. I mean, we've covered so much. We've chatted twice already and
both times we went through various different aspects of all your work.
In the first podcast, we spoke about user interface theory of perception.
We spoke about conscious realism. We touched on conscious agents,
but in the second one, we went very in depth conscious agents in the subatomic world.
We went into that paper. We dissected people loved it, by the way.
Yeah. And that's been, it's, it's been quite a hit for this podcast. I thought,
let me curate a bunch of questions from the audience. So far from the first two,
we're trying to do each of them. But before we do that, I think
since conscious agents of the subatomic world, what's happened since,
because I'm assuming you guys are having a lot of fun. And it's always exciting to
when someone jumps and gets outside the box to know what's, what's really outside the box.
That's right. So we have made a couple, for me, very fun discoveries.
So one has to do with the notion of observation. What does it mean to observe?
What will it mean in our theory to, for one system to observe another?
In, you know, classical physics, the observer is not much mentioned. And if they're mentioned
at all, they're assumed to be objective and don't really interfere at all with whatever it is that
they're, so they, they don't disturb whatever they're observing. In quantum mechanics,
there isn't a theory of the observer, but, but it's, it's known that, you know, somehow the
measurement process is a destructive process. I mean, things are different when you measure than,
you know, when you don't. And so there, there's this feeling that, you know, the observer has to
play a role, but it's not formalized, right? The, the measurement is formalized, you know,
it's some kind of, there is a formalization there in terms of positive operator value
measures and so POVMs and so forth. But, but, you know, even someone like Chris Fuchs who's
saying, you know, that the, that quantum mechanics is really just a description for the agent,
how it should update their beliefs in, in light of experimental data and so forth.
But when you ask him, so, so what is your theory of the agent? He says, I don't know
you a theory of the agent. I'm just telling you that quantum mechanics is the manual that the
agent should use. And I don't know what an agent is. And I respect, I mean, you can't do everything.
And he's doing quantum mechanics, and he's not doing the agent. He's not doing the observer.
But he does say that the agent's important. So, so then in our theory, then, you know,
the question comes front and center, because we're talking about conscious agents all the
way down. So we, we, we can't avoid. So when we talk about a measurement, we have to actually have
a theory of what does it mean for one system of conscious agents to make a measurement on
another system of conscious agents, right? What does that mean? And we use, so I have to be a
little technical to, to explain the idea. I'll try to be as untechnical as possible. But we use
Markovian kernels. So a Markovian kernel basically says, suppose you have
a system that, that can see three colors, red, green, and blue. Now that's what it experiences.
There's a kernel we call the qualia kernel that describes the sequence of color experiences that
the observer might have. So maybe if I see red now, the probability is that the next time I see
a color, it'll be green, but maybe it's, maybe it's half. And it's also a third that I'll see
blue, but it's also, you know, whatever is left over, probably that I'll see red. So I can say
for, for each color I'm now experiencing, what is the probability of the next color I might
experience? And you can, so when you write down a matrix, a table of all those probabilities,
in mathematics, we call that a Markov kernel. And it's actually a linear operator.
And, and you can actually study the properties of a linear operator. You can rotate vectors,
it can exchange, you expand and contract vectors, it can do all sorts of things.
So, so that's the, one of the models we're using to represent observers and the conscious
experiences that what they have. What we discovered was, and this is a new contribution
to Markov chain theory, apparently, to the mathematics of it, is that,
well, first, first, what I'm about to say is not a new contribution, it's a standard notion,
but we're going to use it for the, for the new contribution. If you take one Markov chain,
like it has three colors, and you've got the Markov chain on it, but then you say, what,
what if I, you know, don't look at the red, I don't care when the red, I'm only going to look
at the green and blue. And I'm going to look at those two colors. What Markov chain gets induced
on those two colors from the bigger Markov chain and red, green and blue, right? There's
some probability of going from red, green, blue. But what happens if I only can see the green and
the blue, I'll get some chance, you know, if I'm, if I see green now that I'll see blue next,
for a C green now, I'll see green next. So, so I can actually, you can intuitively, you can say,
well, yeah, you should be able to induce a Markov chain on the smaller number of states, right?
But it would somehow respect the bigger, the bigger Markov chain, right? So that's the idea
of a trace, it's called a trace chain. Well, what we proved, this is work with Chaitan Prakash.
So he and I worked on this together. And what we found is that the relationship of being a trace
chain to another Markov chain is a partial order. That means that we found a, this is an entire
logic on the space of all Markov chains, all Markov kernels. And so this is a brand new logic.
One chain entails another if it's a trace chain of the other. That's, that's, so I can, the actual
definition is simple. Once I've told, I can actually say the def, so one Markov chain P
is less than or equal to Markov chain Q if and only if P is a trace chain of Q.
And you can prove that that is actually a partial order. And it's a logic. So it's actually a logic
on the space of all Markov chains. It's not Boolean. It's more general than Boolean. It's more
general than quantum logics, ortho-complimented lattices. This is more, it's more general than that.
It's locally Boolean. So every particular Markov kernel, if you look at all the ones that are
less than it, all the ones that, that are less than it, they form a Boolean logic. So this is a
locally Boolean logic of observation. And then we proved that this, if you take,
so by the way, then this is our notion of observation. If one observer's
kernel or Markov chain is less than or equal to another, then it observes the bigger chain.
So that's, so that's how you, that's what, so notice our notion of observation is not this
objective. You're, you're outside the system. No, no, you're, you're immersed in it. You are part
of the system. You're an integral part of the system that you're observing. So, so at the top
level, that's the take home from this. Our theory of observation is the observer is no scientist
that's separate from everything and not involved in anything and completely separate and can't,
and can be ignored. No, no, no, no, you are intimately part of the system and you must be
understood to get a real theory of observation in science. You have to understand what an agent is
and how it's embedded in the systems that it's observing. And this is, this gives a mathematical
logic for doing that. So it's really, we're pretty excited, but, but then each Markov chain,
if, if, if you have Markov chains that are like recurrent communicating class, so they're in
some sense, they're nice, they're nice Markov chains. I'll just use the word nice as a non-technical
term, but I gave you the technical for those who want the technical recurrent communicating,
one current communicating class. They have been a probability measure that tells you long term,
what are the probabilities of the different states that you'll see? Like, what was the
probability of seeing red? Maybe long term, you see red a third of the time, blue two thirds of
the time and green, you don't see hardly at all. Maybe, maybe that's the long term problem. That's
called the stationary measure of the Markov chain. And so it turns out that when you have a big
measure and then a trace, sorry, a big chain and a trace chain, that the stationary measure of the
trace chain is exactly the restriction of those, of the, of the stationary measure of the bigger
chain to the, that subset of states. In other words, it's all compatible. So you have a big
measure for the stationary measure of the, of the big guy, and maybe three of the states are what
you trace on. Well, if you look at the, the big guy's probability measure on those three states,
that's exactly what you get on the little guy, just renormalize so that it's a probability
measure. You have to renormalize it so it's probability. So all of these stationary measures
are, they follow through this logic. And so it turns out this then means that there's this, this
logic that we discovered on probability measures that I published 30 years ago.
And it's, it's, I published it with Bruce Bennett, who's, he's now dead, but a brilliant
mathematician. And Parish Murthy, who was a graduate student of mathematics. So it's two
mathematicians and a flunky me working on this. And, and what we published it in the Journal of
Math Psych. And what we, what we proved is that there was a logic on probability measures where
one probability measure implies another or entails another probability measure, if and only if
it's a normalized restriction. So I get the bigger probability measure. I take a subset
of its states, renormalize the probability on that. And that's the probability of this guy down here.
It turns out that's, so it's a simple idea. I'm just a normalized restriction of the bigger
measure, but then I, that's the implication relation. And that gives you a non Boolean logic.
That it's, it's, there's no global compliment, just like in the, by the way, this trace logic,
there's no global compliment. Okay. Locally, there is, because you have a local Boolean
logic, but globally not. So it turns out, this last thing I'm about to say, we haven't proven yet,
but we're going to try to do that. There's a homomorphism of the logics, that the trace
logic is essentially homomorphic to the, what we call the Lebesgue logic on probability measures.
So this gives us, the trace logic gives us a formal theory of observation. And the Lebesgue
logic of probability measures gives us a formal mirror theory of probabilistic belief.
And so putting them together with this homomorphism shows how observations are formally related to
probabilistic beliefs. So this is for us, a major breakthrough in terms of the formalism.
And, and we had to go after this because, you know, you mentioned our, our paper on the subatomic world,
you know, so conscious agents in the subatomic world. Well, we have to say what we mean when
we're talking about modeling observations of quarks and gluons inside the proton. What, what do we
mean? Well, so now we have this, we, we mean that we're going to be positing some bigger Markov chain
and our observations will be some trace chains, right, of that bigger chain. And the trace chain
will have two, two ways that it's doing this observation. One is the number of states that
is tracing on, right? So that's going to be one parameter. The more states you trace on, in some
sense, the better spatial resolution you've got, right? Right? So the, so if I have, you know,
if my big chain has 1000 states, that would be a very big chain, at least for my computer.
And suppose I have a trace chain that's only 10 states versus another one that's 100 states,
first and other one, that's 500 substates of the big chain, right? The one that's 500 substates is,
in some sense, a higher resolution observation than the one that only has, you know, 50 states,
the 50 state one is observing the big one, the big 1000 state one is, it is observing it, but not
nearly with the resolution of the, you know, 500 statement. Almost like quantifying that sort of
objective. It gives you complete quantification. And for the physicists, this would be our
quantification of what they call Q squared, which is their technical thing for spatial resolution.
It's tied to the amount of energy that they use. I mean, higher energy leads to better spatial
resolution. So what we're basically now doing is identifying higher energies with greater spatial
resolution in our trace chains, which is that that itself is a non-trivial statement.
There's a lot, there's a lot that said there, obviously, because it's very complex and a lot
of people find it very difficult. I've noticed a lot of people find your theory so fascinating and
want to jump on board so badly, but the math and the physics become so complicated that they just
can't do it. And the only way I can is when, is by first, obviously chatting to you, watching,
reading your content, but then chatting to friends or physicists, trying to get their opinion on all
of this and trying from their perspective to understand what you're talking about. And the
more I do, the easier it gets, it gets to sort of understand it. But I still feel left in the dark
knowing that you have access to more information based on the base of knowledge you have within
physics and mathematics. Have you felt that it's a bit of a struggle to try and get this out there
because of the complexity of this topic? Do you feel people find that you're hiding behind these
sort of fancy words? Because I've noticed a lot of people comment about that saying that, okay,
once you mention decorated permutations, or once you mention Mark of Blankets,
you're just trying to sound smart. But that's not the case, because when I chat to my physicists,
friends, they seem to know what you're talking about a lot better than the layman.
If someone thinks that, I mean, we have a paper called Fusions of Consciousness. So you can just
go look at the paper Fusions of Consciousness. And we don't just mention the word decorated
permutation, we actually create a new mathematics of decorated permutations for Markov chains.
So it's not just handwaves. I only talk about it because we're using it, and we're using it to
good purpose. I'll put a link to Fusions of Consciousness. And I think that one came out in
January, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, in January, that's right. So I'll just mention that. So I
agree with what you're saying that it's difficult. And I try to talk about this stuff in a way that's
generally accessible. But the problem is, of course, if you do that, then people say, well,
it's not serious. And if you do it seriously, then I can't understand it. He's just throwing out
these technical words. So it's a catch 22. But my attitude is what, I do get potential graduate
students. And this is one reason why I do these podcasts. And I'm interested in getting young
people who are young enough that they can start to learn the math and make contributions, get them
excited and get them studying this stuff. I spent an hour and a half with one student,
potential student yesterday talking about and gave her a bunch of math to read. And so that's
what I'm doing it for, is to actually get graduate students working on their PhDs in this field.
That's my goal. I've noticed someone else who has this problem, because when I chat,
it's Carl Friston. When I chatted to Carl, and we spoke about his approach to the free energy
principle, he has exactly the same issue. He's often accused of hiding behind fancy talk, they
sort of say. So you really are stuck between a rock and a hard place. How do you dumb down
something that is so complex? Do you find that there's a specific way you think that's
best to approach it so far? Have you hacked the code yet? Well, for communicating it,
probably the best approach that I've seen so far to get people to take this idea seriously,
to not just dismiss it, is to point out the failure of physicalist theories.
Right. Some of them might say, look, the brain does it. Forget all this stuff about
consciousness and so forth. Look at all the physicalist theory. It's clear we have all
these neural correlates of consciousness. We're almost there. We've got lots of neural
correlates of consciousness. We have all these nice integrated information theory. We have
orchestrated collapse of quantum states and microtubules. We have attention to schema theory.
There's IIT. I think I already mentioned integrated information. So there's just a
bunch of these. Oh, global workspace theory is another big one. So global workspace theory.
So why do we need someone who's clearly often moving the land and talking to
saying consciousness is fundamental and so forth? And so for me, the thing that I think
is the most grabbing thing to say is if you ask any of these theorists,
proponents of these theories, okay, integrated information theory. This is the theory about
conscious experiences. Okay. So you're starting with some substrate. Maybe it's physical or
some other substrate. And you have this causal architecture that's got the right pattern of
integrated information. And you're saying that that will explain the qualia of specific
conscious experiences, color green, the taste of chocolate, the smell of garlic,
the experience of auditory space versus the experience of visual space or the experience
of haptic space as conscious experiences. So which, so clearly you've been at this for
a couple of decades. So you must have a whole bunch of conscious experiences that you can now say
this is the pattern of integrated information that must be the taste of chocolate. So give me,
what have you got? Zero. And you go to every theory and you ask them, so what have you got?
How many qualia have you given me the global workspace architecture for or the orchestrated
collapse of quantum states with normal microtubules or integrated information,
what they call the Q shape? How many do you have? Zero in every case. So we have these
theories that have been out there for decades, decades now, that are batting zero. And I'm saying
they're batting zero for principled reasons. Space time, the physicists, the high energy
theoretical physicists are telling us space time is not fundamental and reductionism is false.
These theories are failing because they're not listening to modern high energy theoretical
physicists that are telling us that that game is over. We're playing an old game. It's like
someone after Einstein trying to play the Newtonian game in understanding chemistry. Yes.
Good luck. You can't understand chemistry using Newton. You have to use quantum mechanics. I'm
sorry. I shouldn't have said Einstein, so there's some quantum theory.
Don, before you move on from that, because one of the questions from the audience,
so I gathered a bunch from YouTube, Twitter, et cetera. Unfortunately, sometimes I forgot to
actually write on the person's name. So I've just left them all out together. So I'm just going to
ask you them at random. But one of the questions was directed at one of your statements, because
you've said this before, you talk about the taste of chocolate, you talk about the smell of garlic.
This person says that whatever you mentioned, those specific states, they want to know,
why do you want such a direct portion of consciousness? So let's say when you're
asking for that qualitative, qualia experience of the taste of chocolate, why go after a specific
state? Because everything in the mind is so blurry, so mismatched, there's so much going on,
there's so much, let's say, heuristics involved. Wouldn't that be a bad approach to trying to
provide proof of a theory? Well, all I'm doing is saying to the people who are offering these
theories, like the integrated information theory or global workspace, whatever, they're the ones
that are saying, we will start with neural activity or this Q shape, and we will give you
conscious experiences. We will give you these experiences. I'm saying, okay,
that's what you're promising to do. So I'm just asking you, since that's what you said you're
going to do, I'm just asking you, how is it going? And by the way, I asked Julia Tononi this back
in late 1990s, he came to UC Irvine to our Helmholtz Club meeting, and I asked him that,
and he didn't have any then, and I asked him a few years ago in Canada at a conference,
asked him again, and he admitted he needed to offer one, and he couldn't. And same thing with
Stuart Hameroff, I mean, I had him at a conference in front of 400, 500 people, I asked him, so
Stuart, how's it going? I mean, you're promising that we'll start with these orchestrated collapses
and you'll give us specific conscious experiences. So that's what you claim that you're doing. So how
many conscious experiences have you nailed down? And I had to push him for three or four minutes
before he finally said, because he was hemming and humming, and I said, no, no, no, Stuart,
give me one. No, Stuart, give me one. And he finally said, no, I can't give you one. So I'm just,
now, if they want to say, you know, we have these wonderful theories, integrated information theory,
and they have nothing to do with the taste of chocolate and the smell of garlic, fine,
then I won't ask you the question. But if they do say that, then, hey, the science is science,
where's the beef? So that's, that's why I do it. Don, I'm curious about your opinion.
What was it about? It was about two months ago, I think, about the IIT.
Suare, I mean, that was such a major issue within the philosophy community here,
and science community in general. What were your thoughts on that? Just for the context for the
listeners, it's the whole debacle where IIT was accused of being pseudoscience. Right.
That's right. And when I looked at the letter that was put out there and the references that
they gave, one of the things they referenced was Michael Graziano on a paper of his on
attentional schema theory, where it basically says theory of consciousness is either mechanical
or it's magical. And so the signers of that were basically signing on to look at theory of
consciousness is either mechanical and presumably neuro mechanical, but maybe AI kind of mechanical,
but, but most of them are thinking neuro mechanical, right? Or it's magical. And so what, what,
so the argument is that IIT is claiming some kind of substrate independence. There is a substrate,
so that it doesn't say that consciousness is fundamental. It says there is a substrate to
consciousness, but the substrate might not be physical. Of course, they're, they're thinking
it's physical, right? That's, I mean, I'll ask them, so what is, so how many non physical
substrates are you, you know, have you concentrated everything? So what are you going to say,
ectoplasm? I don't know what the, so, so, but anyway, they're, they're, they're saying that
there's a substrate, but they're not committed to a neural put it this way. There's not necessarily
a neural substrate. It could be some kind of computational architecture that's completely
non-neural. So, so I don't think they're going non physical, but they could be going non-neural.
And so that means that they're, they're dealing with something that is, it looks like a disembodied
mathematical causal structure, right? Although the IIT people would of course say it has to be
instantiated and something. So the substrate is, is, is important.
But somehow they think that because it's not, they're not tying,
they're not starting with neurons. They're not starting with, with neural circuitry or something
like that and trying to show that that leads to consciousness. They're starting with something
more abstract and not necessarily mechanical. It's not like this fires and that fires and
we have this circuit and so forth. It's more abstract mathematical kind of thing. So I'm
just trying to explain the kind of, get in the heads of the people that are there worried about
this. They're, and so they're, they're concerned about that. Now my, my attitude is I think that
all of these theories have the problem that I just mentioned, which is there's no beef. There's no,
no success in, in the, in terms of specific conscious experiences. And, and what's happened is
all the physicalists, I think that they're starting to understand that they're not, they're,
they have nothing in terms of concrete conscious experiences that they can explain
without hand wave. They're zero. They're forming a circular firing squad.
Right. They're, they're shooting at each other and, and everybody's vulnerable to the, the,
the objections that I just gave. The objection is you claim that you'll start with integrated
information or I start with, you know, higher order theory. Now, now we're doing the neural
stuff. Higher order theories or first order theories or global workspace theory. And I'm
going to give you specific conscious experiences. Which one? Oh, I can't give you any right now.
How long we've been doing this? Decades. We've been doing this for decades and can't give me one.
So, so at some point people get impatient and go, you know,
no, no, I should say I'm good friends. These are, these are my friends and colleagues, right?
So they're brilliant. Some of them are geniuses. All of them are brilliant and some of them are
geniuses. Why are they not making progress? There is not because they're not smart. They're
brilliant. They're, they're not making progress because we're not listening to what the high
energy theoretical physicists are telling us. Space time is doomed and reductionism is false.
We have to listen to our best current science. It was fine 30 years ago to assume that space
time is fundamental and reductionism is the way to go. In fact, it was the right approach,
given our current science at the time. But it's no longer, it's no longer feasible. It's ignoring.
It's frankly just ignoring our best science. And that's not what we want to do. So my prediction
is as soon as these brilliant colleagues and friends of mine really understand that we need
a new framework and they switch, I think all of a sudden we'll make some serious progress on this
field. And we'll look back and realize that we're in sort of the flat earth period of this field.
And as long as you assume flat earth, you can't do a space program. As soon as you let go of
flat earth, then you start to have the tools that you can, that you need to actually start
doing a space program. So you mentioned Michael Graziano. He was actually, he was the first
person I interviewed on this podcast. And this feels like ages ago. But I remember him saying
that if you take attention schema theory and you plop it on top of global workspace theory,
he believes that together it actually would provide a very complete theory of consciousness.
But I can't help but think based on the fact that he's saying that based on the fact that
they used it's either mechanical or magical. Do you think it's, it would be similar to compare
Michael's theory and global workspace, if they continue to do as well as they do separately and
maybe even together to be the Newton's theory in physics or Newtonian physics of the brain.
And then while you guys are going on sort of do the Einstein's theory of consciousness,
do you think you guys are going to approach consciousness in that sort of way?
Yeah. Now, I should be very, very clear that I think that the work that they're doing
on getting models of the neural correlates of consciousness is brilliant and useful and that
will survive, right? But it's not a theory of the generation of consciousness. It's a theory
about how we see consciousness correlated with parts of brain activity. So I'm all for that.
Now, my understanding about Graziano is at least in some of his writings, I've gotten him,
I've gotten the impression that he thinks that the conscious experiences is in some sense an
illusion. We have the, it's not, you know, there aren't really quality, but we have the illusion.
It's a character. He calls it a caricature. He actually intentionally avoids the word illusion.
Right. I care. So, so if, if, if, yeah, so if he doesn't want to use the word illusion,
Keith Frankish does. So Keith does use the word illusion. And, and if, you know, Michael wants
to use, you know, caricature, that's fine. But as a scientist, my feeling, I'll say first about the
illusion approach with, and I've said this to, I mean, Keith is a great guy. I really enjoy talking
with him. I feel he's a friend and so forth. But I've pointed this out to him and he hasn't demurred
that, you know, saying that it's an illusion doesn't get him off the hook because we now need
a scientific theory about what specific pattern of brain activity must be the illusion of the
taste of chocolate and could not be the illusion of garlic. So, so you might think, Oh, well,
now that they said it's an illusion, they don't have the problem, the problems bring up. No, no,
no, no, no, they have, you know, we have to do science here. If you're saying it's an illusion,
I want to have a precise scientific theory about why that has to be that illusion and couldn't be,
you know, the, this illusion, I would, they call it the illusion problem.
That's, that's, that's right. And I would say the same thing, you know,
from Graciano, if it's a character, then why should this particular brain activity be the
caricature of the color green and not the caricature of the color red? I mean, I want to,
again, as a scientist, I don't want to hand wave and I don't want to say because I called it
caricature, don't owe you a scientific theory. I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm not interested. I'm interested
in results. I want a theory where this is an illusion or a caricature or the real qualia.
I want a theory that gives me the beef and says this pattern must be this caricature and it
couldn't be that caricature. Otherwise, I mean, I'm philosophy is fine. I have a joint appointment
in philosophy. I love philosophy, but I'm talking science here. And so I want a scientific theory.
So, so that's sort of my attitude about that whole thing.
Yeah. And I think what I was trying to get at was it will still be very useful and it will
actually work in the sense that in, in the same way Newtonian physics works, because we still use
it. It's still very practical. It's, it's just doesn't go away. So in that sense, it will still
be very, very good at its job. I agree. And, but also you'll have some with Newton, you have some
misconceptions. You have the idea that, well, I should be able to get the position and the momentum
at the same time to arbitrary accuracy when I'm looking at stuff, right? And so,
so you're led to believe certain things. Well, that turned out to be false. And so, so the,
so the, yeah, absolutely Newton is great. If you want to send a rocket to the moon, it'll work.
And for a lot of everyday stuff, but, but sometimes it leads you into conceptual errors,
like position, momentum, like, and something like these physicalist theories, I think they will be
very, very good for the neural correlates of consciousness and so forth. But they're going
to lead to some, they are leading to what I think are fundamental errors. And I'll, I'll name one
that I think is, is a crucial error. They want to make a distinction between which circuits of the
brain or which physical objects in general are conscious, which ones are not. So they want to,
they want to use IIT in hospitals to determine whether someone's a vegetable or not. You know,
should we pull the plug or not? So that's something that you as a doctor are quite
interested in, I'm sure. And so they're making, they're making the assumption that some physical
systems are associated with consciousness and others are not. That's, that's their assumption.
Okay. Now, if, if it turns out that space time isn't fundamental and objects in space time are
not fundamental, in other words, if we listen to what the high energy theoretical physicists are
telling us, and they're saying that there are structures outside of space time, and they're
finding them like amplituhedron and decorated permutations. What is space time? It's not the
fundamental reality anymore and objects in space time or not. So now we have to understand what
is that. And so what I'm proposing is that space time and objects in space time or just a headset
just on the interface. So think about it that way. So here I'm, I'm using an interface to talk
with you. And I see, I'm using zoom, we're talking via zoom. And I see a bunch of pixels on the screen.
And I see pixels of, you know, Tevin's face. And I see also pixels of a wall behind you.
Now, I'm getting a lot of conscious input from the pixels on your face. I mean, I can see your
expression. I can see if you're interested or not. The pixels on the wall, not much. Now,
I could say, aha, so I want to have the, the, the pixel correlates of consciousness. Aha. So these
are the conscious pixels, the ones on, and those are the conscious pixels in Tevin's face. And the
ones on the wall, those are not conscious pixels. And so now I'm going to have, I'm going to have
my little mathematical model and say, these pixels are conscious and those pixels are not,
because these have some complicated pattern of interaction and those do not. Well,
that's completely wrongheaded. Pixels are pixels. Period. Some pick, and they're not conscious or
unconscious. They're, they're a merely a headset, an interface. Some pixels give me access to a
conscious consciousness behind the zoom and others don't. And, and so when you realize that, that's,
so that is a fundamental difference here. Right. If we use something like integrated
information theory, which is saying certain physical systems are conscious and others are not,
I'm saying that claim is absolutely false. And it's dangerous to assume it in, in hospital
settings. So this is the academic. Yeah. So now this goes beyond, this is very practical. This
becomes very important for us as society. And that's actually the main, when I started the podcast,
one of the, one of the description layers was this podcast's function is to show just how
difficult intellectually and practically the mind, body problems, because the moment you do
finally figure out whatever theory of consciousness you want to develop and grow, it has so many
practical implications. And in this case, I mean, you're touching on a very, very big one. I mean,
we're talking life and death of this. Absolutely. And pulling the plug or not. And, and it's,
if the foundation is so wrong that it's actually, it's at the level of saying these pixels are
conscious and these pixels are not, is that that kind of error, then we have to be very,
very careful about it. So, so, so this is not just academic anymore, saying that space time is a
headset has real, real implications, moral implications, and technological implications.
And it also has implications for the whole debate about can AIs be conscious, right? This
gives you the standard way that that's considered. And again, it brings up all sorts of moral questions
that people are worried about. But the way it's thought about is, we have a physical system
that a priori is not conscious. Somehow, if we give it the right kind of complexity,
computational complexity, it will be conscious. Well, that's exactly the same
mistake as saying if I get the right kind of complexity in the zoom pixel activity,
it'll be consciousness. No, it's not. It's just so certain zoom pixels give me a portal into
Tevin's consciousness. And other zoom pixels on my screen don't give me any portals into Tevin's
consciousness. The pixels are not conscious or unconscious. It's about the headset and how it's
engaged to what's beyond space time was outside the space time and how it's effectively or not
effectively giving us access to what's beyond space time. The whole point of a headset is to
simplify things. And at some point, you're going to simplify things so so much that you can't really
say much about it, right? When I look at you, my my interface has given me a portal into your
consciousness that's good. Not perfect. Even if you've lived with someone, you've been married to
someone for 30 years, you find out that there's things you don't know, right? So it's not a
perfect portal. But when I look at my cat, the portal is even worse. And when I look at an ant,
it's even worse. And a microbe, it's even worse. When I look at a rock, my headset is given up.
Because headsets are there to simplify things. At some point, it has to give up.
So it's not that the rock isn't. It's not that like the Tevin human body is conscious or not
conscious and the rock is conscious, not conscious. It's just that these are symbols that give us
portals into a preexisting consciousness or not. In the case of the rock, my idea is that we're
interacting with consciousness all the time. But when I see a rock, I'm not getting much insight
into the consciousness that I'm interacting with. So I'm not saying the rock is conscious,
it's not panpsychism. So I'm not, I'm not a panpsychist. Headset is a headset. Consciousness is
consciousness. I'm not saying that, you know, most panpsychists are thinking that that space
time is fundamental. Particles are fundamental. But behind the equations of physics and behind
the particles, what breathes fire into the equations and life into the particles is consciousness
inside space time. But we'll keep the same laws of physics and so forth. You know, so
consciousness is sort of almost along for the ride. But the laws of physics are really doing
all the, I'm having, I'm good friends with Philip Goff and we have good discussions on that. And
Philip has said to me that he's, he's willing to let go of space time, but we'll see, you know,
I'll push it, push to let go of that. And if he does, I think we'll be very, very close
in our views. But so, you know, I think that I think I'll just stop there.
I'm going to chat to Philip and I think Jan of Feb, I can't remember when we scheduled it,
but I'm going to ask him about this. I'm going to see how close he's gotten
to that sort of conversion. But I'm glad you're touching, as it stands, Don, you're touching
on some practical stuff at the moment. And this is what I sort of premised a lot of these questions
on, which is great, because I think that these practical implications of understanding this
headset or understanding this virtual reality, this matrix, whatever people want to call it,
it's pretty much the same thing. You are saying that this, this world we're living in is a sort
of simulation in that sense, it is a virtual reality. Some people love you using the word
matrix, just to be clear, it's not the same type of matrix as from the movie. But nevertheless,
the word matrix seems to be now synonymous with simulation in this virtual reality.
You just go to this question that I have for you. How do mental health or mental disabilities
work within this sort of framework? Does your work now give you a sort of, I know you have to now
almost become a philosopher and sort of maybe even guesstimate certain aspects of this,
because it's very difficult to go outside this box already. And to go even further beyond space
time to now give me mental health theories is going to be even more difficult. But just out of
curiosity, what is it? Is it a bug in the actual virtual reality? What's going on here?
Well,
so the way I think about it is that there's space and time and what we see in space and time is
just a headset. And behind the headset is this realm of consciousness. So that's that's another
part of the ontology that we're proposing. I'm not saying I'm right. I'm just saying I'm trying to be
precise and I've got to say something specific. So I'm saying that there's a vast social network
of conscious agents that in some sense probably are ultimately I'll realize that there's one
conscious agent and this network is just a nice analytic tool that I have to use as a scientist.
So I'll talk about there's one conscious agent, but I'm using this network because that's what
I need to use to do mathematics. So that one conscious agent, what is it up to?
And why, right? I don't know. So I guess, but one possibility is
it's a theorem that no system can ever understand itself completely.
If I have a computer system and it wants to understand itself, it has to build a model of
itself. Well, as soon as it builds a model of itself, now it's more complicated. So now to
understand itself, the new self with the model is going to have to model itself with a model
and you get in this infinite recursion. So maybe the one infinite consciousness,
which transcends any particular instantiation like a space-time instantiation or whatever,
we have three dimensions of space, one dimension of time, what about 50 dimensions of space?
In one dimension of time, I can see seven million colors. Why not 20 trillion colors?
This is just one possible form instantiation that the consciousness can use out of an infinite
potential to look at itself. So what consciousness is up to is looking at itself from different
perspectives and then losing itself in the perspective, identify. So I'm now identified
with the Hoffman body. I think I'm only, you know, I'm just that and I'm nothing more and I'm afraid
of death and the whole bit. And then slowly waking up and realizing, oh, no, no, I now know myself
because I know I'm not Hoffman. So all the stuff that I thought I was and I immersed myself
you know, both feet, I jumped in with both feet on this thing and spent 70 years, 80 years, 90 years
and then woke up. And now I know myself because I know, I know myself better because I know I'm
not that. So knowing yourself by a bunch of negations. And so now from that point of view,
the one can know itself by being a paraplegic or having, you know, Alzheimer's or you're having,
you know, any kind of mental disease you want to do some kind of nervous breakdown. I just have
nervous breakdowns all the time or whatever it might be. Or I also experienced myself as being,
you know, the world's fastest Olympic runner. And the world's Einstein. And then I'll wake up,
but I'm not that either. So in other words, essentially even behind someone who looks completely
debilitated is this infinite consciousness, just looking at itself. So in that point of view,
everything deserves equal respect. Right? So there's, there's a moral aspect to this, which
says when I see someone who has an IQ of 50, there's no difference between me and that.
When I look at my cat, is I am the same one consciousness that's also looking at me through
the cat. Those are just different avatars of the one consciousness from this point of view.
So what happens from this point of view is there is no grounds for
putting barriers between me and anybody else. This actually says I am that just looking at it
through a different interface. And this I think is the foundation for a genuine love that love
is recognizing is not just loving the other as yourself is recognizing that the other is yourself.
It's you, the infinite consciousness, looking at yourself through a different avatar.
Yeah, it's, it's you see this sort of play out in a lot of ancient cultures as well, where
let's say someone goes out and hunts for food, they kill the animal and they sort of pray to it,
hug it, do a sort of sing songs around it, because they know they have to eat this being that is
sort of stole part of them. And this, this is quite a, quite a recurring theme with religions,
with sort of spirituals, spiritualists. And I've noticed a lot of idealist theories in general
tend to lead to this. That's right. I didn't intend to go there. Yeah, which is quite fascinating.
I mean, I was just sort of led by, you know, if I'm going to assume that consciousness is fundamental.
And I started this one step after another, and I sort of led kicking and screaming to this. But,
but now that I've gone there, it starts to make sense. It's so counterintuitive. But, but that
counterintuitiveness might just be the, you know, the one jumped in with both feet and it let itself
get completely lost in it. In other words, if you're really going to know that you're not that,
you have to believe that you are it for a while. You really let yourself believe it and then wake
up. And then you really, you took that very, very seriously, you really understood what it meant to
be a Tevin or a Don or, you know, Michael Graziano or whoever it might be, you know, you learned what
it meant to be that. And you realized, I'm not that I am this consciousness that transcends that.
It's like when Bernardo talks about this dissociated altars, I mean, off a universal mind,
Bernardo Castro, when he says, it's pretty much the same thing, that universal mind. And we're
just these avatars or dissociated altars of the same sort of entity. There is a separation here at
all. That's right. So I'm pretty much on the same page with Bernardo on most things. One little
wrinkle that we add though, and it may not be just a little wrinkle is that this trace logic that I
mentioned at the start is the first formal structure I found outside of space time about the
structure of the one. And it's a non-bullion logic. And there's no global complement. So this is the
first hint I've gotten of a structure. And I'm not saying that this is the final word about the
structure of the one. Absolutely not. But it's the first baby step. And the first baby step
in terms of a mathematical model of, quote, unquote, God, of the one is already blowing my
mind because it's not clear what the word one even means. If this thing is not a boolean logic,
there is no one top Markovian kernel. So I use the word one. But right now, when I use it,
already my math is telling me, Don, you're going to have to think deeper that the word one doesn't,
whatever kind of unity that is, is not a trivial unity. And it's not a boolean logic by any means.
So what do you mean by the one? So already the math, I might be using the same words that
religious people are using have used for thousands of years. But already the math is telling me this
goes way, way deeper than I'd ever imagined. And probably way deeper than the human mind
because of the interface limitations we have, could ever understand.
Because that's another one of my questions at some point. I mean, how far do you think you're
going to get, Don, knowing that we are limited, in essence, and we're never really,
we never really evolved the capability to perceive truth. I mean, we know the difference
between proofs and truths, the verticality. How close do you really think that this will take you?
Well,
I'm sorry, I was going to say that's always a tough question. I mean, when we know that
we're so limited, it's so difficult for us to really go beyond anything further and deeper.
Does that ever keep you up at night? Well,
I think about it quite a bit. I tried to do it during the day.
But here's one important aspect of it, though, and that is what is the nature of scientific
theory building? What are scientific theories? What do we mean by scientific theory? A theory
in science says, please grant me these assumptions. And if you grant me these assumptions, and I can
make them mathematically precise, so I'll make these assumptions mathematically precise,
then I can derive and predict all these wonderful things.
And if you do it right, the mathematical description of the theory will tell you the
scope of those assumptions, how much that they can really do, their power, and it'll also tell
you the limits, like Einstein's special theory and general theory relativity. They tell you this
great scope of the mathematics tells you it's incredible, it predicts black holes, and then
all of a sudden, it's amazing that it works really well. It also tells you when you combine it with
Einstein's contribution to quantum theory, E equals H nu, you combine that with that, it tells you
that space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. So it tells you that Einstein's theory
is beautiful theory, it tells you the scope and the limits. 10 to the minus 33, that theory dies.
10 to the minus 43 seconds, it's over. So now you might say, well, of course, that's true of any
theory, but I can now give you a deeper theory that explains those assumptions of the theory that
you just, so I'll give you a deeper theory. Absolutely, you can always get a deeper theory,
but your new deeper theory will have its own assumptions. And this goes on ad infinitum.
So my take on it is science is one of the best tools we have. I'm doing science, I love science.
And science, after billions and billions of years, if we continue to do it for billions
and billions of years, the fraction of knowledge that we would have about reality
is precisely measure zero, right? Precisely measure zero. And yet, we have to do it.
We can never, with science, write a theory of everything. So when we talk about a theory of
everything, real scientists do it with a wink and a nod. It's a theory of everything so far,
and so far is pretty trivial. So I think it's in principle the case that scientific theories
can never be a theory of everything, but they can tell us their limits. That's what's powerful
about science. The theories of science tell us their limits, like the theory of evolution by
natural selection actually entails that space-time isn't fundamental. And Einstein's theory of
space-time entails that space-time isn't fundamental. These theories tell you their limits, right?
Because evolution by natural selection, the way Darwin was thinking about it, is talking about
organisms in space and time, competing for resources in space and time. And when you look
at evolutionary game theory, it tells you that the very categories of space and time and objects
are not the fundamental reality. Those are just headset categories. So it tells you its limits.
I think what our theories do that's essential is they do tell us truths about the particular
perspective that our headset gives us. So science can give us truths about our headset.
There's an infinite reality of consciousness that transcends any scientific theory.
But we can look at different perspectives on that, different possible headsets. Right now,
all of science has been looking at a particular space-time headset, three dimensions of space,
one dimension of time, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, it's over with. It's a fairly cheap headset.
We thought it was the final reality. It just turned out to be a knockoff cheap headset.
But now we've learned the tools inside the headset. We studied the headset, we thought we were
studying the truth, it was just the headset. But now we have the tools, we can step outside the
headset and imagine other headsets. And that's all my theory of conscious agency is. It's just
a projecting model of consciousness. There's no longer taking space-time as fundamentals,
taking consciousness as fundamental, but I'm recognizing I can never get a theory of the
ultimate consciousness. Let me start off with little networks of conscious agents because
I can model that. And that's just going to be a projection at best of the deeper reality.
So every question you ask, I mean, the answer is not trivial.
We, science can never get a theory of everything, but we can get good theories of projections of
reality. And then just to put a spiritual twist on it. But you are that reality, you are
from this point of view. And in some sense, you can know it firsthand by just letting go of any
theory and letting go of it and just being. So when you just sit in meditation, that is the
closest you're going to get to what transcends any scientific theory.
It's incredible because you, because I obviously, I've chatted to you many times and I know how
you think and I can tell, well, I don't know exactly how you think, but I know how science
minded you are and how much it must perhaps annoy you when you're clumped into categories of thinkers
when you are actively doing science. Because I know that there are many people I've spoken to
on this channel who have the same problem. The moment you step outside any sort of status quo,
you're automatically grouped together as either some sort of a hippie scientist or a spiritualist
thinker. And they give you these labels that I think are unwarranted and for the most part,
unfair. And someone who has a similar issue is Thomas Campbell. Because when I spoke to him,
your theories are very similar. And one of the questions I wrote down here, and he
really hates this because he's trying his best to not be associated with any form of religion,
sort of dogma, because he does try and explain things outside of the realm of what we say,
quote unquote, is normal. The question I have here is, and this is not from me, this is from one of
the viewers. Where does Thomas Campbell's theory start and Donald Hoffman's theory end? They're
just trying to ask, what's the difference between these two different types of virtual realities
you guys are talking about? Because they're both very similar. And yet, they are very different.
I think this person obviously just does not see the greater detail in them.
Right. So I did have a conversation with Tom. And so I could actually point out,
there is a podcast where Tom and I go into this in great detail. So I can
give you the link to it. So I'll just give a short answer because that's
there. I mean, Tom and I go at it for an hour or two. So it's very friendly, of course, very
friendly. But so he calls it my big toe, his theory, big theory of everything. And so I just
given you my thought theory of everything, what that means. And so at the very end of our
conversation, I pushed him on it. I said, look, there is no such thing as a theory of everything.
Wouldn't you agree? And ultimately, he agreed. There is no theory of everything. So initially,
I thought that that might be a big difference between us. But I really wanted to find out.
I mean, do you really believe, Tom, that you've got the final word on truth with your theory?
Because I don't. If you do believe that, then my theory is utterly different from yours. Because
I think all I've got is a little tiny baby step outside of our headset. And that's all I've got.
And I'm never going to have a theory of everything. Now, the difference I see between us,
just in terms of practical theory building, is he's using a lot of quantum theoretical ideas
in his approach. A lot of it is using, he's got advanced, I guess he didn't get his PhD,
but he's done advanced research and advanced study, a graduate study in physics.
You know, I think he does. I think he's in... Does he have a PhD? Yeah, in nuclear physics.
Okay, so he does have a PhD in nuclear physics. Okay, good. So he's a genuine PhD in physics.
And I think that he's trying to use quantum theory, sort of quantum ideas that are foundational
in what he's trying to build. And from my point of view, again, the high energy theoretical
physicists in the last 20 years are telling us that not only is space time doomed, quantum theory
is doomed. They're saying that quantum theory will arise, joined at the hip with space time.
And so you might say, well, you know, there's all this weird stuff about quantum mechanics,
there's no cloning theorem, you can't clone quantum bits, there's superposition,
there's entanglement. This is all weird stuff. And this is surely showing us something deeper
about maybe a conscious reality beyond space time. And the answer appears that
from the work of Chris Fuchs on quantum Bayesianism and Robert Speckens, his toy model of quantum physics,
all those weirdnesses of quantum theory, no cloning theorem, superposition, entanglement,
all that stuff, is simply a symptom of incomplete information. If you have incomplete information
about the state of a system, those all follow as theorems. Well, when I say that space time is a
headset, that means incomplete information. Your headset is there to chop down the information.
That's the whole point of an interface is too complicated out there. So let's dumb it down.
Well, so quantum mechanics and all the weirdness of quantum mechanics is merely a symptom of the fact
that space time is doomed. So it's not going to give us, so quantum theory by itself
is not going to take us outside space time. Quantum theory has its weirdnesses because it's tied
to the limits of space time. So what's different between my approach and Tom's is,
and most, by the way, most people who are trying to use some kind of modern physics to do some kind
of exploration of consciousness, they're tied to many of our arts. Quantum is it, right? And I'm
saying not if you believe the high energy theoretical physicists, it's not it. It's going to arise
from deeper structures. And by the way, it's not a hand wave. So they found like the amplitude
hedron is the structure outside of space time. It's a real structure. It's published. You can go
read about it. Its volumes give you the scattering amplitudes of real processes in space time,
much easier than doing Feynman diagrams in space time. Hundreds of pages of Feynman diagrams
turn into two or three terms you can do by hand. And there are no Hilbert spaces to be seen anywhere
in the amplitude hedron. And therefore, there is no quantum theory. And the physicists like
Neymar, Connie, Hamed and these guys who are doing this are very, very clear. There is no quantum
theory here. This is beyond space time and quantum theory, unitarity, which is one of the key things
we can talk about unitarity. I mean, there are some who argue that unitarity is not essential to
quantum theory, but most physicists say it is unitarity and locality are are products of this
thing, but they're not built into the thing. They can give it to you in the projection,
but they are outside of space time and they're outside of quantum theory.
So you can see that the difference, maybe at some level, Tom and I, our concepts are similar,
but the spirit in which we're doing things is very, very different. I'm saying,
I'm letting go of quantum theory entirely. I'm letting go of space time entirely. And I feel
like that Tom is still saying, let me use the tools of quantum theory and the most advanced
physics we have of space time to get my model of consciousness. I'm saying we really have to
jump outside of the headset altogether. Yes. Now, I agree with you because I found that question
quite redundant in the sense that there are clear differences in the way you guys approach it.
I think where you guys do start to sort of become similar is when it starts becoming a virtual
reality and when you start talking about that. But then I have another question from someone
and this question is directed at both of us, actually, of a critique for the two of us.
It says, in our last conversation on conscious agents and the subatomic world,
Tev, you and Don, do not define information. So the person's basically, it's a very lengthy
comment, goes on to say that we didn't clearly define the term information. And since the work
eventually goes so much into a sort of a virtual reality, a sort of matrix simulation,
information becomes a key word here. Do we, should we clarify that for this listener just
to make sure they understand? Right. I used Shannon information. So people who've studied
information theory, if I have, it's all about probabilities and basically if something has
probability P, then it's minus log P is, so Shannon information. Now, I've been,
and then when I use entropy, I'm using the standard, you know, Shannon notion of entropy
from information theory. So this is, I'm just using standard,
standard information theoretic stuff. I've explored
solace entropy. So there are generalizations of Shannon entropy and some arguments for this.
So I've been exploring them, but I haven't used them yet. And if I'm forced to, I may, there are
arguments for showing that the notion of entropy that's used in Shannon information theory may
not be as general as we need in certain cases. And there are more, and one is called solace entropy,
I think. So I am playing with that. But in my conversations with you, when I've said entropy
or information, it's Shannon. Okay, good. Next one is, if we're just avatars within this virtual
reality, what is the concept of procreation? What purpose does this serve in the creation of other
avatars? And does this even work inside of space time?
Right. So what's interesting is that, from this point of view, our headset gives us certain portals
into the deep consciousness beyond. That's what the headset is for too. So right now, my Tevin
icon in my headset is giving me a portal into Tevin's consciousness or that projection of the
one consciousness, the Tevin projection of the one consciousness. So we know that our headset
does give us portals into consciousness. And the question is, what technologies might there be
that we could use to create new portals into consciousness, right? Well, we have one technology
that we know, and that is having babies. That's one technology for opening up new portals
into consciousness. So why would, so there are a couple of questions that relate to this. So why
would the one consciousness use this procreation kind of approach toward doing this? And I would say
that it's, first, I should say, I don't know, but I'll give you some ideas, right? Humility is
required at every step of this, right? Until we have a scientific theory where we're making predictions,
disclaimers. But at some point, I think we'll be able to reverse engineer the headset and understand
this notion of portal that I'm talking about quite precisely. And we'll understand a little bit more
how procreation works in terms of booting up new portals. And we'll be able to build artificial
portals. We'll get the technology to build artificial portals to the consciousness behind.
We'll actually understand what kind of networking of conscious agents is required to effectively
bridge into our interface and into our common headset. But at the top level, why is the one doing
this? It goes back to what we talked about before, which is the one is trying to know itself. And
it can only know itself by knowing what it's not. So to keep having experiences and having and opening
this up to a sort of multiplex of different experiences overall, which goes into the other
question that I have here, which is, did in this framework then, where dinosaurs and all sort of
extinct species and creatures fall into this sort of process, have these all been avatars
as part of an experience of the one. Exactly. They would be and you might say, well, why did
the one do that and then throw them away? And what a waste of time. And that gets the whole
notion of time itself is an artifact of our interface. So a lot of our intuitions are tied to
artifacts of our headset. So in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents, the dynamics
need not have increasing entropy. There need not be an arrow of time in the dynamics outside of
our headset. But it's a theorem that if you take this Markovian dynamics from which the entropy
is constant, it doesn't increase. And you make a projection by conditional probability. So you're
losing some information, you see the dynamics, you see a dynamical system, but it's lost some
information over the deeper dynamics. The projected dynamical system will have increasing entropy.
And so it will have an arrow of time as not as an insight into reality. It's not an insight.
It's entirely an artifact of the loss of information. And so by the way,
time is the fundamental limited resource in evolution. If I don't get food in time, I die.
If I don't mate in time, I die. If I don't run away from that dinosaur in time, I'll be eaten.
So time is the fundamental limited resource. And what I'm saying is that time is an illusion.
It's an artifact of the headset. So the entire, so on one hand, I published papers on evolution
and evolutionary game theory. I love the theory of evolution. It's an incredibly powerful theory.
Evolutionary game theory is beautiful. And inside the headset, there is no better theory
of biological organisms than evolution by natural selection. It's brilliant.
That's being said. The theory itself, all of it, is an artifact of the projection. None of it is
deeply true. It's only true in our headset. And for understanding dynamics in our headset,
there is no better scientific tool than evolution by natural selection. And I've used it. But
our mathematics tells us that the whole thing is an illusion. So I should maybe stop there.
So I should maybe stop there. There was a question some people asked me,
which is, I used evolution to show that we don't see reality as it is. But then that means that
evolution wasn't true. So how am I not shooting myself on the foot? So if we have time at the
end, we can go after why I'm not shooting myself on the foot. So within this headset and having
this headset on, can I take it off? I think yes. I think in the meditation process, when you literally
and myself included are not great meditators. I try my best. I do hear about people that I trust,
go to places where you let go of the headset for a while. You just literally let go of death,
the near death experiences that people report, you know, the Raymond Moody, I guess, and the tunnel,
the light tunnel and life review and that common thing. I'm not saying that that's right, but
it's suggestive that it certainly fits in with the ontology of this conscious agent dynamics that
I'm working on, that in some sense, everything that I perceive is just a headset and death is
just taking the headset off. That's all it is. I tried that. But if you're playing a virtual
reality game and you believe, and you've got an avatar in the game, so it's a first person
perspective. If you identify with that avatar, if you really believe that that avatar is you,
you're going to be nervous and scared and everything that happens to the avatar is going to be.
But if you don't identify with the avatar, you can enjoy the game. And if your avatar gets
shot up, who cares? You just take the headset off. And so I think that it is possible, maybe in
meditation, maybe, and the Hoffman hasn't done it. So I'll just tell you upfront, I've not gone there.
I've meditated quite a bit. So maybe I'm just a spiritual flunky, who knows.
Science won't be an spiritual flunky.
Science won't be an spiritual flunky. But the people that I trust
seem to have had those experiences. And in my own theory, it says it's possible,
even though I myself haven't experienced it.
So let's say within those kernels from the physics, from your mathematical side,
let's say you leave the headset. Would you have to first go via each pathway in order to get
to sort of the one? Or would you see someone else between them? I'm not sure if you understand
what I'm trying to say. A really great question. And I've really wondered about that myself,
because there are some spiritual traditions which talk about, I mean, I was some Tutu warrior in
my previous life or something like that. And so I've wondered if there's any way that I could
make sense of that in my framework of conscious agents. Is there some kind of, like, if I take
the network idea seriously, are there parts of the network that I could say that are sort of
closer to this particular headset, the Hoffman headset? Maybe there are other headsets that
are closer to that headset. And it may be possible that there, and even though ultimately time is
an illusion, it could be, we might be able to explain that illusion in terms of projections
of these headsets and so forth. So I can't rule out the possibility that our theory will eventually
take these non-precise ideas and make them mathematically precise and maybe even interesting.
So I can't rule that out. That's very fascinating. That can be quite a rabbit hole to go down through.
Do you think that, well, another thing that could lead to sort of reincarnative experiences in
general? I mean, let's say you just sort of leave that headset and maybe just enter another one
altogether. I mean, it opens up the door to sort of all those spiritual claims that, let's say,
Hindus or Buddhists sort of have. It kind of provides a scientific grounding for these beliefs,
in a sense. That's right. It's basically what I was saying earlier is what you're saying is
basically the one looks through the headset of an amoeba, and of a virus, and of a bacterium,
and of a Hoffman and a Tevin, and every possible headset, a cat, and they're all
legitimate ways of the one looking at itself and enjoying that view and then recognizing
I'm not that. I'm more than that. And Don, how would you differentiate between
something that's an avatar and something that isn't? So like a virus, for example,
we're not a lot of doctors in the world. People can't even agree whether it's life,
living or dead. At what point is an avatar an avatar in this framework, would you say?
What is the minimal amount needed to be an avatar? That's a great question because it really exposes
an important concept here. And that is in this framework, the distinction between living and
nonliving is not principled. Just as the distinction between conscious and not conscious is not a
principle distinction. The distinction that we make between living and nonliving is an artifact,
entirely an artifact of the limits of our interface. It's not principled. So I'm always
interacting with living consciousness. I'm always interacting with it. And my headset
is dumbing things down because I'm not, that's what I'm doing. I'm looking at myself to a
projection. So when I see a rock, it's fair enough within my headset to say it's not alive.
It's perfectly fine. For everyday practical purpose, I'm not going to try to eat the rock
and so forth. I'm not going to worry about the rock chasing me. And so for practical purposes,
I can say it's not alive. But the distinction is not principled. When I interact with a rock,
I'm interacting through a headset interface icon, namely the rock. I'm interacting with consciousness.
I'm not saying the rock is conscious. So there's not panpsychism of that kind. The rock is not
conscious. The rock, like the zoom pixels, right? The zoom pixels are just zoom pixels. They're not
conscious or unconscious. They're just zoom pixels. The rock is just a rock. What am I
interacting with a living consciousness always? So now my interface can give me more or less
information about someone else's interface with other humans. I know firsthand what a human
interface is like. So I have some idea of what it's like to be you. And then you as a doctor,
if you're dealing with patients with psychological problems, you have some insight. Whereas if you're
dealing with a mouse, you might not trust your insights from the human experience in terms of
understanding the psychology of a mouse, right? You just don't have the insights into their headset
that you have into the human headset. Well, so when I see something that I call a virus,
I have some hint in my interface of something that's like alive. But my interface is giving me
almost no information about another interface. So interfaces have information about other interfaces
that are more or less complete. And so with a rock, my knowledge of interfaces is basically gone to
zero. Okay, yeah. So that's just beyond that interface's access at that point.
That's exactly right. That's also mine. By the way, things that look really stupid to us,
like I see some worm crawling around and it looks like really stupid. Hey, for all I know,
what I'm interacting with there, if I could actually, if I could get inside and understand
what it was experiencing, I might just want to fall down on my knees and worship it,
because it's so much smarter than me and brilliant than me. Again, what I can see about others
is just due to the limitations of my own headset. And what they are in themselves and what they're
experiencing could possibly blow me away if I ever... So you can see this point of view
leads to all sorts of radical adaptations that took me decades to even understand what it could
mean because we're so used to thinking inside the headset.
I know it's very, very mind-bending. It's almost like sort of taking the blooper at some point,
and it's sort of leaving reality altogether, because there's two people who firmly love science,
sowing grain within it. And if someone just has to pop in right now and just shadow and watch
us, I mean, they'll think we're completely out of it. It's completely out there.
All you can think is is that you just haven't taken the blue pill yet.
That's right, but what's led me down this blue pill path is the mathematics and the science.
I've been lead kicking and screaming the whole way. So I understand when anybody has an objection,
I had that objection. And the only reason I'm saying what I'm saying is that I had to go with
the science. It's just plain the fact that our best science tells us that space-time isn't
fundamental. And when you wrap your head around that, space-time and objects in space-time are
not fundamental. That's what our best science... When that is the start of the rabbit hole and
that's not an LSD-induced rabbit hole, that is a scientific-based rabbit hole. And I've been
chasing the mathematics and going wherever... And that's what you have to do as a scientist.
You have to be intrepid and be willing to let go of flat earth, be willing to let go of Newton,
be willing to let go of Einstein, be willing to let go of quantum mechanics, and be willing to
let go of space-time. You've got to be willing to let go of all of it and go into it.
Yeah. At what point you mentioned that the one... I mean, you spoke about this earlier and I think
we should, at some point, get round back to that and just touch on it more because it seems like
quite some fun work that's happening at this very moment. But you mentioned that at that point you
and Bernardo just diverged a little. At which point exactly does it happen? Why is it that your
version of the one in this trace chain is something that would make you two guys clash in your views?
Well, I'm not sure that we would clash too much, but I'll say where we might have some
differences. And again, Bernardo's a brilliant and a good friend. And if there's something
where we differ philosophically, I defer to him because he's a real philosopher and I'm not.
But Bernardo has recently been saying that there is a way of interpreting integrated
information theory that would be compatible with analytic idealism, his view. I'll look forward
to having a conversation with Bernardo about this because he's brilliant and I'll probably stand
corrected with what I'm about to say. But it seems to me that integrated information theory
does assume that there's a substrate and they're very explicit. In the IIT 4.0 paper and substrate
is mentioned dozens and dozens of times. It's not a minor thing. Substrate is front and center.
Now, if I gave you a theory of space time and I said, but there's a substrate
to say space time, then I would assume from that that you're saying that space time isn't
fundamental because there's a substrate to it. So if space time is fundamental, then I'll just
talk about space time. I don't need to talk about anything deeper than that, no substrate to it.
So if I'm talking about a theory of consciousness, and I want to say consciousness is fundamental,
well, then I don't need to really be talking about any substrates. I mean,
consciousness is the final substrate in that theory. So this is what I would like to talk
with Bernardo about and I'm sure he'll have something that will make me think deep.
But so with all, he's a good friend and he's brilliant. So I'll be interested to do it. But
my attitude right now is a theory of consciousness that's scientific and in the spirit of analytic
idealism doesn't need any substrate for the consciousness. You just posit the nature of
that consciousness and you don't posit any substrate. And you don't need to posit some
combinatorial properties of that substrate like integrated information,
puzzle properties of that substrate that quantify how much consciousness there is.
Consciousness is consciousness. You don't quantify this. You can quantify how much
access you might have to the consciousness through a particular headset. But consciousness itself is
just consciousness. It is fundamental. And so in IIT, there's always this thing we talked about
earlier that these circuits, there is no consciousness in them and these brain circuits
and these circuits, maybe they do have consciousness. The whole thing of assigning
consciousness to substrates, neural substrates in this case, is wrong headed. It's just completely
wrong. So that's where, again, I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot when I talk with Bernardo about
this. I really just learned about his views in the last couple, three, last month or so on this.
So that's why I've had a chance to really talk with him. It also called me by storm because
I'm scheduled to chat to him, I think, in a month's time. And we spoke about a few months ago. And
when we spoke, I had no idea that he would, that I also had no clue that he would go down that
year either. It was quite strange to me as well. And I'm curious that I'm keen to ask him as well.
Yeah, I'm going to ask, I'll ask him as well. And I'm sure he'll have something really good to
say. And I'll try to push back on this. You don't need a substrate and see what he says.
I'll try the same. And I'll also let him know if I speak to him first, I'll let him know without
causing any sort of debate. Bernardo loves to debate, by the way. He prefers when someone actively
debates in a respectful manner, though. In a respectful manner, exactly. As long as it's respectful,
he loves the debate. He enjoys it. He actually told me the last time, please actually be more
more stern and strict with the questions. Well, I like sharp discussion in the sense that it's
intellectually on point and deep. Having it be personal, I don't, I'm not interested in having
it be personal at all. I told him that I'm just trying to just be nice and relaxed for the podcast.
Try and make it a nice calm environment. But I'm Bernardo, I'll just say that he's brilliant
mathematically. And I've asked him to join us and work on the mathematical side of this.
And I want to do that. I would love to get Bernardo, because he's got the mathematical
chops to actually work with us on the third consciousness and show analytical idealism
through the through the math of consciousness. But we'll see. I mean, yeah, I mean, to get a
PhD in engineering and philosophy, you must, you must know your stuff. There must be something
going on there that that's you're able to kind of bring these two fields together and give you
people quite a unique perspective, at least on reality. Yeah, I think he's very busy with the
Essentia Foundation. So I see them doing quite a lot of work lately. So probably just like you,
probably a lot of on your plates done in this virtual reality, in this reality, is there anything
you want to call it, by the way? Do you prefer calling it the virtual reality? What do you prefer
calling it? I just I think headset is the easiest for most people. So it's just a headset. Now,
I think that I say that because it's everybody can sort of relate to that. Okay, within this headset,
how does this headset account for I mean, we know time now based on this is an illusion.
But then how do we count for the beginning, let's say, let's say the big bang within this headset.
How is that conceptualized within this framework?
Well, so the time itself of the big bang is an illusion. So what we have is a Markov dynamics
in which the entropy is not increasing. Then we say, so we have this big Markov chain,
there is no time. But now let's look at it from perspective. Let's do a trace chain.
So we started off talking about, so let's take a big chain. Let's do a trace chain. Well,
we've lost information. Well, so now we're going to induce an arrow of time. And it's going to look,
depending on which trace chain you use, it might look like the big bang and then lifeless evolution
of galaxies and stars and so forth. And then life and then consciousness might look like that.
But that's the entire story is an artifact of the projection and it's not a deep insight.
It's fascinating because me trying to ask you what happened before the big bang is kind of like
me asking you, what happened before the one? Is that something you're even thinking about at any
point? Well, absolutely. And by the way, I should say that what I was the answer I just gave about
the projection and big bang just being artifact, I actually want to actually do that. I want to
actually write down a big Markovian kernel in which the entropy is not increasing.
Choose a projection and then show, wow, when I look at it through this projection,
look at that. I do get this weird thing seem to be evolving and growing. In other words,
this is not a hand wave. I am proposing computational model. There is a Markov dynamics
beyond space time in which the entropy is not increasing. Take any projection of it
where by conditional probability, you know, like trace chains or something like that,
the entropy will be increasing. Study those. Study all the different ways that that can happen.
Our universe with the big bang will just be one of the possible kinds of ways that the
universe. So in other words, we can study cosmology from this point of view. We can understand,
you know, right now, if you take space time as fundamental, then the notion of the big bang
and the singularity is an unsolvable problem. What do you do with it? But if you realize,
no, no, that that's just a headset projection of a deeper thing in which there is no singularity.
I've erased the singularity. That's what this mathematics is. I've erased the singularity
and showed you, you get the singularity because of a projection, not because of the deeper,
the truth of the deeper reality. So this is not, so I don't want people to think,
might have sound like it was just a hand wave. No, I'm offering a technical computational
program. Exactly. I mean, that's, I mean, that's the biggest difference between
a lot of other idealist theorists is that you're using computational, I mean,
you're using mathematics and physics, you know, in a very precise manner to try and
show people what you're talking about. I mean, conscious agents in the subatomic world,
you came with that very strategic, knowing that this is the core layer of reality,
according to us and the way we perceive it. And that's why you guys want to touch that
base reality. And you said you don't want to go straight for the neuron because that
that is a bit, it's a lot harder. There's a lot, there's probably a lot more
that's going to have to go into that. Do you have a sort of a hierarchy of what you
think you want to go after from the subatomic world? I mean, we just mentioned going into
cosmology at some point, anything in particular that you're kind of taking these maths into at
some point, or spearheading into the future? Yes, right now, what I'm working on is a specific
technical problem, which is we've mapped a Markov dynamics into decorated permutations.
Physicists have mapped decorated permutations of positive gross monions
into scattering amplitudes. So I want to tie that whole thing together. So what I'm working on right
now is interfacing our decorated permutations with the decorated permutations and the gross
monions of the physicists. I've got to get that map absolutely precise. So and I've been working on
that and I gave two proposals to my colleagues in the last three weeks and they're both wrong,
but they're both a piece of the puzzle. But by putting them out, I thought I thought,
no, no, it's wrong. So I'm realizing I have to dig deeper. I'm going to have to really study
these positive gross monions more deeply and write down a more serious. So that's what I'm
working on right now is because I then want to be able to, once we have that,
then we can do our computational experiment about quarks and gluons. We have to show how
we can go all the way from the dynamics of conscious agents through the decorated permutations
to scattering amplitudes and properties of particles. So that's why I'm focused on this
technical issue right now. Markov decorated permutations mapping to gross monion decorated
permutations. Clean technical problem. And I'm working on it and I'm not a mathematician. So I'm
having to learn about positive gross monions and I'm just learning as I go. But I'm motivated.
So that's what I'm going after now. But then my guess is I'm a cognitive neuroscientist and I
would love to be going after the brain. But the brain is, I don't know, 10 to the 50th or 10 to
the 60th quarks and gluons, whatever. Maybe I should start with two or three quarks and gluons.
Yeah. And work there and then work up to, you know, protons and protons and electrons.
Do the nucleus and atom and then maybe some simple molecules.
Then maybe by the time we get to molecules, maybe we'll know enough to actually know,
for example, about neurotransmitters. What does a neurotransmitter mean in terms of
dynamics of conscious agents? But ultimately, we'll have to get then to, you know,
axons and neurons and synapses. And you can see we have to reverse,
so the problem is we have to reverse engineer a headset. So neuroscience is far harder than
we thought. We thought that we'd look inside through microscopes and we see billions of
neurons and trillions of synapses. And that's really complicated. And we think that that's the
truth. No, no, no, that's a thin veneer on the complex, the true complexity is far, far greater.
Let me give you just a taste of the complexity. If I have a conscious agent that has just 10
color experiences, I'll say 50 color experiences, 50 color experiences.
You can actually, you can perceive six million or seven million different color,
you can discriminate six or seven million. So this is trivial, 50 colors is nothing
compared to what you can do. In our theory of conscious agents, the set of
of possible Markov chains for consciousness is dealing with just 50 colors is the Markov
polytope on 50 states. It's called a Markov polytope in 50 states. And this is a polytope,
it's a geometric object that we have to study to understand all the dynamics of consciousness.
And it has little vertices on it, like a diamond, it's got little points on it, right?
It's got facets and edges and points. You know how many points this, with only 50 colors,
you know how many points this geometric object has? It has 10,000 times more points
than the number of particles in the known visible universe.
That's incredible.
That's only for 50. So I'm going to need a bigger computer to simulate this stuff.
So we thought that the brain was complicated. It's trivial compared to when we let go of the head,
see the headset was there to really dump things down. And it succeeded. It really
dumped things down. We thought we were seeing truth in all of its glory.
We got the really dumbed down cheap version. As soon as we start little steps outside of
our little space time headset, holy smoke, the thing just blows wide open consciousness is
unbelievably complicated. And I'm going to need a new desktop computer.
And I think the worst part about it is that even as you go on, because the irony is that you'll
probably need quantum computers to try and help you prove that you can go beyond quantum,
which is funny. But I think something that makes it even worse is that you have people like Mike
Levin who are even showing you that you don't have to even go to a neuron to show people what
intelligence or a possible mind even is in that sense. I mean, he's blurring the lines completely
with his work. His bioelectric fields are truly stunning. It's amazing. His work is so fast.
I've enjoyed talking with him. I have a couple of podcasts with Mike. And now you're lifting
this position where these bioelectric networks also have to sort of some at some point be explained
now. Absolutely. And he's leaving you with much harder tasks, I would say.
Absolutely. That one sounds like a very fun task to understand the bioelectric fields
and how they would arise as an interface projection of dynamics of conscious agent
networks. So absolutely. This is going to be fun to reverse engineer our space time headset.
And bioelectric fields will be part of it. Neurons will be part of it. DNA, all of that.
So in some sense, science is just now taking off the headset. In some sense,
we're just now beginning the real task of science. Right now, we just polished the tools on our
little headset. We thought we were seeing the truth. No, we were just sharpening our tools.
Now it's time to take the headset off and really get to work on what's beyond. It's pretty exciting.
Yeah, it's almost like a post realism. There's going to be some term for it,
post realism. There's going to be something where people are now moving beyond this headset
if they're going to try and figure out reality in this way. Something on, sorry.
Or maybe it'll be pro realism in the sense that we thought the headset is not the real thing.
That's just a headset. Now we're getting into the realism. But even our discussion on
the limits of scientific theories means that even though I'm saying we're going outside the headset
and science is really just beginning, still scientific theories will never be a theory of
everything. Humility is going to be required at every step because yeah, we're stepping outside
the headset. But effectively, we've just moved to a bigger projection of the one. All we can
never deal with are bigger and bigger projections of the one. And no matter how big our projections
are, they will be literally measure zero of the one. I'm glad you brought it back to that because
I wanted to ask you, I mean, you started off by talking about the stress chain, figuring out the
one and this new information. If you can just try and sort of conceptualize this, what you think this
is the one, what type of, is there any way for you to wrap your head around this? Do you think you can?
In a way, I think we all can in the following sense. If it's true that you are the one,
experience itself through a headset. And the reason that you don't feel that is because
you're in with both feet on the headset. You really believe that you are the avatar in the
headset. And that's part of the whole game. I mean, the part of the whole game is to completely,
for the one to completely lose itself in the headset and to slowly wake up. If I don't really
believe it for a while, it's not going to be real for me to say, I'm not that because I never really
took it seriously. So I need to take it seriously and then let go. So I think it is possible,
even while we're still having these avatars in the headset,
through meditation, to let go. And but to the mind, so this is now where it starts to sort of
go with what spiritual traditions some have said. And that is that the truth can't be understood by
the mind. So no words are adequate, no scientific theory is adequate. But you have another access
to that realm. That's not a conceptual access. It's direct. You are that infinite intelligence.
That's what you are. And any concept that you have of yourself is only a projection,
necessarily. So the only way to answer your question is to, of course, I do my science,
but to answer your question, to really go deep, I have to let go of all of my concepts,
including all of my scientific theories, completely. No, no thoughts at all. So literally
a space of no thoughts, no conceptions, and just aware of aware awareness of awareness.
And then I think that's where you then begin to know yourself, not as you know,
an external object, but you know yourself directly. And my guess is that that goes infinitely deep.
In other words, if you do that for five minutes, you experience that for five minutes,
you've not scratched the surface yet. Try it for 500 years, you've not scratched the surface yet.
That's how deep you go. So that so somehow the deep answer to your question is, on the one hand,
we know the one by looking at this projection and doing all of our science.
And we know the one by doing that really, really carefully and then saying,
I transcend that I'm not that I'm that is a lower limit on my capabilities. And I that's not that's
not the limit of who I am. Then we could go beyond that by letting go of all thoughts,
and just being the awareness of awareness. And that goes infinitely deep.
And so you can know it directly. But but the mind will say,
because there's no concepts for the mind to deal with. So the intellectual mind will say that's
there's there's nothing there. But frankly, my own experience is that, if I want new ideas
to do my science, I need to go into the space where I let go of all concepts, I need to actually
tap into that infinite intelligence, and just be in absolute interior science. That's where
all the good ideas come from. Then you bring them back in. So so the mind really isn't. I mean,
it has this all little limited intelligence, and you can do you can do mathematical computations
and so forth. But if you want deep insights, you got to let go of the mind. Yeah, so we so we are
one infinite intelligence. Yes. Well, when sorry, I'm not sure if I haven't really picked up on
you saying this much. But when did you start calling it the one?
I was into Federico Fajin. So Federico is a good friend. And really, he's a wonderful man. And
he helped support this research for and he talked about the one he didn't give a mathematical model
of the one. And of course, you can't. But he talked about the one and and I you know,
at first, I didn't use the term, but then I realized that our my mathematics was pointing
me toward the idea that there was going to be not just a network of separate consciousnesses,
but I was going to have to recognize that, you know, they can combine and ultimately,
there's there's some notion of one. And so I decided that that was sort of the least
tendentious word that I could use. And but I don't think right now that I have a mathematical
model of the one, I have a mathematical model of projection of the one in terms of consciousness
agent networks. So so that's why I started using the term the one and maybe the last few years
after they are sort of filtered in when I started thinking more and more about the deeper
structure of this network of conscious agents.
So do you think the there is so so that the ultimate purpose at this point then is the one
the one sort of experiencing while having multiple experiences via us, the avatars
in this infinite sort of some essence beyond space time.
That's right. Enjoying those experiences and then learning what it is by by learning that no
matter how exotic and impressive those experiences are, they're trivial compared to what the one is.
Yeah. And then do you think done with that in mind, if you take certain other theories that are
physicalist like the malt walnut, they go a bit beyond that when they think about a multiverse,
would a multiverse in this context be the others? And maybe there's one
in this universe and then there are others, you know, in sort of other universes.
Do you think? Well, good. So there is, of course, a technical meaning of multiverse,
you know, that some physicists have, and also many worlds, there's a different kind of
technical thing there. But one, just at a top level, one could say the idea that I have a
multiple headsets could be sort of like multiple universes, multiple multiverse kind of thing,
possibly. But when you get real technical about it, I mean, like Max Tagmark has, you know,
his level four multiverse, which he, so it's different now from what I just said,
right? Because I was saying we could think informally about all these multiverses being
just different headsets, and there's an infinite variety of them. So that's top level connection
to your idea. But getting down more to brass tacks like what real physicists are using
multiverse for, like one concrete example is Max Tagmark at MIT, his level four multiverse,
he's saying that mathematics is fundamental reality. Okay, so the fundamental nature of
reality is entirely mathematical. And there's an infinite variety of possible mathematics. And so
there's an infinite variety of mathematical universes. And so he, and I agree that there's
mathematics is endless. It's infinite. But I don't think that mathematics, you know, of course,
I think Tagmark is brilliant. And, you know, in this realm, I would probably be set straight by
him. But anyway, here's my idea as it is, that when it comes to the nature of reality consciousness,
what is the relation between mathematics and consciousness? My feeling is that
mathematics isn't the whole thing. That the consciousness, the living, put it this way,
the living organism of consciousness has mathematics is like the bones. But the bones
are just the bones, they're not the whole living organism. And they're, they're essential.
Mathematics, I think is essential, but it's not the whole of the living organism of
consciousness. So that's sort of my feeling about how my views fit with like multiverse kinds of
it. It's fascinating to me how it's becoming so poetic over time. Because I mean, the more you're
obviously talking about this so much more lately, and you're trying to get people to understand it,
and it's, it's starting to slowly develop its own sort of moral practical significance as you have to
hold on it and apply it. Did you ever foresee yourself becoming someone who will sound so
spiritual, almost guru-like in your life? No, I mean, it's, it's sort of, I've been
pushed kicking and screaming. I can tell. It was kind of thing by, by the mathematics and,
but, but on the other hand, you know, at some point, it's, it's time to quit kicking and screaming
and just say, Hey, this is what the next step in, I mean, physics is telling us the space time is
over and quantum theory is not fundamental. So get over it, move on. And so physicalism is dead.
Okay, get over it. You know, we, it's time to get over it. And, and now on the other hand,
you might say, am I jumping in full, you know, with both feet to spiritual traditions and just
buying what they say? Absolutely not. I'm having respectful conversations. So I listen respectfully
and, and carefully. And I, I treat what I hear from spiritual traditions, the way I treat
what I hear from science scientists, I listen respectfully with a big grain of salt
in science and in spirituality, that there is nonsense in both realms and there is deep wisdom
in both realms. And it's up to us to take what looks good, turn it into so spiritual traditions,
I think have a lot of insights. And there's clearly a lot of nonsense. I mean, they're
famous for wars that kill each other for, for thousands of years. So, so they have deep insights
and there's deep dysfunction. And the issue is to understand which is which and to, and, and maybe
for example, and maybe that many of the spiritual traditions traditions themselves are very deeply
onto something, but the practitioners don't understand and they're the ones that are doing
the killing, right? It's not the, it's not the philosophy or it's not the insights that the
gurus have had. It's the misuse of them by the, the followers that that's the problem. So we have
to be very, very careful and don't dismiss the philosophy based because some, some followers
started doing some nasty things. So, so there's pitfalls everywhere. So, so as a scientist, what
I want to do is to listen respectfully to the ideas, then look for mathematically precise
statements of the ideas, ones that look interesting, right? And then turn them into testable theories.
Ultimately, spiritual traditions tell us that their words are just pointers, right? Like the
Tao De Ching, the very first sentence in the Tao De Ching says, the Tao that can be spoken
is not the true Tao. Once you understand that, then you can go ahead and read the rest of it
because now you understand that everything that's been said is not the truth. It's not
to be taken dogmatically. It's to be taken as a pointer for you to explore for yourself. So it's
not about, so you better say it exactly this way or you go to hell. No, no, no, no, no, these are
all pointers. Take them in the spirit of pointers you, you have to explore for yourself. So, so the
spiritual traditions have said that, but wouldn't it be nice to have pointers
that tell you their own limits, right? And that's what science gives you. Space time.
It's mathematically precise. And you know what? It falls apart at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
We can tell you where that pointer falls apart. This is the antidote to dogmatism. So what I would
love to see is that the precision that we've gotten in science is brought over to spirituality
so that we now can have pointers in the spiritual traditions that are evolving. It's nothing to
boast about that I'm using the same pointers that they used 3,000 years ago. I wouldn't brag about
that. I would say that's a problem. I mean, we would like to have this thing evolving and get
better pointers and pointers that in themselves tell you the limit, the scope of the pointer,
how it's going to be useful to you and the limit of the pointer so that we then fight over the
pointers and kill each other over the pointers. You don't believe my pointer? Well, you go to
hell or that kind of thing. I mean, this has been such a fascinating conversation because,
I mean, it's different from the first two. In the first one, we went into a lot of
diesel and all the theories. Second one, we went into a paper directly. As I said, I tried to make
this one as practical or almost a moral philosophy aspect of all of us. And I mean, you're brave
enough at this point, clearly, from all the work you've done to even mention the word the L word.
I mean, the love word in science, people, you know how some scientists get when you say the
right. Yeah. Just talk to me about this bigger picture meaning and how people can take all this
information because now we've got two podcast episodes they can look at. They've got all the
others you mentioned as well. You speaking to Tom, you speaking to Bernardo, everything else.
How can they bring all of this information together and fulfill this purpose of the one or make it
more, let's say, a better process for all of us together?
Right. Well, I think that one way to think about what's happening with humanity is
part of humanity for thousands of years has said, this is just a headset, the spiritual part. They
said, you know, the space of time is not fundamental consciousness fundamental. But they've said that
with only the tools of natural language, but they've not had mathematics. There's another group
of people who have been saying, no, no, no, the headsets, everything there is, the physicalists,
right? This is it. But they develop these mathematical tools and careful experiments,
and they gave us the technology. So we have one group, but then the group that's developed all
of this technology and all the mathematical stuff. And all of a sudden, their own theories came back
just in the last couple of decades and slapped them in the face and said, wake up, space time
is just a headset. And it's a cheap headset. It falls apart at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.
Now, scientists, very few right now, but some, and I think more as we really understand the
slap in the face that space time is doomed, a lot of scientists are going to be waking up going,
well, we need to, okay, we have to go outside of space time. Well, it's this big group of people
that are already out there. They're saying, well, welcome, late comers, we've been here for a long
time. They've done a lot of exploring there. But they don't have the tools that science has.
So there are two groups that have half of the puzzle.
This one group has a big part of the puzzle. They've been doing meditation and they have
informal descriptions. This group is just coming late to the party, but they have incredible tools
and precision and experiments. Let's get the two together. And spirituality and science
are just two aspects of human exploration. It's all human exploration and understanding who we are.
They're not separate. We've assumed that they're separate. There's been this division,
you know, especially since Galileo, you know, his house imprisonment by the Catholic church,
right? There has been this huge division. It's time for us to grow up and bring the two halves
together. It's going to be painful. Any marriage like this is going to be painful because there's
dogmas. I think the spiritual gurus don't have dogmas, but the followers do. Many followers of
spiritual traditions get tied up in the pointer saying that pointer is the truth. This pointer
is the truth. No, no, the pointer to the moon is not the moon. The Buddhists will say it's just a
pointer. It's not the moon. But the many followers just don't get it. And that's just human nature.
So it'll be painful on both sides because scientists are going to have to let go of
physicalism. And for most scientists to let go of physicalism is to not be a scientist.
But science is not a particular theory, namely space time. It's not a theory. Science is a
method of careful experiments and careful theory building and testing and a cycle of experiment
and theory. That's what science is. Physicalism is one theory that was helpful for several
centuries and has outlived its usefulness. It's time to let go of that. And you don't let go of
science by letting go of physicalism. In fact, if you don't let go of physicalism,
then you do let go of science because you refuse to go where the science is telling you to go.
You've got to go beyond space time. So it's painful because something that we've both sides
have deeply believed will turn out to be deeply false. And other things will turn out to be true
and will have to pick what are the true things or I wouldn't say true. The next useful steps
ultimately the truth is just you without any concepts. That's just the only truth I can talk
to as you without any concepts about it. But in our efforts as human beings to put together
pointers on the spiritual side and on the science side, the two can work together. And so that's
to integrate what we've been talking about. I would say that that's the top level picture.
Let's have respectful but not credulous. So not stupid, but respectful conversation and to
find what are the good insights from both sides and what are the stupid things from both sides
and bring the good insights together and have a scientific spirituality that's rigorous and human.
Yeah, now I completely agree. I've always thought that as well. I mean,
East meets West almost in yin and yang. You have to sort of bring these
concepts together because there's so much different types of knowledge and bodies of
knowledge that even the West, general Western sciences did not understand a lot of Eastern
science or Asian philosophy, African philosophy. There's a lot to it that a lot of them just
have never had access to and don't get. But all have profound things to say.
I agree with you. I agree. And I think that in the dialogue, the informal natural language
descriptions of these traditions can be translated into mathematics. And at that point,
then we can start to get the real power of the ideas. I like to use the example of
Einstein when he's developed the theory of general relativity. The big idea came like
in 1907 where he realized that if I was in an elevator standing on a weighing scale,
and the cord to the elevator was cut and this went into free-fro. All of a sudden,
I would weigh nothing on the scale. I would weigh nothing. That was his big insight that led to
general relativity. But it took him years, and he was Einstein, so he was brilliant.
It took him years to turn that into mathematics. But when he turned it into mathematics,
a year later or a few months later, Schwarzschild, some German soldier, actually,
but brilliant, solved his equations and proved that there were black holes.
Well, Einstein had no idea that his equations would lead to black holes. He didn't like it.
He didn't believe in black holes. So what happens is your theories become smarter
than the person who wrote them down. You become a student of your own theory. Even if you're in
Einstein, you're not smart enough to know everything that your theory is going to teach you.
So that's what's going to happen with spirituality does not have that yet.
They don't have the benefit of taking the ideas, making them so precise that you can become students
of those ideas where even the teacher who wrote them down doesn't know all the implications and
has to become humble before their own mathematics and let it teach them.
Yeah. When spirituality gets to that point, sign me up. I'm really interested.
Well, sign me up too, Don. I'm also keen to go on that journey as well. This is Don. It's been
another pleasure for me. It's been such an amazing journey. Chatting to you is always so much fun.
And I still can't wait for us to have many more along the way. Anything on your mind,
anything else you want to say? One thing I'd like to say and that is one question that people
always bring up is you use the theory of evolution to show that we don't see the truth.
Right. We don't see reality as it is, but then that means that evolution isn't true.
And so you shot yourself in the foot. And so I should address that briefly. The idea is this.
This is the way science progresses. This is nothing special about me. This is the way you
put down a scientific theory and you make it mathematically precise. And when you do that,
then the mathematics tells you what the theory can do. But it also tells you where the theory ends.
Einstein's theory ends at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. Well, that's all I'm not doing
anything weird or special. This is just the way science works. You take the mathematics of the
theory and you ask the mathematics, what's the limit of this theory? And the mathematics comes
back and says, here's the limit, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters. Well, in the case of evolution,
it also says the same thing. The limit is the very assumption of spacetime and objects in
organisms and spacetime competing for resources and spacetime. That ain't true.
And in Einstein's case, the mathematics comes back and says, spacetime, that ain't it. It's not
fundamental. In fact, it falls apart at 10 to the minus 33. You're going to need to find a structure
outside of spacetime. Evolution is saying the same thing. So we're not shooting ourselves in the foot.
You have to understand this is the way science progresses. The mathematics
doesn't prove that the assumptions are right. The mathematics tells you the limits of the
assumptions. So I just want to really, it's not a minor point. So it is how science progresses.
It's almost like going back to the old way of thinking like falsification in a sense. It's
you're looking for that cap, that endpoint where it does end. Well, and in fact, if you think about
it, that's what scientists should be looking for all the time. We know that this is not the theory
of everything. We know it. If I can write it down, it's not the theory of everything. So do I want
to be an idiot or do I want to be the explorer? So let me be the explorer. Where's the limit? So
let's find as soon as possible what the limits of this theory are and then go to the next one and
then explore its limits. That's fun. It's boring to just get stuck in the same paradigm the whole
time. And I would say one short thing too. And this question always comes up.
Take your time done. I've got time. Don't worry.
Okay. I won't, I won't perseverate though. Just one last thing. A lot of people will say,
look, you're saying that the moon is just an object in my headset and it doesn't exist
when no one looks and you create it when you look. Give me a break. Everybody goes,
give me a break. So suppose I take, I don't know, an apple and I stick it in the ground
and leave it there for five weeks and then you come and dig it up. You're going to find a rotten
apple. Well, doesn't that prove that the apple was there the whole time and it existed even
when you weren't looking, right? And, and, and rot was going on when you weren't looking and, and,
and so this whole nonsense. Well, and, and all I can say is if you, questions like that one,
and there's many, many, I get dozens of questions all the time. I can imagine. Right.
In all those questions, the way to answer it for yourself is to just put it into virtual
reality. So imagine you're playing a virtual reality game, a multiplayer virtual reality game,
and try to put your question into that realm. And then you'll see how it, how it works. So,
so, so for example, I'm playing multiplayer tennis and I hit the tennis ball to my, my partner over
on the other side. And, and I say, you know, the tennis ball only exists when I look. It's, it's
just, you know, pixels in my, my headset. And the other guy says, Oh, no, no, no, the tennis ball
is real. So, and he takes it. So the both guys are in virtual reality. He takes the tennis ball,
he drops it and looks away. I can't see it. But Don, can you see the tennis ball? And I say,
Yeah, I can see it. So that proves it really exists. No, I just doesn't prove that I turned my head
and I'm rendering it because I'm looking at it. So it doesn't exist. Well, well, then he says,
well, but, but when I hit the tennis ball to you, you hit the same tennis ball back to me. So
it proves that there's just one. No, no, I have a tennis ball that I'm experiencing in my headset.
You have a tennis ball that you're experiencing your headset. Those are, so, so all the questions
that people have before you, before you write me an email about it, first try it out yourself.
See if you can solve the problem yourself by putting it into virtual reality and multiplayer
game and see if you, here's the key, here's the key idea. There is something that exists
independent of what you see in your headset. There is something in that analogy, it's some
supercomputer that's coordinating the game, but there's no tennis ball in that supercomputer.
There's nothing green or fuzzy or round in that. So there is something that exists independent of
you, but it's utterly unlike anything that you see or experience, utterly unlike that.
That's the only thing you have to wrap. Once you wrap your head around that
idea and use the VR and the supercomputer analogy, you'll be able to solve your own puzzles and then
you'll see how fun this approach is. But until then, I see people, they can't really start to
explore because they just see these obvious contradictions that they think are, make the
whole thing a non-starter. So just put it into virtual reality and then you can start to really
explore the space. Another way to sort of see that, well, another way I had a question on,
and I forgot to ask you about that, was also when as two perceivers are sort of seeing something,
the fact that they're able to render the sort of same thing within your theory is actually,
because in essence, this is still coming from one sort of the one. So it's not like they
wouldn't have access to the same information at some point. It's kind of like you do have this
shared access to information within the reality. That's absolutely right. It's like the supercomputer
and the VR analogy is the shared access. And the one little proviso I would give is that
we actually don't know that others are perceiving the world like us. There's something called
synesthesia where people have experiences that like Carol Steen, everything that she hears,
every bit of music that she hears, she sees a geometric object with a specific shape and a
specific texture to the surfaces and colors and so forth. And I've actually met her and talked
with her in person about this. So I mean, she's living in a world that I wouldn't have imagined
as possible. She hears music and every time she hears the same piece of music, she sees the same
object doing a complicated movement with a beautiful surface on it and so forth. Well,
and there was a guy named Michael, something rather who everything he tasted with his mouth,
he felt with his hands. So mint, like a tall, cold, cool column of glass.
Yeah, you get some patients who can, when they read, they can smell it or hear sound.
It's incredible, some of the synesthesia patients.
That's right. So you're right that because we share this, the one, we can have some expectation
of understanding what the other world, what the other person's world is like. But I just want to
put out this proviso that don't think that you know everything. It may be that their world is
very, very different than you, you would ever, we have good experimental reasons to believe
that our visual sensory worlds vary from person to person and sometimes dramatically.
I was going to say, because in that case, someone who's schizophrenic or has fully blown psychosis
has almost left that headset in a different way. How would you sort of explore that within this?
Like a fully blown psychosis where the person is completely out of touch. There is no link at all
to what you and I are experiencing within our headsets. How is that sort of explored within
this analogy? Of course. Now, I'm a complete amateur. I'm not a psychiatrist or anything
like that. So everyone knows this is a philosophy slash podcast. That's not really a mental health
podcast directly. Exactly. Right. So then I'll speculate given that. So I'm not a professional
psychiatrist, but it seems to me that going back to the idea of the one
and the one plunging in with both feet and losing itself. But giving itself, we read and talk about
this, but I think the one gives itself little nudges to wake up. And that's the suffering
that happens when I get identified with myself and I'm trying to be important. And my ego is
trying to clash with other people. I'm trying to show I'm smarter than you or better than you or
faster than you or have more money or better cars. All that competition that we do is painful.
It causes suffering. It's the very act of me being in any way hostile to anybody else. It
causes me suffering. And to be competitive in any way like that is causes me suffering.
And that suffering is the wake up call to the truth, which is that person that I'm competing
against or that I'm angry with is me. That is me under a different avatar.
Now, but and I'm gently, I've got the suffering as a gentle way of, and sometimes not so gentle
as later on, of getting me to wake up and to, but that's part of the whole thing of waking
up to who I am. And so the psychosis, I think, are cases where the suffering has gotten in many
cases. Now, sometimes it's you can say this person had a tumor and that's why I mean,
we're looking there and there's a tumor, right? So, so that the tumor is sort of the headset
version of saying that there's something wrong in the network of conscious agents,
something went, you know, something with haywire and that the headset construction.
But in this other approach I'm thinking about is that the
the extreme psychological pain that you get with extreme psychiatric patients is really the one
one using suffering of an extreme kind to wake itself up, to wake that particular itself in
that avatar to wake up and to recognize that there's nothing to worry about, right? If you're in
the virtual reality game and you believe you're the avatar, if someone's shooting up the avatar,
it's scary as hell. But if you're if you go into the game, you know, my avatar is just an avatar,
you know, they can shoot it up, it's a completely different game. There's no reason to be upset.
So, so that is that kind of it's waking up to, oh, this is just a VR game.
And the psychosis patient in the one I'm talking about is the one who hasn't
who's who needs to wake up but is still so identified with the avatar that they're in
they're in a world of pain and a world of fear and a world of so that's again,
amateur hour from Hoffman. I'm not a psychiatrist. Yeah, just kind of
don't worry. I always put at the bottom of my videos a disclaimer to let people know that
this is more of a an educational podcast rather than a and something you apply to your life. This
is not us trying to be gurus everyone. So just do not. And as a doctor myself, I'm not this is not
me coming out trying to give people advice either. This is my intellectual pursuit of trying to
understand these questions that I love so much. So everyone knows that's just our disclaimer for
the moment. Don, would you professional advice? Yes, this is not professional advice at all.
Don, do you ever get worried or concerned about the fact? Maybe even I don't know,
do you even like it? But maybe that you, maybe Bernardo or you guys within this idealist,
it's almost like a new wave of idealism that's taking place right now. It's quite fascinating
to see as well from from my perspective, doing this podcast and taking part in these conversations.
Do you ever get concerned that you guys are slowly growing a a cult? Or maybe that there's
the people are going to take some of this and and take it way beyond you guys like to to a point
where they form their own sort of dogma type groups. Do you, does that ever concern you in any way?
That's a very interesting question, I know, but I guess it does in the sense that
my efforts are to make it a mathematical science, which still doesn't preclude a cultish kind of
approach, but it really helps to avoid it when when when you don't just have words that you're
pushing around, but you have a mathematical theory that can slap you in the face when when
you misinterpret it, right? And when it actually says no to you, like when Einstein thinks that
there are no black holes and the theory comes back and slaps him says no, there are black holes,
live with it. So so that's so that's what I want is is a mathematically precise
idealism, what I call it conscious realism, because of some philosophical baggage that
idealism brings, but so I call it conscious realism, but it's a version of idealism.
I want to mathematically precise my goal is to get this thing launched with enough mathematical
rigor and enough momentum that it will take off and be a real science, a real mathematical
idealist science. I see idealism in the past has had something of an anti-science
flair to it. I mean, Berkeley in some sense brought up his idealism as a reply to the
the physicalism that he perceived of Newton's science. And yeah, and Berkeley had God as part
of as his main sort of core to the little pieces. That's right. And it was sort of
it came out of an opposition to the Newtonian science. And in many idealist theories, in fact,
I'm not really sure if I know of any like idealists who have said, let's go make this a
mathematical scientific theory. I mean, there are some quantum physicists who early on who
interpreted quantum mechanics in idealist ways, von Neumann and others give idealist
interpretations. But that's not what I'm talking about. Someone's saying, let's take idealist
ideas and make a mathematically precise scientific theory out of idealism. And Kant, of course, did
a lot of deep philosophical ideas about idealism, but that's different from making
mathematically precise theories. And so there's been this anti science flavor to a lot of idealist
thinking. And this is, I think, not necessary. And in fact, it's not helpful. I think that
idealism is the next step. And we need to make it mathematically precise and show that physicalism
emerges as a headset, as a projection of a much deeper theory. So by the way, we don't throw
away our physicalist theories, we show them as special cases of deeper theories. And we use our
physicalist theories as tests for, you know, we're making new theories beyond space time,
how do we test them? We test them in space time, we test them like with scattering experiments,
where we know the physics of the scattering. So we don't throw away our old theories,
we are grateful for quantum field theory and general relative, we're grateful for
evolution of a natural selection. These are wonderful theories. They are going to tell us
when we make mistakes with our theories outside of space time, they will come back and slap us
in the face, because we have to protect them back into their domain. And they say, well,
now you're in our domain. And I say, no, or I say, maybe, maybe you can continue in that direction,
you're not wrong yet. So, so, so that's the, so ultimately, I think idealism
needs to be, and I'm trying to work toward that end to make it a mathematically precise
science. And then I won't have to worry about the cold thing that we talked about earlier.
The reason why I asked that is because you see it when you look at the comments and the way people
talk about your work, Bernardo, etc. I mean, the way some people are really, really in love with
it, you know, they, it, it is their anti anxiety cure, they listen to you guys to kind of get there,
to get themselves out of tough situations, they, they use this as a spiritual escape.
And I've seen comments and I like them, I always tell them, like, it's great, it's,
it's great that you guys have such an impact. But at that point, you do come with a lot of power.
I recently read a paper by someone it, I can't remember who it was by, but it was about Bernardo
Kastrup's idealism. And, and, and I can't remember who wrote it, but it very, it spoke about this,
it was, it was against it, of course, but trying to dissect the fact that it's almost cult-like,
and it's kind of like a group of thinkers coming together for me this new wave, it's almost like
the New Age atheism movement that happened with Dawkins, Dennett back in the day, but except in
it, in a shift towards a positive, so like love, universal mind is one very, very cult-like, and
I'm not accusing you of this, but I'm just saying you can actually see it in the comment sections,
you can tell people do really love your work and there's a big, there's a big need for it and want
for us, clearly. Well, I would, I would say for those who, who love it, the best thing that you
can do is, if you have the talents, is to study the mathematics of it and contribute to the mathematics
and push it forward, or if you don't yourself have that talent and few of us do, find a friend who
does and get them, because the way to really, to really help this is to move the science forward.
As we move the science forward, if it continues to give us psychological comfort, fantastic. If it
progress in ways that we're not comfortable with, so be it. We have to go wherever truth leads us,
or at least the projection of truth that we can see leads us. So that's, that's what I would
suggest is, is I absolutely will say my thoughts on this are baby steps and everything that I've
said are baby steps. It's in just a few years, hopefully, even within my lifetime, everything
I'm saying will be seen as trivial compared to what we've discovered. Let's move the science
forward beyond my trivial ideas right now. Let's get this thing into a real substantial science.
And I mean, it would be crazy. I mean, the more you guys find out, the more you see, you could
almost be seen as the link between us and the one. Because you're going to take us closer,
you're going to take us closer to us all together. No, it's just the one talking to itself.
Yeah, pretty much. You're taking us closer to us. That's right. It's beautiful all together and
done. Thanks so much, man. It's always a pleasure. So much fun. Anything you want to say? Anything
else that you think that you really just want to put up? I squeezed in all the all the extras I
wanted to at this point. But next time, I'll probably have some more things that, you know,
I got emails where people have questions. So next time, absolutely. I would say that I would love
to talk with you again. Absolutely. I'm eager. And every time I'm going to try to do something
different. And obviously, next time, if there's any new papers, if there's anything else you want
to chat about specifically, we go back in, do another dissection. It's always fun done. It's
such a fascinating journey for me personally. Watching from the outside, watching your work,
it's always a pleasure. And I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thank you. And Tevin, I just love
the way that you guide the conversation. It's beyond expert. Well done.
