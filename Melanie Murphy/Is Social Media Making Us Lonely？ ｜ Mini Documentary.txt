My name is Melanie Murphy and I love asking people questions that are difficult to answer.
Something I've been fascinated by recently is how much social media has blown up over
the past 20 years and let's be honest, 20 years is a drop in the ocean of the timeline
of humanity and yet it's completely changed our lives.
I create online content for a living, mostly alone as well as writing books, the loneliest
of jobs and while I feel that I spend plenty of time with real life human beings, my average
daily screen time leaves much to be desired.
So how many hours on average do you spend on your screen per day?
Four hours a day Lucy.
Over four hours, that is like two movies I could be watching a day.
I could be running a whole marathon every day.
A lot of time spent with family and friends.
Ever since I graduated, I've been partial to that mental nourishment that comes with
having different voices contribute to important conversations and the conversation around social
media and loneliness couldn't be more significant right now.
What would study after study and headline after headline pointing to higher rates of
social isolation and depression in those who replace most of their face-to-face encounters
with cliques?
All the while, 81% of teenagers feel that social media has a positive effect on their
lives and they credit it for helping them to build stronger friendships.
Just half of the people on this planet use social media every day for hours and as humans
time is our most valuable resource so are all these things like Twitter and Instagram
and Facebook detrimental to our social lives, our well-being, here is some food for thought.
Face-to-face interaction is like so important, I just feel you get a good read of someone
when you're like looking at them, looking at their expressions or the way they say something
like it's just, you can't compare that to like a text message or anything like that.
I've met people and I'm friends with people and I've gone on dates with people I would
never have met only for social media.
You know it is intense and it is overwhelming to go online and go on social media and see
that 300 of the people that you follow are active and they're accessible to talk to,
to interact with but they're not really there.
Social media was created to be social with people and I try to always remember that.
Ironically even though it's supposed to make us feel more connected can actually enhance
feelings of loneliness.
I think social media can be really beneficial to people who are experiencing something that
can be really isolating like going through an illness.
The internet has been such a bridge for me, such a lifeline.
I think social media makes me less lonely, definitely.
I have to put my phone on, did not disturb all the time because my brain can't handle
it.
If children had phones and schools they wouldn't be locking up from the phone.
They would be texting each other through the phone.
I would say that like 80% of my friendship circle has come from social media.
It would not surprise me if a lot of young people growing up nowadays who only know social
media are terrified of conversation.
From their point of view they're looking at people like us and going wow I want to be
like them.
They have loads of friends and meanwhile I'm sitting at home with my dad with his cancer
and no one's there.
Sometimes you'll like chat a lot online and you see that person in person and it's really
awkward and you don't know why and it's just like the chemistry is gone.
Before social media your social life was your immediate friends group, your work groups and
arranging to go out with them was you know if you were going to meet someone say you
met a girl in the pub and you were trying to arrange a date.
She lived in South Dublin, you lived in North Dublin.
If you got her number you would probably ring from a public phone box to confirm the date
and time and then you'd be meeting them the following Saturday under a clock in O'Connellstery.
With the advent of social media you've got your fourth group.
I imagine everyone has set up as their family connections where you can connect with people
you would not normally connect with and a family who have gone abroad.
Historically before the internet you would probably never hear from them again on some
occasions.
So you get people pass jokes, comments, statuses or whatever the children are doing.
I moved home from living in Scotland for five years because social media just couldn't
cut it for me.
I needed to be around people physically not just see them on social media and see what
they're doing to get the snippets of their lives rather than just spending time with
these people.
I needed to have the actual interaction with people rather than reading a text.
And they're always just posting pictures and things like that so at different points when
I was over there it either helped me feel connected to them but also made me feel a bit lonely
as well.
So at different points I'd be like oh it's so good to see that everyone's having a good
time but then other times I'd be like I know I really just want to be there with them.
It was really tough.
I follow I think 700 people on Instagram and I know what 300 of them have for breakfast
every morning.
I know what time they go to sleep at.
I know how they're feeling.
I feel connected to these people because I know these personal things that I would only
know if I lived with them or if I was friends with them but I'm not.
I've never met this person and it is kind of a lonely feeling to almost believe that
you know someone when you've never even had a personal conversation with.
When I'm on Instagram and I'm interacting with people and I didn't come away from it
I feel less connected to people.
For example if you put up something that you're quite upset about and you're kind of looking
for support do I feel disconnected from people because it's not them that's saying it to
me but it's just a voice or do I feel connected because I can on hand talk to them so easy.
It is a big commitment or it can be a lot of pressure to be there for someone especially
if you're not all there yourself or you have stuff going on so to just send the text is
a lot easier on you.
When shit hits the fan things are tough.
Things are shit.
That's when you start to realise who your real friends are.
I started Vine three years of Vining made loads of friends.
Vine died and then my dad got cancer and I spent all of my time taking care of my dad
after that and then suddenly every single person I thought I was friends with just disappeared.
I think social media is almost like a poison in the sense that it can make you feel like
you have lots of friends and it makes you feel like you have a big social life and then when
real life happens someone passes away, somebody gets ill, you're depressed, there really isn't
the social media it carries on and none of those people are there for you despite the
fact that the numbers are all there, the followers are all there, the comments are all rolling
in.
Haha this is so funny, you're the best creator ever, you're just sitting there at home like
flicking through your phone, your dad's ill, it's so weird, it's almost like an episode
of Black Mirror.
Social media has definitely been a double-edged sword for me in terms of improving my anxiety
and also triggering it again.
I think when I first started to talk about my experience with mental health, social media
was an incredible tool for me to share and realise that I wasn't on my own because I
think such a characteristic anxiety is that you think you're the only person going through
it.
So by putting something out there whether it was Facebook or Instagram, instantly I could
realise that there was so many people who were going through the exact same thing.
I don't like to talk about my emotions in person very much, I would go to Facebook Messenger
and message my very close friends or go to text and text my friends, I wouldn't want
to be in person with them while discussing that thing that was bothering me.
So in a way it kind of aids my ability to talk to them.
When it's just text and an image or maybe a couple of emojis you're losing out on the
tone of voice, the body language and all of the other elements that go into communication
that help you actually convey a message or receive a message.
I love face-to-face interaction, I'm all about it, I will talk to someone and give them my
undivided attention.
I love talking to people face-to-face, quite a gestural kind of person, tone and sarcasm
and all that kind of thing is very much sort of all my kind of idiosyncrasies, how I get
my points across.
And there's none of that on social media through text and that's all very cold.
When you're on social media you're behind a screen, you're behind several filters or
whatever apps you're using, you're curating it, you're putting up the best bits if you
want to and you're taking your time to edit your caption and thinking about what you want
to put out there.
I've had people say to me that they're annoyed at how long it takes me to respond to messages.
I think I'm one of the few people that doesn't get very offended when I'm left on red because
I feel like I can empathise with why someone would want to leave me on red a lot of the
time and it's not personal, it's about their own experience and not about me.
That gives me anxiety of going are they waiting for me to reply to the message but I'm doing
this but should I be replying to them and it just starts spiralling in my head so instead
I just leave it.
I have a very different experience of social media I think to a lot of other people because
I have a chronic illness and a disability that means I can't really leave the house
very much and I spend a lot of time, I guess I would feel incredibly alone if I didn't
have the internet, I didn't have a way to connect with other people.
I had a lumber puncture where they accidentally pierced my spinal fluid sack too many times
and my spinal fluid bled out and into my body.
So for two years while my spinal fluid grew back essentially I had to be in a dark room
by myself.
I couldn't have light, touch, sound, I couldn't have anyone near me because it was such an
excruciating pain.
And for those two years I felt incredibly alone, I thought am I the only person here
who's like this, who's in the situation and now I get to make videos that I know touch
the people who are in that place still and that's the most beautiful thing for me.
Last year I had a really horrific medical scare, I was in hospital for a month with
the flare up of my ulcerative colitis and I had emergency surgery and now I have a
stoma which is basically like a bag of poo and I remember being in hospital after my
surgery and one of the first things I did was I was on YouTube, I was on Twitter, on
Instagram trying to find other young women in the same situation as me and I found these
amazing vloggers and bloggers and just like people on social media who were talking about
it who had like been through what I was currently going through and they were like out the other
end like living their life, thriving and that was so comforting to me to just be like right
where are my women in their 20s and 30s with stoma bags.
I've made so many friends from this, I've connected with other influencers or YouTubers
whatever it is, even their boyfriends online, so it's created a whole other dimension of
socialising.
I just don't really see a difference between like online friend and real life friend, it's
like the same and like I'm literally here in Ireland because I'm going to the birthday
party of a friend I met online but now we're real life friends.
Face to face interaction is incredibly important for me to feel connected to someone because
like one of my love languages is like quality time and physical touch so like I do think
that social media is very useful but it doesn't replace for me like you know physical interaction
and actually meeting someone and being able to touch them because I'm like a big like
squeeze and shoulder hoax kind of person so yeah you can't replace that.
I've met so many people and can I say with so many people that I wouldn't have before
especially like creatives of colour and like black writers and black performers it's just
pretty amazing to have that community of creatives.
Social media has created something that could make people very lonely because people are
putting so much emphasis into their online life that if that goes tomorrow what do you
have left?
I think we forget that the impact of how we use social media can affect other people
in real life, I don't even mean about online connections.
When I go home my parents aren't going to be around forever and they're there trying
to communicate with me trying to catch up and I'm like yeah yeah answering them and
not giving them that attention you're never going to get that time back.
So social media has done a lot for me in terms of creating communities.
If I look back in 20 years time when social media has gone I'm like that's a really good
thing that I left behind and created a conversation around.
When I go to meet up my hiking group I promote it all online, I get down I go everyone get
off their phones.
I don't really use it to stay in touch with people because it forces you to stay in touch
with everybody and you don't necessarily need everybody in your life.
It's so tempting to vent your feelings or share what you're going through online literally
this morning.
I was so stressed with various things that are going on that I posted an Instagram story
saying everything will be fine just carry on everything's fine I'm fine like I was stressed
and I'm like sharing that I'm there and then I got a message from my friend and on
reading the message being like you okay what's going on I was like ah this isn't the place
for that.
This world is full of people and sometimes you feel like your interests are yours and
maybe you feel a bit outcast and no one gets it but social media shows you that there are
people around the world who do and that's a wonderful thing.
There are also those times when I'm sat there and I've got my phone out and I'm scrolling
through Instagram or whatever and I'm seeing people out at parties living their lives and
or people in couples and you'll sit there and you're like oh I've noticed a hole that
I have in my life yeah.
So the children I was teaching were quite young their forms of social media that I found they
were using was online gaming and I found that some of the children who maybe wouldn't have
had access to technology at home they got a little bit left out then because they weren't
as involved.
I have had a parent come to me before about four nights and say my child doesn't use this
they don't have it and because of that they're being left out of conversations.
It really impacted them it was a really important part of their day.
Sometimes when I hear I heard a conversation why weren't you in the group chat I do see
the child they give a reason but they're trying to go a bit down in themselves then they're
not as chatty so I'd have to go over and chat to them.
Be playing online with somebody who they've never actually met but they're like oh I have
this is my friend and that's my friend it kind of gives a different definition to what
they call a friend now I think.
I think social media can benefit children that are shy and that they come into themselves
online in an online persona.
They can make connections with peers in their class online however it might not always translate
then into the classroom.
If they're not able to express themselves in real life they're not able to respond to
that they want to sit inside and be on a phone or a computer because that's what everyone
else is doing.
Which is really worrying because it can it could give them a sense of really being involved
in something but then they could end up feeling quite isolated if these social media friends
or online friends aren't actively present in their life.
I do think social media makes you feel lonelier.
I find the times where I've gone off it and I go away on holiday and I'm doing loads of
stuff I feel great when I'm hanging out with all my friends I feel amazing.
You spend a week alone with my laptop and just my social media I'm not getting that
connection I need to hear someone I need to see them it's I think social media makes
you feel lonelier because you're seeing everyone's highlight reel.
There are 3.4 billion active social media users and on average people have 7.6 social
media accounts.
It would appear to me that asking if social media makes you lonely is a little like asking
if eating makes you gain weight.
The answer is it can of course but not necessarily and not in everyone and not forever.
It depends on how you use it and why just as it depends on how much you eat and what.
Social media use can be fine, wonderful even in moderation but as with any lifestyle loaded
with processed foods an excessive intake of social media could be bad for your mental
health and for your quality of life and just as people need education around nutrition
we need it badly around technology.
It seems like social media makes us lonely when we expect it to replace our real social
lives rather than to aid them or when we allow it to take time away from relationships that
make our lives meaningful.
