This walrus didn't get these dance moves on his own.
They came from Cab Callaway, a 1930s jazz superstar and band leader.
Do you see it now?
Cab was a source of endless inspiration for early animators
who transformed his dancing into that walrus and a ghost
and a very moonwalky old man of the mountain.
The way these moves got from real life to cartoon
was a breakthrough in technology and method.
It's an idea that forever changed animation
when an inventor took pictures that had just started to move
and made them dance.
As riveting as that was,
early animation had a problem.
The first animated shorts didn't look right.
Don't focus on the drawing.
Look at the motion.
See how clunky his arm move is here
and how his shoulder doesn't move realistically?
Max Fleischer saw that problem too.
This is him, the inventor,
blowing bubbles in some of the first films
that revolutionized animation.
And this is the clown that did it.
See how the animation got from real life
See how naturally Coco the Clown moves
compared to the umbrella guy?
That's where the invention called the rotoscope comes in.
You can understand it from the patent application.
It was a way to film real movement
to create better animation.
First, they filmed live action motion in the wild.
For Coco the Clown, they filmed Max's brother,
Dave Fleischer dancing around
in a clown costume on Max's roof.
He was in front of a white sheet,
for contrast.
The sheet actually blew around so much
that Dave almost fell off the roof.
So don't try this at home.
That film gave them individual frames
of Coco moving around.
Like in the patent, they used a projector
hooked up to a car headlamp
to amp up brightness.
And it showed each frame on a screen
with tracing paper.
Then they just played it back, frame by frame,
tracing what they needed.
It had the creativity of animation
but the precision of live action.
The results were astonishingly smooth
and lots of people noticed.
The New York Times said Coco,
the Inkwell man, leaps as a human being.
And it made sense.
He was one.
Take Cab Callaway's performance.
Now, animators didn't have to guess
what subtle movements came in the middle.
They had a filmed guide to every frame.
Later, it helped out with Superman.
Using photos and film to model Lois.
Like here.
Gulliver's travels also had
hyper real movement inspired by
real motion.
When the patent expired,
other animation studios followed.
But Fleischer's work was
more than just one invention.
Now, these cartoons
and other ones at the time
are filled with tons of cringy stereotypes
that wouldn't pass muster today.
But the creativity, that,
that is not dated at all.
Here we go.
Fleischer Studios invented the bouncing
ball song where you can follow along
with the lyrics. Oh yes, there's a patent.
Max and Dave patented
multi-plane animation as well.
See how they could film the main character
moving and separately move
the background elements.
Like pictures and models.
This created depth and saved animators time.
It enabled gorgeous motion.
Like in this scene from Superman.
As it evolved, Fleischer animation mixed
all these technologies with skilled
artistry and improvisation.
And that's why rotoscoping is a versatile
tool still. Whether it's inspiring
some of the animation in early
video games, or in its
logical extension in motion capture.
Where real movements are given over
to animators fancy.
But even that undersells their achievements
a little. That cab Callaway walrus
cartoon, Mini the Moocher,
is a Betty Boop cartoon. But
it is a work of art filled with
infinite delights that tantalize
Scratch that. It is straight up weird.
The best way possible.
Phones have
lips, hinker chiefs talk,
ghost skeletons get drunk, tonsils
scream, the list goes on.
When cab Callaway
saw himself turned into a dancing
walrus, he fell to the floor laughing.
An invention made that work
but it was a different type of genius
that made cab Callaway fall to the floor.
You can patent a device
but you can't patent that.
That's it for this episode in this series
about big changes to movies that came
from outside of Hollywood.
If there are any other animation examples
you find striking, let me know in the comments.
I do want to take a chance
to underscore just how far outside of
Hollywood the Fletchers were.
In addition to their New York studios,
they had one in Miami, Florida.
And that is where Gulliver's travels
was actually made.
