First thing I remember was a lonesome whistle blow
And a young stream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town, not knowing where I was bound
No one changed my mind, but mama tried
One and only rebel child from a family meek and mild
Mama seemed to know what blessed us
It's by the all my Sunday learned
For the bad I kept on turning
And mama couldn't hold me anymore
And I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
No one could scare me right, but mama tried
Mama tried, mama tried to raise me better
But her weeding high tonight
That leaves only me to blame, because mama tried
Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Bet my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to still assure
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right, but I refused
And I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
No one could scare me right, but mama tried
Mama tried, mama tried to raise me better
But her weeding high tonight
That leaves only me to blame, because mama tried
And I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
No one could scare me right, but mama tried
Mama tried, mama tried, mama tried
To raise me better, but her weeding high tonight
That leaves only me to blame, because mama tried
That leaves only me to blame, because mama tried
