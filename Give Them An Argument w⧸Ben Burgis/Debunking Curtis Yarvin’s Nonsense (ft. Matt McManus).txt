So I had a debate with Curtis Yarvin a few months ago.
It was actually the day before the previous live show, the one we did in LA.
I was in Chicago debating Yarvin.
I don't know if I got my donuts worth from that debate,
because a lot of it ended up being about,
I mean, in fact, the debate was much more about history
than I thought it was going to be coming into it, because I thought,
I thought we were going to be debating principles.
It was about democracy.
And Yarvin is sometimes sort of like in his more provocative moments.
He'll call himself a monarchist,
where we can hear from Matt in a minute what he means by that.
So I thought we were going to be arguing about democratic principles.
But Yarvin, I think, was manifestly uninterested in doing that,
or really in arguing about much of anything.
And a lot of it ended up being, because he made these claims,
and he did a one-on-one,
we both did one-on-one conversations with the moderator,
with Thaddeus Russell, before the debate between the two of us.
And so at the very, very beginning, Thad asked,
okay, do you have anything you want to respond to?
And I was like, yeah, a lot, right?
And because...
It did have one of my favorite comments in the whole year, though,
when he was like, well, yeah, of course,
if you look at what historians say, they're going to agree with you, right?
It's like, oh, yeah.
Yeah, that is a new one to me.
I have never received that particular critique
that I assume that what historians say when I read them
is going to inform me about what happened in history.
And apparently, this is a totally wrong assumption,
and in fact, shows that I've been so brainwashed by the cathedral
that everything I say can be disregarded,
because I'm just assuming that you could read books
and gather information about what happened in the past
is the model that I'm working on.
Although, in this sort of previous exchange
with Adnan earlier today on social media,
you brought this up from our debate,
and you did point out something,
you put your finger on something that really infuriated me
in that debate,
if infuriated is too strong, it was frustrated in that debate,
which is that there's a lot of slippage.
And Matt has read far more of Jarvan's written work than I have.
I did some research before the debate,
but nothing like what Matt has been putting himself through
to write this Common Wheel article about Jarvan.
But this certainly seems to be a lot of slippage in general.
It's certainly the debate with me between people
of the past thought X,
and you should believe right now that X is true.
It's like there's a point early on where he was like,
well, so I should say,
just to set this up just a little bit,
that a lot of the sort of historical debate,
and it was about U.S. imperialism in Latin America,
and whether like Jarvan thought,
oh, we were doing too much promotion of democracy
in other countries that were just,
that in fact, that was the problem,
that the U.S. was just involved in idealistic democracy promotion.
That was going wrong.
And my view is what the fuck are you talking about?
The United States has, you know,
especially specifically in Latin America,
and I think he'd even mentioned Haiti.
I think he was the first one to do that.
I was like, look,
I mean, how many times has the United States
overthrown elected governments of Haiti?
How many times has the United States overthrown
democratically elected left-wing governments
around Latin America?
I brought up, you know, some of the obvious examples,
you know, about Salvador Yende and et cetera, et cetera.
And, you know, he always had something to say about it,
but he didn't quite address the point.
You know, it was like, oh, well, Salvador Yende
was a very Americanized cosmopolitan, you know,
and Pinochet was like a real Chilean.
It's like, okay, let's say that this is an accurate bit
of cultural commentary.
So the fuck what?
What is that to do with anything that we're arguing about?
He loved his people enough to send 7,000 of them
to an early grave in Chile's native soil oil, right?
You know, what else could the motherland want?
Yeah, exactly.
And he kept telling me that I should be reading
more original sources on Google books, which is, you know,
fine if you want to throw that at the end.
But it's also, you know, I mean, what?
It's a horrible waste of time during debate.
Like I thought we're there to like make arguments to each other
and respond to each other's points.
And if you say, instead of like actually responding
to the specific things I say, you just say,
oh, you seem very entrapped by this worldview.
You know, here's some books you should read.
You know, it's like, well, that doesn't respond
to the substance of anything.
But also, you know, so this came out,
what Adnan's talking about, the slippage,
I think came out most vividly in the discussion about Haiti.
Because, you know, look, my view of why Haiti is as much
of a mess as it is right now is that it has been
constantly fucked over by imperial powers going back
to the inception of the country and the slave revolution
that threw off the French.
And eventually to have the country be allowed to exist
for France to stop trying to intervene against them.
They had to make this treaty where they had to agree
to pay back the French for the reverse reparations,
you know, for the lost property in the slave revolution.
What do you think about like the slave owners, right?
Think about all the hard work that they put in
to managing those slave enterprises,
getting the people into line.
Nobody ever thinks about them and their contributions.
Why does it, yeah, Helen Lovejoy voice,
why would anyone do that?
And they didn't finish paying that off until I think
like 1947 is when it was finally like it ended
up being transferred during one of the U.S. occupations.
I think the one in the 30s ended up being transferred
to a U.S. bank, what they still owed,
but they finished paying it off in 1947.
Very shortly after that, like within like 10 years of that,
breathing room, they were saddled with Papa Doc de Valier,
who was a really brutal, like kind of death squad dictator
who was back to the hilt by the United States
for standard Cold War anti-communist reasons.
Poppy Doc was succeeded by Baby Doc
and who, you know, friend of Mother Teresa,
but not particularly nice person.
And then the de Valier regime was finally overthrown.
You know, it's like the late 80s.
They had the very first democratically elected
President of Haiti, Jean Bertrand Arrested,
you know, after the post-de Valiers,
not the first ever, but the first post-de Valiers
was removed in a coup where it's an open question.
You know, it's not a matter of dispute
that a lot of the military officers involved
were on the CIA payroll, like everybody acknowledges that.
It's an open question whether the company had any knowledge of it,
like beforehand, you know, that they,
or whether it was just that, you know,
they'd had a relationship with these guys
and, you know, coincidentally, there was a coup,
but at any rate, you know, the United States
did actually intervene under Clinton to put him back,
but then it intervened again under Bush
to remove him at this point directly by U.S. Marines.
Arrested's political party, Lavalas,
is, like, not allowed to participate in a bunch of future elections.
The current president of Haiti,
who after the one just now, at least,
was assassinated by some guys
who seem to have a lot of connections to Miami,
is the guy who came in after who were,
who nobody voted for and refuses to hold elections
and is strongly supported by the United States,
all of which is just to say,
I think it's not a great mystery
how Haiti got to be the way that it is.
I think there's, like, a pretty straightforward
material explanation of this.
Jarvan's view, as far as I can tell,
is he was coy about whether it was cultural or genetic,
but he seems to have some sort of racial explanation.
He said...
Oh, he does.
I'll quote from his book.
This is his text, Muldbug on Carlisle,
where he says,
In Haiti, we see one aspect of life without promises made and kept.
Poverty, corruption, violence, and filth,
in a word, anarchy.
Haiti is the product of the persistence of human anarchy
and an excellent symbol
because it symbolized exactly the same thing
to Carlisle and Freud.
Haiti is far more anarchic now than was in 1888,
which, of course, whose porta-prince
is the paradise next to today's.
The 19th century is Haiti
is the 21st century's whole third world.
So it doesn't really take a genius to sit there
and extract all these references to filth and garbage and trash,
and it's connections with the third world and Haiti
and drawn association between that
and all kinds of horrible racist views.
Well, he said in the discussion with Bea,
he said that,
well, when I think of a country, I think of a people,
and then he did the exact slippage
that Adnan was talking about where he says,
well, you know, if you read, you know, go on Google Books,
you know, Google Scholar, you know, you read these old books.
Everybody in like the 19th, you know, certainly the 18th century
assumes that there are these real things
that are like national characters,
that entire peoples have a certain character or whatever.
And the implications certainly seem to be that,
well, since they thought so, it must be true.
And I just, you know, like, I mean, just crassly.
I mean, my intuitive response to that is okay.
I mean, if you go back to like 1810, yeah, sure.
I mean, everybody more or less thought that, but, you know,
everybody thought all kinds of other stupid shit, too.
I mean, like, what, why is it, you know,
why is like a view having been popular in 1810
a recommendation for...
Well, let's be clear, you know,
the normal reactionary, and I've met a lot of them,
hasn't psychologically come to terms with the French Revolution.
It's still a store spot.
Mulbug is so fucking old fashioned that he still saw,
not just about the American Revolution,
although he's really sore about that.
He's pissed off about the English Civil War, right?
That's how fucking far back his great grievances go.
That's a special kind of reactionary, right?
That's like the point where even Joseph de Maestra
in the 18th century would have been like,
okay, man, you know, it's time to get over it,
you know, things have happened, it'll be okay.
Pat on the head, glass of wine, cigarette, you know,
it'll be fine, right?
Although I do have to say, Mulbug is entertaining
in the way that he'll sometimes tattle on himself
about his more so-called advanced views.
It kind of reminded me when I was reading him
of what Kanye did during that interview with Alex Jones,
where Jones offered him that beautiful off-ramp,
but he was like, you're not a Nazi,
they're trying to insult you,
and Kanye was like, whoa!
You know, just decided to just avoid
the easiest off-ramp in history,
because at one point in his book,
a gentleman in his book-
Yeah, when Jones was like, you know,
Nazis do a lot of bad things, right?
And Kanye was like, I think they did a lot of good things too!
Yeah, exactly.
But I mean, at one point in his book,
a gentleman deduction to unqualified reservations,
Mulbug is musing a little bit on fascism,
and he's like, you know, it just occurred to me
that Hitler reads a lot like me
if I were to lose 25 IQ points
and contract a bad case of syphilis.
And I'm like, did you just fucking tattle on yourself?
And you're like, wow, it's kind of weird
how I sound an awful lot like Hitler.
Eh, what can you do about it, right?
You know, a lesser man might take that as an opportunity
to reflect on himself a little bit.
They would, yeah.
You know, say, is it good to sound like Hitler?
But, oh yeah, I'm not pleased.
Yeah, I just wanted to come in there because I think, you know,
Matt, what you said strikes a chord with me
because in trying to think of how to make sense
to some of the absurd things he was saying in that discussion,
it suddenly occurred to me that if he is a monarchist,
if he is such a reactionary conservative,
he would look upon the American Revolution,
the French Revolution, all of these things as horrible,
you know, turns away from tradition.
And as a result, I mean, there's two things going on.
One is that he's decrying any of these changes and developments
so that when he's saying that America is this liberal order
that tries to globalize its system,
he, you know, there's a certain point from the perspective
of a monarchist that America, you know, supported and sponsored,
you know, was in favor of Republican revolutions
in, say, the New World, you know, you have the Bolivarian,
you know, transformation of South America.
Like, so there are things that he could, you know,
you know, fall back on in his analysis
to think that this is all part of a turn in history,
you know, that has gone down the wrong path.
And so it's the cathedral, you know, it's this new system,
it's this consensus.
All these historians are operating under the same,
you know, terms and it's all illegitimate
as far as he's concerned.
Everything, really, he can pick and choose
and say it's all illegitimate if he doesn't like it
because it's this departure from that historical moment.
And the second thing is that he, when he, you know,
articulates his view on America, you know,
being this liberal globalizing, you know,
he's against the Monroe doctrine, you know,
he's against Wilson's 14 points
because he believes that America actually operates
according to those documents and not according
to actual historical, you know, evidence, you know.
Yeah, you're not.
Like, when Yorven talks about, you know,
the United States policy towards Latin America,
I don't think the expression United Fruit Company
is going to come up very often.
Maybe there's not.
No, but also like, you know, Wilson,
he thinks Wilson is trying to promote democracy
throughout the world.
Well, you know, as it happens, you know,
if you're a Middle East historian,
you know that Wilson completely betrayed this,
you know, he meant fit for Europe
and he was caught by the contradiction, you know,
at the Paris Peace Conference.
There were attempts to present new constitutional kind
of government, you know,
they had a kind of constitutional convention in Damascus
in 1920, 1920, you know, 2021.
And they proposed the probably the most progressive
constitution in the history of the Arab world.
And of course, the powers did not accept that.
They turned over the Middle East to the British
and the French, you know,
which is what he would have wanted.
So he doesn't even know and understand
that the so-called primary documents that he reads,
you know, to understand, you know,
American political thought and so on,
you know, he doesn't know how to put them
into any kind of context and how to read them
in their context to really understand what they meant.
You know, who would help with that would be historians.
He would.
Like, you know, you could read some of those,
you know, some of those books by historians that like, again,
yes, I cannot, like, I cannot emphasize enough
that that was his critique,
that like, you know,
that like what I thought about what had happened in history
is like what most, you know, like historians thought,
which, you know, is okay.
This is a man who said in one of his first major pieces of writing,
which is his letter to an open-minded progressive,
that it wasn't the case that people like Chomsky
were dissident intellectuals.
In fact, Noam Chomsky and C. Wright Mills
were the power elites of the United States at their time,
and apparently wielded more influence than the police
that were arresting people like Miller Chomsky, right,
which is just a staggering bit of historical imagination,
if nothing else, right?
Yeah, I mean, I remember actually an old documentary
I saw about Noam Chomsky that his wife went to
during this period of like anti-Vietnam War protests,
you know, she went back to school,
got to grad school because she figured there was a good chance
that Noam was going to be in prison
and she was going to have to support the family
when that happened, you know.
So I don't think the Chomsky family were under the impression
that they were part of the power elite
and, you know, making decisions,
but this does actually get to something really important
in the art of it, right?
And by the way, if anybody's watching this and thinks,
okay, why are you talking about this bizarre reactionary crank
who is, you know, like, you know,
is mad about the American Revolution happening,
like, you know, why is this guy worth the breath?
I would point out that J.D. Vance,
who was just elected to the Senate from Ohio,
has actually on the campaign trail and interviews.
He referenced J.Arvin as a friend and an influence on him.
Well, so has Bannon and a bunch of the other fine people.
Steve Bannon?
Has done that.
The Blake Masters was almost just elected at Arizona.
The Senate has done the same thing, you know, this guy.
Peter Thiel?
Yeah, I mean, Peter, of course,
the reason we've all heard of him in the first place
is because Peter Thiel decided he was interested
and, you know, brought him out of his obscurity.
But now, unfortunately, he's not at all obscure.
And he does probably need to be dealt with.
But the thing something Matt just said, I mean,
I wanted to go to, because I mean,
I think this is a really important point.
In fact, in a weird way, goes back to what I was,
Adnan and I were just talking about with Harvey
with, you know, about the theory of history,
you know, he has this, like, really deeply idealist view
about all this stuff.
Oh, yeah.
Like, ideas are primary, which is why, like, you know,
like that bizarre comment about Noam Chomsky
and Sirite Mills running the world, you know, like,
that's, that's, you know, what he calls the cathedral is,
is, like, academics and journalists.
And, you know, but he thinks that, well,
because those people set, you know, the, you know,
they produce the ideas that, you know,
that means that, like, what, you know,
literal decision makers do is just downstream of that.
And so, like, really, it's the, it's the idea people,
the academics and journalists who run the world.
Yeah, I should say this,
pension for idealism as Marx detected,
is always more common in reactionaries than it is
in leftist thinkers.
And it's very easy to see why, right?
If you blame any social discontent on the distribution
of bad ideas, then the fault lies with intellectuals,
journalists, the people who are stirring up trouble.
If you're a materialist, then you have to say the problem lies
in relations of power, material conditions,
how people are actually doing,
and that inevitably leads you to adopt
at least a somewhat critical disposition
since these are things that you can't just
chalk up to a bunch of troublemakers
spreading a bunch of gossip and propaganda.
But I think that there is something that is actually
pretty unique about Jarvan.
And I say this not with respect,
but actually with a lot of disdain,
because from an intellectual standpoint,
his arguments are really cheap and bad,
and often, as Aidan said, historically really out there.
Like trying to say that the biggest problem
with the U.S. foreign policy over the course of the 20th century
is that people were too soft on communism.
The only thing you can kind of do is roll your eye
and say, oh, so you think that, eh?
Okay, well, whatever.
I know a few million peasants in Vietnam
and Laos and Cambodia who'd like a word about that.
Yeah, absolutely.
But what's distinct about him is, again,
this attempt to reconcile libertarianism
with this very authoritarian political program.
Now, he's not the first to accomplish this,
and he's certainly not going to be the last.
But what's really interesting that you can see
over the course of his writings is a transition
from really believing in the writings of people
like Ray Rothbard or Ludwig von Miesse
and then coming to the very Marxist,
I should say, conclusion that actually people will not be
satisfied living in this kind of libertarian universe
and that the freedoms that people like Rothbard
and Miesse want can't actually be secured
without an extremely strong state there
to actually compel people to adhere to this kind of program.
And what's really interesting is he's sometimes very overt
about that, where he says most people suck,
as I put it, the masses suck,
and they're not going to actually advance programs
that are good for them, which is precisely why it is
that we need the CEO and chief, this American Caesar,
to create spaces for freedom for the truly productive people
who will go out there and contribute everything
that's meaningful in this world.
And that's been a consistent through-line in his work
from the very beginning, and it's still the case now.
One of the stupidest papers that he's written,
and that's a high threshold, let's put it that way,
came out very recently where he said,
I'm bored with this whole red pill metaphor.
Let's get toking-pilled instead.
He actually condemns the conservative base
for imagining that in the future,
they will get to share in any kind of power
once the left is defeated.
He characterizes the left as high elves in this.
He says that the job with the conservative base
is to find certain kinds of dark elves,
that's the terminology he uses,
who will work on behalf of the Hobbits,
that's just named for the conservative base,
seize power, implement conservative policies,
and then the Hobbits will go back into their holds
and let the dark elves do their thing,
which will include, of course, banishing the high elves
to God only fucking knows where we're going, right?
Some kind of Gestapo.
And it's really, really, really, really disturbing
when you think that that's how much disdain he feels,
even for his own base, right?
Most of you, we are gonna be in charge,
we'll implement policies for you,
but don't ever fucking think that you're gonna be
get to have any kind of say in how it is that you're governed.
It's our job to figure these things out for you.
It's your job to appreciate it
and accept the fact that we're banishing all these people for you.
Sounds like Hitler.
I mean, no wonder he saw an affinity.
Well, that's also fucking remarkable about this,
because if you would make one accusation against fascism,
I would not say that that accusation would be
that fascism is too democratic.
That's the biggest problem with it, you know?
When I think fascism, I don't typically lean to,
God, you know, that really indicates
a lot of these platonic problems with democracy.
But that's actually Jarvan's position, right?
That there are a number of different reasons
why the right shouldn't go fascist any longer.
Some of them are strategic and some of them are moral.
I'll give them that.
You know, he says, Hitler did a few bad things here and there.
It's exaggerated, so-called, but a few bad things.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is he actually saying that's exaggerated?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, at one point he characterizes,
he wouldn't quite put it this way, right?
The Axis powers as the rebellion,
and the allies as the actual empire,
because the Axis never aspired to world domination,
on his view.
The allies already ruled the world.
Cathedral dominates the globe,
and so the Axis were just rebelling
against this world order run by the Cathedral.
And he says, you know,
I'm not making any kind of moral judgments
presenting it in this way,
because, yeah, the Axis were still evil.
But if you characterize something as the empire
and the Axis as the rebellion,
it's not hard if anybody's seen Star Wars
to kind of infer what the moral lesson
is supposed to be, at least historically.
Well, I mean, in the debate with me,
there's a point where he said,
well, it's, you know,
yeah, people would say,
whatever, but like, why weren't, you know,
why weren't we going to war with, you know,
Germany?
Why not with the Soviet Union?
Because, you know, they were like, you know,
that really shows that, you know,
that sort of softness on communism, you know,
that like Roosevelt thought it was worth going to war
with Germany and not with the Soviet Union.
And, you know, I mean, my suggestion back to him
was that the Red Army was, you know,
not in fact bombing London at the point when, you know,
when U.S. policy has been escalated, right?
I mean, like, this is, you know,
the United States was not the only player,
you know, making decisions and reacting
to the decisions made by others, you know,
in this series of events, right?
I mean, like Germany, you know,
Germany was actually doing stuff,
leading up to the United States and Germany,
you know, being in a state of war with each other,
ultimately, you know, declaring war on the U.S. first
after its ally, you know,
attacked it and, you know, whatever,
which is due to, you know, U.S.,
you know, embargo and, you know,
and demands against Japan,
but still like just this idea that,
you know, I don't know, FDR and his advisors
were just sitting around with a map of the world,
you know, deciding, it's like, yeah, you know,
who should we go to war with?
That's, let's do Germany,
because they're like ideologically further than from us.
Yeah, I was babbling about that also.
Oh, what do you say, Daddy?
Yeah, I was just going to say,
one of my favorite quotes from Harry Truman
whenever he was still in the,
was he in the house before he was vice president?
He actually said on the floor of whatever
last year body he was in.
Let's back the winner in the fight between
Germany and Nazis, you know, Nazi Germany and Russia.
If the Russians are winning, we back the Nazis.
And if the Nazis are winning, let's back Russia.
And I think that kind of sums up
America's foreign policy in that war.
Yeah.
And what's also baffling about it that really frustrated me
is anybody who's been in high school knows
about the history of appeasement directed towards Germany
and the fascist powers, right?
And anybody who's actually looking to the matter
with any degree of sophistication,
and I strongly encourage people to read
Richard Evans' third Reich trilogy if they're interested.
I still think it's someone to work on the subject.
Well, no, one of the reasons why the Nazis were shown
a soft hand at many points is there were plenty of people,
conservatives, liberals, and even a few socialists
in Western countries that actually admired
what they were doing, right?
Hitler as engaging in non-aggressive actions
when he remotorized the land,
when he decided to enact the union with Austria.
They even said, well, he says this is going to be
his last territorial demand when he claims this to date in land.
Hitler can be a trustworthy figure, right?
Why would he lie to us?
You'd never see that kind of tolerant viewpoint
directed in the 20th century towards any communist power
that was gobbling up its neighbors in that way.
And the Western states would just be like,
oh, I guess Stalin is certainly a nice guy.
We could trust him when he says it's the last territorial
demand that he's going to make.
Now, thank God we did eventually go to war with them,
and if only we had done it sooner, right?
But this entire historical narrative is completely
bogus and extremely self-serving,
and it does serve to whitewash a lot of the history
of the Second World War and the horrible things that happened there.
Even if Pertis will sometimes try to apply
some politically correct language to imply
that that's not what he's doing, right?
By saying, well, yeah, but of course the Nazis were evil.
Even if they were the resistance to the world empire,
they're still evil, so we shouldn't support them, right?
You know, from what I've read by Yarevan and from the debate
I had with him from the other, you know,
from his debate with Cenk Yuger, which I watched,
it seems to me like he's very slippery
about exactly what he wants,
because he has this kind of provocative mode
where he'll describe himself as a monarchist.
He'll say things like we want, I don't know,
some Silicon Valley CEO who says sometimes
to become the American Augustus, to, you know, which, like...
He has a long parable in his earliest book, actually,
where Steve Jobs literally becomes
the lord and ruler of California, you know?
Sure, why not?
It's a nice little bit of fan fiction.
Yeah, so we'll say things like that,
which suggests that he, you know, like,
taken literally would mean he's, like,
really seriously opposed to the American constitutional order
but that he's got this sort of, like, when he's out,
you know, when he's retreated to the mod, you know,
he'll say, well, all I really mean by monarchist
is that I think we should have a really,
really strong executive branch,
which, you know, that would actually be more democratic
because that's the only election anybody pays attention to anyway
is the president.
And really, you know, because the Constitution uses
the phrase chief executive, which he interprets,
like I'm not saying about context,
you know, he interprets as, like, meaning, like, you know,
a CEO and a corporation, which is obviously a metaphor
that would not have been available to anybody
who was writing the Constitution,
but, you know, he says, well, if you let, you know,
democratically elected presidents exercise more or less
absolute power, then that would actually be
the most democratic thing of all
because who pays attention to congressional elections?
And so, and then, like, sometimes they'll even say,
well, you know, FDR was basically like a king
because, you know, Congress was a rubber stamp
and he could do whatever he wants,
which, you know, it seems to me there's a lot of,
there's this big gap, you know,
between those three proposals that is toggling back and forth
between which are, you should have FDR,
in other words, you should have, like,
a president who's so popular that, you know,
congressmen feel pressured to support his policies
because they don't want their constituents to get mad at them,
which is, you know, fine.
Between that and presidents should basically
have all the power and Congress should have none,
which, you know, makes me a little nervous.
I think about George W. Bush and the ways
that executive power was expanded
during the Bush administration to do things like,
you know, detain and torture people
and, you know, send troops all over the world
and et cetera, et cetera.
But even that isn't an American Augustus.
I mean, American Augustus would, like, you know,
like, again, take it literally.
That would mean that we just, you know,
that we just don't have a republic anymore, right?
I mean, that's what Augustus's role was.
So as far as you can tell,
what does he actually want or does he just, like,
or does he just enjoy the game of keeping people guessing?
Oh, I think it's very clear what he wants.
But I will say just to your point,
this is one of the areas where I think he's a pioneer of sort.
And I wish I had read his work before I wrote my book
on postmodern conservatism,
because I would have actually just been here's patient zero,
right?
Because the way that he writes, including using the pseudonym,
writing on a blog, all these kind of pop culture references
that are intertwined with these very highfalutin kind of
appeals to any number of different figures,
esoteric figures in the reactionary tradition,
it means that anytime where he's pressured
in the way that you're talking about,
he can retreat into the argument that he's just joking
or that this is just irony,
or that this isn't meant to be taken literally,
or sometimes even just say,
of course, this will never actually happen.
So it's just a thought experiment, right?
And this is a very good defensive way of guarding himself
against accusations of any kind of extremism,
because if anybody sits there and says,
what you said is fucking horrifying,
he can just say, well, you're not in on the joke
and that shows how unsophisticated you are,
because you don't actually get what I'm going for here.
Whereas to the people who do take him literally,
he can lean in a little bit more and inhabit that identity
without these layers of irony and shading him.
But in terms of what it is that he's arguing for,
there's been a consistent through line
that's extremely simple and really quite horrifying,
which is that he genuinely believes
that we should have a libertarian society
by which he means maximal freedom
for a certain class of people,
those that he considers worthy, dark owls
or whoever it happens to be.
And the broader masses who suck, that was his term,
shouldn't be allowed any significant input
into political processes,
because they're never going to accept
giving these kinds of rarefied individuals
the maximal freedom to make everything better.
And this is where he differs from conventional libertarianism,
because he says, since they're going to try
to use their freedom to put limitations
on these rarefied bunches, this is why our people,
this is why we need a very strong state
with a very strong executive
that's going to essentially put them in their place.
And maybe they'll be better cared for.
Sometimes he does develop this kind of patronizing attitude
towards the masses where he says, you know,
they'll be better off having someone tend to them.
But that doesn't mean they'll get any kind of meaningful power
or certainly any kind of meaningful freedom
compared to the Peter Teals of the world,
the Steve Jobs of the world,
or Elon Musk, a recent obsession,
who claims to be an American Caesar, right?
And you can see antecedents to this
all throughout the American libertarian tradition,
the right libertarian tradition,
not the left libertarian tradition.
It's just never been made as explicit
as you see with Jarvan.
And in some ways, reading this
was actually kind of fucking refreshing,
because I'm like, well, at long last,
what we've been telling you is the inevitable outcome
has been stated clearly
because you've reached the conclusion like,
yeah, people don't want to live in a right libertarian universe,
so we're going to have to fucking compel them to with the state.
And it's like, bravo, you've reached a level
of 19th century Marxism.
It's quite an accomplishment.
