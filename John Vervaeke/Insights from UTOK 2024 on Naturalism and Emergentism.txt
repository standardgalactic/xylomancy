Hello, everyone. The video you are about to see was originally recorded at the Utah 2024 conference.
It's a conversation, a panel discussion with Greg Enriquez, Alexander Bart and Benita Roy.
We get into some very deep discussions about transcendent naturalism and some
convergences, contrasts, and criticism. I hope you enjoy the video.
All righty, friends. First off, welcome. Good to see so many folks here.
I'm just saying my heart tickled to have an opportunity to have this conversation
with some of my very, very dear friends who have emerged in this space.
And of course, John, who will be joining us in a second, has been really tremendously influential.
It's been tremendously meaningful to connect with him. And I think since 2018,
Bart and I hooked up 2019 in the Intellectual Deep Web. And I got to say, there are few people
in this world who are both more entertaining and more deep and more profound than John,
than Alexander Bart. His Intellectual Deep Web is inspiring, his way of being in the world,
his vision across the breadth. Tyler Groke asked at the end of the last session,
well, is Utah really encompassed everybody? And I was like, well, not somebody like Bart.
Well, Bart's here. I'm sort of outside Utah, although I think they dance well together.
So Alexander, Bart, thank you so much for being here. I really look forward to dialoguing.
And over the last couple of years, another dear friend of mine, Bonnie,
we have explored. I've started to learn. I'm still an amateur, but it's starting to really
get a grip on process ontology, on what true naturalism really means, as opposed to the
fake person that John and I are doing. And I'm really looking forward to sharing about the layers
of metaphysics in relation. And so what we have today is then a very exciting exploration and
discussion where we're going to be talking about transcendent naturalism. John and I will be
representing that. Bonnie is going to bring her perspective, at least at some times,
has talked about that as fierce naturalism. I'm not sure if that's still the term that she is
using. Yes. And what that means. And then we have transcendent emergentism. And the title of our talk,
and I think me and John and Bonnie are okay with naturalism. We'll explore that. We're going to
get into what Bart feels about naturalism versus emergentism. And so we're going to be exploring
the relationships and excavating the fault lines in relationship to these two sets of perspectives.
And so here we are. If John's around, let me just see. I'm not sure if he's in yet or not
in relationship to that. I don't know. He's still not quite. Oh, there he is. Hey, John,
wonderful. Can you unmute yourself, friend?
If you unmute, ask to unmute.
Now I'm unmuted. There he is. Okay. I think we're all here then. All right. So John,
I just gave an overview introduction. Bonnie, Bart, Johnny, and me. I need to say that once.
We're going to explore. So what we thought we'd do today in terms of basic order is that John's
going to kick us off talking, giving us an outline of transcendent naturalism. Of course,
John and I did a series on that. I thought we had a lot of excellent guests. We're going to wrap
that series up with Lehmann Pascal and Bruce Alderman, who obviously will bring lovely things to
say and to summarize that. So we're going to start with that. Then Bonnie's going to give her take,
explore a metaphysics that I think overlaps some, but also potentially critiques. And then Bart
will bring his perspective. The last thing I'll say is coming off of, obviously, I mentioned last
time you talked sort of the enlightenment gap coming off natural science. I look around today,
you got materialism, idealism, and dualism basically in the West. I think all of us would say
none of those are adequate. We need a new framework, a new philosophical framework
for the 21st century and beyond, and it's time to start laying that down. So here we are.
Let's get it rolling. John, if you would, take it away. I introduced you already and already told
you what a brother-in-arms you are, this process, and how much I admire and respect you and your
leadership. And that goes really for, certainly I was in Bard and Benito, and I should have that
already. So welcome, my friend. Thank you, Greg. And I'm looking forward to talking with you, Benita,
and with you, Alexander. So Greg asked me to give an overview of the argument. I'll try to keep it
as brief as possible without leaving it with too many major gaps. I won't go over the argument in
detail. I will often just refer to arguments that were made in detail in the previous conference
presentation and on the series Transcendent Naturalism. So Transcendent Naturalism comes out
of two proposals. It comes out of the proposal of extended naturalism, plus a proposal of a kind
of extended naturalism that supports strong transcendence, where that transcendence is not
just psychological in nature, but has real epistemological and ontological significance.
And there's two main arguments here. Each one is a meta argument, a convergence argument,
a convergence argument for a properly leveled ontology, and then a convergence argument for a
conformity theory of knowing. And then the proposal is, if you have a conformity theory of knowing
with a leveled ontology, you can actually afford a strong transcendence. I will add to that something
that I didn't make in the original talk, just a brief note on why that can be properly understood
as sacred. So extended naturalism is the proposal that science, well, let's take what naturalism
is standardly understood to mean, is that the natural sciences, that is where the naturalism
comes, are those projects that dictate to us our fundamental ontology, our fundamental structural
reality. Now that is usually interpreted without much justification as all of our ontology has to
be derivable from the ontology of the natural sciences. And I argue that that actually doesn't
make sense. You also have to include in naturalism everything that is presupposed in order to do
science, your ontology needs to include that, or you actually have a blind spot in your ontology.
That's the new book, by the way, by Evan Thompson, by Adam Frank, Theoretical, sorry,
Anastrophysicist, Marcello Kleiser, a Theoretical Physicist, and Evan Thompson,
a Fourier Cognitive Scientist, and just some shameless self-promotion. The chapter on the
blind spot within cognition explicitly talks about Vervecchi's theory of relevance realization
as the blind spot within cognition. So yay, John. Okay, so anyways, the idea here is
if you do not include the standpoint from which you are doing science, then you actually
have an incomplete and therefore incoherent ontology. And what I want to argue is what
does science actually presuppose? Well, it presupposes scientists doing science. And how do
we work that? How do we have to extend our naturalism in order to include that? I take a look at
three convergence arguments. One is from Blackowitz on what he calls the real difference.
He argues that reductionism is based on the premise that only what is shared between things is
ultimately real, that he argues can't be right. Real differences matter. Real differences are
presupposed by real information. If there's no real information, there's no real intelligibility.
And so you need real difference, which means you have genuine emergence.
The next main argument comes from whole. And this is the idea that communication needs redundancy.
Redundancy needs levels of reality to it. And causal signaling is a form of communication.
And therefore you need real emergence. Again, I'm not going to go over these arguments in a way
that is intended to make them persuasively convincing. I have done that in the previous talk.
We did that at the intro to transcendent naturalism. I am just referring to them. You can go back.
And I'm going to take it that you're extending me the good faith that there are persuasive
arguments for each one of these claims. The third argument comes from the work of Yoraro
that science needs real structure. And she makes a distinction between bottom up causes
that change actuality and top down constraints that shape possibility into potentiality. And
science, of course, needs top down constraints. These are things like equals mc squared, which
are not events. They are real constraints, real structuring principles in reality. So so far,
we need a leveled reality in order to get real information, in order to get real causal signaling,
in order to get real structure. And then we have Smith's vertical causation argument,
Volcker and Smith, which is the argument to the effect that the measuring device cannot be at
the same ontological level as what is measured, especially when we come down to quantum entities.
And so you need a real leveled ontology in order for measurement. So notice what science presupposes
real information, real causal signaling, real structural principles. And it presupposes real
measurement, integrating all of those together, all of those presuppose a leveled ontology.
Vervecky makes a similar conversion argument that I made at Ralston at length, which is
in order for us to do science, we have to include the scientist on our ontology,
and that converges with everything I've just said. Why is it not just emergence up? The problem
with just emergence up, and this is not just my idea, many people have talked about this,
is it gives you the level, the emergent level is epiphenomenal, it has no causal powers in its
own right, or no constraining powers in its own right. The problem with epiphenomenalism,
it's an oxymoronic term. It is a category for which we can find no non controversial members.
And it presuppose, it indicates that something exists, but does not make any difference in
reality and therefore is not knowable. I'm not going to go into that argument at length. I think
if your, if your ontology leads to epiphenomenalism, it is a modus tolens, you have led to a reductio
adipocertum. So you have to have real emanation and real emergence completely interpenetrating
each other. You have a continuum. And when we talk about levels, all we're doing is picking
out things that are particularly explanatorily causally relevant. Whole has a formal proof that
each level has a distinct set of causal powers to it. And therefore, when we're talking about
levels, we're just picking out something that is most causally relevant to the particular kind
of explanation. But that is not that it is just an epistemic convenience. The levels are epistemic
conveniences that refer to a real emanation, emanation emergence continuum. Now, what about
the meta argument towards a conformity theory? So the opposite to conformity theory is our current
modern theory that knowledge is a matter of representation. I have something in my head
that represents the world. Pickstock in her astonishing book, Aspects of Truth and New
Religious Metaphysics from 2020 reviews all of the distinction arguments that are supposed to
support the proposal of representational knowledge and shows that within analytic philosophy itself,
they have all been seriously undermined. The analytic synthetic distinction, of course, has
been undermined by Quine, the distinction between a conceptual scheme and its content,
by Davidson, the fact value distinction, and the is-ought distinction by Putnam,
Casebeer, Verveke has one that relevance is both a cause and a reason. And the theory data
distinction by Quine and Duhem. So all of the distinctions that were supposed to
open up the space between mind and world for which representation with the bridge was the
bridge have been completely undermined. And what that returns you to is a conformity theory
that the mind and reality are co-participating in shared principles of individuation,
identification, intelligibility, and they're often mutually shaping each other
all the way from these construction up to cultural worldviews.
I also made an argument that cognition is all the cognitive sciences are converging on the idea
that cognition is a dynamic continuum of emergence up and top down, bottom up, top down,
completely interpenetrating, dynamically realized processing. And if that was not tracking the
grammar of reality, if that grammar of cognition was not tracking the grammar of reality, we would
be facing a radical skepticism, a radical solipsism, because it would be that the mind in principle
could not know reality, and we'd be into this very deep Kantian problems, and I won't reveal
all the sort of tensions and contradictions within the Kantian proposal. So we get a conformity
theory. And then that links up with independent arguments within 4eCogSci, launched by Gibson
about the importance of affordances for perception and action and knowledge, Heidegger and the
allostetic notion of truth that is deeper than the coherence or correspondence notion of truth,
and Vervecchi's proposal that relevance realization is inherently transjective
and binds the subjective to the objective together and is therefore more real. And all of these
converge on a conformity theory of knowing. Now if you have a real leveled ontology and a conformity
theory of knowing by knowing it, I know I'm not only engaging in psychological improvement,
I'm actually knowing levels of reality that are otherwise inaccessible, and I am changing ontologically
to different levels of the self that correspond through participation. Actually, I want to erase
that sentence, levels of the self that participate with levels of reality. And so that is strong
transcendence. It is making a fundamental epistemological and ontological difference,
not just psychological hygiene and improvement. I would add to that the current work, integrating
the work of Filler, who argues that pure relationality has to be ultimate because you can't get
relations from Aristotelian substances. Of course, our science has pure relationality
at the bottom and at the top, and scientists are seeking the relation between the cosmological and
the quantum. Nishita's argument that Aristotle's substance metaphysics, a substance is not stuff,
a substance are independently existing objects, things. Aristotle's ontology, which we still
fundamentally share, is that things are ultimately real and that relations and processes emerge from
it, and that is tracked by a subject predicate logic. Nishita shows you get Filler's argument
that that doesn't work, relationality is deeper than subject and predicate and deeper than
substance and its properties. Nishita shows the Aristotelian metaphysics is inherently
contradictory because it depends on predication, which is of universals, but its ontology claims
that individual substances, individual things are most real, and this is the problem of how can
the universals ever know the particular, if the devil's medieval philosophy until the Aristotelian
framework collapses and you get nominalism, the proposed, and what they decide to do is keep the
substance ontology, individual things ultimately exist, but there are no real relations, no real
patterns, they exist only in the mind, that's nominalism, that of course gives you a dualism
because the mind is a fundamentally different kind of reality than reality, and then dualism
gives you all the disasters of the meaning crisis. These are all arguments for abandoning
a substance ontology and understanding that a no-thingness of pure relationality is what is
ultimately real. Finally, making use of the work of the atheist Canadian, yay, philosopher
Schellingberg about what do we mean by the sacred, he talks about the Tripoli transcendent,
and this lines up now with transcendent naturalism. The sacred is that which is ontologically
ultimate, and of course we can conform to and participate in the ultimacy of pure relationality,
nail-platinism, and Zen both talk about this. Sodorological, it can transform you. By entering
into this relationship, of course, you get fundamental transformation of human beings because
you're engaging in strong transcendence. It saves you, it liberates you, it frees you in
epistemologically and ontologically significant ways, not just psychologically,
and it's axiological. It gives you the reciprocal opening relationship as you get the ground of
the self is opening up to the ground of reality, and they are ultimately non-logically identical
because they are co-realizations, co-participations in the dynamic realization of pure relationality,
and that reciprocal opening gives you a capacity to fall in love and to involve the whole of the
self without in any way being self-involved, and this would be a touchstone for all other
normative evaluations, so it would be axiologically transcendent. I can develop all of those arguments
in greater detail if needed, so transcendent naturalism puts us into a participatory relationship
with ontological ultimacy, sodorological ultimacy, axiological ultimacy, and that means it is also
sacred, so transcendent naturalism gives an account of sacredness and ultimate reality
that is nevertheless still consistent with naturalism, but that naturalism has to be extended
naturalism. That's the gist of the arguments and some recent additions I have made to them,
so thank you very much everyone for your time and attention. Wonderful, thank you so much,
and so I think that's a brilliant and crisp summary of the core tenets.
Christian put it in the group and I mentioned that John and I have done the series,
it brings in a number of different thinkers. I'm not going to get into it now because I did a
review of UTalk and certainly have raised some questions, but let's just say what John just laid
out is a ball from Roy Bashkar and say there's a philosophical under-laboring, a richness, and
of course then extending into modern cognitive science that fits sort of with UTalk and sort
of a lock and key. I am not a philosopher by training in relation, I got some notions,
but the ways in which UTalk is structured as we've dialogued is fundamentally consistent
and I think affords certain kinds of elaborations on what John was talking about, but I'm not going
to get into that because we're really talking fundamentally about these different positions,
what I want to do now is turn the discussion over to Benita Roy so that she can share
her perspective on naturalism, what John offers, and what she brings to bear in relation.
Can you, you can unmute. There you go. Woman's worst nightmare.
First, I want to thank John and Greg and all their guests because I've watched many,
many hours of their transcendent naturalism series and I really like season two. I think
it was, you know, you designed it so there's a lot of shake-ups and different ideas and stuff
coming in and I think you broadened the problem and showed that there's a real critical importance
to this, but also that it's not easy, right? I don't, I don't think we, any of us think it's easy.
So I'm glad that John ended with axiology because for me,
why does this all matter? I think where the rubber hits the road is that if, if we could come up with
a system that is a transcendent naturalism that really helps people
close the gap between the is and the ought, I think that this, this is would be its biggest
contribution as we struggle with science and the psyche and idealism and reductionism and stuff.
This is kind of like the path toward that, but I really think that the goal,
one of the huge goals would be the axiological goal.
I want to start with a quote and the quote is to remind us, I think we all can agree with this
quote, but we're here on line and we're going to do a lot of talking and use a lot of words, but
I just want to honor the fact that for me and I assume for you that this is a constraint and that
we're after something that's really personal and sacred to us and meaningful to us personally at
a deep level. And so the quotes from Warren Heidi and he writes, how should one live,
not by painstakingly constructing a linguistic replica of a corner of the cosmos and then running
repeatable experiments and quantifying the results, but by carefully reflecting on what we are
and what living well means for us. So I think the journey often looks like
constructing a linguistic replica of the corner of the cosmos. I think those are the tools that
we use, but it's, you know, I just want to remind us that I recognize in all of us that that certainly
is not our goal. I want to, I don't really have a model or a system or an argument to make,
I want to introduce some tools that I think are useful in this project. And one tool is
metaphysics. And my definition of metaphysics amongst many others is, I think the purpose
of metaphysics is to distinguish the true from the real. Now, we have to define those very,
those very precisely, and there's many different ways to define them. But the way I, in meaning
about that, is kind of like what Baskar talked about, science deals with the actual and not the
real. And so when, so that for me, the true is what science can get at. And I define science as
the set of protocols that lead to actions, the set of protocols that lead to outcomes predicted
by theory. And so science is in a box, a methodological box has a lot of constraints, and it
can create true theories. But this is quite different from the real. And I'll talk a little bit
about more about that later. But I think that, and these are words you hear, you know, John,
is talking about the transcendent as dealing in the realm of the real, and not the realm of the
actual, as Baskar would say, or the true. So I think that's an important tool to look at.
I want to talk about stratified reality. And stratified reality is what we do when we say
there's information energy and matter and then mind and then mind to and life and this and that.
There's, you know, you go different cultures and different periods of human history,
and people would not have organized the ontological stack that way. And so I was thinking this
morning about where in our evolutionary history, pre human, did we still, we first
encounter this ability to create ontological stacks. I mean, chimpanzees aren't running around
creating ontological stacks, people are. But because I think I believe in the continuity
of the animal mind with the human mind, I'm thinking this morning, where, where can I find
the earliest template or the feeling sense of this kind of activity. And I thought about how
animals will reduce a complex puzzle into parts. They do this. And, and so these are different
steps of action. So I want you to think about what, you know, this is what John said,
what is the standpoint from which we are doing this? What is the standpoint from which we are
creating stratified reality? And so I want you to feel into this sense that, okay, it starts in our
pre evolutionary history and our animal nature of reducing, reducing is not the right word,
because reduce is like a bad word or separating or distinguishing or discerning a complex puzzle
into parts. As far as I can see, that's the first instance. And then this is what's fascinating,
this carries on with early man into toolmaking. And the fact that we can teach toolmaking through
a series of steps, and there's a series of parts. And then this starts this whole
evolutionary advantage, I think is what we are doing when we're, we're, is where it all started.
And then now I want to reflect on something. And that is breaking into parts has always been a
protocol for problem solving and making, but only recently has it become a protocol for getting at
what is real, meaningful, or for moral choice. Now, I don't know what to make of that statement,
because that was my insight this morning, driven by, you know, the, the energy of the
participation of this panel. But it's something to, it's something to think about. And maybe
that's a good thing, because maybe we are this, we're doing a problem solving thing. But maybe,
maybe there's something that needs to be converted there. Okay. However, given that,
I'm going to talk about what people do when they do stratified reality. And there's something very
interesting. There's, there's, there's a tendency to make a mistake. And that is, if we say,
let me just give you an example. So if I say, what is pizza made of? Okay, you can say, well,
pizza is made of dough. And then I say, what is dough made of? And you say dough is made of wheat.
This presents a simplistic and reductive sense of what is going on. Because a pizza is made
of dough, but all, but made with the people who, you know, proof the dough, the cook who's doing it,
and the oven that's cooking it, and the oven, and blah, blah, blah, blah, all of this, the with,
the with is lost. The with are all these verbs that don't survive the analysis. Okay. Then we
can say, well, what is dough made with dough made is with made with wheat and the agricultural
revolution, which is made with human evolution, which is made made with the genealogy of the earth.
And so one of the things that happens when we ontological stack along categories is all the
with is gone. And all, and it's kind of like the physicists that when they say, well, 97%
of matter and energy, we can't get our hands on. And so there's something about this enterprise
of categorization stratifying reality that loses all the with. So that's the first thing I want
to point out. And I only want to point out really one other thing. And that is,
if you notice, as you go down, here's pizza. Here's dough. Here's pizza and a whole bunch of cooks
and stuff in the, and the fact that you bought the flour. Okay. And then here's dough and dough
is made with wheat. As I go down the systems that are left out become larger, not smaller.
So Sabina Hobson Felder has this strong critique against physics and so does Eric Weinstein. And
it's part of it is this problem. Because if by the time you get to matter, and then you get to
atoms, and then you get to subatomic particles, the Higgs boson is made with the whole scientific
enterprise across all of human history, and the politicians and the money. And she's recent
Hassan Felder's recently come out and said, there's a real problem with the scientific enterprise.
And this problematizes something like the Higgs boson. And so there's sense that the lower you
go down, the more is actually has to be included to justify the simple thing you are saying exists
in this category of reality. So I just want to add those. I haven't put it together. And
I'm hoping that Bard is up for the challenge. Thank you very much for your time.
All right. Thank you so much, Benita. I took some notes. So what we're going to do,
certainly after I'm going to hand it over to Bard, he's going to offer one thing I will say,
I hope for our conversation is naturalism, emergentism, contrast, maybe Barb will bring that.
I found a lot I resonated with and what Benita said, some questions that I had. I look forward
to jumping in those. But we're going to hand it off to Alexander Bard and let us have it, Bard.
I'm kind of shocked at how much we agree. But I knew we would probably. But I think there's
also a lot here in the nuance. And Benita and I, I'm going to do the sales pitch right away,
isn't done because it's fucking working. It's nonprofit, by the way. It's process event. It
came out last year. And I realized I had to do metaphysics when I wrote this six book,
who might I had to do, I had to sit down and do metaphysics, because the way we did human history
could not be explained unless we had, you know, an understanding of how we do universal history.
So I had to go down to the dirty work of actually going into metaphysics for the book.
When I thought I had wonderful conversations this fall already, I really look forward to
continue those. So I'm here with Bonita against John and Greg's. You know, it's Abba again,
I'm Swedish, you know, Jordan and Benny against Anne and Fred Magnetta. But it's like, but we had
wonderful conversations. She gets the book and I really appreciate Bonita. She gets the book
in the sense that I'm the son of Hegel and she's the daughter of Whitehead, you know,
and I've always found Hegel and Whitehead to be scaringly compatible with each other.
Hegel being still not understood in the Anglo-Saxon world, basically, because we were all blinded by
the enormous turn with the monocontent, the content turn it's called in contemporary philosophy.
But what happened was that only a few years later in Germany, there was another shock,
at least on our part with the content turn, which is the Hegelian turn. So I will return to Hegel
and bring that into the conversation because a lot of what John is asking for. And I totally agree
we have to do this turn and get out of the meta crisis. But actually the work was done
by Hegel and Nietzsche in the 19th century. It's precisely by reading Hegel and Nietzsche
through each other. I worked on this for 30 years. I think we can see that there was a turn here.
There was a turn away from dualism. The last dualism was, of course, the monocontent
onto a monist worldview where the obsession is with difference. Okay, so everything relates to
everything else in the universe. And I totally agree with John. Epiphenomalism is just the dead end
because obviously my thinking relates my physicality too. It's just all the different things that
exist affect everything else. So what we did in the book, there were two things. One of them is that
we realized that three of the philosophical disciplines that I'm a philosopher, I'm not a
scientist. When I'm a scientist, I'm an economist, which I will totally leave out of this conversation.
So the economist Alexander Boer, you don't get seen today, but I'm a philosopher and an artist.
So allow me to be, if possible, maybe we will need to hear even more of the philosopher. And then
Greg and John, who are fantastic scientists can stay with the science. But my pointer is that we
needed to look at the philosophical disciplines themselves. So being tired of doing ontology,
because I'll actually find ontology to be quite easy. There's ontology and there's ontics.
Essentially, that's what happened after Kant. So then everything starts moving and everything is
relational. And that's Hegel. From Hegel through Nietzsche on to White Ted and on to the Lus,
we have realized that everything is relational fundamentally. All this very difficult to think
relationalism, it's absolutely necessary. The object out there is a byproduct of the relation.
There are a lot that comes after the relation. So I think we all agree on that. But Hegel did too.
The thing is with Hegel is that this dialectical method, he just said that no, there is no fixed
point anywhere in the universe ever. There's no individual. I'm an individual and many different
people. I was a different person yesterday than I am tomorrow. By the way, I die all the time and
I'm born all the time. Divigiality is the normal state of things for us to be human. So this was
already Hegel because with this dialectical method, there is no fixed points. You must imagine that
you live in the universe where you're not allowed to have fixed point unless you know you're only
having a fixed point to use it to then try to understand something. So it's like you borrow
into that fixed point and that's called negation in Hegel. So what we did was that we took ontology,
epistemology and phenomenology and threw them all into one big mess, which is what Hegel actually
did. What he said was basically that ontology and epistemology and phenomenology are in themselves
all three, three relational siblings in the world of philosophy. And he started doing ontology and
epistemology at the same time, which is how we overcame Kant because in Kant they were separate.
And suddenly with Hegel, it's just like he cracks jokes at Kant all the time. He's just like, no,
no, no, it's not like there's a phenomenon there and there's a numinal there because actually you
are engaged and involved with the numinology. So we call it phenomenology, just a cracking joke
about it. Hegel constructed phenomenology. So the thing was that by doing this and calling it
narratology, I think we come down to something that we can agree on is basically very human.
Because in Hegel, there's a subject and there's a substance and it's a sub-relationship to the
substance, which is what philosophy is all about. There's always human subjectivity constantly
returning in Hegel. And whenever you try to come up with anything without you being involved with
the world, Hegel says, no way. That's cheating. Back to you again, because you are involved as
philosopher or as partner of the philosopher or as human being. You are involved in the world and
we are humans. Philosophy is a human endeavor. So narratology enabled us to say that this is
the trick with dialectics. Always have a three. So if you want to spice up your sex life, bring
a third person into the bedroom. I highly recommend it. This is very Hegel. What Hegel does is that
no, dialectics is not the dichotomy in opposition between two points. Like if you have yin and yang,
you must split either the yin or the yang. And Taoists actually do that, Bonito probably agrees,
by splitting on the yang side. Always take the masculine side to make the split there because
men are so fucking schizophrenic anyway, women are not. So you split on the side and say there's
yang and the yang within the yang. And then the yang is opposite the yin. This is how Hegel works
all the time. So by using ontology and epistemology and phenomenology as three philosophical discourses
and then saying they're all three interconnected one another. And this is the Hegelian absolute.
The Hegelian absolute is to recognize that and to recognize there is no fixed point.
And using vocabulary from the Greeks, we then say that there's a logos and there's a pathos and
there's a mythos. Human beings have three different ways of describing reality or describing the world
that makes sense of the world. They use a logos, use a mythos and use the pathos. And science,
of course, is on the side of logos fundamentally. Pathos is just our emotional lives, our feelings
and blah, blah, blah. There's no such thing in AI by the way. Electricity is not blood. Let's put it
that way. The pathos is incredibly human, animalistic, whatever, you know, all the forces inside of you,
the force of nature, pathic, pathical narratives, you know, news, a cast, pornography, anything
that's brutally real thrown at you is a pathical narrative. And then there's mythos and mythos is
actually as often Hegel to go between, meaning that since logos and pathos can never be unified
in themselves as logos or pathos, you have to invent a mythos. And this is the temporary story
about ourselves that human beings have to create all the time to make sense of the world. So Hegel
allows us to have a temporary platform, which we agree, at least now we can agree, we have a paradigm,
we have a certain historical period, we agree on certain values, we create a society together and
off we go, right? So to create that temporary platform, the mythos about ourselves currently
in the digital age with AI arriving and climate change and everything to arrive at a mythos is
what we need. The metacrisis is a lack of a new mythos. It's a nihilistic state where the old mythos
is dead. It's, it's not a death of a God, it's a death of a paradigm and a new paradigm has to
be installed and we're in between paradigms for the most. Okay, so this moves us on to metaphysics.
So what kind of, what kind of implications does this narratological model have for metaphysics?
What it means that like you guys, the three of you here, I hate reductionism, reductionism,
silliness thing ever. Bonita just pointed out perfectly. So simply, by reducing the pizza to
the wheat, it's idiocy, right? The problem is that I don't know why, but especially the computer
scientists to make all the technology, they are all reductionist and they tend to go to either
reduction down to the sort of simplest monad, which where apparently the entire history of the
universe is pre-programmed or something, they go all the way down to reduce everything down to
some kind of atom, which would then explain everything else that happens after, because
everything is not deterministic from that point, which I totally disagree with. But they also go
the other way and said, well, I'm conscious and there's consciousness and since I'm the center
of the universe, and I'm a fucking narcissist, because I'm a computer scientist, just made
billions of dollars, therefore, everything has to be about me. So everything can be reduced to
a consciousness. All I tell those guys is that here is a rock, go and cuddle with the rock,
have sex with the rock and talk to the rock, not with me apparently, because the rock has
consciousness and you can talk to it, right? And off they go. So reductionism is the enemy,
but it's being this difficult to get rid of reductionism. I know all you guys here in the
thread say, oh, relations, yes, of course, relations prior to a lot of our old relations,
you have no idea of difficulties to actually sit down and try to do relationalist philosophy.
This is why to genus is like Hegel and Nietzsche and White Ted to do it. And it's really,
really hard. But okay, but if you try to do it, you got to remove all those things out there where
you lose track. So what I'm proposing is that I'm sorry, but the word nature is just the opposite
of culture. And I'm defiant here. Nature is not superior to culture. They're just different
emerges as nature emerged and culture emerged. And like Greg probably graced me, they're equal.
If you're going to do metaphysics, don't do don't do axiology, we do metaphysics,
leave axiology, you can do that later. It can be its own fourth story, whatever,
leave axiology, just try to be as neutral as you can, try to describe how the world functions.
That's all you try to do here philosophically. That's metaphysics. So you say, okay,
so where do I start them? Well, here's the great thing. Bergson. Bergson said, why is everybody
obsessed with why there's something rather nothing? Because that's just interchangeable,
like you were nothing, then you were born, you were something, and then you die, you're nothing
again. There's something and nothing all the time. That wasn't even a philosophical question,
this like betrugation. And then Bergson said, what really strikes me with reality and with
the universe is how much difference there is. God, there's so much difference and difference and
difference upon difference and difference between differences and differences and differences all
the time, which is relations. Relationship is obsession with difference. And I'm obsessed with
it. So I start my philosophy right here and now with you guys. And then I said, what philosophy
is concerned with, what metaphysics is concerned with is that shit happens. And then the question is,
what is shit? What kinds of shit are there? And what does it mean that something happens?
Okay, then there's a great word for that, which is emergence. And we can then locate
mergers as we temporarily say, emerges is like the most important happening that ever happened to us.
So we sit here and describe the word 21st century. What is the most important thing that
ever happened to us? And this is where Greg got some of the ideas from and Greg and I started
into changing, you know, knowledge with each other a few years ago, is that it makes sense
then to create these different emerges that have happened. Well, apparently some kind of
big bounce or big bang, whatever happened. And physics came out of that. And we have chemistry
and we have biology. And biology and physics is a hard problem to begin with. You don't need
mind and matter to have a hard problem. The hard problem is everywhere. Because if one thing is
irreducible to something else, probably the problem is hard just because you're using the
wrong language. If you use the language of biology, try to get physics, you're going to go dead
wrong. If you use the language of physics, try to get biology, it won't work. So biology is just
a different emergence vector compared to physics and the different emerges vector. I even allow
chemistry one as well. And then we would always say mind. And as Greg says, the might has produced
culture and culture is radically different from all the natures we had in the past. So we have
a cultural emergence vector. So when we look at the world, we have these different emergence
vectors. And then we could start make sense of each one of them independently by refusing to
reduce any one of them to the other ones. Can you see how flat this becomes? So it's an emergentism
to begin with. So this emergentism. Now here's the problem though. Something could happen.
You know, shit happens. Something could happen that forces us to rethink how we look at the world.
It's happened in the past, quite a few times. It seems even like every time a new paradigm comes
right now, the internet came and took over the world. And we had satellites everywhere. We're
all interconnected with each other and AI comes along. And of course, we start seeing networks
everywhere. And then we live in a network dynamical world all of a sudden. And then of course, we say,
well, everything is religious. Yeah, because to us now, here, network dynamical universe to make
sense of this, for me sitting here is waiting talking to you guys like we're in the same room.
Magic. Yesterday's magic is tomorrow's technology. Magic. Okay. So the world changes.
And our world, you have to change with it. And we're only human. That means the emergentism
has to be transcendental. And here's the trick. It is so, so easy by human mind, which is stuck
with reductionism, to try to find rules and patterns for emergencies. Say that, well,
an emergency is objectively when this takes happened that it's an emergency. And then Hegel
and I just said, no way, no way, baby, you can't do that. Because if an emergency occurs,
it wasn't pre-programmed. There was no creator God that dictated beforehand what constitutes an
emergency. It's like Hegel says, it's only in his side that we human beings construct a necessity
of the past and say that because now with what we know now, that was an emergency, but that was not.
Okay, that means the number one rule for transcendental emergentism is that it disqualifies any
general emergency theory. There's no general concept to what emergency is beforehand. What
happens is that when a certain emergence happens, the entire theory has to be thrown out and reconstructed
as a new transcendental emergentism. And that is the transcendentality. It's allowing us to
completely change everything. Or like I say, when people say they don't believe in God, well,
haven't waited long enough yet, meaning God could come. Looking at AIs, getting scared like God,
and we might need God because we haven't mentored the devil. We did August 6, 1945, we blow up a
bomb or ocean up the devil, very much exist, and we mentored the devil. So we have to do theology
again and understand we didn't mentored the devil. Where is God to save us from the devil?
Right? Now, if you do that, if you start to think about the word like that, there's incredible
freedom in going for a transcendental emergentist perspective. And why I use the word emergency
rather than nature is because it's a purely metaphysical theory. Greg and John are doing
science metaphysics for science. I respect that. If you do a purely metaphysical theory,
it's better to work with the merge emerges because it's absolutely neutral.
It just says that shit happens. It says nothing else. It doesn't say nature, it doesn't say culture.
And it says that if an emergence happens and we in hindsight, we living the 21st century will agree
on that these things are the most important things that ever happened in history. And then we can
start looking at these are the most important things that ever happened in human history,
because at the same time, as you can see, so these dramatic events to change history forever,
and we know how to live with the consequence of that, erosion might be one of them. Okay,
that's an emergence transcendent emergentism applied on human history. And then we can start
understanding society. So that's essentially how you do metaphysics. If you're a little
philosopher like me, I guess. All right. Thank you. Each of you. I think we've gotten a very good
summary of the various perspectives. I'll just put a let me let me put a little you talk spin.
Then I'll invite John, Benita and Bart to just talk amongst themselves. Certainly if I have,
there are a lot I want to say, but I really want the three of you guys to have some dialogue.
I want to remind folks, since we're here in Utah land for the conference, that Utah is situated
in a particular kind of problem. And that is what I mentioned earlier in terms of like Bart is
coming from a different place. It is very important to understand the situation of Utah. And that's
crucial understand both its power and its limitations. Okay, it is structured to solve or it emerges
out of a very particular kind of justificatory problem, which presupposes the natural sciences
and the kind of knowledge they're trying to generate. And how does it then relate to psychology
as both the science and the subject? And I am, Utah is an architecture is concerned with that,
and it emerges as a naturalism as a function of that. That does not necessarily say that, oh,
that is where everyone should be situated or a philosopher that takes a pure proper metaphysical
stance should be situated there. So I'll just say that in relationship to the Utah stance.
So I can hang with Bart and basically be like, oh, there's a different framing that we should
be aware of. And if we have those framings, I think there's a lot of participatory dance
that can be effectively take place. So I'll offer that. And it's very similar comment in
relationship to Benita. And really, actually, then there's the synergy with John's view in particular.
And I think that is a function of being psychologists, cognitive science, et cetera.
So I'll offer that sort of as a synergistic, but I also want to get into some disagreements.
I have some questions for both Bonnie and Bart, but I'm going to pause. I'm going to hand it back
to John and see where you want to take it, John. And then we can just go in some dialogue
amongst the four of us and then start really bringing in some questions.
Yeah, John, go ahead. Yep. I think, yeah. Good.
Okay. There, thank you. First of all, that was really rich and wonderful. I really welcome
Alexander's. Everybody seems to be calling him Bard. Is that what you want? It's okay.
Sometimes sub-Bard, but then it makes me feel in high school,
teenage boys often use last names as opposed to first names. So at least in Canada,
I don't know why we do that. First of all, I'm very happy to get into a discussion with Hegel.
I've been doing, as you probably know, Bart, there's a renaissance about Hegel going on.
And the work of Brandon, the work of Pinkard, the work of Farnath, Zambroga,
all these people. I'm going through all of that literature. I'm going through it very carefully
with Dan Ciappi, especially Hegel's binding of the notion of rationality into reciprocal
recognition between individuals, not only synchronically, but intergenerationally.
And I think that maps, by the way, very powerfully into current work on extended cognition,
collective intelligence, things like that. And you always need to ask, where's the agent that's
doing the cognition? And I think Hegel gives us an alternative agency. He famously talks about
the I that is we that is I. And that's the kind of agency that is doing this more fundamental
ontology. And I think in that sense, I'm in fundamental agreement with you. And then trying
to work out, you know, how does that agency operate? And I won't get into the details about that.
I think that is a very significant problem. It's a problem that is now becoming central to
40 cogs I. So Hegel is coming in in a very big way. So I think in that sense, we're in agreement.
I'll speak about Whitehead in a second, and then I'll return to Benita. I do have an issue with
Hegel in that. And I think this comes out very clearly in Pinkard. Hegel talks a lot about the
socio cultural cultural historical processes that make the kind of persons, the kind of agents,
we need all these practices, as he repeatedly says, that makes us makes us into the kind of
cognitive agents that can recognize the inconsistencies within a particular way of life,
a particular form of life. And of course, the phenomenology traces, tries to trace both that
out. The problem I have is I feel that at times Hegel verges on a performative contradiction.
He is using the propositional to try to point to the non propositional. And
he doesn't really give us a theory of practices or an ecology of practice. And
and that can't be just propositional, you of course have to use language, but
you have to actually engage people non propositionally. That is the way in which they learn practices.
And I would put to Benita, I think she's right, we don't ultimately get at reality through truth
statements, we get at reality through processes, practices of realization. And that's where I
would bring in what Benita is talking about, I totally agree. We can't, we need ecologies of
practices because realization is how we get conformed to reality as distinct from truth.
And then the issue then comes up, okay, well, what what does that look like? And I think this
takes us into some work that's going on now about some of the work I'm doing about the deep
at the heart of the rational. And I think this is already presaged in Hegel, you find ritual,
you find rituals of recognition and forgiveness, and you find the generation of the spirit of trust.
Barnett does that very well. And you have additional arguments for why at the heart of the
rational, we find ritual, we have to use all these imaginal things. Look, simple, one example of many.
To be rational, I have to reflect on my own cognition. Oh, well, where do I do? Well, I go
into this interior space. Was that a literal space? Well, no. Is it a merely fictional space? No,
it gives you access to your cognition so you can correct it. It's but it's neither fictional
nor literal. Well, what is it? It's imaginal. And you and you're engaging in ritual because
you're seriously playing within an imaginal rain, rain realm, I should say, in order to bring about
the fundamental kinds of transformation in metacognition that is constitutive of rationality.
So at the heart of the rational is the rich is ritual. But that doesn't mean that ritual is
irrational. Ritual has a non propositional rationality. It's not the rationality of coherence.
It's the rationality of does your is what you're doing in your ritual context. Does it transfer
systematically? Does it transfer broadly and deeply to many domains of your life?
And does it transform you profoundly? Does it reach into many levels of the psyche and
transform those that when when you get systematic transfer and systemic transformation, that's why
rituals survive. That is how they survive. That's the rationality. That is what we that's
that's how we judge a good ritual from a bad rich. Well, so you find the ritual and the rational
mutually profoundly interpenetrating each other. And for me, that's the where the work of the
Kyoto school, especially Nishita is so important because Nishita develops, you know, he follows
the Zen ritual into the experience, the experience, not to put that in serious quotations of nothingness.
And then he does explicitly, by the way, a neoplatonic right investigation into the grounds
of intelligibility. And he gets to the basho. And he shows that the basho and the the Zen experience
of nothingness are completely interdependent and inter reliant. And you get basically Xenoplatonism
about Whitehead. I think I was just at the McGillchrist conference at the California Institute
for Integral Studies. And of course, you know, and Ian and I agree on, you know, the right hemisphere
is about the Gestalt and the left hemisphere is about the features. And I can give you all
the features of the bird that doesn't give you a bird. You need the Gestalt. That's where the
intelligibility actually hangs. And that's pure relationality. The right, that's what the right
hemisphere is about. I'll just plug in real fast, John. Matt Siegel wanted to be here. He's actually
at a conference. He sends love. And of course, we've talked to him and talked with him, Bonnie.
And he's an excellent process philosopher. I'll just make that nod as you mentioned.
Yeah. And I just want to finish very quickly. I don't want to monopolize. And then the thing there,
of course, is the left hemisphere works with parts within a formal system and well-defined
problems. Just getting a paper published now showing that you can't computationalize
relevance realization because the process of formalization, the process of translating things
into a formal system is not itself a well-defined problem. And it can't therefore be grasped by
a formal system. Formalization is not a computational function. It is no way of running a formal
system. And so you get that the right hemisphere has priority. And the right hemisphere is about
pure relationality. And Ian and I fundamentally agree on that. The reason I bring that up is
in Fuller in his astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being,
makes the argument. And Matt Siegel and the other people, the Whiteheadians agreed that
Whitehead is basically running an argument that was developed by the later Neoplatonist
about pure relationality, about emergent salamination. What Whitehead adds that I think
James, I know Fuller personally, what James misses is that process of that, I think both of you are
putting your finger on, which is the radical creativity. And I think that's what Bard wanted
to point out too. Whitehead, the mini become one and then one is added. That drawing together
of all the widths isn't just a stagnant interrelationality. It's pregnant. It creates
a newness, a novelty. And what I want to add to that is that that means we have to introduce into
our ontology radical uncertainty. If you have radical emergence in which you can't predict the
emergence, but there is some novelty introduced, you are facing radical uncertainty, which means
by definition, no formal system can ultimately track reality because formal systems require
the exclusion of uncertainty. So if there really is radical creativity, which is what I think
Whitehead adds to the Neoplatonist, and I think what Bard is pointing to, we face an ontology in
which uncertainty is not just an epistemic matter. It's not equivalent to probabilistic risk that
we can calculate. It is radical uncertainty, which then means we cannot grasp it with a formal
system. And I think that's the convergent with what Bard was saying. And I think that's also part
of picking up on what Vanita was, I think, pointing to. And I'll end my responses there.
There's 17,000 more things I want to say, but I was interested in also
I think sacredness is the bridging notion between the ultimacy of ontology and the
ultimacy of axiology. The sacred is that which is most valuable, but it is also bound to what is
most real. And I was trying to make an argument that if you get to this ultimate reality, you
have the triple transcendent, which gives you sacredness. And I think if you have sacredness
with unformalizability that is captured, realized, I should say, not captured wrong word,
that is realized in a set of practices, I think you're very much into what religion
was doing for us. And that would be my response. Lovely. Okay, so how about I hand it over to
Vanita and see what thoughts she wants to pick up on then Bard, then we'll really open it up,
folks. You can use the question and answer chat. I see one in there already. I'll also
check the chat box for this. And I know we'll come in, but I want to give Vanita and Bard an
opportunity to respond to that. You guys certainly ask each other questions as well. And I'll be
checking the Q&A as well. So Vanita, thoughts? This is so be kind. And so as John said, there's a
million things to go through. I want to say this may be a little bit of plug, but I am on the last
panel, and we'll have a chance to talk about my conception of God. So I'm going to leave that part
out. Although it would be nice to just put that here. I want to talk about what I think. First
of all, I have to say this because I have to kind of tease Alexander Bard. Okay, so Bruno
Moutour wrote this book, Speculative Grace. And it really sounds very much like you creating
religion with a flat ontology. And I just think only a true genius like Bard could use Hegel as
an icon for a flat ontology. So yeah, so that was genius. So brilliant. But I want to, I guess
what I want to do is kind of perform what I think Whitehead is doing. And that is everything we said
about the difference between the true and real. So that's the bird chair. And then he says,
so then what do I have? What do I have to experience reality? And basically what he boils it down to
is I have what the Buddhists would call self validating experience of the real. And this is a
feeling that the most fundamental way I can express what this experience is, is a feeling
that things are real. And so from this, he says, as I interpret him, as in my fantasy of being
with Whitehead, he then says, well, if this is so instead of having like a metaphysical ground,
this is what I truly believe is the most fundamental thing I can say about myself.
And then he makes his leap. This is the metaphysical leap. Maybe all of reality
works on this template. What if all of reality, maybe it's not just a coincidence that my experience
is that this self validating feeling that something is real. And in this feeling itself
validates two things. And this is where the transcendent comes in. It validates that my
experience is real and replete. It is whole and full. But it also validates that it's not complete.
That there's a remainder in the cosmos. And this creates the sense that there is more reality.
So this is extremely important experience. And I believe this is the kind of experience
that sustained Whitehead's work. I've never read a biography of him, but that it brings
truth to me. And I just want to combine this with something that Diana Foshe says.
She's a student of Panseps. And she talks about the clinical experience of
transformants. That the psychologist and the client are working toward this,
what she calls, she says, it's an evolutionary arc that's deeply wired in humans for
transformants. And that truth in this sense, which is reality, is this trust or comes from the word
trough or trust. It's this inner understanding of clarity that is the marker for awakening of
perception. It emerges from awakened perception as a core truth or trust. To trust, to truth,
is to behold. And so I think that these kinds of languages, these kinds of
confidence in the human experience is a potential point at which we can begin to
investigate and share and sing and celebrate the confidence of the real and share this peculiar
sense that the real is always never complete. And there's always a latency in our experience.
So yeah, that's what I'd like to put in the space. That's awesome. I did not expect Diana Foshe to
pop up. I'm a fan of hers, AEDT, and that's Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Approaches.
And it is absolutely the case that modern, emotion-focused elements, gestalt frameworks,
to me, the word that I would definitely want us to hit here is primate-mindedness.
The idea that the mind is a propositional reflector that's going to represent,
and that's what's split off, is one of the, to me, deep errors of the Enlightenment.
Mindedness is the embodied contact. And clinically, what we see so much of is a disconnect,
a fundamental propositional disconnect. You can argue, certainly, Yama Gilgios John
and saying modern society, in part, is propositionally personhood disconnected
from the primate embodiedness. And so much of what we do clinically is attempt to connect to that in
a relational space that creates a shared, non-propositional, intersubjected, I'd call it a
mind-to-be space, to connect to the real. And it's so lovely to see that bridge happen in terms
of me as a clinician. That's sort of an unexpected turn, so I just had to prop in there. Let me
hand it over to Bard, and then we'll really start to engage in question and answer from the audience
and whatnot. So there's two quick responses to Bonita and Greg, because we've been in a
lot of conversations, and we'll, Bonita, this is Whited at his Hegelian vest. And please remember,
I use Hegel for method. Hegel was wrong on many things. John can be short of that. He was wrong
on many things, but he was brilliant when it comes to method, because with Hegelian dialectics,
we arrive in Western philosophy with a complete set of how to think relationalism.
And Whited just does the same thing. And that remainder, that's exactly the negation within
the subject in Hegel. So you have those things there. So perfect, Bonita. And as for you, Greg,
this is why I am, as a psych analyst, I am fighting to get psych analysis out of the
digital science, because as a science, psych analysis failed miserably in the 20th century,
but it took off and became a philosophical discipline. And as a philosophical discipline,
the 20th century was, it was anthropology became philosophy. It was psych analysis became philosophy.
And most of all, you know, to do Hegel, I had to do Marsha McLuhan first, because there's no media
theory in Hegel. Hegel thinks ideas develop over time. No, they don't. What develops is, of course,
again, relations between human beings and different technologies. And because different
technologies develop over time, they change the life world. And we actually take to take, we tend
to take to the technologies and improve on our lives, run the ones to make up our miserable.
And because we do that, we can then expand, we can learn how to read, write, count, and we can
mass duplicate and do kinds of amazing things we do. And that's exactly why I think Hegel is only
method and nothing else. Leave Hegel for the rest. That's exactly why Marx and Darwin, the other
guys that came after Hegel, all went to the material real world and threw it at Hegel with
the dialectical method. But the method is great. So I, this is why I'm a great fan of Greg. And
where I'm involved with the U2K, UTalk, is it called UTalk? UTalk, yeah. UTalk is great.
UTalk, because I really believe psychology needs a reformation. It needs a massive reformation.
It gets stuck as a service to governments basically to fix people to send them back to work over the
past 50 to 100 years. And what I loved about Greg's passion was the fact that he said,
I'm a psychologist. I'm going to take psychology seriously. I'm going to do what Aristotle meant
with psycho and logos and do real psychology. And this is exactly why I totally support the attempt
to do a proper psychology as a science, which of course, then connects to John's work as a cognitive
scientist. These are great scientists, sciences, we need more of them. Okay. So for me to do
psychoanalysis is now to do strictly an art. It's nothing but an art. It's a philosophical art.
For me, psychoanalysis performing through people is basically taking the entire history of velocity
down to one single human being and then put their individuality into a philosophical perspective.
It's teaching people how to do a philosophy about themselves. That's what psychoanalysis is.
So psychoanalysis, I work today with psychiatry and I work today with psychologists. What I do is I
arrange teams here in Stockholm where there's psychologists, there's psychiatrists,
and there's a psychoanalyst. And there are three different perspectives looking at human beings
and it's stunning how quickly we can get to results and solve problems and give people the
quality of life and heal. So I'm all for this, again, narratology. Like I told you,
when you have a dialectical relation between three things, it's usually very, very productive.
Don't try to unify them into one thing. Don't try to turn logos, pathos, and mythos into one thing.
Keep them separate. Live with the dichotomies. This is Hegel. Live the dichotomies and it's
going to be productive and it's going to be great. Okay. Now, I want to respond to John,
because I'm just going to write a word down here in the chat channel. Got to put my glasses on
to write it down, because this is the next project I'm involved with and I'm thrilled about. It's
probably my seventh book and everything else I'm doing. Zoophism with a Z. So here's the take.
When I started traveling to Asia in the 1980s and realized the religion and philosophy had to
meet again and Eastern spirituality was amazing. And I was totally with Ken Wilber that it would be
embarrassing for my generation of philosophers to start with the Greeks once over again.
No, it didn't start with the Greeks. The Greeks just wrote a lot. The Arabs saved their texts
and the Arabs saved the texts for us. And then we, in hindsight, we made up the Greek system,
you know, the cradle civilization, whatever, and this sort of mythology about Europe.
Josephine Quinn's new book, How the World Made the West. Amazing book. Better than Sapiens or
whatever. It's the biggest best history book ever written by a woman from the UK. And it just kills
the idea that Greece started civilization. So what I did is that was that I started looking
into Asian philosophy and I started into looking into the Indian and the Chinese and Japanese and
Persian traditions. And then I discovered the Persian tradition is the original Greek philosophy.
The word philosophy is from about 600 before Christ. It was used already by Indian Iranians
1100 years earlier as Maastalias now in Avestan Persian, which means the love of wisdom.
Basically, the Greeks just borrowed and he had the keys Heraclitus. So for all these things about
Neoplatonism and Zen, if you look at the Silk Road and you look at the Silk Road, try it,
as I call it, which is the traditions of Buddhism with Shaivism as well, in India. And then you
got Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrianism in Persia. And then you got Taoism in China. Then you got
all these different spiritual schools that would never really be fought with each other. No recorded
conflicts whatsoever. Basically, just one from one oasis town to the next along the Silk Road.
And you found slightly different variations of the same spiritual themes. Trade routes, great.
Whatever spirituality we're going to next historically, human beings, we should definitely
look at the trade routes for inspiration because these religions are non-digmatic,
they're spiritual schools, they're follow practices, they're follow rituals,
and they basically fix our lives every day. So we get rid of the destructive bullshit and our
mindset, drop it somewhere and stay with the constructive mindset and build on that. And
so when I started Zoroastrian, the original texts, the Gathas in the center Vesta, translated by
Germans, 19th century, I discovered, wait, this is exactly Heraclitus. Heraclitus said the Greeks
should not be Greeks. Heraclitus said we were Persians. We're part of the Persian Empire.
What's wrong with being Persian, right? Heraclitus maybe even was Persian. But the thing with
Heraclitus is that by comparing Heraclitus' fragments to Zoroaster's Gathas, which I did
30 years ago, I discovered this is going to be the gold mine I'm going to work from.
And what I'm now doing, what we're probably doing now is basically the Zed in Zufism is,
of course, Zufism. Be taking back Zufism from its origin. Zufism, taking it away from Islam.
Sorry, guys, but you didn't invent this. You always hated it and you always badmouthed it
because it was modest and all those things that we love. So basically, Zufism is a modest
reinterpretation of Zufism as older than Islam. And we then discovered that this is exactly what
Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met. And Zoroastrian Buddhism met in contemporary Central Asia.
And of course, out of that, we got Bodhidharma, who was not a prince. I mean, that was a trader from
Sogna. We got Babasavana, who is not an Indian prince. He was another trader. He came from Tajikistan
today and he came to Tibet. So Varayana and Zen are just to me drenched, drenched in Persian
philosophy as much as their Chinese were Indian. And these are the richest traditions I can find
in the world today. See, if I'm going to do religion and philosophy and go back 5000 years and go to
find the gold mines and do whatever we can do today to understand ourselves and our history as humans,
this is the gold mine. I'm totally obsessed with it. I can't do Peru and Mexico too.
Other guys have to do that. But I'm totally obsessed with duration and with heritage. And
I think with John and I both heading, maybe this is the future where we can go into conversation
future. I think we're heading is that if I pursue Zufism, I mean, when John just mentioned the
Kyoto school, tears came out of my eyes right away. I mean, these are my months I spent in
Zen temples in Korea and Japan. This is exactly what I love the most about this conversation.
So I'm just dropping towards Zufism for the first time here, because my team here is kind
of agreed. We call each other Zufis now. You can call it Zen Zufis if you like, but we are
practicing now and living a Zufism. And we're obviously finding other Zufis out there around
the world who also managed to live with this sort of monist spiritual tradition with daily
practices. So just want to put that out there and then say that Neoplatonism, maybe then John
can dig deeper or whatever. I don't get too stuck with the Neoplatonist. I love Hellenism.
I think Hellenism was the most fantastic thing ever. But for me, it's actually deeper. I think
before Plato, we go before Plato with the priests of critics, we discovered they did philosophy
flux. They did Relationalism. Relationalism is the oldest philosophy. It's rather later when,
you know, the Greeks start thinking and mathematics comes into the picture,
Pythagoras, everything. And they're so fatigued with mathematics, they think, well,
there could be perfect forms out there. Well, that's an interesting idea, but it's not actually how
the world operates. Today, it's the computer scientists with zeros and ones. And if they
have billions of dollars, they think they're philosophers, we're in a really dangerous spot.
So we have to respond to that whole sort of computer science attempt to turn the world into
zeros and ones and nothing but zeros and ones and create this sort of deterministic nightmare that
comes out of it and respond to that with what John perfectly calls the radical uncertainty.
The radical uncertainty is Hegel's. We are terrified of our freedom because the future is
completely contingent. It is the past which is a necessity because the past is locked up.
History in Hegel is like a zigzag. So everything that's exact is the past. Don't change that.
Amufati niches and just accept that whatever happened happened. That's factual truth. But
the future is completely scaringly contingent and open. And we are active agents engaged in the
future. And for me, that's being a Sufi. So I'll leave it at that.
Well, lovely. John, you want to respond to that? And then I'll take some questions from the audience.
Yeah. Bart, you may be pleased to know that the next big series I'm working on,
and it's going to be titanically bigger than my previous two, I'm going to go on like
on location. It's going to be at different levels of media presentation.
A macro, a mezzo, and a micro is called the Philosophical Silk Road in which I actually
pick up the proposal. Now, I talk about Xenoplatonism, but we can quibble about things like that.
I think, I think, you know, Platonism plays a role in Sufism too. But I don't want to get
mired in a historical argumentation here. I think the orientation is very much aligned.
And to my criticism of Hegel, I'm not going to merely talk about this. I'm going to,
this has become a personal pilgrimage for me. I'm going through a purgation process right now
that I have not called for, but it's called me, in which I'm fundamentally preparing to actually
go to these places and be transformed by looking at the past, but by also drenching myself in what
I call the geophilosophy and the culture and the history. And so making myself
a vehicle, that's two pretentious. At least put myself in service of the advent of the
sacred that is happening right now in response to the meeting crisis. But it seems like what
you are talking about and what I'm talking about, though not identical or deeply convergent. So I
just wanted to reply to that. That's the next big project. Right. So that's, that's really lovely.
And actually, there's a question from Victor. So I'm going to go to some Q&A. I'll see if I
could pick it up in the chat if there are other kinds of elements. If Victor wants to unmute,
he can read this or I will read it for him. I think it's a fascinating question.
Wait a second. I'm not sure. Why don't I go ahead and read it, Victor, if you're around and you
can unmute and then you can dialogue. And so here's the question. Our being in an emergence
pervades our collective awareness, gestured at as a time between worlds. How can a philosophy of
transcendental emergentism inform science such that the preferable emerges? Like where do we want
to go? What do we cultivate? What's the relationship I think between facts and values? Is there a
direction where we're cultivating preferable? I hope I don't put too many words in Victor's
mouth, but I'll throw that out there and see if somebody wants to pick up. What are we oriented
toward? What are we trying to do in form of science? I would also wonder also about practices, etc.
I would first of all say that one of the things that comes out of this in Pickstock does a lot of
work on this and so does filler. But other people have, I mentioned case beer, putnam, some of my
own work. The fact value distinction, the is-ot distinction is breaking down. It doesn't mean
there aren't differences, but there are differences like the difference between two colors. They're
on a continuum of degree and they're not differences in kind. You can't actually ever state a fact
that is not simultaneously a value judgment. You can't make any value judgment that is not
simultaneously a statement of fact. They are non-logically identical, but they are inseparably
interpenetratingly bound to one another. And I think as long as we still frame this as we have
to solve the is-ot problem, no. I don't often invoke Wittgenstein, but here's where I think
Wittgenstein is appropriate. We don't solve the is-ot problem. We are in a place now where we
dissolve it, and then we get back to an ontology that allows us for profound connectedness to
reality. And I think for me, any way forward that doesn't prioritize that connectedness
to the religio in a way that is rationally self-confident, sending, rationally self-correcting,
all that sort of stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about here, and that's part of what Hagel
was on about. It is rationally self-correcting. It's just not strict logistic logic, right?
Because the process is to be self-correcting or you can't distinguish foolishness from wisdom.
But I think for me, what comes out of this, and I can make a deeper argument, but wise love,
agopic love, like what is guiding you to loving more wisely and what is allowing you to love
wisdom in an interpenetrating manner, I think if people are looking for a practical normativity
to guide them in practice, that's important. And then one other thing I would say is give
up the monological standpoint. The evidence is not overwhelming. We reason better collectively
than we do individually. Experimental evidence is merging. And this is what I would say,
not pushback on Bard. I think this is amplification. The dialectic has to be accompanied with a
diologous, which is dialogical practice, because that gives you the cognitive agent that is actually
capable of doing this new kind of realization of a new kind of ontology, in which fact and value are
no longer separate, in which theory and data are no longer separate, in which analytic and synthetic
are no longer separate, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bard is right. This is hard. But it is
already happening. And I think we should orient to the places. Here is one of them. And there are
many others where it's happening. And we should do our best to culturally try to bind all these
places and practices together. That would be my recommendation.
I agree totally with John here. It's just called Nartological Dialectics in my delingo, but it's
exactly the same thing. So it's very humbling to understand how dialectics works, and you can't
arrive at a fixed point anytime. I think the really scary thing right now out there is that the people
who were diabetic have gone fundamentalist and gone hysterical. As we're seeing in the Middle East
right now, that's terrifying, especially if these guys have access to atomic bombs and can blow us
all up. That's a very, very real threat. And the reason why it goes hysterical is because
fundamentalism is like the end state of something that's already dead. It's like imagine an ideology
which is zombie-like. It is almost dead. So the last thing you do is that if God does not intervene
in the world, as he should do according to your dogma, you have to act on God's behalf.
The scary thing right now with Islamic Christianity is they might get the Armageddon.
They prophesied about it, but it's all self-made. This is terrifying. This is very, very real.
My recommendation then is to say the revolution is currently completely on the technological side,
and that's scary because the revolution is going hay-walk right now and needs to be contained.
For me as a human, that means I react exactly the opposite way. I retract. The most radical thing
to do as a human today is to retract. Like John so wisely says, like we all do here,
retract, step back, go into retreat, observe the world from the outside. And yeah, it's about love.
It's about finding that spot where that love is, and feeling, be human. This is why we can't do
philosophy without spirituality any longer. It's just another data. But what I'm saying is that
what Hegel did is that he basically said his absolute is on the meta level, precisely because
he doesn't allow any absolute on the formal level. That's exactly why Hegel is great in the sense
that he says that the only absolute I have is that there is no absolute in the sense that
there is only movement and flux all the time. And all we can do then we try to think those
fluxes are dialectical processing and dialectical thinking. And that's what we can do to not arrive
at any fixed point, only temporary solutions to temporary problems. And that's what we do all the
time. That means it's incredibly anti-dogmatic. That's the whole point. And the anti-dogmatism
is exactly what we need more of the world today. Whenever you can, if you're going to be a missioner
about anything today, you're going to be a missionary about anti-dogmatic, go anti-dogmatic
and dissolve these dogmas out there because they're the ones that really affecting us.
Bonnie, did you want me to respond to that?
Yeah, I wanted to ping on what was where John and Barbara were talking about philosophy is
dialogic. And then I saw a question pop up in the chat, could Bonnie give us examples of fierce
naturalism? So I can kind of answer, build on the dialogic by answering with what I would call
fierce naturalism. Okay, so on the one hand, there's on one level, I completely agree that
philosophy is dialogical. But I think we there's so the fierce naturalism would say yes,
but not dialogic at the level of words and thinking with thoughts. And this is where
if you think of the concept of a stack, I think that so for example,
if you can imagine atoms, atoms are dialogical, they're resonance with each other, there's either
constructive or deconstructive interference. And this is a kind of feeling between the
resonance. And then we get to sentience. And sentience is a dialogue through touch,
you know, so the worm oscillating in an ordered environment is touching the environment.
So that's I touch, and then we have cognizance, where these are gestures, these are physical,
in emotional aphid laden gestures at the animal mind level, let's say, and that's
dialogic gestures are dialogic gesture is touch at a distance. And then we get into the Hellenistic
and the lyrical philosophies, pre Socratic philosophies, where people are saying or singing.
So this is a calm response, the Psalms and the lyrical Hellenistic philosophy. So you just feel
what this is, this I touch, I gesture, I say, I sing, then you get into the great epic of Gilgamesh
and the narratives of the Iliad and the Odyssey. And now we're right at the heels of the Socratic
time. And this is when we're starting to tell. So instead of like lyrical and saying with that
with, you know, saying in a calm response, you have someone telling the whole history of the
people, the whole history of, you know, Troy, and the whole history and these become,
so there's a reduction in the dialogical nature at this point in history. And then with the
Socratics, I would argue that becomes I name. So instead of telling a story of a man who was
courageous, but also an asshole to his wife and all these kind of very complex ways in which humans
in nature show up in the as in the allegories, we start to say, well, that's too confusing. We never
see a real courageous man, because sometimes he's not courageous. So let's extract and isolate these
virtues, these variables from reality and name them. And this is, I think, where we're the next
phase is now we name, then we're going to compute. Okay. So I see this progression that the telling
and then the naming is a bottleneck. And so we go from sentience, cognizance, consciousness
to reflexive awareness. And this is where we get to I tell, I name, I compute. So it's the
progressive simulation of the self. And then we start dialoguing with the self. And I think this
is a bottleneck. So what we're doing in we call it lyric culture is now we want to move from
reflexive awareness to receptive awareness. So there's an opening as john describes very well,
I see I see with the eye of the soul. This is kind of a Gnostic insight. And then you go from
receptive awareness to open awareness. So receptive awareness, you still have the sense that you're
receiving perceptions and open awareness is more like I'm feeling. And so we're back to this white
heads insight that there's a resounding resonance of feeling that I am embedded it I'm not I'm not
just receiving it. And then we I mean, this is this is all, you know, methodology. And then from
there, you become you get the sense of the I am. And this is the transcendent sense of the radiant
being of reality or the radiance being the radiance of God, or the radiance of the divine.
And you find that within yourself. And the naming, the telling and the naming and the computing are
in the wrong direction. We have to dial that back and move toward receptive awareness, open
awareness and the sense of original radiance, which you might say is how the universe started.
So that's kind of like a fierce naturalism take on this conversation. And I thank you for the
opportunity to put it on the table. It's not completely resonant with what else we've been
talking about. Okay. What I'd like to do now is I've got another question. Second one that came
up. This is from Spencer. I'll read it. Spencer certainly throw free to pop in. But I'll read this
this is actually directed at Alexander Bard. How do you feel about the idea that Hegel needs to be
read together with Schelling and later ficta 1804 plus to be fully relationally understood?
For instance, to fully read Hegel with whitehead and delused. Do what you're that's where the
question is if Spencer wants to. So where is he okay? Okay. Yeah, okay. But that's been done.
That's been done a lot. Hegel is put together with the German idealists. And he's not an idealist.
He's he's really a dietician. The way I do Hegel is I do Hegel's method. And then I provocatively
call myself a pan dialecticist. I think fundamentally, everything in the universe, the only thing I
can say about all the different mergers vectors, if they all seem to have some kind of a dialectical
quality to them. So I just call myself a pan dialecticist. Then I learned the lesson from Hegel.
No, what wasn't done is the weird artificial opposition between Hegel and Nietzsche. When I
started reading the guys my teenage years, like, they're compatible. They're perfectly compatible.
I mean, Nietzsche's armor fought it, which is his, you know, axiology, it's just where his
values start from. It's exactly like Hegel's the necessity of the past and scared of the
contingency of the future and the freedom is exactly affirmation in Nietzsche. They're perfectly
compatible. And I'm glad the whole new generation today, at least they're Europe, they're all
reading Hegel and Nietzsche through each other, which is incredibly productive to get all the
best uses bits out of these amazing 90th century thinkers. Then when you start looking at the 20th
century, I found Whited, who I loved a bit. And he also does relationalism. And it's almost like
Whited. Deleuze, of course, later in France, in the late 20th century, Deleuze does the same
thing with Guattari in France and their amazing thinkers. I love Deleuze and Foucault, these are
the guys I grew up with. But Deleuze attempt at trying to do Hegel as if Hegel did not exist.
It's exactly what Whited actually did. Whited did Hegel as if Hegel did not exist,
and then applied on the natural sciences and mathematics and tons of stuff that Hegel was
not aware of, which is why I think Whited is fantastic. So I prefer to use the Hegelian method
and read it through the 20th century thinkers and then try to read it through us and try to read it
through 20th century philosophy, what the Hegelian method can mean today. But as method,
it is amazing. And I'm so glad that John, who's so fantastic, is now going to put his head on
to Hegel because the day for Varkey goes on Hegel. Ooh, that's got to be enormous.
Okay. I've got a question here from Kevin Katwas. And this question is,
how does an ontology of pure relationality relate to the emerging digital network,
decentralized institutions of the future? How does an ontology of pure relationality relate
to an emerging digital network and decentralized institutions of the future?
I guess that's kind of my question again. Anyway, the paradigm we're in right now is the
network dynamical paradigm. Some call it digital, some call it the internet, some call it AI,
whatever. What happened is the technology now is going global. We get satellites everywhere,
everything is interconnected. The threat there is to arrive in a surveillance police state. We
don't want that. So I'm totally with decentralization and try to think, how can we still have a
network dynamical society with all its benefits, but still lived in a decentralized way? That's
a fairly difficult question to solve. Is it typical axiological question today? So we are
networked out because we've got a question here from Cody Palmer. Does a neoplatonic framework
create an ontological structure? Greg, can you hear us? Greg, I think he couldn't hear you,
Alexander. I think that's the problem. All right. Greg, are you still there?
He looks frozen. Yeah, that's Alexander just hanging on a sec. I think that's what happened
there. I don't think he was being rude. I think he thought you'd stopped.
I could just finish the answer as soon as he could get where to back because the rest of you
are all here. She was just Greg's problem, right? Yeah. He'd be back. So I'm just going to finish
the question. The thing is that I'm with Marsha McLuhan, an amazing philosopher, by the way,
in that media we use. I want to show you this because the last time you said him,
did you have you read his Remedian book? Oh, yeah. If anybody's going to save the pope,
it's going to be Marsha McLuhan, the best Catholic in the world. But the thing is that the media
we use will also affect how we think. That's why this sort of minoritarian thinking that
Hegel and White had practiced at the time is not becoming majoritarian. We're all starting to think
like they think because living in a world drenched in network relations and we try to figure out
relations must work. And it's fantastic to live in a relations universe. So why not?
But that's why that's why relations is becoming such a big topic because it actually reflects
the technological environments we are in right now.
I'd like to answer to that too then while we wait for Greg to come back.
And I think this is actually convergent with what Bart is saying. What you still have,
and this goes to what we're now in what's called the fourth rationality debate. We've had a whole
bunch. What is rationality? You still have people claiming that this can ultimately be grasped in
an a priori axiomatic system, all of this. And that that is kind of the epistemological version
of the zombie fundamentalism that Bart was pointing to, but within a scientific framework.
And part of what we try to argue in in two papers, one is
rationality and relevance realization. The other one is naturalizing relevance realization.
Is that project is actually doomed? You can't do it that way. It's not that there aren't top-down
aspects, but you can't step out. This is Hegel. You can't step out and give an a priori top-down
optimization that will work algorithmically across all possible contexts. This is the last
ditch attempt that is being made in order to wrestle with the network reality and the dynamic
system reality we're realizing here. And I think that is a kind of scientific fundamentalism
that is strongly analogous to a lot of religious fundamentalisms that we have.
But because they typically don't blow up buildings or whatnot, they don't get the
deserved attention. But if you don't think these people are going to cause terrific suffering,
if they succeed, I think you're being foolish. So I would want to point out that there is an attempt
to recapture all of what Bart was pointing to, right, about network dynamics in a top-down
a priori axionomic formal systemization. And I think this is the last ditch attempt.
And so I think that has to be properly challenged and resisted. I've been trying to do so,
by the way. And I think other people are. I totally agree with John. That's why I said
Surveillance Police State. And this book, Processing Event, is a manifesto against that happening.
The scientists fundamentalists are going to go for the surveillance police state and they're
going to do good in the world. It's like vulgar Platonism. They're going to go for the good in
the world by controlling absolutely everything. Well, that's already happening because T. M.
Ping is trying to do it in China with vulgar Confucianism. Because vulgar Confucianism is
exactly vulgar Platonism. And these are the two heritages we got in Eastern and Western thinking
we need to get rid of once and for all. We call them the pillar saint ideologies. The pillar saint
ideologies is that Confucianism and Platonism at his worst is the little 11-year-old boy who
threw his wonderful little idea that if everybody did everything the way I think they should do,
the world will be wonderful and everything will be a sunny day forever. And they're there.
I mean, most computer scientists I meet, when they start to think about philosophy,
their mind gets stuck there. I think it's great that you mentioned that here, John.
Scientific fundamentalism is exactly, scientific fundamentalism is the right term for that. And
it's just as scary with other fundamentalists, especially these guys have so much power and
influence today. We've got to avoid the surveillance police state precisely because we need an open
society. Without an open society, all freedom is gone.
All right. Hey, folks, I'm back. It looks like we have Scott. It's got a question. I'm noting the
time here. Why don't we ask Scott a question? We'll respond to that and then we'll congeal,
give some final thoughts and then we'll end the session that way. Scott?
Thank you very much. I appreciate having the opportunity to open my mic. I tried to type
the question and it blew up. Alexander, I very much appreciate your rich, bold understanding of
Hegel. And if we're going to talk about Hegel and Whitehead and be serious about process ontology,
then stability becomes a scale relative phenomenon. In other words, the things, one of the things I've
got. Oh, well, confirm your speaking language. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. There you go. Okay. Sorry,
I got a zoom thing I had to answer. The question I have is, in my work, I look at where you,
the things you described, where we weren't wrong with thingism. Why would it be difficult to think
relationally? One of the artifacts of the way dynamical systems work is that dynamic stable
states emerge relatively in a dynamic space. So they're transient. Yet we've confused the stability
with the fixedness. Our thoughts come to be as temporally stable states that come and go in a
hyper complex neural dynamic. Our words are the same. So I think I just want to get your reaction
to the idea that we've confused the stable states that our brains necessarily create to have things
we call thoughts. We've confused those abilities with the way the world is, not seeing the actual
multi-scale dynamic work that makes the emergence of temporarily stable states possible. I know
there was a lot, but I had to ask that of you given your talk. Totally agree. That's why the
book is called Process and Event. In a very, very, very fundamental rudimentary addressing all the
problem of the East and the West, where East and West can learn, is that the East got stuck with
process. And I've never met Chinese or an Indian intellectual who didn't agree with me. They got
stuck with the process. The problem was that in Western culture, especially through Islamic
Christianity, we got so obsessed with the event, we forgot about the process. What then happened
is that the event itself becomes endlessly repeated. Christ on the cross all the time,
Muhammad storming Mecca all the time, every year again and again, say whip on the back.
The problem is that reality is process and event, meaning human is process and event,
East and West, man and woman, dialectical relations all the way down. And I'm just basically
advocating if you can think that the event is the stability and it's temporary, remember it's
temporary, so you can use it and build from, but then things will move on and the new process
will start. Then what happens is you realize that processes are repeated, but the process is never
identical to the previous lap of the process. That tiny little difference enables you to create
an event and change history forever in a new constructive direction. I think that's a wonderful
thought that any engineer I've ever met is thrilled about hearing because they try to find that little
spot where they can improve on the world every day when they work. So process and event, that's
what the books call that. That's a unity of the two. Alrighty, that's lovely. Let me offer a few
thoughts first off. And so first off, thank you all for really stimulating our 45 minutes.
My heart is filled with joy to stay at the primate level and the exchange of ideas, the feeling in
the room was really good. A couple of things I want to mention. One is let's make sure we're
clear about where we're locating, how we're entering into this. And certainly, Utah's
location is explicit. I appreciated our exchange being clear where John's coming from. I think
where Bernice is coming from. Understanding where we're entering and then to see the convergence
through those various elements, to me, is really inspiring and fascinating. Another area of convergence
I want to mention with Bard is that narratology with its logos, pathos, and mythos has lots of
parallels with Utah's epistemological pillars of the Tree of Knowledge, the Iquacoin, and the
Garden. That's really a logos, pathos, mythos, frame of reference. I also want to speak to
some of what obviously I share with John and our hope for transcendent naturalism, at least in
relationship to a strong transcendence of a collective emergence, a collective intelligence
that transforms the ontopistemological relation. I think that's desperately needed.
And the last thing I'll say in relationship to Bonnie is the embodiment of being.
Contact with the cutting through metaphysics down into the experience of being, to me, is
absolutely central, and we've lost that in many ways. And to regain that is aspects of the core
of the task as I see us moving forward. So all of these things, to me, are connecting in particular
ways. They're inspiring. They're spurring lots of thoughts. I'll go to John and then Bonnie and
Bard can have the last word and then we can wrap up. John, any final thoughts you want to share as
we kind of bring this to a close? I found this tremendously fecund. And I'm always impressed
when there's considerable convergence and its convergence. And there's enough difference.
So we're not just echo chambering. Convergence requires that there's real difference,
although they come to shared conclusions, maybe resolutions is a better word.
Because that raises the plausibility of the overall framework dramatically. If Bonita working,
I'm not claiming we're completely independent of each other, that's ridiculous, but she's working
independently. Bard is working independently. There's significant enough differences between
what we're saying that we're not just echoing each other. And yet as we unwrap, unfold our
particular argumentative paths, we come to very similar kinds of realizations. I think that raises
the overall plausibility. And so I would say that if you listen to the geist between the three of us,
you actually get the best possible argument for what is needed right now.
Lovely. Bonnie?
Yeah, I just want to end by pointing out a kind of confusion. So my work, as you kind of situated
my work, always emphasizes the animal level. But what I hope you can understand from my work is
that I'm not just, you see, the problem is, when you work from the kind of stratified
reality that you have, you're saying my work is down there in the animal realm. And this is the
problem with the stocks because my work is saying, okay, this reflexive awareness, we're telling,
we're naming, we're going to compute. This just because this is more on the scene recently,
it could be a mistake. It could be, you know, there could be an alternative. It could be
the wrong way. And I'm saying that these other moves come out of our animal nature, but they're
beyond the human condition so far. And this is why it's tricky to have always work from that
stock because I'm not a pagan. So yeah, and I think you're going like this, you know, I know,
you know, and so I just want to end with that. And I too found the conversation lovely and very
complex and probably challenging for many people who they stuck with us because there's so many
different worlds popping up. And so yeah, and thank you all so much for being a part of this.
Lovely. I'll just say amen.
Barb? Yeah, I just want to say that this was like the most wonderful check in with you guys.
I'm sitting here on the other side of the Atlantic and you're some of my best friends in
North America. And it's just wonderful to collaborate with you. And I will dig into your
work even more than ever, all three of you. And certainly I'm very inspired. I'm working on a term
myself at the moment, which was not part of this conversation, but just to point out how
inspiring this is. And it's called emotional intelligence. And this is the ridiculous thing.
Intelligence is currently the most important word in our language, and it's not been defined by
anybody. That in itself is terrible. That's a really dangerous position that we're actually
using the word intelligence all the as if we knew we're talking about. There are so many Italian
genses to begin with. And AI is just one of them and a minor one, to be honest about it.
So I'm working with the concept of emotional intelligence, which are things in types of very
nice and whiteted and very nicely beneath us work, just example of how inspiring this conversation is.
But that's another conversation altogether. All right. Well, maybe we'll have future
conversations then. All right, folks. Thank you so much, each of you, for bringing your wisdom.
It's been a real joy. It's lovely to host this in the context of the Utah Consilience Conference
and to think about the kind of philosophies, metaphysics, empirical experiences of being
oriented toward wisdom in the 21st century. And I love the dance, and I appreciate the connection.
Thanks, everybody. Thanks for all the questions. Super engaging. So what we're doing now is basically
you got an hour. I think there's plenty to digest here and go for a walk, get a cup of coffee.
Back at one o'clock, we have three options for three wonderful symposia. And then again,
at three o'clock, three options. I'm really looking forward to the afternoon. I feel like
conference off to a great start and go get some nourishment, share some love, hang out,
meditate, et cetera. We'll see everybody soon. Okay. Take care.
