We're going to have John Vervakey speak to us now.
He is the founder of the Vervakey Foundation and the director of cognitive science at the
University of Toronto.
He's the creator of the acclaimed Awakening from the Meeting Crisis and After Socrates
series.
Thank you.
So I have a choice here.
I can give my talk or answer all of John's questions.
All right, so I'm changing this title slightly from in the program, the cognitive science
of home belonging to the home range orienting from the home base and growing up around the
hearth hospital.
I chose the last one solely because it had H's in it.
It actually captured better what I wanted to talk about.
So what I want to do is I want to make use of John A. Allens.
There's going to be two Allens mentioned, so I'll try to keep them clear separate for
you.
John A. Allens' book, Home, How Habitat Made Us Human, and I want to trace out the evolution
of home in three stages towards answering the question, why do we long for home?
Those three stages is not a ladder but a nesting, and of course, nesting is a kind of home.
The three stages are the home range, the home base, and the hearth hospital, and I'm going
to show how each is a stage in the shaping of cognition within 4e cognitive science.
And then I want to talk about how that cognition is, I hope, plausibly exacted up into our
spirituality and then talk about domicile and quest in that context.
So even before we were recognizably human, we were biological, our ancestors were biological
organisms, and there's been a revolution in biology around this that gives us an important
aspect of the first stage of the evolution of home.
This is called niche construction.
So the old model, which is a sort of Victorian capitalist model, is you have the individual
organism, and they happen to mutate, and that's it, and then there's the harsh environment
of competition that kills them off or they survive, and it's just that, that's the model.
So the model is changing, and it's part of the revolution, the science where science
is happening right now is not physics, physics has been installed for 40 years, the science
where science is happening is biology.
And it's niche construction is the idea, and the idea is this, organisms are not passive,
they are active shapers of their environment, and then that shaped environment in term shapes
them.
They shape the environment, the environment shapes them, and it loops like this.
And you notice I do this a lot when I talk about 4e cognitive science.
It's that loop, it's niche construction, it's a mutual shaping so that they fit together
in an important way.
There's a conformity between the organism and the environment.
They belong together.
Now that belonging together is, I'm going to argue, well I'm arguing right now, is what
Kellyanne Allen, this is the second Allen, first is John A, second is Kellyanne, in her
work, calls belonging, the sense of belonging, and please remember the assonance between
longing and belonging.
What is belonging?
Belonging is a sense of, quote, deep connection with social groups, physical places, and collective
experiences, that's from the paper in 2021, and then there's the book in 2021 as well.
I think that deep connection is in the sense of belonging that she's talking about is deeply
convergent with the work I do on relevance realization and religio and meaning in life
as a fundamental connectedness of yourself to other people and to the world.
And as often the case in psychology, we have these two literatures, meaning in life literature,
and the belonging literature talking about basically the same thing and not talking to
each other because psychology is in a mess right now and see the work of my good friend
Greg Enriquez on how we can fix that problem.
Right now I'll take it as a point of convergence.
Kellyanne Allen goes on, it is, quote, a fundamental need that predicts, notice the language here,
psychologists are usually deeply cautious.
It seems to us, after the evidence, that perhaps it has suggested that, that's how it usually
is written, okay, but here it's, listen to the language, it is a fundamental need, this
is like a summative paper, that predicts numerous mental, physical, social, economic, and behavioral
outcomes.
In short, the evidence is overwhelming, this is why when people say, I don't know what
it means about the immune crisis, in short, if you do not have a sense of belonging, you
are in serious trouble, mentally, physically, economically, behaviorally, socially.
It's powerfully predictive of that.
Next to knowing your IQ, I want to know if you have a sense of belonging.
I want to know if you have a sense of meaning in life, and this is how, there's two questions
you can ask to get out, do you have meaning in life.
What do you want to exist even if you don't, and how connected, how much of a difference
do you make to it.
So, there's actually two sides, there's the result, which is belonging, and then there's
the process, fitting in, this is the, and we've been using this language probably your
whole life, fitting in, I want to fit in, I want to fit in, I don't fit in, I want to
fit in, I don't fit in, I do this, right, okay, but listen to the language, fitting
in, like this deep connected belonging, conformity, participating in, and I think this has a lot
to do, I'll only do this a couple more times, I think this has a lot to do with the recursive
relevance realization, okay, but how is that niche construction, organism shaping the
environment, environment shaping the organism, they belong together, there's a sense of belonging
fitting, I think that gets taken up into the cognitive, and therefore on the cusp of the
spiritual, with the work that myself and Christopher Massupietro and Philip Mizovic covered in
the book, Zombies in Western Culture, 21st Century Crisis, we talked about world view
attunement, which is this idea, I think that that's basically a religio niche construction,
you have a view of the world that supports your view of how you view, how you know, how
you connect, and you have a theory of connection that helps to support and substantiate your
view of the world, and they mutually support each other, and we had that with the Aristotelian
worldview, and then we broke it and smashed it, and we haven't had worldview attunement
ever since, and a clear indicator of that is, and you've probably heard me make this
argument before, the pervasive worldview, the scientific worldview, is a worldview in
which we do not belong, in which we do our existence as cognitive, personal, moral agents
doesn't belong, so if we don't belong in the worldview, it's not doing worldview attunement
for us. So, when we have worldview attunement, we get a network of affordances, just a reminder
of what affordance is, affordance is a living possibility, a real possibility, it's not
created by the environment, it's not created by the organism, it's created by how they
mutually shape each other, this affords me walking, I and this have been mutually shaped
by physics, by chemistry, this and I have both been shaped by culture to fit each other,
so walking is available to me, there's an affordance, there's all kinds of affordances
now set out for me, because of that co-shaping, feeding together, belonging together, once
you have this first stage, you're into an organism having a home range, this is areas
where the it is shaping the environment, the environment is shaping it, a network of affordances
is opening up, it's belonging, they're fitting together, and space gets transformed into places
connected by paths, and you are looking out at the world and seeing places and paths and
you're saying, that's just the way it is, there are no places and paths in physics, there's
trajectories, there's locations, in fact this is so deep in us, in how we've been shaped,
think, try to talk for a five minutes without doing places and paths, John has just started
his lecture, soon he'll be halfway through his lecture, and then he'll be at his end,
the marriage isn't going well, we seem to be floundering, we're off course, paths and
places, look out around you, it's happening right now, you're already starting to home
this space, when you get that, when you get that home range, paths and places, the landscape
courses, I'm using the word course and you're allowed to by the way, it's in the dictionary
and I made sure, you can use course as a verb, the landscape courses, it flows, we talk about
the hills rolling, they're not rolling, if they were rolling we'd be absolutely terrified,
but I'm reading the great Gatsby long time ago, in high school, galaxy far far away,
and I'm reading this book, and why are they making me read it, it's this silly story,
you're Daisy Daisy Nick, Grat Gatsby, and then I get, I mean if you've read the book,
spoiler, you haven't, and then you get to the last three pages and you go, oh my gosh,
this whole book has been about the American dream, and you go, and there's that, and it
first hit me, he's talking about it, and the author, well Nick, but Fitzgerald pulls back,
from the tight closure of the story, and he talks about the rolling hills of the republic,
and I got this tremendous sense of, wait, there's a bigger thing going on here, there's
this whole landscape, there's this whole history, and it's paths and places and affordances,
and it's all alive, and he was trying to invoke that, and he was actually trying to symbolize
it in this rather trite life love story, and I was like, it was one of those first great
moments in my life when I realized how stupid I could be, because I totally missed it, and
it opened it up for me, and I'm poof, right, this is a home range, and what's really unique
about human beings is their home range, right, is quite variable, and that's an advantage
and a disadvantage, see the advantage for the gazelle, here's a gazelle, here's a baby
gazelle, it fits right in, and gazelles don't have existential, how can I be a good gazelle,
I'm failing, right in, your heritage gave you the capacity for home range like any other
organism, but it's a movable home range, because you know what culture is, culture is niche
construction on methamphetamines, that's what culture is, culture is, I'm going to go into
this environment, and I'm going to shape it, and shape you so you belong there, that's
what culture is, and that's a great power, but it's also a great uprooting, because there's
no place you naturally belong, and science fiction regularly reminds us about this.
So then, so organisms are doing this, at some point our ancestors evolved so that they're
becoming hunter-gatherers, we're not clear about when, probably Homo erectus, probably
around 800,000 years ago, right, I've held an 800,000 year old Aschulean handaxe, I was
like, ah, it's so, and what is the next stage, the next stage is the home base, the home
base is a fixed point within the home range, in which everybody goes out from it, they
do stuff and they come back to it, which seems right natural to you, they go out and they
come back, and then what they do is they share the butchering of the animals, the preparation
of food initially, but something that's really important happening here, when they come back,
right, they're checking each other, because that system of distributed labor requires
you to all come back together, not only for their legitimate reasons, we have to coordinate
our labor, we have the synergy of coordinated communication, but also in order to do cheater
detection, you shouldn't get the benefits if you haven't borne the costs, and if you
borne the costs and not have the benefits, then something needs to change, and if you
don't think that's very neat, give your two, three, or your three-year-old, this three-year-old
and that three-year-old, give that one a bigger piece of chocolate cake, human beings care
so much about this that they will do the following, if I sit you in a room and I give you five
dollars and you say, you can keep the five dollars, go great, there's more to the science,
now what you do is you bring in two people and you say, I'll give you five dollars,
but only if you allow me to give him ten dollars, and then guess what they do, no, I don't want
it, they're still getting five dollars for free, but they don't want it because that
has been broken down, see what we start to get into is a new normative space, we're starting
to think about the justice of our actions as opposed to just the efficacy of our actions,
so we've got distributed labor, now that requires something really, so far we've got this, right,
concern for justice, looking for cheating, but looking for honoring, because the opposite
of catching a cheater is honoring somebody who's followed, played the rules, distributed
labor, you're going out there, I'm going out there, and we're not, we can't talk to each
other, imagine if you had to run back every five minutes, now we forget this, I don't
know how old John Van Dink is, I'm pretty old too, so I grew up in this dark time in
which your phone was in one place, and you had to leave your phone behind, and you had
to rely on other things to coordinate your behavior with other human beings, it's funny
we still call it a phone, but if you actually call somebody on it they freak out, why are
you calling me, so think about what we had to rely on, and here's a way of getting this
a little bit closer, so imagine a married couple that has been married for a long time because
they love each other, not because they hate each other, sometimes people stay together
in marriage because they hate each other because that's the greatest way to torture another
human being, that was my parents, so, but I had the opposite, and this, my aunt and
uncle, and my aunt, this aunt, she was like a second mother to me, they had been married
well longer than I was alive, and when she came in the room his eyes sparkled, and there
was like a telepathy between them, he could just, eyes sparkle, and they almost didn't
have to talk, and it's like what's going on, well what's going on is, you have two human
beings, and they're not always consulting each other, they've internalized each other,
she has a model of him, he has a model of her, so he can be over here, out of range
of her, and coordinate his behavior with her by consulting the model, but he has to let
her live inside him, some of you have said something sort of a little bit freaky to me,
but I've tried to take it in good heart, you say things to me like, John, you're in my
head all day, that's a little bit weird for me, but you see what you're doing, you're
internalizing, now the thing is you can't internalize forever, so what you have to do
is you have to periodically all come together, the nexus point, and make sure the models
all match, that they haven't got out of sync, so the ability to go out and do distributed
labor, which is how we build this, requires that we come together and have a common point,
a common unity, a community, in which we correct how the models get out of sync with
each other, and that's what Paul, I think, and Jonathan are often talking about, church
can be a pretty shitty place, because you have all these, oh, that's not how it is,
now what's really interesting is your brain actually works this way, so your brain face
is a problem, it's actually not one machine, it's a machine of machines that can make itself
into a new kind of machine, which is unlike anything we have right now yet, right, and
these, well we all know, they can work at cross purposes, they can be antagonistic to
each other, and so the way we deal with that problem of things working at cross purposes
is we have them communicate, that improves efficiency, so we can improve efficiency by
having parts of the brain talk to each other all the time, there's a problem with that,
two problems is when the brain is talking a lot to itself, it's not paying much attention
to the world, secondly, when all that energy is being expended, it's very expensive, so
this is what the brain does, it actually does, has different areas of the brain, they model
each other, they mutually model each other, and then the brain cycles, it cycles between
you're focused on the world, and all the parts are relying on the model of each other
to coordinate without talking to each other very much, so all that energy can be channeled,
and then it goes to another time when you're basically not focused on the world and all
the parts are talking to each other, and your attention is trying to do it right now, because
part of your attention is task focused, what is he going to say next, he's so weird, and
then there's another part of you that is trying to mind wander, mind wandering is when you
disconnect from the world and the parts are basically talking to each other for what purpose,
mind wandering, it seems like the most useless thing and you spend so much time in mind wandering
because this is when the models all connect and make sure they're tracking each other,
and you cycle back and forth, and your attention is trying to do it right now, and then you
get an advantage out of that, the mind wandering opens up variations of things and perspectives
that are relevant to you, because you're always the hero of your mind wandering, you don't
mind wander, hey, I'm going to mind wander about Pete Seeger or somebody else, you mind,
it's always you, it's you, how are things relevant to me, in fact what's happening is,
you know, John Berwicky, it's not really relevant to me, here's a bunch of stuff that's relevant
to me, that's mind wandering, and then what you do is, you open up the possibilities of
how things are relevant, you open up variation on what you can pay attention to, and then
you kill most of it off when you come back to focusing on me, but some of it stays and
you make connections that are relevant to you, you evolve your attentional fit, variation
with the mind wandering, selection with the task focus, and you do this, and you're evolving
your connectedness, and we figured out with home range and home base how to do that with
collective intelligence, we all go out with our mutual models and then we come back into
common unity, the community, and we do all this stuff that seems relatively useless,
so that we, right, and then we, and the whole community evolves its grip on the world,
the world. So this interaction between home range and home base starts to evolve and develop
intelligence, collective intelligence, the intelligence of distributed cognition, and
of course what happens is individual cognition and collective cognition start to bootstrap
each other. If I internalize her and she internalizes me, she can actually take my perspective
on her perspective, that's what she's doing when she's doing that coordinated, but then
she can just do that when she needs to, not just when she's coordinating with me, she
can, wait, I can, what would John think, what would, what would Jonathan, what would Paul
think, oh, your metacognitive capacities expand dramatically, your ability to be aware of
how you're aware, to know how you're knowing, to learn how to learn, all goes up significantly.
This is all enmeshed with home range and home base, but how is the home base chosen? But
think about campfire, how do you choose it? So there's a theory, we've got to modify the
theory because the empirical record for the initial presentation of the theory has made
up and modified. The original theory is prospect and refuge. Prospect and refuge says you're
always looking for places where you have significant prospects, so you can see a lot,
but there's refuge for you. Now, originally they thought that was like, I want to be able
to see a lot, but I want to be able to hide a lot. And that turns out to be wrong because
when you show pick, because it makes predictions, you show people pictures of like, here's all
this expanse you can see, but you're also sort of in a jungle and there's all, and people
like, I don't want to be there, because here's the thing, if you could hide in it, so could
someone else. So could a predator. So you don't want lots of hiding places. So it's
more like what I want in refuge is I want a place where I can defend myself or escape,
reliably escape. So when I say refuge, I want you to hear that, okay? Now think about this,
because I've been thinking about this and what Paul was saying about rest and how it's
not just lassitude. And I was thinking, what went through my head was this phrase, a refuge
without prospect is a prison. And prospect without refuge is wilderness. You don't want
either of those. You don't want either of those. So this might surprise you that I would
make this move. You're seeking for an optimal grip between that trade-off relationship.
And so you're trying to pick a place. So you've got all this affordance network. You want
a place that gives you this sort of optimal grip between prospect and refuge. It's a nexus
point. It gives you easy access to many different courses of action you can undertake. Now,
I want you to think about what a way of thinking about that. I'm going to use a martial arts
analogy. I think I used it in Thunder Bay, but I'm going to use it again. It's a slightly
different one, okay? So the reason I'm using this is because I'm going to really play on
optimal gripping. Like there's things when you're doing and you're grappling with somebody
and you need to get the optimal grip, literally the optimal grip on them to throw them. Like
you don't want to lean too far forward because then they can, you know, oh, that's not going
to, you got to do this thing. So there's all these different things you're doing that are
optimal grips on your opponent. But you don't start out that way. You start out, you take
your stance. Now, this doesn't do anything. You don't use this for anything. What's the
point of a stance? So think about all the optimal grippings I can have. The stance puts me
in an optimal place to get to any of those optimal gripping. Do you understand? The stance
allows me, oh, if I hear, I can quickly, if I'm here, I can, right, I can quickly step
back if I need to. I can come over, I can, right. There's all these things I can do from
this stance. You have a stance. It's, it's your meta optimal grip. And I have to have
a few metas or you wouldn't believe it was me giving the talk, right? It's your meta
optimal grip point. And it's at the point that gives you the best optimal relationship
between prospect and refuge. And then you have this point. It's the point that is your
entry into the affordance network. It's giving you meta optimal grip. It's an origin point
for all of the journeys that you're going to take and you're going to come back to. It
allows you to navigate your home range and to share that with other people because we
can all mutually model the origin point so that we can easily coordinate our behavior.
So that you get the ability to undertake what's called orientation. This is the work of Stegmeyer
2019, his astonishing book on orientation, the philosophy of orientation. And he talks
about how orient the ability. Okay. So if you were to ask many people today how they're
wrestling with things, they will use metaphors or they will even use the word I feel disoriented.
I feel disoriented. I don't know which way is up or down. I don't know which way to
go. And it's all metaphorical. They're talking about this fundamental ability of orientation.
I want to coin a word. I don't know if it's a word. I want to talk about co-orientation
like the way we talk about coordination. We have co-orientation when we have the home
base and we take that up into our world view and we can navigate the world view.
We can co-orient in that world view and move around in that space so that we can coordinate
our distributed cognition, access that collective intelligence. That's what orientation does
for you, shared orientation. We even do it. We even do it temporally. We've been talking
about this. Right? We have retrospective. We have this retrospective. We want, remember
I didn't mean rest. Sorry, I didn't mean hiding. The path should provide some kind of refuge
for us now. It should have, all of these things should have converged so that we have a trustworthy
home base that then gives us prospect for the future. We feel so that we can properly
do this. We can, there's a common unity that gives us a common law of the precedent that
has been vouchsafed to us from the past. Then it encourages us to be prospectively responsible
and try and set precedent for the people in the future. This of course is random's work
on reason and philosophy, his new interpretation of Hegel. What we're trying to do is constantly
find ourselves in that stream, in that course of the common law of distributed cognition
by, we can draw from the past and we can prospect to the future and then we are oriented. Then
we are oriented. So, we've got the home base and it's within the home range and then all
of this is within the horizon. But with the home base and the home range, we have this
sort of resonance field in which the land flows, we belong to it. And then on top of
it, we have this ability to orient and to co-orient and to form community. And out of it, we have
access not only to the community here and now, but the community of the past and the
community of the future. And I take it that Christians represent that with the community
of the saints and things like that. Are these some branch of Christians? I have to be honest,
sometimes I can't keep all of you straight. And I say that affectionately. So what happens
with this orientation is, remember with the first thing, space became places linked by
paths. Now the paths and the places are transformed into maps, cognitive maps. And a map is a powerful
thing. And then what Descartes did, by the way, he figured out how to take our mapping
ability and our orienting ability and turn it into a graph because that's all it is.
It's a graph, it's a mapping from an origin point. That's why it's called the origin point,
by the way, on a Cartesian graph. See, what a map does is it reduces your cognitive load.
You don't have to remember all the idiosyncratic paths and pathways. You don't have to, by
the way, in the dark times, you didn't have Siri, we would go to the glove box and we
would retrieve the parchment. We called them maps and we would open the map. And I had
never trod this path or been in that place, but I could find my way. I didn't have to.
See, once you have a map, you don't have to hold all the paths and places. Imagine if
your environment was the way you treat your house. We had to memorize it. So your range
gets limited when you don't have cognitive maps. When you have cognitive maps, you can
go to all kinds of places you haven't been before with confidence. They encourage you
to interpolate, extrapolate, to go into the unknown with a kind of confidence. It charges
that space. Sorry, that's not even right. It charges that relationship between the home
base, the home range and the horizon. It charges it. It becomes a resonance field. It's resonant
with possibilities for you because you won't be overwhelmed because you have the map. So
now you see the belonging and the co-orienting are actually, they're not being left behind.
They're mutually nested within each other, growing each other. Now we move to the third,
which is the hearth and hospital. Now I need you to hear something. The word hospital. Hear
it the way it originally was meant in the word hospitality. So sometime after we started
home basing, our ancestors get fire. And they start to reliably use it. And there's a lot
of dispute about how ancient that is. But it's, reliably we've got evidence for 500,000
years. There's some older sites maybe we don't know. And we don't know, like if we don't quite
know if the home basing is first and the fire comes along or the fire and the home basing
come together. We don't know. I'm just giving you, so I'm talking more about stages than
perhaps the actual historical sequence. What happens around the hearth in the hospital,
healing, we start to really start to heal each other when we're sick, when we're wounded.
And that again seems as the natural thing to do for you. It's not. Right. For most organisms.
Right. Of course, we have now the nursery. And think about how the nursery and the healing
overlap. We talk about nurses. They're not raising children. They're healing the sick.
We see a relationship between those. We're rearing the child. Now what's happening when
you have the home base and the hearth is you've got the extension of agopic love from the
mother and the child to the extended family. That is a huge, huge advantage. That's a huge
advantage. This is why for many people, people who don't have houses, like the indigenous
people in Australia, they don't have houses. They have kinship systems. That's how they
feel at home. And they're really, like, it's hard to figure out. It's so complex, even
convoluted and sophisticated the way the kinship systems work and the way you name people so
that, like, you're my mother-in-law. What? Well, because it's bizarre. Like, I'm struggling
to understand it from the outside, but all I know is it's impressive. There's, of course,
food sharing, and we still do that. We just did it. Until we had phones in the dark time,
eating, you'd go to a restaurant and you ate by yourself, it was awful. So there's
the looker, or there's the ignore. Now what we do is we pretend that we're important and
we're obviously involved with something. My phone, the president's talking to me. And
of course, as I said, there's social bonding. But think about what's also going on in the
hearth. There's the fire. And what I said, to really pick up on what Jonathan was saying,
think about what fire is. Fire shines and it withdraws at the same time. You can follow
it, but you can't grab it. It's about, so you're in this place where all these transformations
are happening. The kitchen is a transformation, the food, the child rearing, the healing, all
this transformation, and then you've got this incarnation of transformation, elusively
present there. And Matt Rosano has talked about, like, that being around campfires probably
affected, right, in the niche construction manner, the evolution of our intelligence.
Because fire is hypnotic. It's amazing. Human beings, you light a fire in there.
And part of the problem with the video world is it generates the campfire effect, but there's
no campfire. Pause on that. See, when I'm in a campfire, your face is lit and only your
face, and I don't see the rest of you, like a video screen, which is lit and I don't see
the rest of you. You're very close. You're closer than you normally are with somebody
at a campfire. Same with the video screen. But we don't have a common origin. We don't
have the fire. We don't have the fire reminding us of the reality, of how being shines forth,
but always also withdraws. It's no wonder that Heraclitus, who brought the notion of
the logos into philosophical and then ultimately religious use, chose the fire and the fire
as the symbol of the logos. And we talk about conversations that catch fire, because fire
has its ability to catch and organize and grow. It shines and it withdraws. It appears
and it disappears, and this is reality. And what we can do with the fire, because it's
hypnotic, is we can get into symbolic resonance with it. It can make us aware of the transformation
that's happening in us, and then we can see more in the fire than just its superficial
presence. We start to see more deeply into it, and it starts to disclose something more
deeply into us, and we symbolically resonance, and we start to get ontological depth perception
happening. And then we also start doing that with each other around the campfire. I open
myself up so you can see into me, and you open yourself up so you can see into me, and
we do this, and we reciprocally open, and we get ontological depth perception. So what's
happening is, we start to do things that the kids are already doing around the hearth,
symbolically resonant, serious play called ritual. Imaginally augmented perception and
conception, the serious play designed not for any goal, but for transformation itself.
And there's a process there. Rituals have a rationality to them. It's not the rationality
of propositions. A ritual is rational, ratio, properly proportioned, if it transfers broadly
and deeply outside of the context in which the ritual is practiced. The point isn't in
the ritual. It is, but it isn't. What I mean is, if the ritual just stays in the ritual,
Kierkegaard has this wonderful parable about this. There's a bunch of geese, they walk
into a church, and they all sing about flying, and then they walk out. And he said, that's
a lot of Christianity today. And he's a Christian. Fire walking, fire. Fire walking is a ritual
around the world. Why? It seems so bizarre and strange. What's going on? Well, here's
what's going on. When I'm walking on coals, they are actually slow conductors of heat.
So, if I walk fast enough, I won't get burned. But if I walk too fast, I'll kick up the coals
and I'll get burned. So, I have to get my timing just right. So, I have all of this mindfulness
about, I get right, very mindful of a situation, so I get the timing just right. Now, do you
think that ability transfers broadly and deeply in your life? You better believe it. So, for
fire walking, the fire, we get that in the hearth. So, what's happening here? Well, at
that origin point that's been horizontal, the map, we now get the vertical intersecting.
We discover spaces below and spaces above, and how to navigate those spaces and return
to the origin point. And this is ancient. We've got clear evidence of at least 15,000
years ago of shamans and the three-tiered cosmos. There's the underworld, this world,
and the overworld.
Ontological depth perception. Navigating it. We're taking all of these other skills
from the home range and the home base, and we're taking them up into the ritualization
and the transformation around the hearth and the hospital, and we're getting the vertical
dimension, and where the vertical dimension intersects the origin point, you have the
axis mundi. And as Jonathan is frequently pointing out to you, that's what the cross
and the tree represent, if I understand him correctly. And you nod when those symbols
come out, but try to be abstract for a moment and step outside of it. It's like me coming
up to you and saying, it's all about the squirrel and the wash basin. What? But if I say, it's
all about this axis mundi, this tree that grows to the depths and to the heights, oh
no. And of course, trees are also the source of wood which provides fire. Okay. So, all
of this is being lost. You might have heard me talk about this. We're all experiencing
domicile. So, Kellyanne Allen, who does work on belonging. Belonging is the source of
declining massively and quickly with horrible consequences. Undeniable empirical evidence.
One sure measure, how many close friends do you have reliably going down? No matter how
connected we are, how many close friends do you have reliably going down? How much of
your days are lonely, reliably going up? Just one measure. There's many other measures just
to give you a clear example of that. You know, and I've said this before, this is like something
out of Orwell. The United Kingdom has set up a ministry of loneliness because they figured
out that if they don't fix this problem, they're in a lot of trouble. Of course, I don't think
the United States will do such a thing. And Canada isn't doing anything right now. So,
all that religio, meaning in life, belongingness, worldview, attunement, that's all going away.
The loss of our awareness and appreciation of the non-propositional knowing so that we
can rightly and deeply participate in ritual, that is going on. Notice how the word ritual,
post-Froid, has become the way of talking about an obsessive pathology. That's how far
we've come. And of course, as Brian Well said, home is where we take the symbols that are
like right there, pregnant, like the path that's right there. And it's how I think, it's how
I think about intentionality. And then we take the symbols right there, ready to be birthed,
and then we have to set it into a ritual community, and that is what we do to make a home. A home
is a machine in which symbol and ritual come together. And if you don't think that's what
a home is, skip Christmas next time. If you don't think that's what a home is, skip Christmas
next time. And see how everybody reacts around it. No, we're just not going to do Christmas
this year. We're not going to decorate, we're not going to do this. Skip it. People will
hate you in a way you've never been hated before. We've lost co-orientation, origin-point.
The vertical. We've been reduced to the horizontal. We've lost the axis-mundy. But as I've tried
to show, all of those things are part of who and what we are. So as they have come into
question, we have come into question. We are in question in a way, and Heidegger is the
prophet of this, he says, we are the beings whose being is in question. And the fact that
we lack an ability to wonder in that fashion is precisely what he says is one of the origins
of nihilism for us. So when we wonder, we call ourself in the world into question, but
we also wander. Wandering is when we're disoriented and we don't know where to go. So we're wondering
and wandering as we're in question, as we're seeking orientation, as we're trying to find
the origin that will put us into right relationship to the horizon. And that is exactly what a
quest is. The word quest and question are related for a deep reason. In a quest, you
are what's in question. You're wondering as you're wandering. There is no answer to the
question without the transformation that is brought about by undergoing the quest. We
need a reciprocal reconstruction of our world view. We need to bring back the reinventio
of co-orientation. We need the reinventio of symbolic resonance and ritual. We need to
do this in a coordinated fashion. We started not on time. How much time do I have left?
Pardon me? Nine minutes. That's perfect. Nine is good. I'm happy. Okay. So part of what
has to do, and I really had this in my notes before Jonathan gave his talk, part of it
has to do with a relationship. We have to get back to this fundamental orientation point
in our meta-optimal gripping. We have to get all the way back there because that's how
deep the problem is. Attempting to solve the problem anywhere that's more shallow than
that won't give us the transformation of the ontological depth perception that we need.
We have to get back to that orientation, which we're so badly lacking. The problem is when
you lack orientation, you don't know which way to go to get it. And so you can see the
20th, well, you can see actually all of the centuries since the Enlightenment is us thrashing
around trying to, first of all, what we'll do is we'll get an absolute foundation in
science and math, and that will be our origin, and that fell apart. What we'll do is we'll
actually, we'll take into our hands technology and we'll build the, oh no. In fact, and I
don't want to talk about this too much, right? Well, if you want to talk about it, I'll talk
about it. I don't want to talk about it right now. But the advent of AGI, which is now on
the horizon, and if you hear one thing I say to you, it's don't pretend that's not the
case. Don't pretend that's not the case. We need the very best from all of us right now,
and pretending it's not the case is not helping. It is harming. So, what do we need to do?
We have to get to this ability where we can reorient because the advent of AGI has said
to us the promise of the Enlightenment, not the promise of Enlightenment, that's a different
thing, the promise of the Enlightenment, the Promethean promise. We have discovered that
history is not about God or being or the true or the good or the beautiful. History is about
us. We are the authors of history. We are the telos. We are the point of history. The
point of history is to bring us to completion as free agents in the world. What's freedom?
Don't ask that. Freedom, freedom. And there's a lot of good, I don't want to live in a
world before the Enlightenment. But we paid this price because we started down a course
of action that has got us to the... I work with Jeffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.
He is the godfather of artificial intelligence. He quit his job so that he could speak freely
about the serious danger we're in right now. The Enlightenment promised all of this, and
then we get to this place where we told, oh, by the way, you weren't what this was all
about, and you are no longer the authors of history. And you actually aren't going to
matter very soon. We tried that, and then we tried the vassalation between various utopias
and nostalgias, and we fight bloody, titanic wars over it, and it's all for bloody nothing.
Jonathan spoke of a sacrifice. We need to make a profound sacrifice to get back to the
point where reorientation is possible, so that co-orientation is possible, so that real
community is possible. We have to get to a kind... See, I want to talk about something,
but I don't want you to hear a particular state. I want you to hear the possibility
for the transformation of character that's in this. So this goes to some of my scientific
work. It came when I was at a monastery, a Buddhist monastery, just to keep things even,
I'm going to a Christian monastery after I'm here. It's all balanced, and it's an Eastern
Orthodox one, so there you go, Jonathan. But I was in a Buddhist monastery, and I was talking
about all the relevance realizations, and I got talking to them, and there was this
sort of creative tension, and I had a bunch of insights, and it was in dialogue with other
people, Steve March and Zach Stein, and then I realized something that had always been
what is the proper stance, stance orientation towards being and the grounded being? We don't
ask that question, we presuppose we have answers, but we don't have answers anymore, and we
got to get back to that. What is the proper stance? What are all these places that people
are getting to in their mind and spirit? I don't care which entity you posit at being
in right now. And then I realized something, and it helped me make sense of what I was
reading in the Tao Te Chen, what I'm reading like in Do Jin, and actually also what I'm
reading in Maximus. I hope that doesn't offend anybody, because I mean it with affection.
Relevance realization is about our optimal gripping on things, and we even have a meta-optimal
grip, we have to get past that. That's what Jonathan was arguing, we have to stop grasping.
Paul was doing it too about the restless resting. Relevance realization can come to the realization
that it itself is irrelevant, that what is not needed anymore is what relevance realization
does, which is optimally gripped. Because relevance realization is how I get into relationship
to this being, to this being, to this being, to this being, to all of these beings. But
when I want to be in relationship to the ground of being, I have to give up relevance realization.
I have to get to a state where I give up that most fundamental human need to grasp. And
it's hard for us to think of it, this metaphor is the comprandra, this is the metaphor for
getting it, for understanding. But I can't, right. But then you get what you really want,
you get the place where you have the stance towards being, towards being, towards being,
towards the grounded being, towards the no-thingness behind and within. Maximus has this great
thing, right? I really love it, where he says, God is inside of everything but not enclosed.
God is beyond everything but not excluded. You can't get that with a graspy mind. You
can't get that with a graspy mind, it doesn't make any, look, it's inside. Oh, I don't
know, but it's, I'm sorry, this is exciting to me. You're all just sort of like, oh, okay.
But look, like, this is, like, this is like, when I did, and I did lexio on it, so just
sort of like, it's like, God is inside everything but not enclosed, not imprisoned. God is beyond
everything but not excluded. And I kept going, how do I get there with a grasping mind? You
can't. You can't. When you, when you grieve up all your grasping, you give up the nexus
center point of all the grasping, you get opened up. I think it's a kind of deep depth, like
Jonathan was talking about, with the possibility of a resurrection, because if we have the
stance to the ground of being, such that we can really live with, be along with how
it shines in and withdraws, then we have the possibility of a fundamental reorientation
and a new existential stance in the world, which is badly needed right now. Because all
of the Cartesian things that we've gloried in, well, look at how much I can calculate
and look at how I can paint and I can write poetry, that is all going to be challenged
very soon. But this, this ability to enter into that axis-Mundi stance towards the ground
of being that liberates me from the grasping so that I am in this deep, right, Ratio, Ratio
religio, that is always available to you no matter what. You long for home because we
are woven with the nesting of the home range, the home base, and the hearth, with the fire
logos at the center, the hearth and hospital. We long for that. We long for it. But we're
in a place where we need to recognize what we are actually seeking. We're seeking to
belong, to orient, and to transcend. And the right relationship with the ground of being
will give you those functions in a way that doesn't bind you into that perpetual vacillation
between trying to find it retrospectively in the past, trying to find it prospectively
in the future, but finding the common law, the through line that binds them all together.
Thank you very much for your time and attention.
Thank you, John. We're actually going to move quickly into our discussion. We have half
an hour left before dinner. So just take two minutes, get a drink, use the washroom, and
we'll get up, sit up.
Thank you very much.
