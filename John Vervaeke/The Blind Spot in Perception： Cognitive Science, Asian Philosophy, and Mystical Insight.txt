Welcome, everyone.
I've been really looking forward to this particular voices
with Reveke.
You're no doubt looking at somebody who you've heard.
Many of you have heard me mention multiple times.
Sighted his work and his influence repeatedly.
Huge impact on me.
And somebody I've gotten to know on a somewhat more personal
level.
We were colleagues.
I taught his son at one point.
Well, multiple points, I think.
And he's just a fantastic and, I think, important thinker
in the field of cognitive science.
I think he's probably one of the most
premier of not the premier person representing what's
called for ecogsci.
And that, I think, is very pertinent to questions
that we're wrestling with around the nature
of meaning, et cetera.
So I'm going to just turn things over to my friend Evan
Thompson and ask him to give us a little bit more of it,
the background that he thinks might be relevant.
And then we'll move to the issue at hand.
Yeah, so I am first and foremost a philosopher.
That's my academic training.
And I work in the areas of philosophy of mind
and cognitive science, both theoretical cognitive science
and collaborating with experimental scientists.
I also have a strong interest in Asian philosophy.
My undergraduate training was in Asian studies,
Chinese language, and history.
And I got drawn into philosophy really
through studying Chinese philosophy.
So I sort of went the reverse path from the path
that sometimes people take from West to East,
from East to West, in my case, academically.
But I have a continuing interest in the conversation
between Asian philosophical traditions
and Western philosophy.
And I also have a strong interest in phenomenology.
The tradition coming from Edmund Husserl.
And that plays a strong role.
The phenomenological tradition plays a strong role
in the most recent book, The Blind Spot.
Which is what we're going to turn to.
And Evan just referred to it, and this is it.
I want to strongly recommend this book, especially
for people who are interested in the meaning crisis.
And it is the central topic of this book.
It is called The Crisis in Meaning, The Meaning Crisis,
The Blind Spot.
The Blind Spot is a particular account
and explanation of the meaning crisis.
This book is written with Adam Frank, Marcello Gleiser,
or Gleiser, is it Gleiser?
Gleiser, Marcello Gleiser, yeah.
And Evan Thompson is the third author.
And so when I got this book, I opened it,
and I was like, whoa, things that are near and dear
to my heart and to my work and my besetting obsessions,
the meaning crisis was there.
And then there's this notion of The Blind Spot,
which we'll unpack in a minute.
And I turned to chapter nine on cognition,
as I often do in any book, because that's my shtick.
And The Blind Spot in Cognition was explicitly named
as relevance realization, something else near
and dear to my heart.
And so as soon as I saw that, I hadn't read any more of the book.
I just read about 10 pages here and looked at the chapter,
and I went, oh, wow, and I showed my partner the book,
and I was so excited about it.
So I reached out to Evan right away, and I said,
you got to come on, we got to talk about this.
Your work and my work really talk to each other
really deeply at this point.
The book, just some basic things, the book is wonderful.
I'm talking now sort of rhetorically.
It's clearly written, it's accessible.
I wouldn't say it's like a beach read,
like you're just gonna sit there and write.
You have to put thought into it.
It demands, it provokes and demands reflection
and consideration.
But it is also not pitched to the academic Hoy Ploy
or anything like that.
It is really written as I think it should be given the topic
to a general educated audience of people
who are concerned with the meeting crisis
and how we get here and what it is
and what is this meeting we're talking about
and how can we immediately read it.
So first of all, the book is really,
really wonderfully written, very clear.
Now the thing I wanna ask you very quickly about
and unpack this a little bit
before we get into the meat of it.
Like this book has a very single voice to it.
Sometimes you know when you're reading books
by multiple authors, you hear this,
you get the sense of a carcophony and it's,
but like, and you use we throughout and everything.
You're reminding the reader constantly as you should.
But the voice has, I find the clear integrated voice.
Like how did that come about
and how did you make that happen?
Well, I'm glad that it reads that way.
Obviously that was, you know,
that was a challenge in writing a book with three authors.
And I would say that the responsibility
for really doing the overall smoothing as we called it
and kind of unifying of tone and narrative,
that was really part of my role as the writer.
Each chapter was written in a first draft
initially by one of the three of us.
So Adam, Frank, you know, took the lead
on the quantum mechanics chapter, Marcello,
Gleister took the lead on the cosmology chapter.
I took the lead on, you know,
the cognition consciousness and the introduction chapters.
But then we each, you know, wrote over each other's drafts.
And then when we felt that we all were sort of
on the same page with regard to what we were saying,
then it was really my job to smooth it out
and just give it a unified voice and tone,
which I'm happy to hear you say you think it works
because, you know, when you're doing something like that,
you don't want to remove the particular,
you know, the special things that each author has
in the way they articulate something,
the way they write something,
you don't want to just remove that and flatten things.
But on the other hand,
you can't have really very different styles
in the same chapter, let alone the same book.
So that definitely took some work,
but I enjoyed that work actually.
I found it very satisfying and it enabled me
to really deeply think through each chapter
with materials that, you know, I'm not an expert on,
you know, quantum mechanics, cosmology,
the physics of time.
I mean, these are not my areas of expertise.
I have an interest in them from a philosophy of science angle,
but that's not, you know, to be a scientist in those areas.
So I learned a lot from doing that.
Well, that's interesting.
And I won't open this up as rabbit hole,
although maybe we'll return to it.
I mean, I've been doing a lot of work right now
on dialogical reason as opposed to monological reason
and a lot of the emerging evidence about how it has
a lot of capacities to overcome bias
and to be more clear and complex at the same time
that you get with monological.
So I welcome that, the fact that this was
sort of dialogically produced.
So in order to flesh that out a little bit more,
can you tell me a little bit more about Adam and Marcello?
Yeah, so Adam Frank is an astronomer and astrophysicist
at the University of Rochester.
He works on a number of different things in science
and he's written a number of more general audience books.
Marcello Glycer is a theoretical physicist
and he's also done a number of different things
in the scientific domains as well as having written
a number of popular books.
So the way that we wound up writing this book
is that Marcello directed for I think about five
or six years at Dartmouth College where he's based,
an Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Engagement, ICE.
And he invited fellows each year to come and be there
for a couple of weeks and give some talks
and just interact with the community there.
And he invited Adam and me, I think it would have been 2016
or 2017, I don't remember, so we were both there together
and we just started talking and at one point
in our conversations about science and experience,
this term, the blind spot, popped into our conversation
and then we just kept working on it, the three of us
and eventually it became clear that we had something
that we wanted to write.
So it really came out of conversations, our collaboration.
As a result of Marcello's having this special intellectual
setting where he was inviting scientists and philosophers
and historians and religious teachers,
spiritual teachers as well, also to the center.
And so their background is really coming out of physics
and history of science and then the conversation
between us was what launched the book.
That's excellent.
So there's good representation both from the history
and the philosophy of science going into this book.
So I want you to unpack the core argument.
No, and people do this to me all the time.
Can you summarize Awakening Tim from the Meeting Crisis?
Right.
Yeah.
So we'll give you time and space.
But when you do that, though, can you talk a little bit
about how at least these figures show up in the introduction?
They show up sort of throughout.
But Nishita and Whitehead and then Cartwright, three
philosophers at least, that's maybe the best category
they all belong to, are playing a pivotal role.
Cartwright I'm unfamiliar with.
I've just purchased a couple of her books
because of the Blind Spot, so thank you for that.
And now Whitehead and Nishita, I'm doing a lot of work on
and have been doing this on and off for several years.
But I mean, they have a notion about this idea that in some way,
I'll use Whitehead's idea here.
We've gotten into kind of a performative contradictions
where we're making statements about reality.
And then I'll use Nishita from a standpoint
that isn't consistent with those statements.
And many people on watching my channel,
I've made this argument about scientists making
pronouncements about everything above the level of the quantum
being an illusion.
And then it's like, but then you're
basing those statements on all these illusory machines,
and gauges, and illusory conferences.
What?
How are you drawing deep conclusions
about the ultimate nature of reality
from all this illusory material?
And there's a performative contradiction.
And I don't know if this is the actual source,
but I credit Whitehead was sort of the first person
to really put his finger on that performative contradiction,
although I've seen Nishita doing something very similar,
especially when he gets to Basho, when he's talking about Basho.
So what is the argument and why the term the blind spot, which
I found really helpful as almost an enacted metaphor for this?
Right.
So maybe we'll start with the metaphor of the blind spot.
So the blind spot in the way that we're using the term
is a metaphor from the blind spot in the individual field
that we have that all mammals have, actually.
And it's the area of the retina where the optic nerve
leaves and projects inward into the brain.
And because there are no light sensitive receptor cells,
where that bundle of nerve fibers enters into the brain,
we don't see anything in the blind spot.
There's no possibility of visual sensitivity
to what's in the blind spot.
But we also don't see that we have a blind spot
because the situation is the eyes are constantly darting about
and the blind spots of the two eyes are different.
And so as it is said, we sort of fill in across the blind spot.
So we have a blind spot, an area within the visual field
in which we don't see, and we don't see that we don't see.
So this is a metaphor for the idea that in our scientific world
view, there is something that makes science possible,
that is, you could say, the source of science.
But we don't see it, and we don't see that we don't see it.
And what it is, and now we could use different words for this,
what it is is lived experience, direct experience,
immediate intuition, pure awareness, these terms that
thinkers like William James and Kitara Nishida and also figures
in literature in the 19th turn of the 20th century
are interested in stream of consciousness.
All of these thinkers as modern science
is becoming this tremendously powerful epistemic accomplishment.
All of these thinkers are Whitehead, Husserl,
the phenomenologists.
They're all grappling with this recognition
that there is an experiential source to our knowledge,
that we systematically occlude when we think
about the nature of that knowledge.
And the way that we do that, it takes different forms.
But the way that we do that in how we think about science
is that we step back, we look for invariance
across perspectives, we look for things
that we can objectify and quantify
across a community of observers, forgetting
that those things actually depend on and arise out
of a background of lived experience.
And then we objectify them in a way
where we take them to be more fundamental than the experience
that underpins them.
And that's the crucial move in what we call the blind spot,
is this treatment of what comes about
through a certain method.
Let's call it a method of objectification, which
is a very powerful and very useful method.
We're not arguing against the method as such.
But when you forget that it's a method
and you take it for the being of what you're studying
in a way that makes that being more fundamental than the
experience that's animating the method, then what you've done
is, and here we really rely on Hustrel
in the crisis of European science,
you substitute a method for being, which
is like a category here.
And Hustrel calls this the surreptitious substitution.
You substitute a method that you've arrived at.
Hustrel identifies it as arising really most powerfully
in Galileo, where Galileo imagines the world
with no sentient creatures.
He then treats nature in terms of mathematical properties.
With the mathematical properties,
the method for him is geometry.
The mathematical properties are then
taken to be the actual being and reality of the universe
from a sort of God's eye point of view
that sees the language in which nature is written.
So that move of substituting a method for being,
that's the surreptitious substitution that's
built into the blind spot.
And the connection to Whitehead is that Whitehead,
there's sort of two concepts in Whitehead
that are important for us.
And for Whiteheadians out there,
I would say that we're really working here
from what is sometimes called Whitehead's middle period.
So the concept of nature is a really important book for us.
And also science in the modern world,
which is a little bit later.
So Whitehead says there's in the epistemology
that gets attached to modern science
or to natural philosophy.
You could say there's a bifurcation of nature.
Where we say, as Galileo did, what's
objective and fundamentally real
are the mathematical properties.
And the qualities, the lived experience, that's subjective.
And in a way, it gets kicked outside of nature.
That's the bifurcation.
It gets kicked outside because if nature is
that which is mathematical, and those qualities
have to be removed in order to mathematicianize nature,
then what are you going to do with those qualities that
are residing as it were in the mind?
Well, the mind then gets excised from nature.
And Whitehead is insistent on saying,
even from the standpoint of natural philosophy,
you cannot do that because the lived sensuous qualities
belong to nature.
And so the task is to create a system of relations
that treats them on the same level playing field
and integrates them.
And to think that the abstractions,
the mathematical abstractions, are what nature really is.
Whitehead calls that a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.
Because you've got an abstraction that you concretize.
And no, what's concrete is, in Whitehead's terms,
it's the sensuous experience or the sense
of awareness in which nature is given to us in terms of passage
and duration and flow out of which we abstract things
like space, time, continuum, and so on.
So that's sort of what we set up in the beginning of the book,
where the blind spot, just to maybe succinctly summarize it,
the blind spot is the inability to see or to recognize
or to acknowledge that lived experience
is the source of science.
And so if you undercut the source of science
by occluding lived experience, this is central to our argument,
you're actually damaging science.
Because you're removing the epistemic footing
that it needs to be the kind of powerful investigative method
it is.
And what happens is you get this symptomatic of the meaning
crisis in our culture, you get this oscillation
between the extreme of science triumphalism, which
is science is the greatest method ever,
and the world is what science tells us it is, on the one hand.
And then you get science denial, on the other hand,
because a very natural reaction to science triumphalism
is to say, well, that's not how I experience the world,
regardless of what you say.
And in a world of rapid transmission of information
and misinformation and willful misleading of people,
that oscillation between science triumphalism and science
denial becomes particularly problematic and proditious.
So that's sort of the setup of the book at the very beginning.
That was great.
Yeah, and that oscillation is, I mean,
it also comes to the fore in some ways.
I don't know if it's the same, but it resonates with the oscillation.
We have an instability in our sense of realness.
We have these two.
We have the mathematical sense of realness,
and Descartes played with both to no resolution.
Or we have the core where consciousness is present to itself
as what is most real.
And we also vacillate between those.
And I don't know if they are identical,
but at least they seem to be tracking also
between science triumphalism and science denialism.
I thought that was beautiful.
So it sounds like you're, and this is a bit of Nashida in it,
you're picking up on that the blind spot,
we're not only unaware of it,
but it is also simultaneously the source of our ability to see.
Yeah, that's right.
You're right, right?
Because the optic, you know,
and Nishitani builds on this,
it's the knot, the thing that makes it accessible to us
and that sort of thing.
So that move is really interesting to me.
This idea of grounding,
and you use that term a couple of times in source,
you use that term a lot.
So what would you say to somebody who says,
well, what do you mean?
I mean, isn't there a difference
between the epistemological order of how I come to knowledge
and the ontological order of what that knowledge discloses?
Yeah, I have to start in sense experience and et cetera, et cetera.
But that doesn't mean that ordering of my epistemological
endeavor is the same as the order of reality or how it unfolds.
I know that you're ready for this,
but I want to hear what you have to say about it.
Sure, sure.
Well, this depends on what ordering means.
So I mean, at one level,
it certainly is something that needs to be recognized
that the procedure by which we disclose something is one thing
and that which is disclosed is another thing.
The ordering, though, if it's a hierarchical ordering
in terms of fundamentality goes beyond just that recognition
because it says what's ontologically fundamental
is, let's say, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the properties as mathematical
and the experience is derivative.
The problem with that ordering is that
the mathematical properties exist at a different level
of intelligibility from the concrete phenomena.
And they are, if you will, the map and the territory is the concrete phenomena.
And if you, if you assume that the territory just is the particular map
and the way that you're able to render it using, you know,
the tools of, of objectification and mathematics,
that's, that's actually to not see that.
So let me give a concrete illustration
because this is a very abstract way of putting it.
So, so one of the things we talk about is time.
And so we have the idea that, you know,
from a, from the standpoint of physics clock, you know,
time is what clocks measure.
That's fine as a method, but if you then say, well, what time is,
is what a clock measures, you've forgotten that there needs to be clock readers
and they exist in some window of duration.
That's, that's a continuous flow that disappears.
If you, if you try to reconstruct it in terms of, you know,
point-like instance and clock readings, so.
So let me just interject here.
Yeah.
So I want to make sure I'm tracking.
You're saying something like there's a kind of time in clock reading
that is presupposed in measuring time with a clock.
Exactly.
I could put it that way.
Exactly.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
So, so there was just a review of the blind spot in LA review of books
by Robert Crease, who's a philosopher of physics, also writes, you know,
general books about, about science.
And he had a wonderful statement that I, that I wish we had actually thought of.
And let me see if I can, if I can, if I can get it exactly.
So he says, describing our view, no one pulls out a clock to know what time is.
They pull out a clock to know what time it is.
So that's basically the idea, right?
You already have to have some experience of time.
And you might say, sort of, to use a, use a phenomenological term, a kind of, you know,
pre-understanding of time in order to be able to recognize a clock as at all
relevant to, you know, to the, to the subject phenomenon that you're immersed in.
So the ordering, so the epic, just to go back to the ordering point.
So the ordering is, is, is what we object to is the sort of hierarchical ordering
in terms of fundamentality, where we say experience is not fundamental.
Or what's disclosed to us of the world in how we experience it is derivative,
not fundamental.
And what's fundamental is what we, what we're able to reveal through,
through say, mathematical models.

Okay, so there's two moves here and I like both of them because I've advocated for
both of them.
So I hope, I hope this isn't just two members of the choir performing
in front of the minister or something like that.
That's okay too.
Because I've talked about, you know, even a naturalist should be committed not only
to what is derivable from your science, but what is presupposed by the practice
of your science.
And that's exactly what you seem to be saying.
You're right.
Greg and Rikus and I talk about that as extended naturalism, right?
And then the next one is, and then this one may be maybe more controversial,
but it sort of follows from the first.
There's an implicit judgment of realness and I think, well, I hope you agree.
I take real as a comparative adjective, right?
You know, people from Plato to Marlapondi to Whitehead have said, you only judge one
thing as an illusion by judging something else is real.
It's always comparative and vice versa.
And so what I was hearing something like fundamental, implying something like more real,
and the idea is, I'm not happy with this term and we'll play with them a little bit later,
but the concrete is more real than the abstract because of something like, and you say this
multiple times too, there's a richness.
There's an inexhaustible-ness to that that, and this is the point about the map territory
kind of, the territory is way richer, has an inexhaustible, it overflows any particular
map, even a globe, even a Earth-Science globe, et cetera, et cetera.
Is that?
Yeah, sure.
That's very, you know, so for me, just because we're sort of putting cards on the table,
that's the influence of Polania on me.
He was proposing that as the mark of what he calls contact with reality.
And Esther, like Kat Mead, has talked about that in her book of the same title, this inexhaustible-ness,
but it's not her coffin is inexhaustible, and we'll play with that a little bit.
It's kind of like an inexhaustible fount of intelligibility, right?
And so is that, is that, I think, there?
Yeah, so that's very much it.
I mean, another way that I think of it is that our being always is more than or overflows
our knowing, because knowing, you know, happens through certain means, through certain methods,
through certain sensory systems, through certain forms of intelligibility, and our being is
always larger than that.
It always overflows that, yeah.
So that would, that's wonderful, Evan.
I've got to slow down.
I'm very enthusiastic about that.
So that means that, well, let me form it as a question.
Is it possible that one, because I've made an argument that one of the contributors to
the meaning crisis is we've reduced many kinds of knowing that have many different kinds
of memory attached to them, procedural, episodic, autonometric, have different criteria of realness
to them, skill is power, you know, perspectival knowing is sort of like noticing, getting
that sense of, you know, getting deeper into things, more present to them.
And then the participatory knowing is the sense of sort of belonging, fittedness to
your environment.
And what I mean by that is part of, I hear you saying this, but I want to frame it like
that.
Our practice, we've reduced what knowing is, and we forgot, when we do that, we've forgot
the ultimate responsibility of knowing to being, like particularly our being, but also
being in general, like we forgot that there are ways of knowing that are more or are closer
metaphor to our being in the world than these mathematical abstractions.
Is that also tracking?
Oh, definitely.
Yeah.
No, definitely.
I think there are different kinds of knowing, there are different modes of knowing, I suppose
you might say, different ways of delineating those, of course, too.
And it's because science is so transformatively powerful, in its outward obvious manifestations,
we have defaulted to thinking, and I mean, you see this explicitly in Descartes, right?
We have defaulted to thinking that knowing is a matter of having a method.
And that's true for some methods of knowing.
Even the application of a method presupposes something that you can't state in terms of
a method, right?
I mean, this is a familiar kind of thing for philosophers.
So yeah, no, that's right, there's a kind of acquaintance, you could say, that we have
with our being that is not a matter of having a method.
That acquaintance is not unproblematic, of course, I mean, all sorts of questions arise
in relation to that, normative questions, existential questions, philosophical questions,
ethical, political, of course.
But it's the background for the application of any method, exactly.
I was smiling because I know you're aware of this because you tweeted about it, you know,
with Johannes Yeager and Henry Dell and Aldrich Bedwick and Dennis Walsh, we're trying to
get a paper published on how you can't ultimately, you can't capture relevance realization and
computation for exactly that reason, that the process of formalization of translating
things into a formal system is always an ill-defined problem that requires relevance realization.
And that's sort of, I mean, there's a lot more to that paper, but that's the core kind
of thing.
Yeah, no, I love that paper and I completely agree and sympathize with the argument, yeah.
Now, what's interesting, excellent answer to that question.
So I'm going to throw out these like devil's advocate things and then you do, you did this
wonderful thing and we get into some nice discussion.
Well, somebody will say bifurcation, come on, we've always bifurcated because we, we
have to and we do even in our lived experience readily and reliably make distinguishing distinctions
between appearance and reality, fraud and reality, illusion and reality, delusion and
reality, hallucination and reality, right?
And, and, and yeah, maybe we cut it up as a subjective and objective, but the ancient
world cut it up into the problem of the one in the mini.
We're always building these worldviews, trying to somehow give us a normative guide for how
we discern, you know, reality from appearance.
And so isn't a bifurcation an inevitable thing therefore?
Yeah, so, of course, we always live in a, in a world where we have to make distinctions
between, you know, the appearance of something and as we say how it really is.
But if we think about how that works, the, the, the test, the criterion, the standard
for how something really is, is disclosed in and through another experience.
So it's not that we step outside of experience and we have some absolute standard or metric
by which we can say, this is real and that isn't real.
It's rather that we continually open up new vistas, new horizons in experience where the
relationship between appearance and reality shifts within the sphere of experience itself.
So that's not really bifurcation in Whitehead sense.
That's, that's a sort of progressive changing of appearances, perspectives, you know, profiles,
aspects of things where what we take to be true or real is something disclosed again
through experience where Whitehead, when he uses the term bifurcation of nature, really means
you kick experience out of the framework of scientific, the framework of the scientific
representation of nature.
And then, and we know this very well today in terms of the hard problem of consciousness,
then you face a very, very fundamentally difficult problem of how to recover consciousness,
awareness, the mind.
And the hard problem is that problem.
It's a problem that that derives in a way from the bifurcation of nature in the way that we state
the problem today, which is, you know, how is consciousness possible in a purely physical
world where we conceive the purely physical in terms of this bifurcation of, you know, a
mathematical, quantitative nature that then somehow we have to find a room for the qualia,
the qualitative properties, the phenomenality, the appearances.
And then we either, we do that by either trying to, you know, be reductionist and say, well,
it just really is physicality in the face of the obvious sort of problem of conceptual
intelligibility there.
Or we say, well, it actually is an illusion itself.
We sort of go the illusionist route.
And then we strain at the intelligibility of the concept of an illusion.
Or we, you know, or we go panpsychist and we say, well, there's a sense in which consciousness
and some minimal, phenomenal sense is sort of an ingredient everywhere at all levels.
So we sort of like having sucked the consciousness out, we then sort of like spray it back into
the universe as it were everywhere.
And that doesn't really work either.
So that's the bifurcation.
So, so yes, of course, we have to make distinctions between appearance and reality, genuine counterfeit.
But we always do that within a framework of the test of experience.
So that's the key move.
And I like that.
That was a great answer.
And there was a moment in the book.
Sorry, I don't mean to indicate it was the only moment in the book.
There was one moment in the book, one among many, where I was, I was looking at this and
I said, oh, I never put those two together.
You know, I talk obviously about, you know, the relationship to God and the two worlds
mythology.
But you did this, you made this move where you said, you know, the thing about the idea
of of this, I don't know what to call it, you know, the monarchical God or something
like that God, even when that God disappeared, we preserved the placeholder function of the
view from nowhere, right, in there.
And so what I hear you critiquing is that view from nowhere possibility.
It's like, yes, yes, there's reality, illusion, reality distinctions, but you never are in
the place from nowhere, no when to make that distinction.
Is that a, is that a fair way?
That's right.
That's right.
Exactly.
I mean, if you read, if you read Newton or Galileo, you have this, this conception, a
particular kind of conception of God as, as able to, you know, behold everything at all
times from all possible perspectives, you know, Newton says that, you know, space is
God's sensorium.
So there's a sense of God can, can contemplate, you know, every, every possible perspective
of a thing in space.
You, you have a, you have a conception of, of the outside view and science, you know,
is, it may never achieve that, but that's, it's, it's ideal in a way.
And so that is very much what we're, what we're criticizing is no, that that's, that's
not how science works.
And it's not how knowledge works, it's not how experience works.
So that's really good.
And I want to, I want to, I want to shift back into a Nishita just for a sec.
I forget where it's in Nishita, but Carter talks about it in his beautiful book, The
Nothingness Beyond God.
He talks about Nishita's distinction between the transcendent, transcendent and the imminent
transcendent.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Because you, well, you qualified something and I think it was good that you did because
some of my people listening to this, you're not the village atheist or something like
that.
And I argued for here.
And so, and I hear you're saying, well, that conception, the transcendent, transcendent,
that, that is probably given this argument, a performative contradiction of some kind.
Like it's, it's ultimately not conceivable to us, not just because we're limited or finite,
but because it is inherently, it severs itself from the very sources of meaning and understanding.
Is that, is that, is that a, that is, yeah, yeah, whereas there's something like the
notion of the imminent transcendence, which you get, of course, in, in Whitehead, right?
You have the, the emergence, right?
You, you have, and we can talk about whether or not you still like this language, but you
know, you have the eternal and the emergent and they're constantly resonating with each
other, but they're always bound together.
Whitehead says, you know, God transcends the world to the same degree that the world
transcends God and God is imminent in the world to the same degree, the world is imminent
in God.
And I think that's very aligned with what Nishita is trying to get at.
Now it, so the, you aren't responsible to every possible audience.
I get that.
But a lot of people come to this and I think this is a fair point around the meeting crisis
and they come to this around the issue of sacredness because they say, yes, you're talking
about reality and you're talking about things can be more real.
I can be closer.
I can be more in conformity to it.
I can live a perhaps a fuller life, a more responsible life.
And there's a sense that that could even be sacred.
It could afford transforming me, making me a better person.
And you know, both Whitehead has, has a God and Nishita talks a lot about God and he certainly
has a sacred in it.
So I know you're not a theologian and I'm not, I'm not trying to bend you into something,
but I think this is a fair question.
Because these questions around the meeting crisis bring up issues around, you know, about
sacredness and ultimacy and what, what would you say about that?
Would you say that, yeah, because there's a parallel, this is all final proposal for
before I shut up and let you answer the question.
There's a parallel with religious denial and religious triumphalism, I think, in a certain
way.
And, and maybe, you know, and you're, you're trying to get out of the one.
And I, I agree with you on that, the science and you're trying, I've been trying to get
out of the other.
And I'm wondering if you see relationship between them, particularly because we're, and
I want to get into this with you at some point.
I think this meaning, the, what psychologists call meaning in life, not semantic meaning,
but this sense of connectedness to reality is what's behind, you know, our judgments
of what is, you know, most real and most sacred, most important for us, et cetera.
Do you think those two problems talk to each other?
I know you don't, I mean, I haven't read a whole book, maybe you talk about it in other
places in the book.
No, that, yeah, no, those are really interesting thoughts and questions.
That definitely goes beyond what we talk about in the book.
So we don't, I mean, I'm happy to talk about it here, but just, just to be clear about
the book, it's not, we don't really enter into issues about, you might say larger issues
about meaning that connect to, to religion or to the sacred or to spirituality.
You know, we may be allude to the certain aspects of them here and there, but they're
not, they're not a really dominant theme in the book that, you know, the book is really
circumscribed by the, by the effort to, you know, help us get clear about what science
is and how science works.
But that, of course, immediately raises the question from, you know, a larger perspective
of how to think about science in relationship to philosophy or religion or to issues about,
about the sacred.
This is difficult, you know, in a way to know exactly how to enter because, you know, the
word, the word sacred can mean different things.
The word, you know, the word God can mean different things like whitehead has a very
idiosyncratic conception of God.
I mean, it's been generative for process theology, but, but it's, it's, it's, it's an
outlying conception, even within the realm of theology.
So I would do how I'm using it and maybe and see if that's good enough.
And I'm deeply influenced here by a fellow Canadian, a Schellenberg, and his idea of the
triple transcendent, the sacred is that, which is, in some sense, ultimately real for us.
It is ultimately transformative for us.
It has a sodorological function.
It's not just an intellectual ascent.
And then it, it has an axiological, it serves as kind of an ultimate normative
guide for us in some way and making our ethical and aesthetic, even epistemological
judgments and, and, and, and other people like Bracken and the Divine Matrix seem to
be arguing that I'm not, I'm not saying this is going to satisfy everybody, but maybe
it's enough of a core so that we got something to work with in answering the question I'm
posing to you.
Yeah.
I guess the way that I have been thinking about that recently, so that this isn't really
worked out for me in a thorough way, but, but, but I have thought about these things,
you know, more in actually in relation to the writings that I've done about Buddhism and
religion and science in my, in my earlier book, Why I'm Not a Buddhist.
So there's an issue I would say about.
You're going to come on my show and talk to me about that book when I get to that book.
I've had that book on my shelf for a while and I apologize for that.
Yeah, no worries.
Yeah, yeah.
No, that would be fun.
Um, so we might, we might use Tillick's idea of, you know, faith as ultimate concern,
like not to say that that has to stop there, but we can take that idea as an entry point.
I like a lot as you know, he's big.
Yeah.
So ultimate concern.
Or, you know, we could, we could use the word sacred to mean ultimate concern as well.
So, so, you know, faith, sacred, ultimate concern.
For me, um, one issue really has to do with a juxtaposition between, uh, what Martin
Hogland calls secular faith.
So this is the idea of, um, faith in our, in our being as faith in our finitude, faith
in the life we share together as finite beings, you know, under the, under the horizon of
death or within the, you know, the limit of the horizon of death, the kind of existential
secular conception of ultimate concern where ultimate concern really has to be grounded
in, in this life and, and, and this world that we, that we share with each other.
Whereas the notion of transcendence can be used in a way that would, that would, that
would be juxtaposed to that where transcendence would mean something like, um, a state either
of liberation or freedom or release that takes us beyond or outside this life.
Transcendence doesn't have to be used that way because you could have a transcendence
in immanence again within this, you know, within this life.
But when used, um, that way, which I think is, is one fundamental sense of transcendence
we see running through, uh, lots of different religious traditions, then I don't see, it's
not that I want to deny that because I think for many people that's important and meaningful,
but it wouldn't be how I would articulate the sacred or ultimate concern.
Right. And so there's a diss, I mean, and I've realized I've made an error sometimes in making
this a hard and fast distinction, it's more of a continuum, but there is a distinction to be made
between something being indispensable to somebody and somebody claiming it's sort of metaphysically
necessary in some fashion. The example I use is I'm, I'm monolingual, so English is indispensable
to my cognitive agency. That doesn't mean it's metaphysically necessary.
And so I think, I think that's how I sort of parse what you're doing.
And I agree with you, the sacred does not obligate us to any kind of escapism because
behind the escapism is a two worlds mythology and then we have the problem of the bifurcation
and then we're getting into back to the very place we're trying to get from. And I agree with
that. That's a mistake. But here's, here, like, so for example, the meaning in life literature,
you want to ask people if they have meaning in life, you can ask them these three questions.
And like, what do you want to exist even if you don't?
Sorry, say that question again. What do you want to exist even if you don't?
Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
How real is it? And sometimes you put in the qualifier, how really real is it? Because
simply, what do you mean? Right? Right. And then, and then how much of a difference do you make to
it right now? If you got, if you got something, you know, doesn't have to be an object, obviously,
if you have something that, you know, this is Susan Wolf's, this is trying to, you know,
break out into a questionnaire Susan Wolf's idea of being connected to something larger than yourself.
Right. What that metaphor means is, well, people want this thing,
like they want it to be in the universe, even if they're not, it's not, it's not in any way
bound to their egocentric preferences. Right. Right. And then the next one is, right. It can't
be fraudulent. It can't be mere appearance. It can't be superficial. It has to have significance
in depth. And then, and then the next is, but we have to be connected to it. We have to make a
difference to it. And so, so remember, I agree with everything you said, and I sort of ran through
that, the argument with you about it. But how do you, I'm going to express sympathy. I can express,
and let me buttress this. Okay. So you're, you're in the Axial Revolution. You've got Bella's second
order thinking your, your metacognition has been massively improved by numeracy with what the Greeks
are doing with alphabetic literacy. You've got incipient democracy. So debate is everywhere,
hyper justification, and you've got a shared culture, but many different
polices. So you have all the six social experimentation, and this is really blowing
your metacognitive abilities up. Right. And so you're getting just a tremendous awareness
of your capacities for self-deception. And then you're liable to think, oh, you know,
and you can see this in Plato, you can, you can even see it outside of Greece. You can see it
like in the Dhammapada, but, you know, right. And things like this, that, you know,
this realization about how much of our suffering and violence is due to this
self-deceptive proclivity of the mind. And then you could start to conceive of a world that,
how the world would be if you weren't looking at it through that torture of self-deception and
self-destruction. And then you could plug into this, this other thing we said, you've got,
that's, it's being connected to that is deeply meaningful to you. And you somehow have a sense
of it being beyond your life, right. And beyond your egocentric concerns. And so I'm not justifying,
I'm trying to play with an explanation with you. It's very tempting to give into a two-rules
mythology. That is just such a wonderful way of explaining all of that and drawing it together.
Yeah, no, that's right. And I think, you know, there, there are different cultural forms
that, that that takes. So, you know, say in India, where in the, you know, the Vedas, we don't really
see the, the idea of rebirth or, or, you know, reincarnation, as we sometimes say, we, we,
we have a cosmology in which, you know, there may be, you know, higher, more divine kind of
transformative states or possibilities after death that have to do with, with divinities
and, and, you know, the sort of sacred order of the cosmos. And then we have this idea that we have
this sort of ethicization of action, where the idea is, you know, if you act, you know, in a good
way, then, you know, the possibility of a more refined transformative after death state is open
to you. If you act in a bad way, then it's going to go worse for you after death. And, and so we,
we have this sort of, you could say kind of two world, if we, if we slice it in terms of,
you know, life here and what happens after, you know, after death. And then we have the idea that
of karma that we see really first in the Upanishads, where it's, you know, because of desire,
you're actually thrown back from that other world into this world. And, and then it goes round and
round and round. And that becomes an existential problem that has to be, you know, has to be solved.
And then we get, you know, the different solutions to it on the part of, you know, Buddhism and,
and, you know, the Buddhist teachings or, or what later come to be called Hindu teachings.
So that's all part of this axial, this axial transformation in our, in our consciousness,
in our metacognition, in our cosmology, in our ethics, definitely. And,
Well, let me phrase the question. Since we've landed on sort of a, I like the way you broadened
it, because I want the cross cross contextual, cross historical, right? Given that something
like that, let's like, like that, how do we preserve the recognizable gains? There's a
change in the notion of wisdom to, to, like you said, this, this kind of liberation, maybe escape,
but transformation from, you know, maybe a bronze age, you know, Taylor talks about,
you know, the continuous cosmos and you're trying to fit in and harmonize, right? It's,
it's a very, it's a very different notion of wisdom. How do we preserve what was gained
by us? And you know, I'm going to obviously ask the same thing when we come to the scientific
revolution. How do we, how do we preserve what was gained by the axial revolution? Well, can we,
can we preserve that? Let's say we, we agree, we want to preserve it. I'm presuming here,
but let's say we want to preserve a lot of what was gained by that, all the metacognitive
enhancements, all the sense of individual responsibility, right, et cetera, the realization
of self-deception, the possibility of self-correction. How do we, how do we maintain all of that?
Or can we, I'll phrase it a question, better question, can we maintain all of that? And
I don't know, tarot-free, and I'm trying to use a somewhat violent metaphor from
the two worlds of mythology. I mean, it's, it's almost, and, and, and, you know, part of this
also plugs into even our, you know, our conceptual metaphors and our embodiment, realism or
up, less real is down and like, I'm peeling up today and you're looking down and all this kind
of language and we abstract and the abstract is above and the concrete is like, like, it's, it's,
it's so woven culturally and even like, into, you know, plugs into our embodiment in a powerful way.
I think we can, but I want to hear what you, like, do you perceive the difficulty of the problem?
Oh, certainly. I mean, that is, that is a huge question, you might say,
part of the big historical question for our, for our times and the, and the, you know,
the crisis of meaning that we face as, as you've talked about it. And, and I see it,
you know, it's hard not to sort of go Hegelian here, but, but I mean, I'm going to give in to
the temptation. I see it, I see it in a way as, you know, that was a, that was a hugely transformative
revolution, let's call it, you know, the axial revolution. And we might also think that things
were lost in that. So we might think that a certain relationship to the natural world
was lost. And we're now especially conscious of the need to restore some viable,
I'll even say sustainable, though it's become a buzzword, some viable, sustainable relationship
between the human and the, and the rest of the biosphere that requires, I think, an affirmation
of the, the, the specialness of our earth environment. You know, yes, there are in, so
Marcelo Gleiser's book, The Dawn of a Mindful Universe is about this. It's, you know, yes,
there are, you know, inordinately many planets out there that might be able to support life,
but a critical examination also suggests that there might actually be very, very few that have
life. And if life is a special thing that's happened here, at least in the way that it's
happened here, then, you know, the sacred and ultimate concern has to involve our being in
relationship to the, to the biosphere. And we have to do it in a way that involves all of the
ethical cognitive gains that we made as a were of, from the axial revolution, you know, telescoping,
you know, huge historical time here. But we also have to do it in a way that recovers a kind of
sensibility to the, and relationship to the natural world that there would have been
pre-agricultural, at least according to some historical new narratives. We need, we don't,
we can't go back to that, of course, that's absurd, but we need to recover something of that
in a new, so the way this is Hegelian is it's like a higher turn of the spiral. This would be
how my dad would have put it, actually, is that, you know, you have this course, a recourse of
history, and you never repeat the same thing, but there are patterns where at a certain turning
of the spiral, you actually can look down and see, you know, the axial turn, you know, the, the,
the, the, the turn that would have been or the curve that would have been before the axial.
And from that perspective, you need to, you need to recover things that were lost because there's
always something lost as well when you, when you have a, when you have a gain. And that, you know,
the amazing thing about science, just to bring it back to the book for a moment is that, you know,
with, with things like the Gaia theory and earth system science, we've opened up a whole new appreciation
of, you know, that we don't live on the planet, we live in the planet that we're embedded at so
many levels in the very fabric of life on the planet. And that is it, is it, you know, to really,
to really be with that in a, in a, in an ethical way requires a kind of profound, I think, change
in our, in our sensibility that, that science gives us some of the tools for not all of them,
but some of them. And the other things are going to need to come from, you know, larger perspectives
of ethics and the sacred, you know, religion and spirituality art. I mean, the world is a lot
bigger than science, right? The human cultural world. Yeah. Well, that brings up two things.
One is, of course, I assume you're making a similar argument about the scientific revolution,
that there was a lot lost. I mean, that's what the book is saying. That's right. That's right.
But you're not proposing nostalgia. I get that. Definitely not. And so, but the thing you said
about that, that, that met that. So it's not only a looking back through the eyes of history,
it's also looking around through eyes other than the eyes of science, art, ritual, all different
ways of knowing, different ways of being together, of being in the world, looking, you know, looking
from within, not looking at, but looking from within nature, Ursula Goodenoff's notion of
transcendence into nature, things like that. And so Whitehead had this idea that we need to recover,
almost in Tolkien's sense of recover, we need to recover art and ritual and all of this and somehow
bring it back into having a proper role within our epistemological and ontological endeavors.
That's clearly sort of a thing that Whitehead is arguing. Does that land for you too?
Oh, definitely. Yeah, definitely. Okay, okay. And here's where we're maybe trespassing on
Matt's work, Matt Segal, especially his most recent book. But you know, and this where I'm
influenced somewhat by Habermas, right, you know, Kant basically severs the true and the good and
the beautiful from each other in really powerful ways with the three critiques and the autonomy
arguments for each one of those. And you know, Kant is sort of looming in places in the book here
and there. Because you're rejecting both the kind of old Platonism and simple Kantianism about
things like math, we'll probably get into that in the next conversation. I don't know if we'll
get to it now. But I'm trying to get at what would at least in a preliminary fashion, and I'm not
trying to pin you here, you know, I'm your friend, I want to talk to you about this. How would you
address? I mean, that's a hard problem. It's a hard problem. I mean, Habermas has been wrestling with
it. He wrestled with it, sorry, right, to, you know, overcoming those arguments that give us the
autonomy of the true, the good and beautiful. We have a sense, you know, and David Schindler has
been arguing about how they're actually convertible and all that sort of stuff. But how would you,
where would you, where would you go to, like, I'm trying to make, I'm trying to make Kant the
impediment that you have to address right now. But that's not all of his work. But just this move
about, right, the, you know, the, the, the separation and making autonomous,
including making the individual autonomous with each one of the, within each one of these
autonomies of, you know, because of the three critiques. That seems to me like a really
powerful thing to be trying to wrestle with philosophically. And the book has a philosophical
edge to it. You represent that. Yeah, that's an interesting question. I hadn't quite thought of
it in those Kantian terms. I suppose my, you know, my philosophical sensibility is so informed by
phenomenology in the sort of, you know, sense coming from, from, from this role. And it doesn't,
there's, there's a way of talking about truth, where it's very easy to think of truth as different
from the beautiful say. And that's because we think of truth in terms of the correctness of
propositions. And we have, we have an idea of correctness really, or of, or of correspondence.
But from a phenomenological perspective, that actually is a secondary sense of truth. And the
primary sense of truth is, is disclosure, or presence, or the, to be, you know,
technical in the way that Husserl uses the terminology, the, you know, the evidencing
of something. So evidencing is the, you know, we use evidence as a noun in English, we think
here's a piece of evidence, but, but in other languages, evidencing has this verbal sense where
you, you disclose something, you, you uncover it, you reveal it, it comes to presence, you know,
Heidegger tries to talk about this in terms of his, his sort of etymological reconstruction of the,
you know, the Greek sense of unconcealment of Aletheia, you know, Leithae is the concealment,
the Alpha Privet of Aletheia is the unconcealment. So there's this opening, this, the space of
unconcealment and openness, and it's within that space that you can then say, in terms of a proposition
you might assert that you put in quotation marks, oh, that proposition that you just said,
it's correct, that happens against this other sense of truth, which is, you know,
unconcealment, presence, openness, evidence, disclosure, you know, however you want to,
however you want to put it. So within that context, it's very difficult to make a separation between
the, the, the, the, the sense of truth as unconcealment and say, the beautiful,
or other aesthetic, aesthetic properties for that matter, or the just. And so if we think of it that
way, we are in a sense going back before Kant, you might say, well, that's going back before the
critical philosophy of Kant and, and thinking in, you know, a more Greek way. That's fine as long
as we do it, having taken, you know, the knowledge and the message, if we want to simplify things,
of Kant on board, you know, it's like, we're not going back in some nostalgic way in the way that
Heidegger often writes in a way that I find actually very distasteful, this kind of nostalgic,
artificial German, German romantic sort of projection back into the ancient world. No,
we're not doing that. We're, we're taking what we've learned from Kant, but we're moving forward
in the way that, say, phenomenologists have taught us to, taught us to do, where again, the,
the, the, let's say, the horizon of experience as, as, as presence is the, is the, is the context
within which we're, we're going to be talking, where those distinctions don't can't, can't be made
hard and fast in the way that they might have been done in, for the Kantian purposes.
I want to play with that a little bit. I like that because I've done similar play.
You know, Rikur talks about the hermeneutics of suspicion and that, and I've made the argument
the hermeneutics of suspicion is parasitic on what I call the hermeneutics of beauty. The hermeneutics
of suspicion is, appearances are distorting, misleading, they, they conceal deception, blah,
blah. But the hermeneutics of beauty, at least, some people are talking about beauty, is, well,
no, but there have to be situations in which appearances disclose reality, that appearance is,
is not a veil, right? The way, that's an enlightenment ideal, but, and that beauty is when
we're getting a sense, and this, and, and, and Skari does this in her book on beauty,
that it's what we're getting a sense of, oh, oh, it's, and it's, it's bound up with almost like
that insight moment where you realize, oh, I haven't been seeing this as, as, as it is. And then,
so that's beauty, but then that, you're already also in, like the truth, but you're also getting
into this other thing, this sort of, and you get this research from people who have, look at the
Griffith lab and others, I know you're familiar with this research, and they have the experience,
the noetic experience of the really real, and it seems to have a kind of normativity to them,
right? Right. And it's just, it's just in the fact that it's real, that it's normatively binding
on them, like, and they transform their lives and their relationships, and they're not guided by at
least a Kantian sense of being more moral, and they're not, right, but they're guided, but nevertheless
by this sense of a goodness, I call it, onto normativity, just to give a name to it. Somehow
there's a goodness to reality, that, and, and you're nodding, you might be just being polite,
but is that sort of the kind of thing you're talking about, where you start to unpack these
kind of things, and you start to say, well, no, you know, there's a sense of beauty as
appearances disclosing something underneath them, which relates to truth as disclosure,
and then there's a sense of goodness as, you know, this contact with the really real as something
that's sort of an ur normativity for us. Is that? Yeah, very much so. I mean, I think,
you know, in addition to beauty, I would, I would invoke awe and wonder. Sure, of course. Yeah, yeah.
I think that
it's impossible to separate those things phenomenologically in those kinds of experiences
and situations that people have, including science, right? Yeah, I mean, you read Einstein,
you know, writing about the world view that he has as a scientist and some of his own
experiences in thinking about his scientific work. You read historical, you know, scientific
figures throughout throughout history. And, and they all, you know, express or many of them express
this this sense of, you know, awe and, and, and wonder and amazement and, and, you know, a feeling
of the good transformative insight. And I think there's a deep connection. So I'm really going
to lay my cards on the table, because I know I can do that with you. But I mean, for me, I, I, I'm
very much drawn to mysticism in as a mode of understanding what's happening there. I think of,
you know, science and mysticism as as deeply linked throughout history in, in, in, in
in philosophical, cultural and, and, you know, personality ways in terms of individual scientists
where, you know, mysticism is this, I think of mysticism almost as a kind of epistemic
humility. It's that, you know, the world is, is vast. It's unfathomable. And that there are modes of
knowing is not even the right word. There are modes of being in which there is a felt
oneness or unity that can be expressed in innumerably different ways in, you know, in, in
science and art and philosophy and, and mysticism, you know, so, so going back to the sacred, I think
of it as a kind of, you know, the need for kind of imminent mysticism, a mysticism of, you know,
the here and now in this planet, you know, with, with, with the needs that, that face us as a species
and as a, as a civilization, as a scientific civilization. So I see the mystic as really
almost the, the, you know, the guardian, the remind, the reminderer, the, the sort of
watch person for that sensibility. Yeah.
Well, I think you know that I agree with that quite deeply. A lot of my work is about trying
to get these two to speak together. And in your own book, The Blind Spot, I was noting the many
places where you explained why this was chosen by the scientists, especially in the history
chapter, because it was elegant, because it was beautiful, because it was simple. I mean, there's
a problem with the notion of simple. We act as if it's a cleanly, cleanly determinable thing,
but it's not, right? And stuff like that. But there, yeah, there was this tremendous sense of how
much that is, how that is, you know, driving, motivating and justifying the moves that these
scientists are making historically. Yeah. And even, you know, as people have written about,
just, you know, just to balance things, that, that can sometimes lead us astray. You know, we
can get caught up in the beauty of the mathematical constructions in a way where we lose, we lose
contact with how the world actually is talking back to us. And we, you know, we depart from any
real possibility of experiential grounding or confirmation or support. I mean, this happens,
you know, so I'm, I'm, you know, Marcelo and Adam could talk much more articulately about this,
but you know, this happens in, in areas of physics, you know, in string theory or, you know, the
many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and, and how people just are willing to run with
its metaphysical implications in this sort of profligated indiscriminate way. So that's sort
of the flip side is you can get, you can get fascinated by constructions that have a kind of
beauty, but that are, but that are misleading in certain ways. For sure. For sure. And
it's interesting that maybe we'll leave to when they're present to talk about this more in depth,
but you can see sort of both of these impulses, right? You, yeah, you can get the rabbit holding
that goes on with strings theory and multiple worlds. And it's just one electron moving all
through time and space and countering itself and like, what, how could you possibly determine that
or given empirical content of that claim? And then, but the other, like there, there is something,
and I hear that the, the, maybe I'll call, I'll be poetic, the whisper of the mystic in the,
in this drive to unify the very, very bottom with the very, very top, the cosmo relativity
with quantum. And it's like, you know, if there was ever a falsification of popper, there's a
falsification. We've had the best minds and the best technique and they keep making this hypothesis
and it keeps getting reliably disconfirmed and they, that doesn't matter. They just keep going
and they just keep going. And I think that's powerful. Yeah. I wouldn't want to, I, I'm very,
I, I, I try to make a distinction between the wisdom that mysticism can give us and any particular
ontological or epistemological knowledge claims that are made. And the first, I think I take
very seriously. The second, I, I agree with quite a bit of suspicion. Right. And, and, and I think
that's important. Well, I just want to, I want to wrap up for today. And we're, I think this was
great. We're really unpacking things really nicely, very dialogically the way I like. I want to talk
to you next time, just to forewarn. I want to talk to you around, about these issues,
about abstraction. And you, you make a wonderful correction, or at least amendment. I can't remember
is at the end of chapter one or chapter two, you talk about, well, you say, actually, we, we mean
more or less abstract or more or less concrete, because the terms are actually relative and
comparative, right? You know, the dog is more abstract than the Cocker Spaniel, but the mammals
more abstract than the dog and, right, and all that sort of thing. And I want to unpack that a
little bit more. And how does that plug into this notion of more, more real, as you're more
closer to the inexhaustible fount of intelligibility. And then there's this other one about, you know,
direct experience, immediate pure experience. And, you know, and then you're familiar with this,
no doubt. These are criticisms made by others against people like Nishida and the Kyoto schools,
you know, Hey, Gillions would make this argument. What? What do you mean? There's no, there's all
experiences mediated. That's the gain from the Kantian Revolution. That's the thing you're doing
where you're trying to go back before it can't, you're giving up the realization that everything
is mediated in some fashion. And there's no such thing as immediate experience or direct experience.
Right. Does that sound like a, a fecundary to go into it? Yeah, definitely. I mean,
immediate, immediate is like abstract concrete. It's, you know, there's a,
Yeah, exactly. There's a contextual issue there as to what,
what immediate versus immediate means, just as there is for abstract concrete. But yeah,
no, those are all important things to talk about. Definitely. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Excellent.
Well, Evan, first of all, I'm going to thank you. This has been just fantastic. Thanks. I had great
expectations and it exceeded them. I really enjoyed myself a lot. I hope you did. Yeah,
definitely. Lots of fun. And I definitely want you back. Let's have the next one just be you
and I again. Okay. And then maybe we, you could reach out to your co-authors and we could set up
maybe a third and fourth with all of us together. Yeah. We might need a little bit more time for
those episodes just to give more space for more people to be able to chime in. But I always like
to give my, you know this from when you were on the philosophy of meditation, we'd like to give
the people here the last word. It can be provocative. It can be summative. It can be
mysteriously evocative. Whatever you want it to be. I don't know if I have a, if I have a last word
of that, of that nature, other than just to say it's always lots of fun to talk with you. And,
and yeah, you know, I've really enjoyed the conversation. Yeah.
All right. So then I'll give the last word. I'm going to plug the book again. Okay. Really,
this book, if you are interested in the meeting crisis, if you're interested in, well,
relevance realization, that's in the book too. If you're interested in all of these issues,
we'll be talking about the sacred, about, you know, the fact that somehow we need to be put
back into the scientific worldview, but that means changing what we mean by a scientific worldview.
And you should be interested if you're watching this video, because I've been talking about those
things for five years, at least in this space, and I don't know, 20 years at the university. So
you should definitely buy the book. Again, very clearly written, accessible without being a dumbing
down. It's a nice stepping down without being a dumbing down. I highly recommend the book. Go out
and get it. It's not expensive. It's a great read. And thank you very much again, Evan. Just a great
pleasure. Thank you.
