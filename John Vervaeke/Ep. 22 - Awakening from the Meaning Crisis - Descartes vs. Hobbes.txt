Welcome back to Awakening from the Meeting Crisis. Last time, we took a look at Martin
Luther and the deep impact in our cultural grammar made by the Protestant Reformation.
We talked about things like cultural training for narcissism, sapiential obsolescence, the
division of church and state, which furthers secularism and the rise of the Protestant
work ethic and how that's how that integrated with emergent corporate capitalism. We then
took a look at some initial responses by Pascal to this change and the loss of the
cosmos being replaced by the infinite spaces that terrify. We looked at an individual who
tried to respond to that brilliant genius from the heart of the scientific revolution and that's
Ren√© Descartes. He creates a new psychotechnology, the psychotechnology that is at the core of the
scientific enterprise is understood today and that's Cartesian graphing and the whole proposal
is that we can render everything into equations and that if we mathematically manipulate those
abstract symbolic propositions, we can compute reality and that Descartes saw in that a method
for how we could achieve certainty and that he understood the anxiety of his time as being
provoked by a lack of certainty and the search for it and this method of making the mind
computational in nature would alleviate the anxiety that was prevalent at the time. I
noted that we had two different elements in our grammar that are in significant tension
with each other and they both share, that's what's so interesting about them. They share,
they overlap significantly in the idea of the isolated individual mind whereas Luther's
going to put an emphasis on conscience, Descartes is going to put an emphasis as we'll see, we began
to see last time, we'll now call consciousness although of course these two words are highly
related in nature but on one side we have the grammar from Luther telling us that we need
to accept without question, without evidence, without argumentation and then Descartes is we
should only accept that when we have certainty and neither one of those is viable for us,
they're both pathological in a very deep way but we saw that Descartes nevertheless proposes
this new method, a method again similar in so many ways to essential features of the
Protestant Reformation, a method cut off from tradition, a method cut off from institution,
a method that relies just on the individual mind and relationship to itself. So although
in one way, in one sense these two grammars, the Lutheran grammar and the Cartesian grammar
seem so opposed in our culture and these grammars are at war in our current culture war, the war
between an understanding of faith as a radical acceptance and knowledge as the pursuit of
logically derived certainty although they are that grammatical tension is at the core of
a lot of our culture wars, nevertheless these two views are so deeply bound together because
of their mutual influence and their shared commitment to the isolated individual self.
Descartes has a couple of contemporaries, as I mentioned Pascal, we'll come back to Pascal in a
bit but we also talked about Hobbes and Hobbes comes up with the radical proposal that following
on Descartes, if cognition is computation and if matter is real then we can build a
material computer and we could artificially make cognition. Artificial intelligence is a
product of the scientific revolution and is part and parcel of the advent of the meaning
crisis in modernity. Now what I want to do is take some time to look at these two interactions
that I've mentioned, draw them out a bit, we have Descartes versus Hobbes and then we have Descartes
and Pascal, what we can learn from these interactions because they're pivotal and we are now going to
remind ourselves that the idea of artificial intelligence is deeply relevant to both the
scientific revolution and the meaning crisis. I've shown you how it's relevant to the scientific
revolution and I pointed out last time that it is deeply relevant to the meaning crisis because
Hobbes with the proposal of artificial intelligence proposes to finish the swath of death that has
been created by Galileo killing the universe for example and what Hobbes is doing is killing the
human soul and of course that's going to exacerbate the cultural narcissism because if we no longer
have souls then finding our uniqueness and our true self, the self that we're going to be true to
becomes extremely paradoxical and problematic. If you don't have a soul what is it to be true
to your true self and what is it that makes you utterly unique and special from the rest of the
purposeless meaningless cosmos? So these are going to be crucial questions. Now I want to take a look
at how Descartes responds to Hobbes because that's going to make clear to us again both the scientific
import and the existential relevance of the AI project and it'll also make clear deeper problems
that we are now facing in the meaning crisis. Now here's where it's important to make clear
how we should treat Descartes. So it's very fashionable philosophically and cognitive scientifically
to blame Descartes for many many mistakes. There's a famous book by Demasio a book that in other
respects I think very highly of Descartes' error right and we'll talk about all this stuff later.
However I mean if I were to put it in a sentence I wish I had made Descartes mistakes. Descartes is
titanically brilliant and the mistakes he makes are so foundational to our culture so woven into
our cultural grammar that overcoming them is not going to be an easy task. Why I say this is because
I want to look at how Descartes actually rejects Hobbes' proposal of artificial intelligence
and why that rejection is still scientifically philosophically relevant to us today but how
it makes our existence problematic. What I want to say is there is often a claim made that Descartes
rejects Hobbes' materialism because Descartes is Catholic and that his motivation is religious
and then there is the innuendo that Descartes is actually operating sorry for this pun in bad faith
he's merely trying to preserve his religious beliefs. I think this completely misrepresents
and is a disservice to Descartes' intellectual integrity. Descartes does not respond to Hobbes
out of his religious faith. Descartes responds to Hobbes out of the fundamental machinery
and central claims of the scientific revolution and I want to take a look at that because I
want to show you how problematic our worldview is becoming and has become. So Hobbes proposes
basically this idea of artificial intelligence. Descartes says that that's wrong and he has
a series of arguments against Hobbes that are very telling and what Descartes basically does
is argue about the central claims that are being made by the scientific revolution. The central
claims that are being made are claims that matter is real and reality is mathematically measured
and that the meaning and value of things is not in the things themselves. So let's go through this
very carefully. So Descartes says well Hobbes if you are making an argument if you're engaging in
reasoning as opposed to just computation you actually care. You have a goal you're held to
a standard of truth because whatever I'm doing when I'm reasoning I'm working towards the goal
of truth which means I'm acting on purpose. And secondly truth depends on meaning.
If I ask you is the following claim true? Is that true? You presumably can't tell
me if it's true or false because you first need to know what I just meant. Truth depends on meaning.
So reasoning acts on purpose. It acts in terms of meaning and it cares about standards or goals.
It works according to a normative standard of how we ought to behave.
Okay notice this. This is at the heart of reasoning. This goes centrally to a lot of
useless time I would say. I'm just going to be somewhat harsh here but a lot of useless time
in the current culture wars of discussions of rationality. I actually am a scientist who
scientifically studies rationality in human reasoning and it is often surprising to me how
little of the science of rationality advocates of rationality make use of.
How difficult and this is what I'm going to show you it is to integrate notions of rationality
with a scientific materialism. I am not anti-materialistic. That's not what I'm doing here.
I'm trying to show you that people who advocate a model of rationality that is ultimately cartesian
that rationality is about behaving purely logically in an attempt to get certainty in our
truths. Sam Harris for example comes to mind are not paying attention to the criticisms of that
model made by the very self-same Descartes. Do not advocate one side of a phenomena without paying
attention to central criticisms made about it by its progenitor. Because what's Descartes saying
to Hobbes he's saying well look look what's central to reasoning normativity how things
ought to be meaning and purpose and Hobbes and I'm going to I'm going to act on Descartes
behalf here and we I can do this I think in all integrity and legitimacy because we have Hobbes's
letters to Descartes and Descartes response and Descartes response are often contemptuous so you
can almost hear Descartes saying Hobbes you idiot you can't have a material reasoner because what
is the scientific revolution saying about matter it's saying that matter is inert it has no purpose
right there is no meaning in matter we've all we've been doubting that since Occam
Occam's razor remember what it actually cuts and it acts in terms of ought to be not how
things are no science doesn't act in terms of how things ought to be it acts only in describing
explaining how things actually are it has no values so science is teaching us that the world is
purposeless matter is meaningless there's no normative standard or structure in matter
it's just actually how it is and how it actually is is valueless
so Hobbes matter lacks meaning purpose normativity it's inert
how could you possibly get all of those things out of matter
how could you
if you're a reasoner you care about the truth and yet truth depends on meaning
purpose at least the pursuit of truth and normative standards of how things ought to be
and none of those are in matter well Hobbes responds and says well you know what it's like
what I can have is I can have little I have like my abacus and it's automated and I have little
pieces of paper on them and right the pieces of paper are manipulated much like the letters on
your computer screen and if they're manipulated in the right way I get a meaningful sentence the
cat is on the mat and then Descartes says Hobbes you're being an idiot because you're making a
fundamental mistake here first of all you're English I'm French I don't have this I have this
physically these are two very different things yet we're both thinking about the same meow meow
creature there's no meaning there's no intrinsic meaning in these material marks
if waves on a shore happen to mark scratch the pebbles right so that this word
appears on the beach would you think the ocean is talking to you that'd be ridiculous it's just
random grooves cut in the sand by the water it has no intrinsic meaning these things only have
meaning because they are associated with ideas in your mind and those ideas actually possess
meaning see do you see what Descartes saying he's saying look you have a view of matter that makes
the rationality that you're holding out to be so central actually deeply deeply problematic
see this is what we need to pay attention to when we invoke rationality as a standard of course we
should invoke rationality as a standard but first of all two things we should note the idea that
rationality is just the logical manipulation of propositions is something we should question
because I've shown you already the already that's not historically accurate that's a
particular view that we see from Descartes secondly Descartes himself rejects that because he
realizes that rationality is caring about the truth on purpose according to normative standards
and values and none of that machinery can actually be found in the scientific model of matter
so you know what is actually deeply mysterious in our culture right now although it is invoked
religiously and I mean that is exactly the notion of rationality itself
this is not me advocating irrationality not at all I am against the advocation of it as if
it is a philosophically unproblematic phenomena that is irresponsible
and seriously misleading okay is that it no there's more Descartes going to say more
in order to say that we need to go back to Galileo what more does Descartes say to Hobbes
what more does Descartes say to Hobbes Hobbes says well look Galileo had this problem
right and we've talked about it but let's go over it again mathematics is the language of
reality ultimately a platonic idea right and then you get the idea that there are two kinds
of properties there are the properties that are measurable by math those are the primary
properties the primary qualities the ones that are mathematically measurable and although the
term isn't quite used this way in Descartes time shortly thereafter it's going to come to take on
this meaning the mathematical properties are properties that are in the object regardless
of whether or not anybody is paying attention to them looking at them involved with them so if I
can measure it mathematically it's in the object it's objective
but of course Galileo faced the fact that many qualities of experience and notice how this is
you know part and parcel of this whole scientific revolution and the calling into question of
experience Galileo noted that many qualities are not mathematically describable how beautiful
something is right how sweet the honey tastes how wonderful the rose smells
and then he has an important idea here these are these were called secondary qualities
and the idea here is and notice how this follows on prokernicus these don't exist in the object
they only exist in my mind they're part of that veil that might they experience places between
me and the world they're part of the way in which my mind doesn't touch the world these are purely
subjective qualities purely in the subject
object thrown against thrown against object thrown against because matter resists me
subjective I can throw it under me I can dominate it
now notice what Descartes saying Descartes is going to pick up on this right
philosophers have a nice way of talking about these secondary qualities they have invented
this term called qualia that's plural the secondary qualities and the idea here is they're purely
subjective they exist only in the mind and that these make up an important part and there's all
kinds of debate about this I'm not going to try and resolve that here but somehow these qualia
are central to consciousness they're part of the fabric and or the content or and or the nature
of consciousness remember why I said that Descartes is emphasizing consciousness now here's the idea
what the scientific revolution showed it one of its big insights is this is in the world in matter
and this is not in the world it is only in mind
and then what you can say to Hobbes is the following and many philosophers
I've said it repeatedly Thomas Nagel comes to mind and many others right matter
does not possess these properties the qualia consciousness therefore there's no way to
manipulate matter to generate qualia consciousness
that's really really devastating because it brings with it the possibility that the AI not
only will the AI not have meaning not have purpose not have any normative values the AI will also
not have any conscious awareness of its cognition it will not possess consciousness
now Descartes brings in one other important aspect to this which isn't quite as explicit
but it was very quickly derived from other people around him see what does this happen
in Descartes right by the time of Descartes we've seen this slow withdrawal everything is withdrawing
from the world into the mind the mind is getting isolated trapped inside of itself
and then Descartes right famously worries about that he says I want to doubt everything
try to find something I cannot doubt he makes what I to my mind other people have said this
this isn't original to me but I think it's important he makes a mistake about this notion of certainty
there's two notions of certainty there's a logical notion and a psychological notion
the logical notion of certainty is something like absolute deductive validity it's impossible for
the premises to be true impossible and the conclusion false that's different from psychological
certainty psychological certainty is an inability to doubt so you find something
certain because you you're incapable of doubting it the problem is these are not
identical by any means think of the radical bigot the radical bigot I am not I hope such a person
but the radical bigot cannot doubt certain things they cannot doubt this the superiority
of the white race or some other such garbage they're psychologically incapable of doubting it
precisely because of the depth of their ignorance and bigotry so they have psychological certainty
but it is certainly not logical certainty there is no direct connection between psychological
certainty and logical certainty but what Descartes does is he thinks that if he pushes this far enough
it will somehow become identical to this and it never does and that's part of the problem we face
because he realizes to be honest I mean so what he does is he says I'll doubt everything I can
possibly doubt and and then he even doubts the math because he realizes that his commitment to math
is still ultimately based on an aspect of psychological certainty because there could
be some evil genius perhaps like the matrix who's actually programming his brain unbeknownst to him
to make him believe in the axioms of math and before you say that's ridiculous come to realize
how much modern physics has rejected the axioms of euclidean geometry even though they were once
taken to be absolutely unquestionable so why am I saying all of this because what Descartes comes
to the point where the point that he thinks he finds that connects these two together
is he cannot doubt that he exists but because in order to be subject to illusion
his mind must exist so even the most comprehensive set of illusions guarantees to him the existence
of his mind this is the famous cogito ergo sum I think therefore I am it's not an argument
there's no argument there I think therefore I am there's no that's not a logical argument it's not
a logical argument it's a statement of where psychological certainty becomes indistinguishable
from logical certainty because the idea is in order to be suffering from an illusion
I must exist notice what's happening we used to have the mind in touch with the world then the mind
is at least in touch with the math and now all we have left is this all that the mind actually touches
is itself that's what consciousness is and notice how weird consciousness is like that
when I tell you how do you know if I ask you how do you know the cups there you'll say well I see
it I interact with it if I ask you how do you know you're conscious you just say I know I'm
conscious by being conscious what does this mean with Hobbes well Descartes saying
that aspect that's the touchstone of reality the mind touching itself Hobbes is nothing that
matter has matter doesn't have because what the scientific revolution did was take all of that
contact out of the world and it took it I'm even willing to say it's not even in the math it's just
here so these are devastating problems I would put it this way if you're an advocate and you
should pay very serious attention to artificial intelligence because I'm trying to show you
not only is it going to change the world socioeconomically politically culturally trying
to show you it's going to change your understanding of who and what you are and it is going to interact
with the meaning crisis in profound ways right but if you're interested in this and if you are
doing something work on it and some of the scientific theoretical work I do is an attempt
to contribute towards the development of AI right you need to pay attention to a distinction
a distinction that was made famous by John Searle between weak and strong AI I don't
like those terms because weak AI implies something defective because we never use the word weak as
a compliment why do I say that because weak AI is the project of just making machines that
can do things for us that typically intelligent animals or human beings could do your laptop
computer is weak AI and there is there is nothing weak about this in a social or value sense it is
a legitimate and real pursuit that computer revolution has transformed the world right there
is nothing deficient or defective of people who want to make weak AI you depend on weak AI we
carry around these Star Trek computers in our phone and we go to automatic banking machine all of this
has profoundly altered our lives okay so when I use this word I am not using it in a pejorative
sense perhaps Searle was I don't know but I'm not but here's what is of value in Searle's distinction
between weak and strong AI weak AI does not really advance our scientific understanding
in the following way and this is the way that matters this is how you would succeed at strong AI
and when I say it right it should make it should show you how difficult strong AI is a lot of people
now talk use this term artificial general intelligence to talk about strong AI
what is strong AI strong AI is to make a computer that not does just some intelligent things or models
what it's like but is actually an instance of mind it's to succeed in Hobbes' project it is to
make a mind but that but to succeed in Hobbes' project requires you do the following if I'm
actually making a material mind
how do I know I've really succeeded if when I make this I can give an answer
if I can give an explanation of how Descartes is wrong if I can answer all of Descartes
objections in an explanatory fashion not just yelling at him Descartes silly silly silly
but I build a machine and then I can say look given how the machine is built and operate
here is my scientific explanation for how you can get purpose meaning normativity consciousness
and that contact with realness that Descartes talked about
that's strong AI and that's a lot harder that's why people who are invested in that project
are a lot more cautious about predicting when we will have AGI the fact that computational
machines are going to change our society in the next 10 to 20 years is undeniable
you're just some sort of intellectual Luddite if you try to resist that
but the idea that that immediately translates into a profound understanding of the nature of the
mind is a second question and people the people I respect the people I think are doing the best
work in strong AI people pursuing AGI are a lot more cautious about whether or not we're going
to be able to answer Descartes and show in a deeply explanatory evidence based way how Hobbes is
right so we are still with that problem now I work in cognitive science that we're still at
that problem we're still wrestling with this problem right now and there are many people on
both sides of this issue I do not want to misrepresent one side I mean most people in the
professional business think that Hobbes is ultimately right they take seriously Descartes
challenge if they're good scientists and most of them are there are many it's a minority but it's
not a small minority there are many of these scientists who think that Descartes might be
fundamentally right okay so this is still very much an open and important question that goes to
the core of us now you may think some of you perhaps also if you have a religious orientation
and I'm not insulting you here I am not insulting you because you might think well Hobbes tries to
kill the soul and these arguments from Descartes they sort of preserve the notion of a soul and
that's great because if I have a soul then of course then immortality is a real possibility for me
well be careful you may not want the Cartesian baby okay even though you're trying to throw out
the materialistic bathwater because the problem with Descartes solution is its existential cost
it's existential cost because what Descartes was basically arguing for is that mind and matter
are essentially different they share no fundamental properties mind moves on purpose
it moves according to values it works in terms of meaning and qualia it cares about and pursues
the truth and it has this kind of contact with itself that no material thing has
whereas matter is extended in space and time displays force transfers energy
so all the properties that mind has matter doesn't have and all the properties that
matter has mind doesn't have so Descartes of course came to a plausible conclusion that
mind and matter are two radically different kinds of things mind is a completely immaterial substance
matter of course is a completely material substance and you may say yay here's the problem
if mind and matter share no properties how do they causally interact
how do they causally interact here I'm going to show you mind over matter I'm thirsty I desire
water because water is good so I'm going to move on purpose so notice all these mental terms desire
and want and I value the water and I'm going to move on purpose and here I do I move and I get
some water that's mind making matter change but how can it do that mind has no energy doesn't take up
space right doesn't have any force what about the reverse can matter ever cause mind here we go
behold I'm going to start with a completely material event and it's going to end up in a
completely mental event ow two pieces of matter slam into each other and the end result is pain
what's pain well it's a qualia it's a qualia about the value of your experience
how much does pain weigh does it even mean make sense of what color is it
what's its electromagnetic radiation what's its chemical structure
so look your experience is moment to moment mind and matter are intimately interacting
in a bidirectional matter mind and matter intimately continuously doing this and yet
Descartes whole position the way he responds to Hobbes makes it impossible that they can interact
because they share no properties in virtue of which they can interact because he used that gap
to argue against Hobbes because it's the gap between matter scientific matter and mind that
Descartes uses against Hobbes but the problem is that gap undermines your whole existence because
what does it mean it means you are radically cut off from yourself your relationship between your
mind and your body is a complete and utter mystery the most intimate aspects of your experience
the taste of this water is absurd because there's no way that the taste which is a mental thing
and the water which is a physical thing could in any way be related to each other
but it's worse because look around you there's another person how do you know what's going on
in their mind do you directly see their mind of course not well how do I know are they utter words
well no they don't they make sounds and we talked about remember what Descartes says to Hobbes there's
nothing in the sounds that's meaningful their face moves and they make gestures and they express
their emotions so what you're saying is you get what's going on in somebody's mind because of
the way their physical body moves and makes other physical things like air move but if there is no
connection in between mind and matter and your body is a purely material thing and I hope you
don't disagree with that then there's no way by paying attention to body I can figure out what's
going on in mind because there's no connection between them this is called the problem of other
minds how do I know and Descartes seriously worried about this how do I know that the rest of you
are not just mindless automatons not just zombies how do I know this because the only the only
mind that my mind touches according to Descartes is itself
well at least the mind is still in contact with the world with Descartes right John because the
math touches the world uh-huh be careful there Descartes given us two different answers he said
the math tells us what's real and it's objective but the mind touching itself
in consciousness is ultimately the touchstone and I use that touchstone of reality it's purely
subjective and so what we have are these two different standards of realness subjective
consciousness objective math and so what our society our culture has now done historically
is careen back and forth between them you get you know the empiricists and the positivists
right no science tells me what's real and then all you say well how do you know it's not a dream
oh well ha ha silly silly silly nobody really pays any attention of that and what you get are
insults you get insults and ad hominem arguments it's like well no no answer what's oh well you
know it's and then we invoke rationality and what do you mean by rationality and how does
rationality fit into this mathematically realized world when we don't have any mathematical material
way of talking about purpose and truth etc it's very problematic so you swing the other way
and you come over here and you're the romantics I don't mean the rock group and I don't mean
like romantic love right we'll talk about these guys in in in a bit right so what's ultimately real
is my pure subjective experience right but then the problem with that is well
how is that to be in touch with the world how is that to be in touch with other people how's that
to be in touch with reality at all it leaves me totally disconnected this how would I know it's
it's not just all the dream and so I go back and forth and back and forth so what Descartes actually
gave us wasn't a secure way of being in contact with reality he gives us a completely unstable
grammar of realness and our culture is driven by these two demands and we swing back and forth
between a subjective and an objective account of realness as we swing back and forth between
attempts to understand the relationship between mind and body and between mind and mind
so notice what we have here
we have a loss of perspectival and participatory knowing we found we've seen a gradual loss of
contact with the world a loss of contact with tradition and history loss of contact with our
own bodies loss of contact with other people other minds loss of contact with reality and
then you say well at least Descartes gives me contact with my own mind right at least I have that
right I have my little tiny Cartesian Lutheran island and at least that's where I can make my
last stand well do you because you have to be really consistent right if you're going to be
Cartesian and logical you have to be consistent and here's the problem you can't invoke
historical cultural notions of the self
see when Descartes says cogito ergo sum and he says and you may say well therefore I know
that I exist well what does what's this I that exists is it is it all of John Vervecchi
right because it can't that first of all it can't be anything I'm introspect because a lot of my
introspection is false or wrong right is it based on my memories well my memory is certainly
capable of making all kinds of mistakes it always does in fact
well what about my history well what access do I have to my history and how do I measure that
history mathematically my memories certainly not trustworthy in according to standards of certainty
and I don't have any mathematical way of gaining access to my past
all that you have contact with is this moment of self-awareness right now
isolated atomic moment now take that completely isolated contentless having no autobiography
no contact with its body no contact with the world no contact with other minds
and then place it inside Pascal's infinite spaces that terrify that completely atomic
empty self adrift
in empty infinite spaces of terror and that's what you get that's where you are if you think
through things carefully according to the fractured tortured
tensions of our current cultural grammar that's how you get into the meeting crisis
now Pascal was aware of this and like I said he is as great a mathematical genius
as Descartes he on his own rediscovers from axioms forward recreates all of euclidean geometry
as a as a adolescent on his own he says brilliant he's part of the scientific revolution he
invents the barometer as a way of merit measuring air pressure but he has a transformative experience
we talked about those and they convince him that what Descartes is trying to achieve the certainty
is not possible and that the meeting crisis is powerful Pascal makes a distinction but what he
calls the spirit of geometry you have to think of that in Cartesian terms I would say today the
spirit of math or the spirit of computation and what he calls the spirit of finesse
and his fear his concern is that we have lost this and we have come to think of all of knowing
and being in terms of the spirit of geometry and this is a theme this Pascalian theme as you've
been seeing it running through this history we have slowly lost procedural know the importance
of procedural knowledge knowing how to do things we've lost perspectival knowing knowing what it's
like and we've lost participatory knowing knowing that is part and parcel of how we are bound up
with something else someone else in a process of mutual transformation reciprocal revelation
because that's what finesse is to do something with finesse right if I do something with if I'm
doing a move in Tai Chi and I do it with finesse right it's like jazz right there's an element in
there right that I can't capture in terms of mathematical propositions it's knowing how
in terms of knowing the right timing the right placement when you're kissing someone else right
you have to do it with finesse the right timing the right placement the sensitivity to the contact
knowing what it is like to be you knowing what it is like to be the other person and then get
getting those two perspectives to have a participatory relation to be in a relation of mutual
revelation with each other that's what's necessary to kissing someone well
and so Pascal is pointing out that what has been lost
in the scientific revolution is all these other kinds of knowing and being
and these are the kinds of knowing and being that he found present in the transformative
experience that he had it was for him a religious experience but we've seen that these transformative
experiences are not necessarily religious they're always spiritual but they're not often sorry
they're not always I should be careful they're not always things that reinforce established
religious beliefs or propositions sometimes they challenge the beliefs that the person has had as
we've seen sometimes they lead to anti-religious or at least non-religious propositions nevertheless
Pascal is on to something to my mind when he argues that the loss of the spirit of finesse
has left us bereft
of the capacity for transformative truth transformative knowing and so we're now stuck
where Socrates was at the beginning of the actual revolution we have scientific knowledge
but remember Socrates rejected it because although it was rigorous and even plausibly true
it did not afford transformation self-transcendence into wisdom
but of course all that self-transcendence is gone because now I don't believe in
self-transcendence because of the Protestant Reformation and I don't have to go through
personal transformation according to Descartes look at what Descartes is saying you do not
have to be transformed in order to come into contact with ultimate reality all you have to do
is use the right method do the right computation so all of this part of the axial revolution is
being lost that's what Pascal is putting his finger on and he's doing it extremely well
so
what I want to do next is to follow up a little bit more on Descartes and take a look at
Kant and the rise of the pseudo-religious ideologies and the main problem facing us in the west today
we face these undeniable at least if we're being rational crises environmental economic
socio-political culture wars we need deep fundamental transformation transformations of
cognition consciousness culture community but we have lost the psychotechnologies the spirit
of finesse the traditions and the institutions for affording that because what the thing that
used to do that was religion but we've lost religion
and as I'm going to show you next time we tried secular pseudo-religious alternatives
and they drenched the world in blood thank you very much for your time and attention
