This is a question I've been working on for a long time now, and the last few years have
become, I would say, really quite exciting, and the central ideas have become more crystallized
in my mind than they had been before, and it's very much about using life as a guide
to the origin of life, which immediately sounds like it's a tautologous in some way,
but it's, I could call it turtles all the way down, it seems as if there's an infinite
regress involved in that, but it begs the question, how can we possibly know what the
answer is? And if you take it almost literally and say, imagine that we had a time machine
and we go back to some time around the origin of life, what would we actually look for?
And the answer is, well, we would have no idea if we found some kind of green slime
or something. We wouldn't really know, was this the origin of life? Was this just some
slime? Was it on the path towards life? Was it a failed experiment? Actually, what we
really need to know, what we really need to have is a framework, a rigorous intellectual
framework which shows how a sterile non-living planet can give rise to a living planet and
we need to know what all the predicted steps would be along that path and then how to test
for them to see whether or not they actually have any substance in them or not. And so
we'll never know how life started on Earth because it's a historical question and we
can't go back and if we did go back, as I say, we still wouldn't actually see what the
answer was. What we need is this rigorous framework. And that's where I think life as
a guide comes in because there is a spectrum and that spectrum starts somewhere almost
unknowable but let's assume for the sake of argument that it was on the early Earth and
that it was in Earth-like conditions rather than in outer space somewhere or, you know,
panspermia may have happened. However, it tells us nothing about the conditions under
which life can start. So it's an assumption that life started on Earth. And we know the
other end of the continuum, the other end of this continuum is life itself, cells like
bacterial cells that have a genetic code that have DNA and RNA and proteins and membranes
and everything else we know about cells. So we know one end of the continuum and all we
need to do is figure out the other end and how to join it up. Now what I'll argue very
briefly then is that life is an extremely good guide into its own origin and I'm going
to break it into three sections. One is energy. The second is metabolism is the third is genetic
information. So I will try and address all three today. Before I get going, I'm going
to just orientate you with a few slides about what I mean by energy and so on. So this is,
you could imagine it as a bacterial cell or you could see it as the mitochondria in our
own cells but effectively what we're seeing here inside this lozenge-shaped thing, think
of that as a cell, I'm showing it respiring and respiration is effectively taking something
like glucose, breaking it down through the Krebs cycle and the Krebs cycle, you don't
need to know what it is. All it's really doing is stripping CO2 and hydrogen out of food,
out of any organic molecules. Now the CO2 is a waste product which we simply breathe
out and the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrogen, it's in the form of NADH in our
own cells but it's basically two hydrogen atoms. They are being split for physicists,
needs to get somewhere in the vicinity of fundamental particles, it's basically electrons
and protons. The electrons are passed to oxygen in the membrane so it has effectively a current
of electrons within an insulating membrane through redox centers in that membrane and the current
of electrons powers the extrusion of protons across the membrane which is what I'm showing,
let me just get a pointer up on here. So we have a charge on the membrane, the protons are positively
charged of course and so we have a relatively positive charge on the outside of the membrane,
relatively negative inside and that's known as the proton motive force. It drives for example
ATP synthesis but it basically drives all work in cells and that's all we need to know. We can put
ATP aside for the time being and just think of we have an electrically charged membrane that drives
powers work in cells and that I think is the fundamental thing that we need to explain. Why
is it that cells work by having an electrical charge on the membrane that powers work? That's
much easier to understand than something like the ATP synthase as a protein. This is the next slide,
I forgive you if you don't notice any difference whatsoever but in fact everything has just been
turned on its head here. The Krebs cycle is now going in the opposite direction, those arrows
switched around. It's deliberately looking the same because the reverse Krebs cycle
takes CO2 and hydrogen from its environment and cobbles them together to make organic molecules.
This happens in various bacteria, it's pretty ancient and obviously if we get energy out of
burning sugars in the Krebs cycle now then the missing ingredient there is we have to put energy
in to make these Krebs cycle intermediates from CO2 and hydrogen. That energy is coming from exactly
what I was just talking about, a charge, an electrical charge on the membrane which is driving
the reverse Krebs cycle to make organic molecules from CO2 and hydrogen, simple gases
in the environment. That Krebs cycle is the center of all of metabolism really. We make
lipids for the membranes, we make amino acids for proteins, we make sugars and nucleotides from
ultimately from Krebs cycle intermediates. This is the core and the heart of metabolism across
all of life. This is more ancient chemistry than the genes that appear to encode that chemistry.
The genes diverge and differ in bacteria and archaea but the chemistry underlying it remains
the same. Then the third aspect is information and in this case I will touch on this at the end
and there are patterns in the genetic code which suggests that there are direct interactions between
amino acids and the nucleotides that code for them in the genetic code. We don't know exactly
what they look like, I'm giving a couple of possible ways of imagining it here but I will
show you that those patterns are real and that they're weak and they're statistical but they are
real and this can explain the origin of information in biology. In effect if what we have is a random
sequence of RNA, we could say it has no biological information in it and that templates in one way
or another a non-random peptide which has function in the context of say growing proto cells and I'll
come on to that. Then we can select for the sequence which selects for a non-random peptide
which has a function in that context and so information seamlessly emerges, biological
information emerges with selection on that sequence in that context and so there is no
problem with the origin of information in biology if we get the context right. Those are some big
claims there and I'll justify them at the end. Another thing to notice about that is I'm talking
about electrical charges on membranes driving autotrophic biochemistry starting with CO2 and
hydrogen to make all the components of biochemistry which then interact with nucleotides and genetic
information comes into existence in this context. In other words I'm saying everything is happening
in the same environment and that's another big ask. I'm not saying that some stuff happens in the
atmosphere over there and some other things happened in a deep sea hydrothermal vent and
some things happen in Darwin's warm pond. I'm saying it's all happening in one place right now
all at once and that's a big ask but it's experimentally very simplifying because it means that we
need one set of conditions that are capable of driving all this and so it becomes experimentally
very tractable. The set of conditions that drive it were proposed not by me at all by Mike Russell
more than anybody else but quite a few people have worked on this over 30 years or so now.
The conditions again keeping this as simple as possible, the conditions that Mike has talked
about are hydrogen and CO2 in these alkaline hydrothermal vents which are now found at the
bottom of the ocean but also other environments as well including on land. At the right hand side
here you can see that these are effectively a labyrinth of interconnected pores on a micrometer
to millimeter scale. This is modern chemistry in modern oceans fully oxygenated and is not
reflective of what we would expect to see four billion years ago in the Haiti and when
there was no oxygen there was much more for example ferrous iron in the oceans back then.
So these vents should have had a perhaps a similar topology but the actual chemistry would
have been different and would have included reactive iron sulfide minerals in there.
The hydrothermal fluids are strongly alkaline pH 11 the early oceans we think would have been
mildly acidic perhaps pH 5 or 6 and so there would have been steep proton gradients across
these barriers and those steep proton gradients in principle can drive work in pretty much the
same way that the proton motive force would drive work in cells. It's not exactly an electrical
charge but it's very close to being the same kind of structure. This is effectively it we have at the
left hand side here an inorganic pore at the right hand side the cell what a cell is doing is pumping
protons out across its plasma membrane so we end up with this high proton concentration and
relatively positive charge on the outside and relatively alkaline on the inside and it's about
a three to four pH units difference equivalent to a three to four pH unit difference. In a
hydrothermal vent we've got again at least arguably a three to four pH unit difference between the
inside of a of a proto you know of a pore let's call it and ocean waters percolating into into
these vents we have a much thicker inorganic barrier surrounding it and that barrier is likely to
include minerals like iron sulfur minerals that couldn't drive drive some of this work. So is
there a way an imaginable way that we can go from one of those to the other and this is the
hypothesis in a nutshell and the rest of the talk I'll just give a little bit of data on trying to
test this hypothesis. So what you're seeing here is a pore in a hydrothermal vent is relatively
rich in protons outside. We have this iron sulfide barrier I'm imagining protons crossing
this barrier and driving the the reverse Krebs cycle inside this this proto
pore let's just call it a pore at the moment so we've got hydrogen reacting with CO2 driven by
an influx of protons pretty much as happens in cells today. We would expect to see thermodynamically
at least fatty acids so the components of lipids and probably some amino acids from that if we look
to the right hand side what would we expect those to do the fatty acids should form some kind of a
bilayer membrane which we can imagine at least might might just sit snugly inside this at this
pore and once we've closed down a kind of an enclosed proto cell inside here we might expect
that metabolism will drive further so not just lipids and amino acids but perhaps sugars and
nucleotides as well so this is imaginable this is at least a hypothesis. Notice also that for
protons to be driving Krebs cycle inside a proto cell we would need to have some kind of an iron
sulfur nanocrystal or iron sulfur clusters the same kind of thing that drives this work today
it would need to be sitting in that membrane so you could label this wishful thinking but you
could also call it a testable hypothesis and that's how I've been treating it over the last
few years. So I'm going to break it into these three parts and I'll skip quite lightly over it
and we can discuss some of the data at more length afterwards. This idea though that the
proton gradients are fundamental it's something I've been thinking about for a long time and it's
I tended to think of it in terms of driving molecular machinery rather than as simply phase
separations. Now Peter Mitchell himself who put this chemo osmotic hypothesis forward back in the
19 early 1960s had been thinking about the origin of life before that in the late 1950s and there's
a lovely quote which from a conference in Moscow in 1957 where he said I cannot consider
the organism without its environment from a formal point of view the two may be regarded as
equivalent phases between which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate
and link them so when he says organism here he's thinking of a bacterial cell but it's you know
instead of trying to define life as something different to the environment he's more or less
conflating them he's describing them as equivalent phases between which this dynamic contact is
maintained and if we think before there were any cells before there was anything living then the
idea of you know a membrane that separates and links two equivalent phases is a very productive
way of thinking about the question. So why would that matter? Well in essence it's this
the problem with hydrogen is it will not react very readily with CO2. This is just showing
vague thermodynamics for two steps rather than a single step which is why I call it vague through
to formaldehyde so taking the electrons from hydrogen pushing them onto CO2 to form formaldehyde
at pH seven or any other pH all I really for non-chemists all I really want you to take away
is it's an uphill reaction it's not going to happen spontaneously but we don't have hydrogen at pH
seven and we don't have CO2 at pH seven in an alkaline hydrothermal vent we've got hydrogen at
pH 11 and CO2 at pH 6 say and that shifts these equations around and the reason for it is very
simple intuitively to grasp if if hydrogen gives up its electrons in an alkaline environment what's
left behind is protons those protons will react immediately with hydroxide ions to form water
it's just a neutralization reaction it's strongly favored and so it will happen immediately.
So hydrogen is more reducing in an alkaline environment. CO2 needs to pick up electrons
if there are plenty of protons available they will balance the charges and then you can pick up
more electrons and more protons so it's easier to reduce CO2 in an acidic environment. So what
we have here then is perfectly two phases an alkaline phase and an acid phase separated by
a semi permeable semi conducting barrier and those phases have hydrogen and CO2 and should be
more reactive in those phases so this is all we effectively need it's not clear yet whether it's
electrons crossing this barrier or protons coming the other way but it's this is really just showing
visually what I just did we've got hydrogen on the alkaline side passing electrons onto an iron
sulfide barrier the the protons react with hydroxide ions to form water and on the acid side
we've got CO2 picking up protons and electrons from the barrier itself so this in principle should
work it's very easy to set it up well it's not so easy but in principle it's easy to set it up this is
needs to be done inside a glove box an anaerobic glove box oxygen even trace amounts of oxygen
really do play around with this we need to have it pretty strictly anoxic. This is a microfluid
chip with a barrier that's just spontaneously precipitated by laminar flow with sodium sulfide
on one side and sorry sodium sodium sulfide on one side and iron chloride ferrous chloride
on the other side they spontaneously precipitate this barrier and this is just one one one piece of
evidence to show you formates is being formed acetate also so we'll be getting towards the
Krebs cycle we have seen pyruvate as well but we've not managed to see it on every occasion yet
and possibly things like methanol as well so this is stuff that I was hoping for when I last
presented to you five or six years ago but this is now is being is being published in PNAS and
this is our own work which is taking a little bit further so just to come back to this figure for a
moment if we are able to reduce CO2 to organics and we think that they should include amino acids
and lipids the next step then will be to have some kind of protocell we've taken a leap forward
rather than I mean we are trying to make these lipids as well we've not done so yet
but if we simply take lipids that other people have successfully synthesized under these kind
of conditions we're able to form vesicles under these alkaline hydrothermal conditions this is
another major step because these vesicles are not supposed to be stable under under these pretty
harsh conditions and the literature and our experiments as well show that if you have a
very simple vesicle made from decanoic acid it more or less falls to pieces as soon as you change
a pH or the temperature or anything else but if you have mixtures slightly messy mixtures of fatty
acids and long chain fatty alcohols and so on especially if you have one-to-one mixtures of
these then we get you can see with cryoam and you can see with thomphocal microscopy there
we are seeing vesicles at pH 12 70 degrees centigrade modern ocean salinity in the presence
of calcium ions and magnesium ions so it's we really are able to form from the kind of
fatty acids that have been formed under hydrothermal conditions you can make vesicles under those
conditions and this was another one I wanted to share with you very briefly this is UV
vis spectroscopy and it's showing a classical shoulder which was the last thing we expected
to see there because that shoulder when we mix the amino acid cysteine with sodium sulfide and
iron chloride and that's it in water that shoulder is a 4fe4s cluster the same thing that we see in
ferrodoxin and which is responsible for a lot of CO2 fixation in bacteria today and we've looked
at different concentrations of everything including the cysteine we've used mospower spectroscopy to
characterize the clusters and we've used cyclic voltammetry to show their redox potential and it's
exactly the same as ferrodoxin this is the midpoint reduction potential and it's about minus 450
millivolts which is right in the region for reducing CO2 though we've not yet used them to
reduce CO2 so it seems to be possible to make this machinery under surprisingly simple sets of conditions
so i'm going to say a little bit about metabolism and again i'm going to skip likely over some
some data and then i'll finish with the the the code itself so this is the core of metabolism
i've mentioned the Krebs cycle this is this is not really the cycle so much as some of the steps so
acetal coa or some equivalent to it a prebiotic equivalent through to pyruvate that we're now
into the Krebs cycle oxaloacetate alpha ketoglutarate and so on what i really want you to notice here
is this is CO2 at the top left and in in a kind of browny red color we've got hydrogen hydrogen
hydrogen there's lots of hydrogen in there in green we've got CO2 again there's CO2 everywhere
that you look pretty much this is the chemistry of hydrogen and CO2 and there's not much more to it
when we get amino acids we're beginning to see ammonia in there as well the blue arrows here
are basically experiments that have been done successfully under prebiotic conditions
by us and by other people there are several labs around the world doing this kind of chemistry
and the the red boxes are showing the precursors for nucleotide synthesis following the
the biological pathways as the starting point so much of this chemistry has now been done
one of the things that has been missing from there is cysteine synthesis and we've we've
recently i mean this is about as much as we've got at the moment it's not very much but this is a
peak for cysteine on on nmr sorry no that was on hplc i beg your pardon and and and it looks like
we've managed to do a one-pot synthesis of cysteine starting from from glycine through serine to to
cysteine and we're also able to produce aspartate and alanine under those kind of conditions so
this is basically using life as a guide and a lot of these we've used pyrodoxamine which is a simple
cofactor used by life and it's that which is capitalizing these reactions so another problem
then is can we make pyrodoxamine under these conditions so there's always there's always more
questions that we've not answered yet but we can make the cysteine that's not published yet
this is also uracil synthesis and again i'll skip very lightly over it but this is following the
biological pathway starting with ammonia, carbonate and aspartate which i just mentioned with
synthesized and this goes through to uracil which is one of the bases in RNA and again this is a
one-pot synthesis starting over over here and we've made both oratate and uracil that way
and when we just do these last few steps going from dihydrooratate to uracil and we try to optimize
them so we looked at a panel of different metal ions, we looked at different ph's, we looked at
different temperatures, different salinities and things like that and worked out what the optimal
conditions were it turned out those optimal conditions are about 90 degrees centigrade ph9
high pressure 100 bars pressure modern ocean salinity so that was very gratifying and this
at the right hand side here is showing those optimal conditions uracil synthesis when we
matched up the optimal conditions apart from that's not high pressure that's just atmospheric
pressure so that was an eight-fold increase in yield when we optimized those conditions
whoops that just hopped forward this is the last thing i'll say about metabolism but i
mentioned ATP a couple of times it's now produced by this amazing rotating nano motor the ATP synthase
that's obviously a product of genes and natural selection and must have come later but then the
question is so why did ATP become the universal energy currency and this is this is some beautiful
work from a former phd student of mine Silvana Pinna who showed that a mildly acidic ph in this
case and at 30 or 50 degrees centigrade in water starting with acetyl phosphate and ferric iron
and adp the acetyl phosphate will phosphorylate adp to ATP at around 15 to 20 percent yield
just in in water and she tried a whole range of other phosphorylating agents and none of them
really worked carbonyl phosphate worked a little bit cyclic tmp worked a little bit but basically
acetyl phosphate does that job beautifully and interestingly still does that job today
in bacteria and archaea but the the other beautiful thing about this was it works with ATP but it
doesn't work with any of the other nuclear bases in other words we can make ATP but we can't make
ctp or utp or itp or gtp and so on um so why is ATP the universal energy currency the answer
seems to be because you can make it fairly easily with minimum um minimum catalytic requirements
and simply acetyl phosphate which is a two carbon phosphorylating agent in water at reasonable
temperatures and pressures and so on so uh that's by no means does that say that's why ATP is the
universal energy currency but it's certainly almost uncanny that that we can make that and
nothing else under those conditions so for the last five minutes or so um i'd like to touch on
information and this is some of the most beautiful work that i have been involved in in the last
few years and i should say that these ideas came from steward harrison who did his phd in my lab
and is now doing a postdoc job with me and so this is actually i'm used to thinking and and i'm not
used to my phd students and postdoc coming up with the best ideas and this is what's happened on this
occasion so it's very pleasing actually in many respects um this is metabolism again uh as we've
seen it starting with co2 uh coming through into pyruvate oxaloacetate and so on um and in the
laws the colors lozenges are the amino acids um and they're color coded according to um the first
base of the codon that encodes them in dna or in or an a uh and so glycine alanine aspartate
and glutamate are all encoded by a gene at the first position as well where it makes sense
yeah get that get that awareness and build that picture yeah i was going to go to the boundary
ones as well though i don't really like it's quite like i'm not going to go to the deep dive
i'm probably going to go to the overview because i feel like that'd be more like able for me i think
the deep dive would be a bit too technical for me it's probably going to be more at the
practitioner that i think you'll get a good sense at the high level one from what they
yeah what they've talked about so that they did good to get immersed in that yeah
no they're not gone
shall i continue
okay i'll i'll continue um so can you hear me okay
yes i think we can yes good um so so in gray then it's g at the first position of the codon
and then in yellow it's an a at the first position of the codon and then in blue it's a c
cytodine and in green it's a u at the first position of the codon um so there's plainly
patterning there and it seems to link to the distance from co2 fixation uh and at the bottom
right there that's just showing uh exactly that distance the number of steps from co2 fixation
what exactly this tells us is not entirely clear um but it seems to it seems to suggest that the
the organization of the code or the first letter of the codon is linked in some way
to the pattern of metabolism we do have ideas about why that might be and we can talk about
it afterwards but i'll just leave it that there's clearly a pattern there uh and that patterns an
interesting one if we then um so what we're seeing here is the is is the hydrophobicity of
of the amino acid in relation to um the second letter of the anti codon and we're arranging them
in boxes with g at the first position of the codon then a then c then then u as we had
before and all i really want you to take away from this is there's a clear relationship
that a is the most hydrophobic amino acid um and v is the most hydrophobic uh base so this is
uh there is a relationship between the hydrophobicity of the base and the hydrophobicity of the
amino acid that it codes for and at the other end of this one it's a spartate um and that is encoded
by a u um which is the most hydrophilic of the bases so there's a clear patterning there especially
if there's a purine at the first position a g or an a at the first position we see quite a strong
relationship with where there's a pyrimidine pyrimidine at the first position that's less
of a strong relationship but it's not gone away completely so again all i really want you to take
away from it is there are patterns in the code that depend on the bio on on the hydrophobicity
of the amino acids and the bases which suggest direct uh stereochemical interactions between
them this kind of thing has been known for a long time but the patterning is stronger when
we set it out around an autotrophic protometabolism and this is the third position and again only a
couple of things i really want you to notice here but this is an inverted codon table which is to say
these are the amino acids that are coded in the outermost ring this is the first position of the
codon then the second position of the codon and then the third position of the codon in the in
the most part there so just to give one example here we have glutamate and the spartate and they
both have a g at the first position they both have an a at the second position but glutamate has
a purine at the third position of the codon whereas the spartate has a pyrimidine at the
third position of the codon and what we see if we if we now switch this to the anti codon not
the codon what we find is that if there's effectively a big bulky base a purine rather
than the pyrimidine at the third position then we'll always see the smallest amino acid so this
is the size of the amino acids that could be coded for there and we always see that the when
there's a larger base there's a smaller amino acid so again it just suggests that there's direct
interactions between the chemistry of the amino acids its hydrophobicity and so on and its size
so all of this is very suggestive but there's no doubt various ways in which it could be
interpreted and so this is the last slide then and this is work which is should be published in
the next week or two I hope and this is doing a mixture of molecular dynamic simulation so all in
silico and some NMR work which which is ongoing but these are the first four that way and what
we're seeing here this is basically the proportion of time spent the amino acid spends in the vicinity
of specific bases these are mononucleotides so AMP, CMP, GMP or UMP and you can this is
proline in this particular case and what you're seeing is that it spends much more time
within two angstroms of GMP than anything else there is a direct predicted interaction between
proline and GMP which happens to be the base that codes for it at the second position of the anticodon
we see something a little bit similar underneath for a spartate but this is much muddier in that
case it tends to spend quite a lot of time with almost everything but in that case it's also I
think it's GMP is slightly slightly better what we're seeing in effect is we can predict 50% of
the of the middle bases of the anticodons that way we're much better at predicting this is all
the amino acids across the bottom here and it's on a scale going from hydrophobic at the left
hand end to hydrophilic at the right hand end and we can get the hydrophilic interactions pretty
well the hydrophobic interactions this method is much less good at predicting correctly the
hydrophobic interactions but still we are we're better than 99% of random allocations if we simply
assume that there were random interactions our predictions are better than 99% and we also when
we do NMR work and we're looking at the binding constants for these it's again it's easier to
work with hydrophilic amino acids because you can get higher concentrations in water
it's it's more fiddly trying to do it with hydrophobic bases and hydrophobic amino acids
in water but we're seeing that essentially the same patterns so we are I would take this as
broad confirmation that there really are weak but statistically systematic
interactions between amino acids and the bases that code for them in the genetic code and so
that picture that I showed you at the beginning suggesting that there can be some kind of
templating or non-random templating that if you've got a random stretch of RNA you will get a non-random
peptide which is interacting with it that seems to be borne out in other words as I said at the
beginning there should be no problem with information at the origin of the code that's
all I'm going to say I just want to have a final call out to the people who've been doing this work
this is over of some years now I just like this picture because they they're holding up the reverse
Krebs cycle there this was a birthday present they did a few years ago and I like it too much
to so a few of these people have left the group now but but I still keep this image but they are
the people who've really been doing all this experimental work that I've talked about and
that's it so I will stop sharing and I look forward to your questions
well thank you Nick that was that that was quite a quite a tour de force
so thank you and I'm not sure we have many questions yet in the chat box so we had a
little bit of an interruption okay we had a bit of an interruption there in the sound I'm not
sure quite what happened there yeah sorry I apologize for that Alan I had I had a cup of tea
delivered oh sorry okay anyway okay it's audience's chance to to fire away with some questions from
from for Nick if you'd like to unmute yourself and and and put your video on and wave your hands
we can we can start with some questions don't be shy but can I maybe start with one Nick you
you kind of touched on the thermodynamics so how much of how much of this is a thermodynamic
process alongside the chemistry I think it's predominantly thermodynamic in the sense that
what we're dealing with is an environment which is continuously out of equilibrium because we
have continuous flow of hydrothermal fluids which are rich in hydrogen in the modern vents
that it's up to about 15 millimolar equivalent hydrogen and CO2 and in the early oceans we don't
know what it was exactly but but you know potentially more than a bar of CO2 back then
so the modern systems are somewhat carbon-starved because they're alkaline and it precipitates out
to carbonate but but in the older systems there would have been an overwhelming amount of CO2
there and so thermodynamically it is it's it's exegonic to be producing pretty much
all of all of the biomolecules it's it's simply an exothermic reaction
right down to the catalyst yeah well and we have a few hands up with a couple of hands up
there's one there from from Victor Victor would you like to unmute yourself and ask
your question okay can you hear me yeah okay yep I had a question which might not be as
knowledgeable as some of the other people's questions in in this session
so you've you've looked at the life that we have and the building blocks that build up that life
and kind of working backwards to some simple conditions where those building blocks might
have might have had their origin and is there another form of life that could have developed
rather than the one that we've got or maybe it did develop at certain stages and then it
it it died out for some reason it wasn't as successful in terms of the changing conditions
on the planet from when life first formed it may not have had any longevity associated with it
is there's some other thing that we could have that would have ended up with something completely
different potentially yes and it's a very good question and it's one which keeps me awake at night
I think but but it's um there's to my mind there's something a little bit uncanny about all of this
metabolic biochemistry just happening in the absence of genes and information and and some
of it I can understand but the further we get from co2 fixation the more unbelievable it seems to be
that's uh that impure in synthesis or well permadein synthesis we're working on purine
synthesis and it's well that's a bit hard work um but um we tend that you'd think there's all these
side reactions that could happen and should happen uh and to a large extent don't happen what we tend
to see is is small amounts of the intermediates along these known metabolic pathways forming
spontaneously and interchanging between themselves at low low levels um and
why why those ones why not other ones this is the the essence of your question and I think a lot
will depend on the starting point which is to say if we're starting with hydrogen and co2 at a
particular temperature we're likely to get a certain metabolic network if you like and if we
change the starting point to something else or we change the temperature we change any of those
parameters then easily you could get a different network um so so why this network um it still
seems uncanny but if you think about what the genes would be doing then as soon as we introduce
information into this system there's a serious problem here which has been largely overlooked in
my view uh about um how how an RNA world invents metabolism which is the standard view but but
the the RNA world of people have really got as far as trying to replicate RNA and haven't really
worried themselves very much yet about how how you know as soon as you got something which is
capable of self replicating then you've got a system which is capable of evolution and and and
it's easy lazy to put it aside there and say okay so it'll evolve there is no conceptual problem
but there is a conceptual problem to my mind because if you invent one enzyme that catalyzes
one step in a metabolic pathway and there's 10 steps in that pathway then it's absolutely no
use to you you really need all 10 enzymes in that pathway and and so it's beginning to look less
probable but and what what use is one pathway you actually need multiple pathways to have anything
that's any use to you so a more rigorous way of thinking about what what entity is being selected
and what are the reasons it's being selected uh you're left facing quite a large part of
proton metabolism needs to be doing it to produce the required amino acids nucleotide sugars whatever
else is is required to to have a system which is capable of replicating itself um and and again the
problem is still there's no point in having any one of those pathways by itself um or at least
there's no obvious point that I can see um so there's a there's a serious combinatorial problem
there um that's never been seriously addressed and I suspect it's borderline impossibly difficult
um but if what actually you see instead is a kind of a spontaneous proton metabolism that
happens to have a particular network structure to it and what the first genes do is increase
flux through that pathway for example by steepening the driving force so increasing the
fixation of co2 to make the first intermediates in that pathway then you get increased flux through
the entire network so that's not intrinsically very difficult what that says then if you take a
step back is that what the first genes are doing is amplifying the network and so the fact that we
get the same network and the entire thing is amplified is in fact a direct prediction of
assuming that network comes first in which case we should be able to turn that on its head and say
okay well if if we can look at the conditions that give rise to that entire network then we
should be able to predict the you know if we can get the entire network under this set of conditions
but not that set then we might be able to say the conditions under which life arose
well that's very good thank you okay thank you for that Nick um we have another question from
Chelsea Chen could you unmute yourself please Chelsea and if you want to put your video on
we can see you too perhaps um hello can I just ask about why ATP can be spontaneously synthesized
water while other nucleosides can't uh yes you can ask um I'd like to say I could answer
we did we did some molecular dynamic simulations on that um and it seems to be in part to do with
the with the charge density on ferric ion ferric ion was necessary and other other other other
metal ions did not work in the same way it seems to be partly to do uh with the actual orientation
of the phosphate group of acetylphosphates uh in relation to the ferric ion and the ADP tail I mean
came up with a potential explanation for the orientation some of it seems to be to do with
the way that the ring nitrogens interact with ferric ion and I don't understand that very well
but they interact very differently with say guanine compared to adenosine so why I'm not
quite sure but the prediction is that you know molecular dynamic prediction is that you do not
have the orientation of the acetylphosphate in the right place and and it tends to abstract the
catalyst it abstracts the the ferric ion which interacts with the nitrogen on the ring instead
so we have some answers but I'm not persuaded that they're the right answers or that the molecular
dynamic simulations are real I don't know enough of what's going on under the bonnet with them with
the atomic forces that they're predicting uh I am not a chemist I'm a biochemist and and you know
I tried to get my hands dirty with all of this stuff but it's uh I think we need a proper
chemist to look at some of that okay thank you thanks um we have a question from Jim Cunningham
on this chat box there um Nick can you see that uh oh he's asking when when when will the book come
out about all this it takes more than 45 minutes to digest this at all uh well I I am trying to put
together a proposal now to write a book on the origin of life specifically covering more or less
what I've said today but it will be some years before it's written I mean we're not I'm neither
chemist nor biochemist so general science to be like I I do have a book that was out last year
that touches on some of the actual chemistry of the Krebs cycle and and some of the ideas I've
just talked about now so that's out already but the genetic code stuff is quite new um
and I'm I'm quite excited by it but the path going from a pattern to a predicted set of steps
that we can then test that uh I I want to delay writing the book until we've done some of that
and I have something to say about it these these steps you're predicting they seem to depend
uh on specifically specific earth conditions but perhaps earth-like conditions um well they
yes they they I mean what we would get from this metabolic network is a specific set of amino acids
and we would tend to get those amino acids and we would tend to we would predict an order in which
we get them as well um the extent to which we would expect to see exactly the four bases that we
see in RNA compared to a bunch of other possible ones that are and there's a lot of modified bases
around um I'm less sure about that so one thing we want to do is is model metabolism where we're
varying the thermodynamic parameters and kinetic parameters on each of the but basically it's more
the thermodynamics than the kinetics what's the likelihood of each reaction happening
and given that we have no clear idea no clear data under the sets of conditions that we might
be thinking about if we if we model it we can vary across orders of magnitude and obviously if you
make an oxidation reaction more likely then a reduction step is less likely and so on so we can
we can we can vary parameters um in relation to each other and try to see how much of of metabolism
we actually recover and do we recover then the the the core of it in which case we would expect
to see exactly the same interaction somewhere else in which case if we discovered life on Mars
and it has exactly the same genetic code then it doesn't prove that it was a contamination
or it may be that it's much looser than that and that um that if you know if effectively
we would expect to see some but not all or or or it's very contingent on which bases you produce
and which ones get incorporated into RNA or DNA then that would come up with a different set of
predictions so there's a lot that we don't know or I don't know um but but there's a lot you know
there's a huge amount that can be done here start yeah could could I could I ask a quick
supplementary on that please nick um you've been talking about the the bases you find in in RNA
and you mentioned uh uracil yes because as I recall in in in DNA we've got cytosine,
guinine, alanine and thymine have we not yes do we know do we know why thymine came along
as opposed to uracil in DNA um I mean there are ideas out there um and it's partly to do with
stability um and and and decreasing the risk of mutations because if I'm not I'm probably going
to get this wrong I can't quite remember but um if if if there is a I think an oxidation of uracil
then uh you end up with producing something very similar to one of the other bases
and I need to double check that uh in other words there there's more scope for um for I suppose
confusion um uh replacing the wrong base so so that'd be part of it in part um RNA does not
tend to form structures as stable as DNA and I'm not sure that's to do with the bases so much as to
do with um the deoxy versus ribose um but I I don't we've not really started thinking very much about
DNA yet it's plain that as soon as you've got DNA you've got a much larger much more stable
structure which is going to lower the error error rate um but uh that's another another reason I want
to delay writing a book on this until I until I figure it out how does DNA how does that fit
into this picture right well please don't delay it too long Nick I'd like to read it um now then
Chelsea Chen has had a supplementary right if she's still around she's welcome to read otherwise
I'll read it out are you there Chelsea yes do you want to go ahead with your supplementary
about purely RNA compounds uh sorry this is not no longer Chelsea Chen but but it's the same
question do yes do we know do we know if there is uh if there are any RNA purely RNA compounds
that are capable of catalyzing reactions such as uh condensing condensing amino acids or or
nucleotides um well I mean there there's been a lot of interest over decades in what's called the RNA
world and there are plenty of ribozymes which are basically catalysts a bit like an enzyme
enzymes are made of proteins and ribozymes are made of RNA and RNA will tend to form into
interesting shapes and knots and has quite a wide range of catalytic functions much less than proteins
but but but certainly um you know capable of catalyzing quite complex chemistry and so this
has been the basis for what's being called the RNA world hypothesis um and that really goes back to
to people like Leslie Orgel in the 1960s in the late 1960s and it the ideas are very simple and
very appealing which is more or less that because of complementary base pairing it's it's you know
conceptually very easy for an RNA to make a copy of itself whereas for a peptide to make a copy of
itself is much more problematic and complex and difficult um so if you were to say which
comes first then RNA has to come before peptides in that sense at least as a hereditary mechanism
um but what that has tended to lead to is a rather purest view of an RNA world where as I said RNA
invents everything else it invents all of metabolism and that view has been I would say receding over
the last five to ten years or so with a kind of recognition that chemistry is dirtier than that
and that there will be other things in there there will be lipids in there there will be
amino acids maybe peptides in there and that we've we've got a kind of a a dirty RNA world
so there's no question that RNA is central to all of this um and that's that this was almost
only the first code and it's interesting that the ribosome which is the big protein building
factories in cells they're basically ribosomes um the the the RNA content is very high and as
far as I'm aware it's the ribosomes that are doing most of the catalysis of peptide bond formation
um so so it's interesting that they have an absolutely central critical job and this is
one thing that we're trying to think our way through to and do some experiments on as well
but it's a it's a highly populated area you may say because it's uh it's so central to the question
people have been working on it a lot for a long time um ironically RNA does not copy itself in
cells and this this kind of holy grail of having a ribosome that will copy itself which was the
the essence of the RNA world actually the it's an enzyme that does that job it's the RNA polymerase
it's a magnesium dependent protein um and so there's this this interesting um RNA effectively
copies proteins and proteins copy RNA so we're back in this strange chicken and egg situation
that uh that that is not easily unscrambled um I've forgotten exactly what your question was
but essentially could how much work does RNA do and the answer is it's very central to a lot of
this um but it's not the only thing that's going on uh and I I think peptides early are are pretty
necessary Nick that's been a very stimulating um afternoon thank you so much um before we go um
you you you've clearly got a collection of your fans here in the audience would you like just to
say give a quick a quick commercial for the other book that you have written very recently the one
on trans you call transformers oh that's very kind of you yes why not I'm not sure that um
not sure I would be intellectually fair of me to over plug it because it's it's a book on the
Krebs cycle uh which is not everybody's taste right on it attempts to link the chemistry
that I touched on on the origin of life which is which is making Krebs cycle intermediates from
co2 and hydrogen but I have I have another lab group at UCL which is working on mitochondrial
function so still an energetics and so on right and it turned out both groups were
measuring Krebs cycle intermediates for most of their lives so I had to put two and two together
and and you know the Krebs cycle goes into reverse in cancer for example and it's it's
certainly um and then what's it doing well it's driving cells copying themselves it's
instead of being about energy it's about making the building blocks required to make a new cancer
cell so all of the lipids all of the DNA and so on that's required so metabolism the central
cycle in metabolism is central right across the whole spectrum of life from the origin of life
up to um to aging and cancer and I I there's an epilogue where I have a go at linking it to
consciousness as well which is beyond most people's tolerance for speculation in science but that's
where I finished with the book so that's that's my plug for the book but if you don't like metabolic
biochemistry then then then you may prefer just to watch a short talk online or something right
okay well thank you so much right well we've had a wonderful afternoon which I've hugely
enjoyed and I'm sure everybody else has so without ado apart from thanking you again
I'd like to pass over to our chairman professor David Southwood if I don't have
screen up in front of me but David over to you if I may thank you Alan and Nick thank you very
much for an invigorating afternoon um origin of life I think how can how can we not be interested
in it and how can we not feel some of the emotions that you clearly feel the curiosity of it the um
the fact that things have come out of it and yet there we are it's one of the big mysteries that
we live with as human beings in my view so I really think you've taken us on a wonderful voyage
and your enthusiasm is absolutely magnificent I think you'll need to communicate I much admire
and so I think if I can ask people generally to unmute or to use the symbol for clapping
to give you a sign that we really did appreciate your time this time this afternoon so thank you very much
