social media is a drug. And I, like so many people today, am totally addicted. I'm addicted
to scrolling. I'm addicted to making every account on every social media site look perfect.
I'm addicted to liking, to commenting, to seeing photos of random celebrities, to seeing
drama of random celebrities, and to refreshing the same page over and over again. And with
every drug comes a high. A moment when one feels like they're on top of the world and
nothing can stop them until everything just comes crashing down again. For me, even if
the picture I've posted looks nothing like me or isn't real at all. When the likes in
the comments start pouring in, that's the high. I feel people must like me, my self-esteem
goes up, and I feel this temporary happiness and this temporary joy. Until a couple hours
pass by and the likes in the comments slow down and me and my self-esteem just kind of
go crashing down again. Social media can slash down your confidence and in a fraction of
a second make you feel like the loneliest person in the world. And this is a problem
that persists now within our modern society. With a couple of taps on a smartphone, anyone
can make any account on almost any social media site and make up a whole life that they
don't even have. And as our technology gets better every single day, it becomes easier
and easier for people to post a picture where they look 20-pound skinnier to Photoshop themselves
into a party they never went to, or in more extreme cases do things like this. They put
a toilet seat up against a window so it looks like they're going on an exotic vacation, even if
they're actually not. This phenomenon is particularly prominent and what is now known as influencers
on social media. Influencers look like they live the amazing life. They're usually on any social
media platform, but specifically Instagram and YouTube and have millions of followers
or subscribers. As I said before, their life looks perfect and even companies use them to
promote products for easy advertising. Looking at a social media influencer can make the average
person feel pretty insecure at times. An example of one of these influencers is James Charles,
19-year-old makeup artist with over 15 million followers. A minute, he doesn't look bad in
any single photo on his Instagram. His makeup is always flawless and he never shows you the
time or the money it takes to put all that on, so it looks quick and easy and like he did it in a
minute. Another one, Hailey Baldwin Bieber. She has over 18.3 million followers and she posts
pictures of herself under the most beautiful beaches in the world. Spoiler alert, nobody wakes up and
looks like that. It takes time, energy, money, and so many different resources. And I'm not a fancy
influencer, but I'll admit, I do it myself. I mean, I know this talk is probably going to be
shared somewhere on the internet, so I dressed up better than I normally do. In real life, my hair
is large and curly. I wear glasses and I prefer to wear big sweatshirts over anything else. But on
every single photo on my Instagram, my hair has been straightened. I have my contacts in, my makeup
is done, and I'm dressed up far better than I do regularly. Me, influencers, and so many other people
now only put on Instagram what we want other people to see. When you're scrolling through Instagram,
you only see what the Instagrammer has specifically designed. Specific moments in their time where
they're looking happy and they're dressed up and nobody has to see any other part of their life.
According to sociologist Julie Albright from University of Southern California,
people's persona online may be much more fabulous, much more exciting than the everyday life that
they're leading. And this isn't a problem just for teenagers anymore. I mean, my grandparents have
Facebook. I was born in 2001 on this weird Generation Z Millennial cusp, and I'll find that I spend
hours on Instagram and Snapchat and just end up feeling sorry for myself. I wonder why people who
I haven't even spoken to in years look like they have their entire life together, and I don't.
I wonder why it looks like everyone's having the best time ever. And with these photos quite
literally in my face all the time, it's so easy to wonder, why am I not that pretty?
Why am I not that skinny? Or why am I not that popular or cool? I had a conversation with a
teacher of mine as well, a millennial, who says one of the worst parts about social media is going
out to Facebook and seeing people she used to go to school with now raising their own families.
This makes her wonder, is she raising her family right? And how can she make her son just as good
or even better than every single other kid she sees on Facebook? And I've seen it in my little
sister too, Generation Z. I've seen her swiping through Snapchat wondering how it looks like
every other middle schooler in the world is the most secure person in the world. We all know
that's probably not true. Although social media can make us feel so lonely. It's so easy to feel
alone when it looks like every other person has it together and you feel like you don't. So it
shouldn't take any big scientific discovery to promote the claim that social media has detrimental
effects on our mental health. But scientists have done the study and it's proven true. Melissa
G. Hunt from University of Pennsylvania stated that using less social media than you normally do
would lead to significant decreases in both oppression and loneliness. And George Albrecht
from University of Amsterdam stated passive social media use co-occurred with a loss of
interest, concentration problems, fatigue, and loneliness. So what do we do? We can't just
avoid social media. It's everywhere. It's on our news. It's in our schools. It's in our homes. It's
in our workplaces. It's impossible to just forget about it. But it has given us a huge advantage
in some ways. We have the ability to communicate more than ever before and that's amazing. I'm
about to go to college and I've talked to people from all around the world that I'll be going to
school with next year and I've talked with my roommate so many times. When my parents went to
college they had no idea who they'd be living with for the next year. And my TED Talks from the
past few years have been put on YouTube and my message about mental health has spread to people
who I will never know. So in the words of Stanley and his favorite comic book, Spider-Man, with great
power comes great responsibility. Social media has given us an amazing advantage to communicate,
to share ideas, to bring people from all around the world together. But it's also made it easier
for people to fake their lives, fake a personality, and for us to become more insecure.
And going back to the Instagram influencers, it's hard sometimes to just remind ourselves that
not everyone is going to look like the favorite celebrity. Jamila Jamil, an actress known for
the NBC show The Good Place, has now started a campaign called I-Way. The purpose of her campaign
is to call out and show celebrities and point out to regular people that celebrities and
influencers have amazing resources to some of the best food, the best personal trainers,
the best gyms, and the best magazine editors in the world. So no wonder they look better than
the average person. Jamil has also called out celebrities who are now using their fans' weight
insecurities to sell diet pills so everyone can look just as good as they do. Jamil has become the
beginning of an amazing campaign to make us feel better in our bodies and not to compare ourselves
with every single person we see on the internet. And sometimes when you're just at your worst,
it's better just to delete the apps off your phone. Sometimes, as I said, when I'm feeling
my worst, I just delete the apps off my phone. I don't delete the accounts necessarily, but
without the apps physically there, there's nothing for me to be just checking throughout the day.
And usually I can go for weeks out of time until I feel comfortable enough that I can
redownload it and it won't affect my mental health so much. So I know a week's hard, but
I ask all of you, take one day, just delete the apps off your phone, whatever it is,
Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, Tumblr, MySpace, whatever it is, delete it for one day.
And I promise that it'll be like a huge weight taking off your chest. And who knows,
you may find that you have more times to do things you like, like making music,
dancing, or volunteering with kids. So if there's one message that you take from this talk,
it's I hope that you know you are not defined by the amount of likes and comments on your post
on social media. Social media is not real, and no way can a single account on a social media website
encapsulate the entire brilliant personality of a single human being. Thank you.
