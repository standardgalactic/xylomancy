We know that the AMOG is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.
We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before.
And we are not really much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing,
in terms of how much degree of global warming would be okay before the AMOG could collapse
than we were like 20, 30 years ago, even though we know much more.
Today's conversation is with climate physicist Lefke Caesar.
Lefke works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Her current
work primarily focuses on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, aka the AMOG, and its
pivotal role in our climate system. Lefke's research has produced seminal work on the past
evolution of this important ocean current. In October of 2023, she also assumed the role of
scientific lead for the newly launched Planetary Boundary Science Initiative at the Potsdam
Institute. This conversation was a deep dive on all things AMOG, what we know, what we don't know,
and what speculations are for the future of this critical component of our planetary systems.
Please welcome Lefke Caesar. Lefke, great to see you.
Yeah, great to talk to you, Nate. Thanks for inviting me.
You are welcome. So usually when I host guests, I have their location on my globe,
but since we're going to be talking about the AMOG, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
of the Atlantic Ocean, I highlighted the Atlantic Ocean as the theme location of the podcast.
So you are a world-renowned expert on ocean issues, especially the AMOG, and that's going
to be the topic of our deep dive today. But let me first ask you this, how old were you
and what were you thinking when you first decided I want to be a scientist studying
how Earth's natural systems work? That's a very interesting question, because I have to admit
I'm actually coming from the space science side. So when I was young, and I think even at the age
of like eight, nine, I was really interested in the formation of black holes, the life cycle of stars,
then I had a period when I wanted to become an astronaut. And that basically sparked me to
study physics. And it was then later during my studies that I kind of realized I want to do
something that's closer to home and that feels a little bit more relevant. So I still really believe
that astrophysics is really cool. And I don't know, physicists might call it sexy in terms of the
data, the mechanisms, but yeah, I guess I was in about like 22 when I really did my
bachelor's in physics that I realized physics can also be applied to our planet, to the Earth system,
and can explain so many interesting and relevant phenomena, whether the ocean
circulation that, yeah, basically then when I decided to shift my focus.
Excellent. I shifted my focus when I was on Wall Street and realized that the
externalities were not included in our prices. And we were in for a phase shift during my lifetime
of the ecology and natural systems on Earth. So as you're well aware, global heating is in the news.
Lots of people are worried and aware of climate change. Oceans are a very integral part
of the climate system, but they don't get as much coverage in the news. There are multiple ocean
risk that we face, ocean acidification, decline in oxygen content, sea level rise, overfishing,
lots of different aspects. But what we're going to talk about today is the ocean currents
and how they change and how they may be changing in the near and distant future.
So can you start us off by describing what the AMOC is and how critical it is to the function of
climate as we know it today? Yes, sure. So the AMOC, which is short for Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation, and I like that name even though I guess for a lot of people
it's kind of difficult to say at first, but it's actually a good description of what the system
is. So the AMOC is a system of ocean currents covering the Atlantic, therefore Atlantic,
Meridional, because that's the geological term basically for saying something is moving in the
north-south direction. And while the AMOC is basically, when depending on where you look,
moving in any direction, the main transport is on the north-south line. So the AMOC is transporting
a lot of warm saline water at or just below the surface of the ocean northward in the Atlantic.
It's really coming even from the southern ocean. So it's really transporting the whole length of
the Atlantic, these water masses, and then as basically it's going over the equator through
the tropics and then entering the colder sub-polar north Atlantic region. And basically with that
it's coming into regions of colder air masses above the surface of the ocean and a lot of this heat
is then being transported or basically released to the atmosphere. The water, the surface water is
cooling down and cold water is denser compared to warmer water. And this is then basically
leading to a sinking of the water masses, which we call convection in physical terms basically.
And these water masses then that are sinking down in the sub-polar north Atlantic, and
well the locations are the Irminger Sea, the Nordic Seas, the Lapporte Sea, but I guess if you're not
an oceanographer then probably you wouldn't know what these ocean regions are called. So it's basically
around the Greenland ice sheet, so to the south of it, to the east of it, and there you have those
places of this deep water formation. So the sinking of surface water masses that are being
cooled down by the atmosphere, getting denser, getting heavier, and then are going to deeper
ocean layers. And when I say deeper I mean depths of two to three kilometers. And then these water
masses together form the southward return flow of the AMOC, now transporting colder water southward
at depths towards basically back towards the equator region. And it's mainly this exchange of
warm surface water going towards the sub-polar region and colder deeper water going back that
leads to a lot of energy transport by the AMOC. Okay, let me let me pause you there for a little bit
of history. And I'm gonna pretend that I don't know much about this, which I don't really have to
pretend much. We've had the AMOC current forever, or since there were seven continents, right? I mean
we've been aware of this and able to look back in time and this current that you described has
been there for a long time, right? It has been there for a long time, forever is probably difficult
to say, but yeah. And is this a new, I know there's a new paper out by your colleagues, I believe,
and yourself on the risks that the AMOC poses in the near future, but is awareness of this current,
is this a relatively new thing or is scientists known about this for a long time?
Actually, no, there are within the scientific community, this kind of starts with Henry Stommel,
who's one of, yeah, famous oceanographer, who already in the 60s basically assessed that this
overturning circulation, which first of all is special to the Atlantic. So we do not have this
kind of overturning circulation in the Pacific, that it A, exists, that it's very special in the
sense that normally when we look at either ocean currents or atmospheric currents,
they would always transport heat from the tropics to the polar regions, because basically the sun
is heating the earth in the sense we have most of the radiation going towards the tropics and then
less towards the polar regions. And as is usually the case, basically the systems thrive towards
distributing the heat more homogeneously. So basically, when you have a lot of heating at one
place and no heating at the others, you have a movement of either water or air masses from the
heated region to the colder regions. But the AMOC is special because it can actually transport heat
above the equator. It's transporting heat from the southern to the northern hemisphere.
And that makes it really special. And that the system is there, basically, and why it can be
there, which is like a delicate balance, basically, of fresh water, saline water, heating and cooling
in the Atlantic. That is something that has been known, as I said, for several decades now.
And also an understanding of the mechanism that it doesn't have to be there. So that in principle,
it's possible that there is no AMOC. Or theoretically, we could even say the AMOC could be flowing the
other way around. So as I said, we have a northward surface flow and a southward deep flow. We could
also have a circulation in the Atlantic, where we have a southward surface flow, deep water
formation, basically, in the southern ocean, and then a northward deep water return flow. But
that's not the case. The way, basically, our earth system is set right now through the fact that we
have a heating in the tropics. We have then evaporation of water masses, of the warm water
masses in the tropics, and more precipitation rainfall in the North Atlantic. This balance
is basically played out at the moment that we have the AMOC as it is flowing today with the
northward surface flow. Okay, so I'm going to jump around here. But give us the punch line first,
and then we'll backfill from there. What is happening to the AMOC now, and what are the risks
or the scenarios you see in coming decades or centuries or millennium based on what's already
built in? Yeah, so what we see now is basically a slowdown of this circulation system, very simply
said. And while scientifically it's always a little bit difficult to give exact numbers,
everything hints towards a slowdown of about 15% over the last few decades. And again, it's more
difficult to say why something is happening compared to then just observing it and saying it is
happening. But we do understand under which circumstances, what are the mechanisms that
could drive such a slowdown. And this is mainly related to a freshwater influx into the sub-Pollinouth
Atlantic. So I already kind of said that what is driving this ocean circulation is really a
formation of deeper water masses, a sinking of water masses in the sub-Pollinouth Atlantic
around Greenland. And then basically when you have water sinking at some place, you have to have an
inflow at the surface that is kind of filling this gap just due to volume conservation. And then
this deep water has to go somewhere. And basically with how the earth is set, the rotation of the
earth, the way it is basically that we have a southward deep water flow and then this surface
northward flow. But if we now put a lot of freshwater into the sub-Pollinouth Atlantic,
what is happening is that the surface water there get lighter, less dense. This is because the
density of ocean water depends on two things, the temperature, which I already mentioned,
colder water being denser than light water, but also the salinity. And here I guess it also makes a
lot of sense if I put more salt, more matter into something, I make it heavier and denser.
Now if we put a lot of very fresh water, so no salinity basically into the sub-Pollinouth
Atlantic, then we lighten the surface water and we hinder, slow down this deep water formation,
the sinking of water masses. Now that's in principle, that is understood, not just in
principle, it is understood. The thing is that in real life, it's not happening in the way that we
have at every minute, every place in the sub-Pollinouth Atlantic deep water formation. So it's not
like we sometimes call the overturning circulation a conveyor belt. And I think there you mentioned
something that is continuously going, flowing, but actually the deep water formation is happening
from time to time, mainly in the winter time, because that's when the atmosphere is specifically
cold. It's also then cooling the surface water the most. And then it's also happening at specific
locations because it's really a delicate balance of what exactly is the local surface temperature,
atmospheric temperature above that, what's the local salinity value. And that's also why it's
difficult for us to say, when are we really stopping this process? Because we do know that
we're now putting more fresh water in the sub-Pollinouth Atlantic. The green and ice
sheet is melting. Under climate change, we see increased precipitation over this region,
so also more fresh water. But whether or not and how much this influencing the overturning
circulation really depends on where exactly is what happening. So which is more,
has a higher forcing component of salinity or temperature, like a small change in salinity
or a small change in temperature, which causes the water to not descend or to descend faster?
That's a very good question and it depends. So because the relationship basically between
temperature, salinity and density is not linear. So basically how much when I change the temperature
a little bit, it matters whether I change it from 20 to 21 degrees or whether I change it from 5 to
4 degrees. The differences or the effects on density are different and the same is with salinity.
So we can't just talk about the change. We would have to also talk about the background state and
then look at the change to say what is more important. And then also when we look at it right
now in terms of the more dominant driver is actually the temperature. But in terms of what we
human change and how we change it, it's actually the system is more sensitive to salinity changes
right now. So here's a dumb question, but it's my podcast so I can ask some dumb questions.
When water evaporates from the ocean, the ocean is a salt water, but when it evaporates,
the salt doesn't evaporate, the salt stays in the ocean. So the clouds just get non-saline water
droplets. And the part two of the question is as we head into a world with a higher
standard deviation of precipitation, floods and droughts, etc., does this changing precipitation
pattern over the oceans and supposedly indirectly over the land which would run off into the ocean?
Does that higher standard deviation indirectly affect the salinity of the meltwater in the oceans
and change this amok? So first of all, your first question, comment, I'm just going to comment
that was right. So basically rain is freshwater and the salt just stays in the ocean when it
evaporates, which is why when we have more precipitation over an ocean region, we are
freshening the water there, we are decreasing the salinity. And yes, I mean the thing is
unless with global warming where we can basically say it might depend on the region, but in general
we see global warming globally. So there's warming close to everywhere. When we talk about
the changes in precipitation, it's way more difficult. So we have a tendency of saying,
okay, the regions that now receive precipitation are likely going to receive more and the drier
regions are going to be drier in the future, but that's like more a general thing. It doesn't have
to be true for every place, but we can see in our climate simulations that there's a tendency
towards more precipitation over the regions where the deep water formation for the amok is happening
and that in itself is basically bad for the amok because it can slow it down. But that alone
wouldn't be the problem. I think a bigger problem is actually the melting of the ice sheets because
due to the reason what you said, also snow basically, I mean that's frozen precipitation.
So that is also pure freshwater and all this melting runoff coming from the green and ice
sheet and entering the sub-Polaroid North Atlantic. That's actually potentially very harmful for the
amok, but there are also other effects. Just basically the surface warming that we see globally
in the oceans could also hinder the or slow down the amok because it's also making the surface water
lighter, enhancing what we call the stratification of the ocean, really meaning that there's not a
lot of vertical mixing and therefore also hindering the deep water formation. So there are really
multiple effects overlaying this and I could actually get on and go on and on because it
gets even more complicated. I listened to a few of your podcasts and you also talked already about
the aerosol forcing basically and it's important for climate change and that actually also plays
a role for the amok because a lot of the aerosols right now where they are basically are located in
the atmosphere, it's cooling regions that could also be critical for the amok and help in that sense
kind of and basically be good for the amok in terms of it's cooling the regions where the deep water
formation is taking place and that might help the driver of the amok, but that also really depends
on where exactly and this is something that is different from climate model to climate model
which is why it's so difficult for us to really say what is going to happen to the amok.
We're going to get into the implications of this which are potentially quite horrific in the
coming century but as a scientist and I can tell from your voice, do you ever feel a sense of wonder
that teams of humans with technology and computers and observations were able to figure out the things
that you're describing today? I mean it's pretty cool right that we can understand the dynamics of
the ocean currents and all that. Do you ever feel like wow this is amazing?
When I take the time and take a step back I guess from what I'm doing because I mean in my day-to-day
work I'm more concentrated on what we do not know and what we haven't figured out yet and
from that point of view it's also a little bit frustrating because we know that the amok
is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down. We see from
paleo data evidences that it might have happened before and we are not really much closer to
knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing, in terms of how much degree of global
warming would be okay before the amok could collapse than we were like 20 30 years ago
even though we know much more but basically in discovering more we also discovered that there
are more uncertainties and more things we do not understand and that all in all led to the
thing that we are still pretty uncertain. Let me give you three scenarios and you can speculate
knowing like you just said we don't know but you're very knowledgeable on this topic. The first
scenario is that the amok slows around 15% and stays there kind of like it's doing now. The
second scenario is that it continues to slow you know another 50% or something like that and the
third scenario is that the amok actually stops in the coming 100 years or 200 years or something
like that. Under those three scenarios what would be some of the effects that the world
could experience or Europe and the North Atlantic coast in the USA and Canada.
Can you just paint a picture of what the future might look like under these three scenarios?
Sure maybe just as a feedback question what kind of climate change scenario otherwise are we
looking at? So basically because that again is very important are we looking at a global warming
world or are we saying okay we keep this level of global warming plus an amok slowdown collapse?
Right you know this podcast you know we talk about neuroscience and debt and biodiversity
and climate and economics. Every one of those is unbelievably complex and yet and this is what
we're trying to do so what you're saying is that let's keep everything constant with climate the way
it is right now today and if we were able to do that which of course we're not this is just a
thought experiment then the amok would exhibit under those three scenarios I said it would have
certain effects or you could look at it as what is the at two degrees above pre-industrial Celsius
what would do the amok so they're they're moving in tandem let's just say that
two to two and a half degrees Celsius in the in the three scenarios I told you.
Yeah so basically if the amok stays as it is right now so basically it slowed down by about 15
percent then we would probably I mean see what we link to the amok at the moment
which is I already talked about this global warming signal you see global warming or the
warming everywhere around the globe but actually when you look at the long-term temperature trends
you can see that the mid-center of the North Atlantic cooled over the last century of course
this is not true for every single year I mean right now we are having extreme warm sea surface
temperatures in the North Atlantic but the long-term trend for that region actually has a slight cooling
signal which is unique seen globally and that is something that we link to the decrease in amok
strength and the decrease of heat being transported so the amok normally transports heat into that
region as the amok slows down less heat is being transported into that region which is why we can
see a global or a cooling signal a local cooling signal in that region despite global warming.
This is now making it more complicated because when we change regional the rate of regional or
the local rate of warming basically if that is different from one place to another then this
has an effect on the atmosphere in terms of when we look at the changes in sea surface temperatures
patterns so that's what the amok is doing it's kind of heating some of the ocean surfaces and
cooling others by transporting heat and this then is being translated to the atmosphere by either
warming or cooling the air there and this then leads for example when we have strong amok we have
a heating the local air above that region rises we have a low pressure system above that surface
region a higher pressure system in the air or up higher up in the air and what I'm trying to say
I'm probably doing a very complicated job in doing is is that we have an effect on weather
systems and what has been shown for the amok is basically that a slower amok can actually
lead to heat extremes over Europe in the summertime by influencing the state and location of the jet
stream and the weather systems that are moving with that. So you're saying that the the ocean
current dynamics of the amok would create a cool blob in the north Atlantic and because of
the jet stream and the pressures that that actually could cause a heat wave in continental Europe.
Yes exactly because it's determining how the jet stream is located and that then determines
whether the air that is coming towards Europe is either coming from polar regions or whether it's
coming from the African continent and in that case this would actually favor an air pressure
distribution where we have more air coming from the south towards Europe so hotter air and therefore
can lead to heat extremes. Okay so carry on with my speculative question what would be
some of the effects if under these three scenarios and you can tell me what climate
scenario you would you'd like to choose I just want to isolate as much as possible of course
we're part of a complex adaptive system so we can't just talk about the amok without the other
things but I don't think many people understand the risk associated with just this one ocean issue
so maybe you could explain under a not too bad bad and horrible scenario what what some of the
impacts would be. Yes I think maybe I'm talking mainly about the impacts and with most of them
I think the risk is just going to be higher under a stronger amok slowdown scenario maybe it's a
little bit different for a complete collapse of the amok so what we know what the amok is important
for I said it's important for the heat transport it's also important actually for getting heat
from the atmosphere extracting that and getting it into the deeper ocean so in a way it's also
important for cooling the atmosphere we know right now that and I guess maybe some of you
have heard that the ocean is taking up about 90 percent of the excess heat caused by global warming
and how does that happen yeah basically it's it's a kind of a simple loss of thermodynamics and
physics that and I guess you know that I mean if you have two systems of different temperature
then you will have a transport of heat from the hotter to the colder system right that's basically
why we get cold when we go outside in the winter time and I think it might be also
then important to know that it's this effect is stronger with water maybe you know when you are
out in 25 degrees air it's a warm summer time if you stay in water that's 25 degrees Celsius for
a longer time you will actually get chilly because the heat capacity of water is four times
larger than that of air basically it can take up heat easier but it's also conducting the heat
faster from away from you and what's happening really is we heat the atmosphere and the ocean
below that is colder they are not in equilibrium and normally systems will always tend towards
going into an equilibrium and because of that we have an heat flux from the atmosphere to the
ocean now the thing is it's really the ocean is vast so the the mass of the ocean is even though
of course it's in terms of depth it's up to 11 kilometers so that's not as deep as the atmosphere
is going in in height but because the air gets thinner as we go up into the air the mass of
the oceans actually more than a hundred times larger than that of the air and the atmosphere so
the ocean really has way more capacity for taking up additional heat so so the the good news is is
that our planet has these deep and cold oceans that have buffered the effects of heat from our
greenhouse gas trapping activities the bad news is is they've done this largely invisibly without
being recognized and we've taken this buffer for granted and what an amazing thing that these oceans
are are so potent but they've kind of blinded and caused a delay in our ecological impacts yes
yes that exactly and it's basically a problem that is emerging right now because you probably
know the problems that we see with coral reefs and the bleaching effect I mean and that is also
due to ocean acidification but it's mainly due to marine heat waves and this is something we're
seeing now more and more as we're heating up the ocean and also it might lead to us taking
for granted that the ocean can take up this much heat and by the way also carbon but that is not
necessarily the case I mean as I said systems tends what an equilibrium so if we put more heat
carbon into the atmosphere the ocean will take up more but the pace of how fast the ocean can do that
depends on how strong the ocean is stratified and how much deep water formation also we have
so basically the deep water formation kind of acts as a link between the upper ocean and the deep
ocean and if we don't have that anymore then the upper ocean takes up heat and carbon but
it's fairly full soon basically because that's a thin layer and it really only triggers very
slowly to the deep ocean and therefore there will be like a delay time when we have the deep ocean
connected to the upper ocean we are deep water formation then we can take up or the ocean can
take up the heat and carbon much faster and that's important but that might actually
yeah be hindered in the future by this by the effect itself by the increased certification
because of warming the ocean and yeah I have so many questions let's go um we're talking about
the amok in the Atlantic Ocean but presumably there are currents in all the other oceans as well
that we're just talking about the Atlantic one right yes yeah um and in the past I've had on
friend of mine Peter Ward who's a paleobiologist who's written books one book called under a
green sky which was about a historical period called a canfield ocean where they became stratified
and produced hydrogen sulfide gas and there was no exchange between the different layers
what are the possibilities of that happening and what are your thoughts on that
well I mean in principle it's never completely going to happen right I mean even if you have like
a very stratified ocean if you keep warming the atmosphere and with that the upper ocean
there will always be a little bit of mixing and diffusion basically and the heat is going to travel
downwards but normally and this is why the amok is so important as I said that's a place where
we have a lot of mixing with from the surface ocean with a deeper ocean and um it's basically the
difference in um I put a drop of color let's say into a water glass or a water bottle if I wait a
very long time it's going to mix perfectly but I would have to wait a very long time if I take
the bottle and shake it I can do it within a second and the effect is not as big with the amok
because it is a local effect but it's still a deep region or a large region in the north
atlantic where we have a mixing between upper and lower or deeper ocean and that's why it's so
important and um the same is kind of happening as I said with carbon so also the carbon uptake
of the ocean is again it's the same principle we have an equilibrium between the carbon pressure
in the atmosphere and the one in the ocean we put right now more in the atmosphere the ocean is
taking it up and the speed depends on the rate of mixing in the ocean okay so um the oceans have
taken up approximately 90 percent of the additional heat uh in the atmosphere and approximately 50
percent of the carbon something like that yeah I think it's a little bit more I think it's more
I'm not completely sure about the number but I think it's more like two-thirds of the carbon
okay so um can this continue indefinitely at at this pace I assume the answer is no and and
what is the mechanism that reduces the ability of oceans to absorb heat and carbon and what
happens if they can't absorb anymore or what happens if they can't absorb as much yeah so
basically the mechanisms are slightly different as I said it really is related to an equilibrium
between atmosphere and surface and then the mixing basically between surface ocean and deeper ocean
with carbon we also have the problem that it's a gas and gases are easier soluble in or you can
dissolve them easier in colder water so as we are warming the ocean we are actually kind of reducing
the capability of the ocean to take up carbon I mean as long as we keep pushing more carbon into
the atmosphere the ocean is going to take up more carbon because we increase that pressure
but if that process is slowing down then we see of course also a faster rise in atmospheric carbon
concentration because we have to put make the pressure even higher from the atmosphere on the
ocean for the ocean to keep taking up and then the problems of course also that this equilibrium
is going to change in the future let's imagine we stop with our CO2 emissions and we actually
manage to stabilize the atmospheric uh CO2 concentrations and even reduce them then at
some point the basically the ocean is going to outgas that additional carbon right now and and
giving it back to the atmosphere and the same as with the heat if we start cooling the atmosphere
by going into the right direction basically because it's what we want then the ocean
who's now acting as a buffer might give that back on long time scale so it's really also
yeah it has to change how we are treating our solutions and our future pathways by having to
consider what we are now changing in the ocean system so we're going to get our carbon security
deposit kicked back to us uh at at the end so the buffer turns into a boomerang um once once our
emissions slow or stabilize hopefully soon maybe in a hundred years or something like that the
oceans are gonna then um give some of that back at some point yes exactly and we have to take that
into account are we taking that into account that's a very good question i think in general of
course we are aware of that but um most climate scenarios that we calculate often they stop in
2100 but as if as if our world stops in 2100 exactly and that's um that's not really an
oceanic time scale let's put it like that so um i i guess often it's not taken enough into account
so in the earth system uh timelines um this is something that's important to look at
yes yeah okay so getting back to the three scenarios um just
let's just say that uh we don't do anything to abate uh our emissions and economic growth is
somehow able to continue um and aima continues to uh slow um what what are some of the impacts on
europe and the world uh under those scenarios just as a disclaimer basically it's in general kind of
complicated to really like single out what is an amok effect and what is an effect basically
of a changing earth system when uh the amok is also changing so let's assume that they they change
at the same rate um the rate they're changing now yeah um so basically um this knowledge is
coming mainly from um either paleo data or climate models so and when we basically look at a climate
model then what we see is that when we slow down the amok we have an increase in storm activity
and winter storms over europe in the winter time which is mainly related basically to changes in
the sea surface temperatures pattern in the north atlantic which is driving the winds and um that's
basically what we can see we also expect changes in precipitation mainly over summer
and that really depends on where in europe you look but in general it seems to get a little bit
drier with an amok slowdown um the explanation is fairly easy in the way that if we put less heat
into the north atlantic we have less evaporation and due to the wind system normally this evaporation
is being transported towards europe um when we look at the us coast we actually see an increase
in sea level rise and um the explanation is actually quite beautiful i mean it's not it's not a good
thing but the explanation is beautiful in the way because um i don't know whether many people know
that but when we would look at the ocean surface it's actually not flat so basically when you look
from space at the ocean surfaces you really have hills and um bumps and so on and that is basically
because water masses are moved and um we have due to the rotation of our earth we have like a constant
force i mean physically saying saying it's we say coriolis affect not force because it's not
yeah in a physical divinational force but basically we have something that is moving the water masses
if something is moving more northward on the northern hemisphere is being deflected to the right
and now when we look at the surface currents of the amok in on the northern hemisphere they are
moving northward so water masses are being deflected to the right towards the midst of the
north atlantic which is when you when when you would look at the north atlantic you actually
have a water hill in the middle of it and lower water levels or basically towards the coast of
the us and that is really linked to the strength of the surface current of the amok and if that
strength is slowing down if that current is slowing down then basically this water hill
in the middle of the atlantic is getting lower and the sea level at the us east coast is getting up
and um again it's kind of really complicated to say or difficult to say how much exactly that
would be so from climate simulation that seems like a complete shutdown of the amok could
lead to an additional approximately one meter of sea level rise at the us east coast
but there it also really depends on the city because of complicated dynamics but that's
yeah a link that we know of and what about the temperatures in europe if if there's a
large slowing or shutdown well um if there's a shutdown it could be locally up to 10 degrees
or more and that depends on do i look at the annual mean temperature
hotter or colder colder if the amok shuts down then because of this missing heat transport
by the amok towards northern the northern hemisphere and europe it gets colder um
so like the like the movie the day after tomorrow just not as exaggerated not as
exaggerated and not as fast of course i mean in the day after tomorrow everything happens
within weeks and that's something of course it's also important to stress we know that the amok
has a tipping point which means that if we push it too much towards slowing down there are feedbacks
within the system that basically would continue the slowdown process and would lead to an even
slower amok but this is not happening within days or weeks but decades could could you just
briefly mention one or two of those such feedbacks yes one is actually and um this is a nice thing
i guess that we are talking about the same principles and um again again the amok itself
is as i said it's transport it's transporting warm and saline water surface waters northward
and i said ocean density is determined by temperature and salinity so basically the amok
by transporting salt towards the region where the deep water formation of the amok is occurring
is actually um kind of enforcing its own driver it is making the water denser where it needs to
be dense to keep driver to keep going but if the amok slows down then we have less salt there
and it's of course it's completely different effect from adding fresh water to the system
but the result is the same less salt in the sub-porta north Atlantic where the amok deep
water formation occurs you are so smart and articulate and i have to also point out that
you are doing this not in your native language so it's it's so impressive and and important and
interesting so thank you thanks for pointing that out sometimes i feel a little bit stupid when i
say something in english and no temple out of my mouth i could never do a scientific climate
discussion in english let alone german the way that you're doing now so um let me ask you a
another dumb question if amok slows or stops it could be up to 10 degrees celsius cooler in europe
but this is why while at the same time global global warming is occurring so does that mean
elsewhere in the world there's somewhere that has a corresponding heat pump to to make the whole
thing a little bit net hotter or how does that work yes um so a yes so basically again amok
transporting heat from the southern to the northern hemisphere if the amok stops we have
more heat access in the southern hemisphere and that is also what we see in any kind of simulation
where we simulate an amok shutdown is more heating in the southern hemisphere um exactly where
is difficult to say it's probably of course in the north or in the south atlantic so in that
region but it kind of seems to spread globally so so this would not be good news um for brazil
and argentina who are already experiencing quite hot temperatures from climate exactly and i would
even go so far and to say it's also not good news for us even though we might have a cooling through
an amok slowdown or shutdown and um i mean we now said okay it could be 10 degrees it really
depends on the simulation but then we would have to add that a shutdown is probably going to occur
maybe it occurs under five degrees of warming so you could say okay great we have five degrees of
warming 10 degrees of cooling so maybe a little bit of cooling um but a this really it's very local
effect so we don't know exactly where yet and that is of course a very complicated thing because it
also means on how to be prepared for our future it would be very different under an amok shutdown
than it is under a general global warming scenario with just an amok slowdown there there are um
decreasing uh benefits in an economy to more complexity there are also decreasing uh benefits
to conversations with average people due to more and more complexity uh and this is an incredibly
complex topic but a simplistic understanding is there a risk for trying to get people in Europe
aware and engaged and voting and doing things to mitigate more global warming that if they
hear that the amok is going to slow and that europe is going to be a lot colder doesn't that
emotionally um kind of defer the urgency of climate change at the margin to some people
have you come across that i haven't and i think that's a very interesting thing that i haven't
because i think it shows that people understand enough about the complexity and that basically
nobody could guarantee them that it's that they're better off with an amok collapse
instead that we tell them it's it's really something also depends on where in europe
you live so it's not going to be like a cooling everywhere in europe but it will be really centered
about the north atlantic it's going to change precipitation patterns and i think um looking
basically at the last years with um flooding events and draws and so on people know that
all these changes in dynamics apart from a simple change in temperature can
take give so much additional risk or bring so much additional risk that i think a lot of
people know know this is not something one risk even though there might be a very very small
percentage that's actually going to benefit very few of us so obviously you can't distinguish
you levka wearing a scientist hat or wearing i am a human being hat but if you could just
loosely release the scientist hat for a moment where do you speculate in the distribution
of possible futures what's your gut feel on on where we will eventually land in terms of
temperature Celsius above pre-industrial average my feeling is we're going to land
somewhere where we do not want to be and i'm and that's basically what scares me i think we're
going to land somewhere where we are forced to act because the consequences are so dire and so
extreme and i mean this is the problem is of course i think that the regions globally that are more
vulnerable are not the ones where the power and the money sits and that basically means that
we are probably going to see the consequences maybe more in having more refugees and having
more war zones and and stuff like that and um i yeah it doesn't matter what the number is going
to be i think the the reality is not going to be nice i was just in india in the south of india
and most people there don't know about climate science they just know that it's um well it's
a hundred degrees there today in in the south of india and it it kind of broke my heart because up
until that moment i cognitively knew that there's a billion four hundred people in india and the
indian subcontinent is one of those places that it's going to warm and have higher wet bulb issues
but to be there in person and see the real warm lovely people and culture it it kind of
hit me because i've visualized um some of this happening not centuries from now but in the
coming decades so i i hear i hear what you're saying um so um how do you uh and we'll get back
to this but i i want to still ask you some questions about amok how do you and your colleagues
measure amok how can you even measure such a thing
yeah um that's very complicated actually so um even a few years or a few decades back um i think
the first amok measurement that i know of like a real measurement basically where they went into uh
out onto the north atlantic and um put instruments out in the ocean is from 1959
and back then what they had to do is basically they really had to go on a research vessel
and then drive along the whole width of the atlantic because you really have to go from
basically africa to the us and um or brazil basically to really cover the whole length to
take into account all of the water masses that are being moved and that's how it was done for
most of the time and um from these first measurements and that's very costly it takes a couple of weeks
to actually do this um and yeah just being on a research cruise every single day is as i said
very expensive and resource extensive um but these first measurements that they made indicated
that the amok slowed down by quite a bit between 1959 and i think the last measurement was in 2001
where they will really assess that um and the first estimate was a slowdown of 30 percent over
that time and that was of course a dire news but it also um led to a lot of scientists saying well
can we really say that because this was deduced from five measurements to five research cruises
basically going out there over a course of 40 years um they were done during different times
of the year so some were in spring some were in autumn and basically what they always gave us was
one snapshot of amok strength in time and i mean basically if i would try to um understand how
temperatures are changing and basically i'm measuring the temperature right now today and then tomorrow
i'm going to measure the one in the morning and um then the next time at night then i know even though
i have measurements from three consecutive days i can't really deduce any trend from them because
they're measured in different times of the day and we know that there's internal variability
with a day cycle and the same is true for the amok but on timescale so that we are not completely
aware of yet so there's not just an annual cycle but there's an inter annual cycle and long story
short that's why they started in 2004 to put instruments out into the atlantic full time
to really have a continuous measurement it's still very costly it's a lot of work so you
have to have like research get it or scientists getting out there putting the instrument in
they have to be uh exchanged every one or two years they have to be calibrated um but from now
for from 2004 on we have amok continuous data the only thing is basically that 2004 until now
that's 20 years when we are looking at climate change we don't talk just about 20 years we
talk about at least 30 years or longer because we know that there are internal variabilities at
place and things can basically happen or you can have a trend over two to three years that's not a
long-term trend but that's just really related for example i guess most people know the alien
new phenomena all these things have effects on their system so how does the amok um relate to
or does it relate to the gulf stream uh and is there a risk of the gulf stream um slowing down
um so the amok and the gulf stream are two uh interesting partners brothers i would say in the
sense of um sometimes we even talk or call the amok the gulf stream system because they are
closely linked but they are different and the important difference is the gulf stream is in
surface current it's a wind driven surface current um basically we have wind systems over
the north atlantic they pushed the water masses due to the coriolis effect the water masses are
deflected to the right and this basically leads to the gulf stream flowing as it does the gulf
stream is when we look at the size of the gulf stream it's way bigger than the amok so depending
on where you measure whether it's close to florida or more towards the um inner outer north atlantic
the gulf stream has a volume transport between 30 to 150 swerdrup and swerdrup is this unit
used by physical oceanographers one swerdrup is a million cubic meters of water that are being
transported per second so gulf stream between 30 and 150 maybe just as a comparison the amazon
river the largest river on earth has a transport of 0.2 swerdrup so what's being transported in the
atlantic is huge but most of the gulf stream waters are then basically also end up on the
return way as a surface current and with return way i mean basically the gulf stream is flowing
northward and it's then being deflected to the right and to the right due also to the wind system
and we have a southward surface current along the european and african coast basically we still
have a little bit of a heat transport because we have the warm water masses going towards the um
north atlantic they're being cooled and a little colder water masses going back but when we talk
about the amok we have an exchange of surface flow going towards the north atlantic and deep
water really cold flows going southward so in terms of driver for example you could say the gulf stream
is driven by the winds the amok is mainly driven by density differences mainly i'm saying
mainly here because when we go out there and measure the amok we don't we can't ask the water
masses hey what's your driver are you moving because of the winds or because of density
differences we just see moving water masses and um yeah because of it we would say probably that a
small percentage of the gulf stream is basically ending up into the deep water formation region
and is then becoming part of the amok but the majority of the gulf stream is just being also
traveling back southward as a surface current and that part is not slowing down as long as we
have the winds when the amok will collapse then the gulf stream would slow down a little bit
that amok part of the gulf stream and warmer temperatures affect both the gulf stream and
the amok though um because the winds uh to my knowledge are created by the temperature differential
between the equator and and the poles and if the poles warm a lot then that temperature differential
declines and that would reduce uh some of these winds yes yes that is true um i think although
when we like measured right now the the wind effect is really not that large right now
but in principle you are right um that that's happening this polar amplification is decreasing
the temperature gradient and with that the wind strength overall so in in one of the presentations
that uh that you have on your website and that you shared with me you have a slide which will put
on screen where you you highlight that the amok effect has potentially uh uh is part of a domino
effect in some of the other issues um dealing with the amazon and the west Antarctic uh ice sheet
and the greenland ice sheet could you talk about the the feedbacks and and the domino effect that
relate to not only amok but the climate system so the amok i think is special in the climate system
as it's the one major connector between southern and northern hemisphere between the Antarctic ice
sheet and the greenland ice sheet and when the amok let's assume the amok would slow down by a lot
we kind of said okay that means more excess heat in the southern hemisphere less in the northern
hemisphere that could on the one hand side stabilize the greenland ice sheet because it's
cooling down the sub-polar north Atlantic around greenland and could yeah therefore stabilize that
ice sheet but it would lead to more heat around Antarctica and could therefore um yeah lead to
more melting there and destabilize when we look at Antarctica mainly the western part is the one
that we are worried about the most right now because it seems to be the most um destable one already
and um with that of course um then enhance sea level rise but and this is really important it kind
of shows that the order of things happening has an effect because if the greenland i said a slowed
on of the amok could stabilize the greenland ice sheet if the greenland ice sheet is tipping
then this would actually lead also due to a destabilization of the amok because if that basically
is the order because we have a lot of freshwater then melted on greenland and flowing into the
sub-polar north Atlantic and i explained already how this can slow down the amok so yeah but it
shows that the whole earth system is linked and um when we have those major effects happening
more can follow you may be too young and i don't know what tv shows there were in Germany when
you were growing up but do you ever get the feeling that this is all part of some twilight zone episode
that we're describing this the the biogeochemical cycles of the planet that you and i are alive on
and we're talking about like major earth system changes happening on our watch doesn't that just
blow you away at times and and not in a good way yes actually yes and i think it feels so strange
that um as humans i mean an individual human is very small and in a way i don't want to insult
anybody but insignificant and i for example when i go out on the north Atlantic on a research vessel
and you are out on the ocean then there's huge water masses so much power around you so much
energy and also when we look i mean i talked about the the volume transport by the amok that's huge
that's nothing we can do basically in terms of engineering so i had actually people contacting
me saying can't we put some kind of robots into the water and move the amok ourselves no we can't
because that's way too much that is so huge the system that we can't do that physically and yet
we are actually messing with the system by something as burning coal by putting co2 into
the atmosphere so by actually doing uh affecting even tinier particles and um it feels very wrong
very scary i guess trying to be optimistic okay it shows that we can actually affect the system
a lot um but yeah it it feels like we are playing with something and we don't know the rules
is there um i and we can talk about this you know i'm a science communicator and i know that people
that follow this channel are very fluent in in these issues but relative to the general public
the amok and ocean risks are are relatively unknown especially in my country um what about
in the scientific community is there increasing consensus among your colleagues on on the amok
and climate uh and scenarios going forward or is there still uh quite a bit of
disagreement on the broader trends there's certainly an increased amount of consensus um
so when i basically did my phd and i published my first paper on an amok slowdown there were
quite a few scientists who made the point to me that um there are other explanations for the
signals that we are seeing and i mean the difficulty here is i i mentioned the real like
direct avoc measurements continue started in 2004 so to know what happened over the last century
we have to look at what we call proxy data so other climate variables that we um can measure that
we know are related to the amok and then kind of deduce the amok evolution from them and i worked
with my phd supervisor stefan ramstof on looking at the sea surface temperatures in the north
atlantic and there are a lot of reasons why we know that they're linked to the amok but of course
they are also influenced by other things for example an increase in wind strength could cool the
north atlantic as would an amok slowdown and um while there was no one in the scientific community
who said you must be wrong because of that there were a lot of people saying well but it could
also be a change in the wind system we don't know that yet we don't have the data to support that
but you can't be a hundred percent sure and i mean that's true i would say in in all of climate
scientists we basically are never a hundred percent sure because that's not how science works um we
basically we make an assumption we look at the data and we try to explain all the data that we have
according to that assumptions and if we find something that is basically um disproving what
we thought first then we have to find a new assumption um this has changed because there
have been more and more publications that indicated an amok slowdown and none that showed the opposite
there's still some data where we are okay this is interesting we can't completely complain that yet
but um with that the consensus is definitely increasing i think one problem is also just
the way the science community works as a whole so it's not that there's one publication about
something and everybody's oh yeah now we're going to believe that it's more like oh interesting now
let's wait a little bit see what other research groups are publishing on that test that i mean
that's good that's how we can make sure that we are not basically following some random group but
that we're really getting to enhance our knowledge but it also makes a little bit slow and maybe with
regards to climate change too slow it's so complex and i'm sure you deal with uh um ocean amok
experts uh in your your paper writing and your job but then there's arctic client climate specialist
and um cloud physicists and you know there's there's all sorts of different disciplines
within the climate discipline itself and how do you all meet at conferences and compare notes
on things that you're not experts in that someone else is um what's your experience there my experience
is um that the different disciplines are too siloed basically so then don't talk enough to each
other and i think it's not just a problem with within the disciplines but also with the way
science is being done at the moment that it's really pressed towards publications um as a young
researcher i know basically i'm being measured by the amount of first author and second author
publications that i have because of that too many papers are being published and no one can
read all of that but to publish a paper you have to find something new and i think what we really
have to do more is actually synthesizing the data that is out there the publications that are out there
yeah it's yeah so so tell me about your work where do you work what do you do and if you and
your your team are successful what what do you hope to accomplish yeah uh here i have to admit
that basically um i kind of left the amor community the like very small amor not not small but the
focused amor community because of the experience i made in the last years that basically um the amor
is a topic that is able to raise attention maybe also because of this movie the day after tomorrow
and at least in europe a lot of people know about the goldstream and the importance but
there are so many things happening when we look at the increase in extreme weather events when we
look at floodings and um i feel that the increase in fires um so many things related to climate change
that happen on a way faster time scales than the amorc and that have a big effect right now
that i basically went to my um former institute the posthum institute for climate impact research
and now work with johann rochström on the planetary boundary framework which is highlighting
actually this global approach and the synthesizing approach saying it's not enough to just look at one
special corner or area and um i mean this is actually going for that thing saying okay
not just amor is enough not even just climate change is enough to really have to look at the
earth system and looking at all its components looking at the biosphere integrity and basically
how the biosphere is right now functioning in our favor because that is also taking up a lot of carbon
how it's basically working in terms of the radiation budget and i just feel that we know
so much that we can do that would improve the lives of so many people on earth in terms of of
course reducing few too but also living more sustainable changing our diets towards more
plant-based that um i just wanted to work on that and i think the problem is in getting people to act
that most want numbers and certainty and we can't give a hundred percent certainty yet and we can't
give like the exact numbers but we can give with 99.9 certainty the direction that we have to go
and i just want to press that and um work on the science there this is an interesting thing because
if we stop this conversation now you have outlined scientifically credibly in some detail
how the amock works and my viewers will have learned about that there's a wide variety of
viewers that follow this channel because we we cover all the aspects of the human predicament
but once we go into what should we do about it i'm sure you have some suggestions um then once we
talk about prescriptions then some people no longer believe the the scientific description
and i'm not talking about you i'm just talking about generally in the world um there is the
explanation of the issue and there's the what to do about it and they confound each other have
have you experienced that yes and um i mean i'm not a hundred percent surprised by it because it
often seems to be human nature right that we find it really difficult to change and i mean
when i look or we look at our everyday life i guess most people know basically what would be
best for their own health in terms of exercise diet and so on but they seem to be not to be able
to do what's best for them in the long term i guess short term i can basically say okay i want to
eat this right now so i do it because it makes me happy and um so it's not surprising that when it
comes to this even bigger and more longer term issue that of course we are not able to choose
what's best for us in the long term but it's also really really frustrating i think if 10 or 20
or 30 of people chose the better path for climate there would be a social primate pressure to do
that but since it's someone else's problem and in the future so far we have not we've not done that
plus we are individual humans as part of this globally connected emergent energy hungry
pseudo organism that has a life of its own so climate is is a real problem uh for for this
situation and the only antidote that i can think of is more conversations like this
that act as a facilitator between our current behaviors and our mental understanding of the
future i agree i think that the best way still to basically facilitate or induce change is to
explain things to understand things because if it's difficult to change then we will only
change if we really get the reason so earlier you said and i happen to agree with you um
that we're going to do business as usual make a few little benign tweaks on the margins
but not do anything major until we we see the temperature precipitation ecological impacts
are horrifying and then we're going to try to do something radical
um at the last minute do you have any speculation on what some of those radical interventions might be
uh oh i don't know yet because i guess it's kind of like a path i don't really want to
go down in my mind i mean the thing is of course that there are as far as i know they're not like
real international laws on what kind of climate or geoengineering is allowed or not so i'm afraid
that some people might be thinking oh cool now we put a lot of air results into the atmosphere
because that at least has a cooling effect for a few years um i know that i think i mean those
ideas have been tested in in climate models and and basically in yeah run through and none of them
seems to be promising for the moment so i would i'm afraid that anything radical that we do is
probably not going to be wise so um could you offer any non radical suggestions to our viewers
either as individuals or as parts of institutions that create policies um and you know my my view is
germany or the united states can't just be climate friendly policies and and go to the
paris accord agreements it's a global you know the co2 is not recognized national borders i mean
it's a global thing um so what what sort of uh recommendations do you have to avert some of the
the default paths that we're currently on with the amok and with the global climate system i mean
in principle it is very simple first of all we really have to get our c2 emissions down um and i
think personally that means on the one hand side i would really encourage people to basically look at
the particular political party that they support and this topic should be in there and i mean i'm
not basically for me it's not really important whether otherwise what kind of faction you support
and whether you like our fan of capitalism or free markets or whatever the climate topic should
be in there no matter what the party is because that's non-negotiable and that's nothing we can
basically we we can't talk to to the climate system or to the earth system and say hey now
we're going to pay you this amount of money and you're not going to change so that's important
and please stress that no matter what you otherwise basically stand for belief in and then the other
thing is also be skeptical i think because we like easy solutions but normally the easy solutions
is not the best solution and i think um that's just something most of us know right if we work hard
for something normally it stays longer basically what i gain in a minute i can often lose very soon
also what i gain with hard work over years that stays and i think so with that be okay with that
it's going to be hard but it's not going to be negative a lot of the decisions or changes that
we have to make as i already mentioned would also be good for ourselves i mean we do know that
a plant-based diet is better for most of our health and um that basically cycling a lot i mean
who wants to sit in a car all day and drive around maybe a few people do but and that's okay too i think
kind of try to find the changes that are okay with you nobody has to change their life completely
but we can all make changes that basically make our lives more sustainable and i think
that's also important to like really take care of that and do the effort and don't do it for
somebody else but basically do it because it's the right thing to do that makes sense it does
make sense but as i said climate is a global issue and we've got india planning to double
coal production in their country by the year 2030 and you can understand why they want to do that
because they're going to have higher temperatures and they need more air conditioning and cooling
for their population so there is individual recommendations and i agree with the ones that
you laid out but there's got to be some sort of global plan and there isn't and i know why there
isn't so is there any hope in the international scope of things that that you and your colleagues
have i think these cop meetings so far have been a real disappointment they have no teeth
and i think the the the difficult questions are not askable with all these high status men
and women from around the world because they don't like truth to power sort of questions
yeah that's a very good question and i have to say basically there's a reason why i'm not in
policy because i i'm i like honesty and i like being direct and i can't can't deal with people who
try to tell me something by i don't know going around the issue and telling me something else
and with that i'm also very frustrated and i think honestly that this lying on a police
like lying on that level on an international level and with lying i'm also meaning that if you
like draw attention away from the truth or you hide some facts that should be really punishable
i think because it is misleading and it's hurting so many people i'm also hopeful because i've
actually met a few people that are active in policy and that have great ideas and that are
really really enthusiastic and engaged and try to protect others those who can't protect themselves
but of course i do see that we are not really getting closer to a solution right now and
i honestly don't know how to change that how to help that i think we if there are people out there
who know that their strength is to influence other people basically and to get them to
basically do what you want them to do then please use it for good that's what i'm asking you
i can only give you the facts but we see that delivering the facts is not enough right that's
what we've seen that that's not enough we kind of apparently need some kind of climate lobby
where we really say hey people this is what you have to do maybe we need effectivists instead
of activists so let me let me ask you a personal question um you're obviously very knowledgeable
and passionate about this topic as you should be because this is the topic of our times well one
of the the core ones anyways how do you manage um being all in as you clearly are on ocean issues
planetary boundaries where we're headed and then have a normal life and have a cheeseburger or
strudel or whatever whatever you eat there with your high school friends and and your family
how do you live in both worlds because i struggle uh to be honest in in in my life with with that
yeah i i do too and i guess um i mean i'm not completely sure what i'm leading a normal life
compared to everyone else so i would say that when i look along my amongst my friend most of them
basically support the same things i support so i'm really living in a little bit of a bubble
and most of them really try to be as sustainable as possible i think it would be difficult otherwise
it's something that i do see with family with i mean you don't choose your family right you
are born into it and there i'm having sometimes complicated or complicated discussions and sometimes
i just yeah decide not to discuss certain things and in other terms i mean i have to
admit say that this kind of is also affecting basically how i plan my life and i do see that
basically i would say the goals and dreams that my parents have given me and kind of saying hey
when you are i'm i'm 34 right now so i should probably have two kids a husband and a house
and um basically i i have a partner fiance i'm very happy with but um we never plan on getting a
house because it's not really i think realistic achievable for most people so i guess they're
of course but some people can have their own house in their own place but when we look at
the number of people we have on the planet our limited resources then not everyone can have
a house actually most people can't have their own house and it's also really when we think about
okay do we want or not have children do i want to put my children into this kind of world will
i be able to adequately protect them with what's coming in the future these are things i'm discussing
with my my partner and with my friends because it's yeah it's not just about what is my own happiness
basically and do i give on my genes to the next generation um we certainly know that in terms of
population um we don't need every one of us to get a child so we are enough people on the planet um
and of course in terms of resources not having a child is way smarter than having one which is
not saying that nobody should have children of course if you but it's something that i think
is in there i know of those things i know of the limited resources and i can't forget it
when i basically enter my private life what i learn or do do during my work time so i struggle as you
long ago i chose not to have children um genetic children uh you and i both have cultural children
in a way with the young people that we influence with these ideas and i have ducks and and dogs
which also eat resources but um that's the path i chose so um let me ask you one more scientific
question and then i'll get to the closing questions that i ask all my guests would it be fair for me
to say that this year will be the coolest year of the rest of my life on average of course there could
be El Nino and La Nina and other things but is that a fair assessment to make given what we know
about the inertia of the climate system? Sort of i mean you just chose basically an El Nino year
which of course we know is a global average a higher temperature so i very much hope that the
next two three four years will be on average a little bit cooler again but in terms of course
of the long-term trends yes so basically i wouldn't see like a large scale cooling signal is not
going to happen within the next decades even if we would stop all emissions right now so um yeah but
yeah thank you um that's my understanding as well but i wanted to back it up with a climate
scientist and i will have Johan uh your colleague on in the near future he was supposed to be on
tomorrow but uh we had to we had to reschedule it so uh Levkay i really um i really like you
and i respect what you're doing and i feel um the the passion and frustration bubbling just
under the surface because this isn't our fault what's happening but you and i were born um on
this planet as humans during this time of the carbon pulse and looking around us and figuring
it out um is someone's job and i'm and i'm glad that you're you're doing it so do you have any
personal advice you just mentioned about uh houses and children but do you have any personal advice
for the um listeners of this show that are hearing what you're saying and concerned about the future
what what sort of advice do you have uh for the listeners i would say on the one hand side kind
of be creative in your dream i kind of mentioned that we don't have to have the same goals in terms
of having or becoming rich having our own house or having to basically fly uh have a vacation
somewhere fancy tropical every year um because that's not doesn't tell you what makes you happy
so really like listen in your inner self basically what really does make you happy
because i think most of the stuff that makes you happy can be very sustainable and totally fine
and be done within the earth resources but then the other thing is i still believe and try to act
under the assumption that humans are good and that nobody really wants to be a bad person or
tries to harm others i mean there might be a few exceptions but i think um most people even if they
actually do something right now that is causing a lot of emissions and harm to the environment
they have a reason that can probably be understood by us because there is a reason in their reasoning
why they're doing this and why it's a good thing to do and so it would be good of course we have to
educate those people and we have to try to change them but we shouldn't um like make them to monsters
and we should act in the way saying hey okay i see what you're doing this is how it's like this how
why i don't like what you're doing because it's hurting this and this person can you explain
me why to me why we're doing it and maybe we can find a solution together so i think that's important
to to also just stay stay optimistic and to like life and also because i really believe it's true
so most people i talk to when they do something like how can you do that then they explain it to
me and like oh okay and now it makes sense but hey there's actually a different way of how you can
do this with this which is way better for the environment and for everyone and how would you
change that advice for the young people watching this show and their teens or 20s who are becoming
aware of all this and they have a whole lifetime ahead of them that's a very good question and um
i would say i'm not completely sure what i would say i would probably apologize for not
for not having taken better care of their world so far i mean and i'm still fairly young um i would
try to i would say be be bold basically just because you're young and it feels like you
might know less and that's something i experienced as actually as a scientist so i mean i'm talking
to colleagues who are have 20 or more years experience than i have in the topic and sometimes
still they i see that they make mistakes and uh it just takes me more longer to be brave about
that and say hey no i i'm studying this too and you might have more experience but i put a lot
of time in this and i know i'm right and i think that's also with the young people is when you feel
something is not right be brave about it be bold about it and change um and um otherwise probably
also be be hopeful find your own future but in general i have to say it does it's hard for me
it's hard for me to be like completely optimistic towards the person who has i don't know 70 80
year ahead of them because i know that life is going to change quite a bit during that time
so this is a question i ask all my guests and i think you may have subliminally through your
things that you've left unsaid have given the answer but what do you care most about in the
world lefke it's probably a fair and honest world so i i think that um this is what bugs me most
about i guess this topic is that the main people who are causing the problems are not the ones
that are suffering the most and um that's just not what i like so it's really the fairness
and the main uh non-humans are going to suffer as well that's a very good point yes yeah so if you
could wave a magic wand what is one thing you might do to change human and planetary futures if
there was no personal risk to yourself kind of depends on on the limit i mean if i could basically
change the climate system the earth system back to a pre-industrial state and fix it in that way
that no matter what we do we we couldn't change it as humans that would of course be a safe way
although maybe we wouldn't then learn i think if it comes to the human mind as i said i would
really like us to be able to make the advice's decision to be objective look at the facts and
then decide what we do based on them and what we want to happen and not based on this weird mix
of emotion fear maybe favors yeah so that i think would already bring us a very big step
further towards a sustainable future thank you um if i were to have you back on the show which
i would love to what is one topic uh in your broader work that um isn't a a broad overview
but is a very specific topic that you think is relevant to our future that you would be willing
to talk about in in depth the next time well given my my location better my job right now it would
really be about the link of the climate system towards the rest of the earth system towards uh
with the land system with um the species diversity and how all of this is basically connected but
from a scientific point of view so not from a like spherical point of view mother earth but really
we see so much scientific evidence for that and i would love to talk about that
excellent uh any closing words for our viewers and listeners levka i guess honestly if they
listened until this point then i would thank them for being so interested in the science um
because um yeah i know it's a complicated topic and i know that it's hard to understand and i mean
i've been doing this for 10 years nearly and um i'm still learning new stuff so yeah thank you for
your openness to learn about these things for your willingness hopefully to change um that
means a lot and that's i think what the world needs thank you so much for your time today levka
and for your important work on this issue uh to be continued my friend thank you nade
