Joining me today is Kim Stanley Robinson, a very well-known science fiction author.
I've long thought that we need to better communicate science to the general public,
but in a way that uses art and literature to be able to change the mental landscapes of an
individual human mind. Stan has been publishing science fiction novels for almost 40 years now.
He's a leading figure in climate fiction writing. Stan incorporates strong influences of ecological,
cultural, and political themes and features scientists as the heroes in his work.
Many of you have heard or read his most recent novel, Ministry for the Future,
which has been highly praised for the illumination of possible near-term climate impacts
and how imagining such an issue might change our responses to what we face. How can we incorporate
fiction into our set of tools to bring more people into awareness of the pressing system
dynamics that underpin global human events? This was a very interesting conversation.
I hope you enjoyed it. Please welcome Kim Stanley Robinson.
Hello, Stan. Hey there, Nate. Great to see you.
Yes, good to see you too. So you, let's dive right into it. I've long known of your name
because I've read some of your books long ago, but you've kind of been thrust into a broader
spotlight because of our cultural awareness of climate change and your recent very popular book
Ministry for the Future, which kind of took a view in the future of accelerating climate damage
to society. You've long been an environmentalist. How did you decide that fiction writing was the
way that you wanted to get involved and contribute to these issues?
Well, for me, the fiction writing came first. So the environmentalism came later. I was a reader
as a kid. I grew up in a suburbia in Southern California. I was a beach kid. I did love the
beach with all my heart, but I didn't think of it as anything but getting out of suburbia
into something more fun. And then I was an English major. I loved all literature, but
the novel sort of takes precedence in my reading life and in the world at large these days when
it comes to literature, maybe not compared to screenplays. Anyway, I got into science fiction
because it seemed like the best way of conveying the way my reality felt, which was Southern
California turning from orange grows into city extremely rapidly. And so science fiction
struck a chord with me and I wrote it. That's my start. And then I started going to this year
in Nevada when I was an undergraduate in college and that mountain consciousness was pretty
all-encompassing. It reoriented my lowland life to be always thinking about the mountains,
my love of the mountains, what did that mean? What were the threats involved? And I began to notice
that California in general is what you could seriously call a terraformed space. The water's
distributed by a natural means. It's an irrigated landscape. It's now urban, but also ag.
It made me pay attention. And then by that time, the environmental movement was really
an active thing in the world, pointing out the dangers that even preceded our awareness of climate
change. And then climate change was just the, how can you say it, the exponential growth of
an environmental consciousness. And it began to invade my science fiction. Anytime I set a story
in the next 100 years or two or almost anywhere, the climate and the environment were prominent
players in the story. So that's how it came about for me.
And what's been your experience? Have you found your works, your books to be effective in educating
or swaying people? No, not until the ministry for the future. I can say that my books were
considered, oh, well, you know, that's Stan. He's our Boy Scout. He's our nature guy. Science fiction
community likes to be ecumenical and welcoming to all kinds of viewpoints. And in the great
world of the science fiction community, it's a melting pot where no matter what your politics
or your interests, you can be taken in with open arms. So that was the attitude towards me. And in
the larger world, I had my readers, but and truthfully, I mean, to be more serious about it,
as time passed, it became obvious that I was a leading proponent of climate fiction, which was
near future science fiction, paying attention to the over determining reality of climate change.
So in other words, all nearest future science fiction had to turn into climate fiction to be at
all realistic or relevant. And so it wasn't just the ministry for the future itself, like
from zero to 60. But in a growing sense of where I was in the cultural conversation,
and New York 2140 was a big step in that way with its sea level rise and its climate finance.
Ministry still nevertheless has joined the or how can I say it? It's it's blown up my life,
but it's joined the world conversation in a way that none of my books ever have before.
So I wonder if you had written that exact same book 20 years ago, if it would have been far,
you know, equally well written, if it would have been far less well received, just because the
public awareness of climate still wasn't the way it is now where we have events and things
that people recognize are out of the normal. I think that can be that's almost certainly true.
Yes. And we have a small thought experiment that shows how true it is. I published 40 signs of rain
in I think 2004. And I want to say that 40 signs of rain is not as good a novel as ministry for
the future. It's confined to Washington DC to the National Science Foundation. It's an attempt to
go local. But because the local was Washington DC, that was its supposed international aspect,
you know, capital of the world and all that. But National Science Foundation is not a powerful
agency. It was a bit of a joke on my part. I struggled to convey Washington DC and the
federal bureaucracy in a novel. And my struggles were, I think, evident on the page. But it was
also 2004. And this was just an odd thing to be interested in then. And I must say Al Gore's
In Incommitent Truth came out almost the same week as my novel. And it did have an impact.
So that was partly Al Gore, partly a movie, partly a better demonstration of the severity,
the problem than my novel. Nevertheless, if I had, if the book I had put out then had been
ministry, it wouldn't have gotten the same attention that it got in 2020.
Just a brief personal question. Did you win like writing awards in your high school English
classes? And were you always like going home and writing short stories and stuff? Or is this
something that evolved into a passion and skill over time?
In high school, I loved Shakespeare and poetry and detective novels. And there weren't any prizes
to be had, except for one, my English teacher, Mrs. Catherine Lee, a sweetheart, a complete
anglophile, an elderly woman who seemed of a previous age to us, because I'm talking the
late 60s here. And she was probably had her looks and her mind formed in the 1930s. So she's
probably was quite a bit younger than I am now, but we considered her to be ancient. But she was
lovely. She paid attention. She liked it that I liked literature. We were like the two literature
lovers in the entirety of Orange County, as far as we could tell. And so she was fond of me.
It's amazing how high school memories like that are imprinted on our amygdala. My high school
English teacher Rita Mack, I specifically can see the pen writing blah, boring in writing on some
of my papers. So more broadly, you know, with writing and fiction, et cetera, how important do
you think art is, broadly speaking, versus science in our current kind of poly crisis situation?
It's a good question and a hard one. And I'm not
good at answering it because I'm kind of inside my own bubble looking out into the world from a
particular perspective. I'd say it's the sciences that are making all the stuff that keep us alive
and telling us how the world works. And this is the science dominated world or science created
world. But then science at its straightest, where it's really being honest with itself
and with everything else. And notice I'm personifying it, is modest in this way. It says,
we're learning about the world. We're creating some power over the world. We're not going to tell
you what to do with it. That's the job of everybody else. And so they give over many scientists will
just say, look, this is society's job, or this is the work for philosophy. And so there the arts
and humanities come in. What do we do with our new powers? How do we get along with each other?
These are not scientific questions. These are humanities questions. And so the arts can come
in to tell the story and to create a sense of meaning. And so that is important. It's vaguer
and it's and it's also like a giant echo chamber that we're all inside where everybody's yammering
not all at once. So in other words, it's quite incoherent. But it is important.
Well, I would argue that art is more important, but it has to be informed by the correct system
science. And a lot of our, like you said, everyone's kind of yammering in the same chamber. A core
message in ministry of the future is that civilization has to trust in science. But I
wonder what version of science, because economic, which in my opinion is not a science, is overlaid
on top of climate science and gives, in my opinion, quite inappropriate roadmaps of the
future. In effect, there are no integrated assessment models that show a decline in growth
from today to the year 2100. What do you think of that?
Well, I'm with you on that. I think economics is a quantified ethics or a power politics disguised
as a science. So it's an instrument of power to run some numbers and say, we'll do this because of
these reasons, because it makes economic sense. I would divide it, it is a social science and it
uses scientific tools. It could be more useful than it is. If you think of it as being something like
geometry where there are theorems, but the theorems are decided based on axioms,
then economics needs to go back to the axioms. What are we doing it for? If it's for human welfare
and also the welfare of the rest of the biosphere over the long haul, then those axioms would drive
the economic calculations and we would get different rubrics than profit or shareholder value,
which are ridiculous rubrics, gross domestic product, ridiculous. And even this word you use
growth when it's used in economics, its meanings are peculiar and various and unhelpful. We need
the poorest people on the planet to live at adequacy, so that's some kind of growth. We don't
need the richest people on the planet to get richer, which I have consistently since the 1980s,
but especially during the pandemic, where something like 70% of the quantitative easing value
created in the pandemic to keep the economy going was captured by the top 2% of wealthy people.
Well, not only that, I often ask what is the carbon footprint of quantitative easing,
something that people don't ask that question. True. Well, this is an economics question that
gets de-linked from physical systems questions like you ask, and so economics is ridiculous in
that sense also. It's not rating biosphere impacts, those were used to be negative externalities,
they weren't even included at all. Now they're attempting to include them, but things like the
discount rate or the various wiggles that currently enacted, which is to say legal and powerful
economic systems, they are still very poorly aligned to people on the planet. So it is something
that I talk about, and the fact the discussion of it in Ministry for the Future is one of the
reasons that the book has struck people's imagination, that economics could be changed,
that it could be aimed better, that it could be recalibrated, and that it could be
something like the carbon coin, which I would say is a kind of a symbol for power and money being
redirected to the public good and to biosphere health. Well, people were encouraged by that,
they were interested, they were thinking, oh, you know, it's possible to change.
That was one of my few criticisms or not criticisms, but points of interest in ministry
that you wrote about a pro-social, pro-environmental behavior that sequesters carbon would be rewarded
with a carbon coin. But I wondered, in such a society, if you do things and you're rewarded
with a carbon coin, then don't you in turn just go and spend it on other things that create or
contain indirect carbon? Yes, I think that's valid, and it is a problem. I guess I've been
thinking about this since you've communicated with me before this and pondering it, and I guess
I would say the book is a little cautious in that it tries to propose methods we could use
right now that are not completely shocking, that they're legal. You could imagine them getting
passed by central banks and legislatures, and so it's Keynesian. Keynesianism is not radical,
nor is it particularly biosphere-friendly. It is a standard economic system where the government
actually stimulates the economy in times of distress, like a depression, and that stimulus
is indeed what you're talking about. More carbon ultimately will be burned if carbon is,
if carbon burning is fundamental to the system working, then by keeping it healthy,
you're burning more carbon. Yes, but the carbon coin, if it's an adjusted right,
then you bring down a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere, hopefully the creation of
the, what can I say, the needs and the wants, the necessities and the toys will be more clean energy
created than they were before, so the decarbonization effort would extend to decarbonizing our energy
systems, our transport systems. All of those would receive carbon coins, and slowly but surely,
even though you might have a quite active and productive society and civilization and economic
system, it at least would be decarbonized. It wouldn't solve the other problems, and because
there's no single solution here, and indeed my novel talks a lot about biosphere corridors,
wildlife corridors, what now is being called the 30 by 30 plans, they weren't even quite being
discussed when I wrote the book in 2019, and yet now they're the law of the land because of this
Montreal Treaty and because of the Ocean Treaty. Well, this is astonishing rapid progress on that
front, and that's different than, that's different than economics, that's land use,
it has an economic aspect to it, but again it's part of, it's not exactly decarbonization,
except it does draw down carbon if you leave wild land alone, but it's more having to do with
biosphere health and having the wild animals not go extinct, so it is a big project.
Let me extend that a little bit. I would argue that decarbonization, the way it's being promoted
now is going to lead to a rematerialization, especially in the global south, and negative
impacts on global ecologies in the countries where there's going to be massive copper and
lithium and cobalt mining, etc. So I wonder if you extend the metaphor of the carbon coin
in your book to be an ecology coin, things that are not only optimized for climate, but
that are optimized for biosphere health, writ large, much wider boundary. I wonder if that would,
I mean part of the problem here is we're trying to optimize so many variables at once,
but what do you think about that, to extend it to a broader ecology coin?
Well, I've certainly heard about this since my book came out in ways that are super interesting.
There are people who are studying the fact that you can tell what's alive in a biome,
in a watershed, by taking a water sample out of its streams and testing for DNA, and those tests
have gotten so good and fine-tuned that you can tell everything that is alive in that watershed
and then you get a credit for it. Wait, you can just do a DNA test and it shows the species that
live in that watershed? Yes. I didn't know that. Well, it's the ETH, the Swiss Federal Institute
of Technology, is doing some work on this, and I can put you in contact with the people who are
both studying that, and also could that be turned into a form of credit for the people living in
that watershed? So this would be what you were describing, a kind of biosphere coin,
that you would get renumerated or you would get, instead of destroying your watershed,
extracting things and selling it for profit in the old economy, you would begin to be able to
make your living by taking care of your watershed and keeping a whole lot of creatures alive in it,
which you can prove they're alive by this water test of the DNA. Well, it's new and interesting.
I'm totally in favor, long term, of something like that, and all these discussions, I think there's
two questions. Where do we want to go and what's sustainable and how do we get there from here,
and those are two different questions. But if we could have people making a living
by doing things that are healthy for the ecology, isn't that a much better use of a Keynesian stimulus
than just supporting people to buy flat screen TVs and take junket trips or whatever it is,
just the consumption as usual? That's the cultural shift that I think could happen,
would be a fantasy to happen, but I'm hopeful for in coming decades.
Seems to me that what you're talking about is also that it's not economic, but it's more
experiential or philosophical or even a religious sensibility. In other words, what's life for?
Many of us, and the way that you live your life, to a certain extent the way I live my life,
although I'm a very conventional suburban guy still, but it's more interesting to do things
than it is to watch things being done. This, of course, is a stab to the heart of our current
cultural imaginary of social media and watching things on screens, a whole generational problem
of your smart form, your laptop screen, your big wall TV, watching things. And then other people
do them and you watch them. This is so sapping of human spirit. It's so passive and observational.
It's like a half-life. It's like a Philip K. Dick half-life. And many people
live it because they haven't figured out that even just taking a walk down the lane to the
local store would be more interesting than what they were doing. Or throwing pebbles at a bottle
on top of a fence top would be more interesting than these incredibly complicated computer games
being played on a flat screen. The third dimension, bodily life in the real world,
this is all more interesting than our artificial created advertising culture. So when people will
get that, how people will get that, whether that becomes a general sensibility, I don't know. To
me, it's as obvious as walking outdoors to other people, obviously not so much. So I don't know
exactly how to make that turn. One thing I'll say is that my books are always about people doing stuff
outdoors in the world. And maybe that's why my Washington D.C. novel was such a trial for me
and for its readers. There were too many meetings and offices. Didn't you write one of your recent
books like fully while you were outside? I think I heard that somewhere. Oh, that's true for my
last book since I finished that D.C. trilogy, starting with Galileo's Dream or even the last
book of my D.C. trilogy. But for sure, Galileo's Dream and every book since. So that's about seven
or eight books now I've written entirely outdoors. Now, I'm in California and in the winter I bundle
up, in the summer I put a mister on. It can be cold, it can be hot. I have a tarp overhead,
so the rain just falls around me when there is rain. And I work outdoors no matter what,
very stubbornly, because it turned my writing into a little outdoor adventure and it saved my
brain. I was a burned out case at that point and now I'm very energized. That's awesome.
So you are a very busy person, Stan. This podcast has been scheduled for four months.
After we hang up later, are you going to go outside and write? Are you writing a novel now?
I'm not writing a novel now and I'm antsy and feeling unhappy about it. But the ministry for
the future has kind of eaten my life and I'm currently like the cardboard cutout of the minister.
I mean, I do a lot of events like this and it's okay. I'm going to write a nonfiction book about
Antarctica. So I'm quite excited about that. Have you been there? I have. I've been twice.
So the first time was in 1995 and then I went again in 2016. I loved it. It was a big adventure.
A little strand of memoir will be in this book, just like in my Sierra book, where it was a big
strand. But in my Sierra book, I've been going to the Sierras for 50 years and I've only gone
twice. So that strand will be small. But there'll be history, geology, and a little bit more about
this future plan of slowing the glaciers down so that we save sea level. So in ministry, you
incorporate chapters from mostly unspecified, non-human, non-living perspectives. Why did you
decide to incorporate these different perspectives and what was your thought process
while writing them and trying to get into the mindset of these creatures or entities?
Well, thank you for that. I really enjoyed doing ministry as a kind of a miscellany, an anthology
of different styles and genres and modes and character types. So this is actor network theory
at a Brunelatour that our lives include very important contributions by creatures that aren't
human. The animals in your life, the microbiota inside your gut, these are actors in your
mentation and your life. And to write about that is a thing that literature ought to be doing
that it hasn't done enough of because it's somewhat of a new perception. So I was thoroughly enjoying
that and Anglo-Saxon literature can fit into one thick volume, all that we have left of it,
and about a third of that volume is riddles. So I enjoyed having riddles of, oh, well,
I am the thing that is always in control, but I never do anything. And so these riddle modes
were fun for me. I also very much enjoyed the eyewitness account, which I began to understand
as a new genre of its own that is not like fiction proper. The eyewitness account,
you're usually being interviewed. It's like 10 years later. You don't dramatize the scene. You
go really fast and you judge what happened, what it meant to you and your life, what it meant to
the world. So the eyewitness account is interesting and there are bundles of them. There are books
of all the things that women saw on their way on the Oregon Trail or all of the things that
happened in Germany in April of 1945 or the French Revolution, et cetera, et cetera. It's a mode of
history and when I realized I could do that for my future in ministry, it freed me up. And so
it's not just a photon or a carbon atom or the sun that I have speaking in the first person. It's
also individual humans that you never learn their name. They never come back again, but they tell you
something interesting that they saw and did and that for me was the key that turned the lock. I was
happy. So Stan, I recently did a podcast with climate modeling expert, Erica Thompson, where we
discussed the idea that models in general can go way beyond computer programings, including the form
of novels. So do you feel like the books that you write are a sort of mental model
of the potential futures that you see that allow a human, even if they don't know the science or
haven't taken a science course, it helps them construct a mental model?
Yes, absolutely. I often compare it to modeling exercises, but then what you would want is to
take the whole spread of science fiction stories and say each one is one run through from the
initial conditions to a different outcome like in any modeling exercise scenarios. It's good to
compare them to scenario building. And the thing I would say that the novel brings to it that the
others don't have and there are things the others have that novels don't. But what novels bring,
some people call thick texture. And I think it's also just a time involvement and a giving of,
a generous giving of time on the part of the reader who has to imagine those sentences on the page
into some kind of internal lived experience. That takes effort, that takes hours. And when
you're done, you feel like you've kind of lived it. If the novel has worked well, you feel like
you've been there, done that. It's a time travel, it's telepathy. It's quite a magical thing, but
it's all in the reader's head. And so it's a modeling exercise with some heft to it because
you've been there for a while and you've kind of lived it. So you've often spoken about narratives,
especially speculative fiction, as a powerful tool to envision positive change in the world.
However, and despite its transformative intentions, a lot of
cli-fi climate fiction so far has been dystopian. And there has been science showing that dystopia
tends to reinforce the resignation to negative events, climate catastrophe, etc. What are your
thoughts on that? I think that's right. And I think it's a really serious problem. I have become
anti-dystopian. As a utopian science fiction writer, I've always had to acknowledge that
these are two sides of a coin. Utopia dystopia, things could get better, things could get worse.
It's dialectical. They both have their value in imagining. They're like the modeling exercises
we just talked about. And you'd need negative models to convince you don't go that way. So
dystopia has always had its use. Susan famously, 1984, is a classic case of people saying they
didn't want to go to the land of Big Brother and false information, which maybe we've ended up at
anyway. But back to dystopias. There are now a kind of a comfort food. People read them or watch
them on TV in order to feel like superior. Like, well, things may be bad for me, but at least
they're not that bad. And so you come away from them comforted. Is that why the evening news at
6pm, they always lead with all these bad things happening in the world and my mom is obsessed
with watching the six o'clock news and it's all terrible? Because it makes them feel better about
their current situation? Yes, I worry about that. But also, if it bleeds, it leads. When it's TV news,
you need something that you can look at. So it can't be facts. It can't be a report. It has to
be visual and you have to have been able to capture it at that moment. So it's always the aftermath
of a crime, red lights, police tape, and a reporter outside going, oh, how horrible, look how horrible
this is. And it's simply a desire for visible drama, something that they can get on tape within the
day of what had happened or else it isn't news. So they're struck by a structural problem of the
you can't get visible evidence of the important things that happened that day. So they're stuck
with trivia. So the nexus of art and science on environmental catastrophe and risk to the future
is a really fine line, isn't it? Because we have to create mental models in people's minds about
the science of what is possible, but not so dystopian that they just check out. There's got to be
avenues for personal and cultural response. I think it's like what you say. And I think it's,
I call it a tightrope walk. You have to convince people to walk the tightrope with you of not
falling off on either side. If you pay, if you point out the danger that we're in, which is severe,
and existential, you know, breaking planetary boundaries, causing a runaway hot house earth,
this is a mass extinction event. This is as bad as it could get. So on the other hand,
powers of people, of society, of science, in theory, if we got to act together,
a kind of a golden age, certainly the, we have the tools and capacities to solve these problems
and get into a good space. And so that's the other side of the tightrope falling off is to say,
oh, well, that's going to be okay. What gets called cruel optimism, where you just shrug
and say, look, the experts will take care of this. I'm living my life. I don't need to worry about
this. And indeed, you don't need to worry either way. If the world is going to hell in a hand basket,
then there's nothing you can do about it. If the world is headed towards utopia,
then you don't need to do anything about it. So the tightrope walk is very,
it's very narrow. It really is a tightrope that you have to stay a balance on it and say,
the situation is dangerous. There are things we can do and must do. And that's the line you have to
hold to. In your book, Ministry for the Future, one of the beginning premises was that millions
of people in the subcontinent of India died because of higher wet bulb combination of
temperature and humidity. How much of that wet bulb India framing was science fiction?
And how much of it is what you, Kim Stanley Robinson, actually believe about the future?
Well, I'm terrified that it could happen. That is one of the main reasons I wrote
Ministry for the Future was reading about the wet bulb 35 limit of human endurance,
which I read about in about 2017. And it wasn't that it was a new fact. It was that the scientific
and medical communities had kind of combined. People in the climate community had been saying
temperatures could get this high and people in the medical community were pointing out,
that would kill a person if you weren't in air conditioning, because we're not good at,
we need to sweat off excess heat as bodily creatures. And that works in dry heat. In wet
heat, it works far less well. And at wet bulb 35, which is, as you said, an index of heat and
humidity in combination, then you died within several hours, whether or not you are in the
shade or not, whether you have a fan on you or not, because sweating stops working at wet bulb
35 in a way that you overheat internally. And hyperthermia will kill you just as fast as hypothermia.
This was news to me. And when I read it, I thought the idea that humans could adapt to anything
is a false one. And this was a thought that was out there in the culture that, oh, humans are so
adaptable, we'll just adapt to higher temperatures. Why are people so worried? This is sort of the
view of what was called for a while the eco modernists, that essentially we're adaptable,
we can solve any problems, quit worrying so much about the carbon burn and a global average
temperature rise of four degrees Celsius. Big deal. Well, that turned out to be wrong. That's
flatly wrong. And they don't say that anymore. And that's partly because of ministry for the future.
I just put it out there that the news, the real news is that will kill us and vast swaths of the
world, including the American Southeast and the Midwest. I know where you live. One of the
hottest wet bulb temperatures ever recorded was right outside Chicago in the early 1990s.
And it was one of those flukes that happened, but it goes to show that anywhere because it was so
humid. Yeah, it was humid heat. It was like a wet bulb 32 or even wet bulb 34 for a couple hours.
And well, a functioning electricity system will allow you to get shelter in air conditioning.
You can save your life. But when the grid goes down and you don't have air conditioning,
then you'd be doomed. And that's sort of why I put it in India. That's a place that's going
to be very susceptible to these temperatures. It's got a weaker power grid that fails often.
And that was that combination was what I wanted to indicate could be deadly soon. And so this
isn't a real fear that I think a lot of people have if they're paying attention. It's we are
having heat waves. People are dying in them. I was in a wet bulb 31 in India last April,
and I was interested because of having written my book, maybe interest is too weak of a word.
I was highly apprehensive. And it turned out it was no worse than a than a day in in Washington,
D.C. You know, Washington D.C. during a hot summer's day, steamy heat, it will it will cook you up
quickly. And this day was no worse than that because it wasn't wet bulb 35. But we could get
to that soon. So you know, this is a case of starting with dystopia of starting a novel with
something happening so horrible that it gets the world's attention. What I'm hoping is that
since we know it can happen, we'll act before we have the disaster.
Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. But that would be like a whole other podcast, because I
think we there's a systems challenge that we have and climate is but one of the risks that we face.
And it's downstream of our culture, optimizing for profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon.
And so I personally don't think we are going to, we will see foresee unless something radical
happens. But I think to see is pretty baked in the cake. And that's going to be bad enough.
But we're going to have many other dystopian aspects to our future than just climate. So let me ask
you a hard question, maybe, what I'm really interested to see how you will respond is science
fiction, not just your writing, but science fiction writ large, inherently techno optimistic,
colonizing space and these things to me seem energy and ecology blind from a biophysical
perspective. So I suppose books about an Earth Trek future where humans are using 80% less
material throughput, and it's a tougher material existence, but perhaps greater spiritual pursuits.
That sort of book wouldn't actually be in the sci fi genre, it would be in something else.
But do you have any thoughts on that?
No, that would be a science fiction story. And it's a good one. I'm going to make a simple cut
and say science fiction is any story you set in the future. So UN demographers, stock forecasters,
everybody that pitches their story into the future and says this is going to happen,
they don't know that the future is unknowable. So they're doing a science fiction story often.
It's disguised as nonfiction or as futurology or business prediction. It's often a scam
because anybody who claims to know what the future is bringing is making a false claim,
so you have to be suspicious of it. And one thing science fiction does it says,
look, this is a fiction, I'm making this up, but it's interesting anyway. And so if you put a story
out like yours, this is a good sign. It's a form of utopian science fiction. Things could be better
for these reasons. And that's the kind of science fiction I write all the time. I would agree with
you. The dream of space, I've written about this often, and I talk about the solar system as our
planetary neighborhood and actually amenable to human visitation in person, which would be more
or less interesting depending, not that interesting, like going to Antarctica, useful, interesting,
but not transformative. The dream of going to the stars is a fantasy, a false dream that's
impossible. I wrote about this in Aurora. It made myself very unpopular with the people who write
space fiction, because I said, look, it's a great story space, like Middle Earth is a great story
space, but it's not real. We're not going there. It's too far away. Humans co-evolve with Earth.
We are stuck with Earth. That is not a bad thing. That is just part of being part of a planet.
Planetary consciousness is very important. And you no more should complain about that than you would
complain that you don't live on the inside of the sun or you're not an angel or you're not an ant or
something. You're a human on planet Earth and you're a planetary creature. There's an interesting
side case to be made that Mars, if we were to be in a good balance with Earth biosphere and a stable
civilization, Mars could become an interesting scientific station, blah, blah. That's a separate
and side issue. A kind of a random case. You can't see the same thing about Venus, for instance,
or the surface of Jupiter, but Mars, you could land on it. You could live on it. You could set up a
little space station there. A few people could live on it. A few people, like Antarctica today.
The best analogy for Mars is Antarctica, which we're there and nobody cares.
And to me, it's Stephen, a very smart and famous people. Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, among them
kind of say, we're screwing up Earth. Climate's going to be bad. We need to colonize outer space
and head to Mars. And that makes just zero sense to me because on the worst thermonuclear
runaway climate scenario, Earth is still going to be a paradise next to Mars.
I agree with you completely. That is a case that has to be made. And the thing about people
like Hawking's, the thing about people like Elon Musk is they're smart. They aren't that smart. They
aren't wise. They aren't philosophers. And they are not ecologists. Very often physicists will
assume that ecology is just physics in action and that they've got it all sussed out because
they know the rules of physics and they can do rocketry. But you can't do plant biology just
knowing rocketry. It's more complex. It's more interconnected. It's a more complex science.
And many physicists will arrogantly say that because I know the laws of physics, I know everything,
but they don't know how Mars works. They haven't studied biology enough to understand their own
ignorance. So how smart are you if you don't know how ignorant you are?
Homo sapiens, we have not yet lived up to our moniker. I think we've been more clever man than
wise man. Homo Faber. Homo Faber, humans, the makers, that's to me the best name. We do make things
and it's a real skill. So do you think, you know, in your writing you've often advocated for
a rewilding of Earth? Kind of, I assume you're aware of Yale Wilson's notion of half Earth as one
of the key solutions to the future. Is this possible? Are there any signs that we could
eventually do this in coming decades? Yes, I think there is. I love Yale Wilson and his
biofilia. He's a very important public intellectual and philosopher, recently deceased, but I honor
his memory and he will be remembered like Ben Franklin or William James as an important American
thinker. And half Earth was crucial when it came out, but I thought it was quite utopian. And now
we already have 30 by 30. All the nations on Earth have agreed to keep 30% of their lands wild by
the year 2030. China forced that deal through, which is super interesting. And now we have the
same thing for the oceans, just completed after 10 years of negotiation. These are super hopeful
signs that are under reported in the news because people don't get it because they are indeed living
inside their social media and their laptops. So if you spent time outdoors, you would realize
that if 30% of the Earth's surface was left to the wild creatures and they became healthy by that.
And I'm told by the woman who runs the 30 by 30 program in California, which is a formal
state program, that we're at 24%. And that everybody in that pursuit talks about 30 by 30,
then 50 by 50, which would be the half Earth project by the year 2050. And yes, humans can indeed
do their agriculture and compress into the cities, which young people want to anyway,
you wouldn't have to force the issue. Organize our management of the landscapes in ways that don't
mean pure wilderness like humans never get to go here. That would be unusual in the extreme.
But land use that opens up the land to the wild animals and they get to live their lives
unencumbered by us. And then we live on the other 50% in ways that are intelligently managed
in biosphere sense. So we're helping also even on the land that we're on. Well, this is the plan.
It's maybe the most important part of the plan going forward, although you want to have a way
to pay for it, etc. I hope that can happen. Even if it were to happen, though,
it really isn't 30 or 50, because the 30 or 50 assumes that everything else in the biosphere
is constant. And we know that the climate and other biogeochemical feedbacks are going to
accelerate. So that 30% of ecosystems, what it supports today, 20, 30 years from now,
climate will have an impact on it, obviously. Yeah, it's true. I think you're just pointing
out realities here that everybody ought to know. For that reason, there are some wildlife
ecologists and conservation biologists talking about making sure these corridors we establish
for the wild creatures have room for them, the migrate northward in the northern hemisphere,
to get away from the heat. And you mentioned the inevitability, almost, of us creating a two-degree
Celsius rise in average temperature. That's looking very, very likely, as you know. That's
why you said it. So I'm saying that means we're going to have to suck down a lot of CO2 out of
the atmosphere. That's going to be a project. Regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and even
mechanical vacuum cleaners sucking it out of the air. Everything is going to have to be applied
to get us back down to, I don't know, 350 parts per million. It makes sense. I mean,
there's a reason Bill McKibben chose it as the name of his organization. We could do it
if we don't have a runaway that blows out our abilities to do it. Well, we could do it.
Stan, I don't think you've watched much of my material because you're so busy and we just
recently met. But one of my recent framings is I call it Mordor or the Great Simplification.
The Great Simplification is when we can no longer kick the can financially and the amount of
financial claims we've created crash down in our snapping rubber band to our biophysical reality,
which means a smaller economy and smaller emissions going forward. On the other hand,
if we are able to do more carbon finance trickery and quantitative easing number nine or whatever,
we'll continue to grow the gross amount of energy that the world uses which results in GDP.
But the net amount of energy that goes to hospitals and science fiction books
and Disneyland and shopping centers, that is going to be more and more directed towards the
energy and mining sector itself. They're going to need to use more to get the lower quality
resources and the mechanical vacuum cleaners and things like that that take care of our
environmental waste. So a much larger percentage of GDP will go to energy and environmental
remediation. So in that scenario, the rest of the economy gets priced out a little bit.
And so if we're going to get down to 350, if that were to be a cultural objective,
which I am skeptical on, we would have to give up a lot of other things in order to make that the
primary focus. Yes? Maybe. I take your point. It makes sense. I am interested in the people
who are talking about things like regenerative agriculture that we could both grow our food
and capture more carbon in the soil that we grow our food in. So we have more biosphere health,
as much food, and more CO2 sucked out of the atmosphere all at once. I'm always looking to
these multiple goods where we need food, but we also need less CO2 in the atmosphere if we
can do both at once, which is a technique and agriculture is a science and a technique that
people spend a whole lot of time studying that that right now in the fields of America, especially
corn and soy, the carbon in the soil by weight is down to about 1%. And it could be that with some
changes to agricultural methods, we could begin to draw down and it tops out pretty quickly.
You can't get more than 3% or 4% of carbon by weight in the soil before you have kind of topped
out that soil. It's not an infinite bank, but it's so much soil. So if we like just hypothetically,
if we went from 1% carbon by weight in the soil to 3% globally, just hypothetically,
what would that do to drawing down the carbon roughly? Do you have any idea?
Well, it's incredible. And yet it's apparently true that that is enough carbon to that's as much
carbon as we've burned out into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution began.
Really? So yes, it's an enormous sink. Now, I mean, I'm told this by people who are studying it.
I am still a science fiction writer. I'm a reporter, but I'm telling you, there are people who say this.
Well, I'm actually a lot more sanguine about regenerative agriculture than the mechanized
vacuum cleaners. So I'm, if you have any world expert on regenerative agriculture,
you could introduce me to, and I could take a deep dive on that publicly on a podcast. I would
welcome that. What are your thoughts on? I can do that. I've just run into those people. I am
going to write that down. Okay, awesome. Thank you. What are your thoughts on geoengineering?
Will we eventually be faced with the obvious, oh my God, look at what's happening with climate,
and we'll have to try it. Are you morally against it? Are you hopeful of some of the
science there? Or what do you think? I think it might be a break glass in case of emergency type
operation. I am not morally against it. We've already geoengineered this earth to within
an inch of its life. That's called climate change and biosphere collapse. Civilization has been
geoengineering all along. Right to the beginning of burning down Australia when humans first arrived
there, et cetera. So it's an old practice. Now, if we needed to do it because people were dying
all over the tropics because of wet bulb 35 temperatures happening all the time,
then this thing people talk about of casting dust into the atmosphere and
imitating a penitubo type volcanic eruption, dropping worldwide temperatures for a degree or
two for five years after which the dust falls back to the ground. I think the real issues there
are governance issues. How do we decide to do it? How do we get public buy-in? It doesn't look like
some weird Dr. Strange-Levy and type experiment with the earth itself. We've already been
experimenting with the earth itself in ridiculously bad ways and a lot of times in ignorance of what
we were doing. This would be being done on purpose in full knowledge of what we were doing.
I think we should study it. I think we should discuss the governance of it. There are also
more, what can I say, less alarming versions of geoengineering. For instance, if you slow down
the glaciers in Antarctica, you can call that geoengineering, but there are no negative side
effects that I know of. Then there are people talking about the whales that when we killed off
95% of the whales on this planet, we wrecked the oceans biopump, which is also a nice carbon drawdown
mechanism. That replacing the whales, and since you can't just replace whales, you can replace
whale poop, which is a chemical formulation, a kind of living bio excrement of whales
dropped into the ocean, would create the same biospheric conditions that existed before we
wrecked it. This would also be geoengineering in a peculiar way and is being discussed. The topic
is huge, and I don't want to go into all of the rabbit holes involved there, but I certainly think
that it's something that people should be able to talk about it without a sense of shock and awe,
or, oh my God, there are some things man was not meant to know type mentality. We're far past that.
We are in an emergency situation, and certain emergency gestures may become necessary that
we don't get a runaway into a hot house earth, which could happen.
Do you ever get the sense, or just this like deja vu weird sense looking at the news and looking
around the world, that we are living a science fiction novel reality that none of you writers
could have imagined 20 or 30 years ago. Every day there's just crazy stuff happening left,
right and center. It's almost like the Twilight Zone. This is like a real Twilight Zone meets
reality TV, our lives. Well, yes, I've been saying this for about 25 years. We are in a science fiction
novel that we are all co-authoring together. What I mean is the future is crashing us, that there's
the great acceleration has accelerated yet again, and everything's happening faster than we can come
to grips with. And that's what a science fiction novel is trying to capture is that feeling.
So for sure. But what you would want, although Twilight Zone was a great show,
you would want something more like, I don't know, Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispissed, which actually
is very troubled and filled with revolutions and conflict. So it's not like you're going to dodge
revolutions and conflict here because we're in the midst of it. It's a very
melodramatic science fiction novel that we're caught in the middle of and we just have to try
to write it towards Utopia. I actually posted on Twitter a month ago that my entire life is filled
with nonfiction and I needed some fiction recommendations and I had a thousand replies
and Ursula K. Le Guin's Dispissed was like among the most popular ones. So I just bought it. I have
it outside. I've not read it. So are all those books behind you? Are those all science fiction
books? No, this is a nonfiction shelf. I keep John Muir. This is accidental, but I have a full
shelf of John Muir and then a full shelf of California nonfiction and the top shelf is
Antarctica. I see a really long shelf of Antarctica. That might be the 90% of
anarchic literature right there. So just out of curiosity, how many hours a week do you spend
reading? Oh, well, a lot. I read nonfiction by day and I treat it instrumentally. I almost
strip mind my nonfiction to get what I need for my fiction. So I read nonfiction all day
but I'm writing also. I reckon it must add up to a couple three hours of reading per day
of nonfiction and then every night when I go to bed, I read fiction for about a half hour
or an hour. It depends on how long I can stay awake. But I'm always reading a novel and when
I finish one, I start another one and I love it. I love reading fiction. Reading nonfiction,
I don't love, but it's important. It's part of my work. It's good literary hygiene that you've
described two hours of nonfiction, a half hour of fiction before bed. Yeah, yeah. And I must say
read a novel when you go to bed and you'll be absorbed, you'll fall asleep in a different world,
you'll live that life. It will be the best part of your day or let's put it this way,
you'll look forward to it every day. Oh, good. Now I get to dive into like right now I'm reading
the ragged, trousered philanthropists, a British working class novel from about 1904, very funky,
very serious, very sad, very intense, working class life when you were in the precariat.
Precarity really means it when you're going to die if you lose your job and your family too.
And then I'm also reading Freddie the Pig and the baseball team from Mars, a children's book that I
read when I was a child. Obviously, it had a big impact on me since I still play softball and I
still write about Mars. And then sort of lighten the load. I usually just read one novel at a time
to tell you the truth. I think that's the best way you join that world. But in this case, I'm
kind of lightening the load of the ragged, trousered philanthropists. Well, lightening the load is part
of the recipe to remain sane in these times because you and I in the stories we're trying to
share with society, this stuff can get toxic reading and learning. Like you said a few years ago,
you learned about wet bulb 35. I just learned about that two years ago. And you just add these
things and the human physiology and our genome didn't evolve to handle this much toxic information
about our world. So we need antidotes. I have dogs and I live in a forest, but I also like
fiction reading as well. Well, I think that what I read about you before we got on this podcast,
that this that you figured it out, that you're living on the land, you're paying attention to
a particular piece of land and you've got other animals, companion species that you're taking
care of and helping and they're helping and teaching you things to you as an animal, that this
is what everybody, if everybody had it figured out to that extent, and even you can live a life
in an apartment in Manhattan that includes these things if you've got it figured out in the first
place. So it's really a matter of understanding what we are and then adapting, living your life to
accommodate what we really are, which is animals and social primates and all the things that we
obviously are. The more you embrace that and and live it, rather than sitting on your butt
looking at screens all day, every day, that will drive you mad. And so we live in a culture that's
slightly mad. I agree. Thank you for that. I'm not sure I have it all figured out and I do still
need to read the equivalent of Freddie the pig at night. So key question here, climate,
and to a lesser extent biodiversity and PFAS and endocrine disruptors and all these other things,
are becoming more aware and teenage humans are coming into learning about the world and learning
all this stuff. And I've taught a college course for eight of the last 10 years. In my experience,
there's a lot of scary material at the, you know, I don't know how many tens of thousands of climate
courses there are in high school and college, but worldwide. And there's scary material. This is
what's happening in the climate. These are the scenarios. This is what's going to happen in the
21st century. But there's kind of too narrow a solution set. Just at the end of the semester,
it's well, we switch to renewables, you drive an EV, or we end capitalism. But do you think
that we're approaching a time when there could be more systemic story and recommendations to
young people that involves behavior change from within, like being happy with social, natural,
human capital rather than financial status? You know, what are your thoughts on this? Are we
are we approaching young people with the right message on all these systemic crises?
I don't know. It's a good question. It speaks to what Raymond Williams called a structure of
feeling that a civilization has a structure of feeling that is cultural. It's not biological.
And it, and it changes over time at different historical moments. I think actually of the
list that you made ending capitalism, if young people are being talked to about that, that would
be crucial. I don't think they are. They live in capitalist realism where they're going to be told
typically nothing can ever change. This is the system you have to plug into it. The system is
unchangeable. And that's not true. The system is changeable and has to change because biosphere
reality is forcing change. So may they might be aware that change is coming fast and it isn't
planned and it's going to be incomprehensible. I see a lot of climate dread, a lot of anxiety
of young people, a sense that, well, we're doomed but ready. And no matter what we do,
we're just on a downhill slide into chaos and disorder, which is not an inaccurate assessment
of the way things feel for sure. And you can't change the feeling just by pushing a button
or saying some magic words. You actually have to change the political economy that you're in
to one that's more life positive. So ending capitalism would be one big, I mean,
geez, when you say it, it's just so radical. I would say now reforming capitalism extremely
rapidly to getting to something that is more like cooperatives. It is post-capitalism in its first
step. That would be a big step and we aren't really there but we're trembling on the brink.
I think also there was a world order working in the neoliberal times, say the 1990s, that
isn't working anymore because it doesn't take into account the biosphere or what we really are as
creatures. And yet there's now 8 billion of us. So the old system isn't working. The new system
hasn't yet been invented. This is often talked about. The in-between, the inter-agnum between one
system and the other, it feels frightening because you can't, despite me being a science fiction
writer, what I can say from that is you can't see the future. You can't predict the future.
There's too many factors and it's changing too fast. So I mean, there's reason for everybody to
feel anxiety and climate dread but what you can do and say to the young people is solutions are
out there. Let's make the solutions happen. Let's work together on the solutions. You'll be one
little brick and a giant wall but the wall is possible. We can build that wall and you put
your brick into place and you'll be part of that historical wave, that movement that changed
this generation is tasked with a really heavy task to dodge a mass extinction event
that previous generations started mostly by accident. Well, tough assignment and people
will be freaking out the entire time and even fighting against you the entire time. So it couldn't
be weirder, harder and all you can do is try to call out for solidarity, put your shoulder to the
wheel and fight the good fight anyway. So do you ever speak to younger audiences in addition to
your activist message that you just described? What sort of advice do you give to teenage humans who
are old enough to intellectually understand this stuff but not yet sucked into the consumptive
vortex of modern society? Do you have personal advice to young teenage or early 20 humans?
Yes, I talk to all the schools in Davis on a regular basis because I have teacher friends who
asked me to come by and in Davis it's easy and then I talk to college students all over the world
in literally the case and they're young enough that they're forming their ideologies, they're
figuring out their ways in life, they're thinking about what they're going to do with their lives
and they're very active and open-minded. That's the crowd to talk to I think and it's a privilege
to talk to them, I try to learn from them and listen to them as much as I can and what I just say to
them is no matter what you're interested in and you can follow your interests, follow your nose,
I'm interested in art, I'm interested in engineering, I'm interested in plant biology and why bugs eat
plants and why plants are protected from bugs, whatever you're interested in it's a climate
change project now. You can be anything, a sculptor or an accountant, someone measuring things
and engineering for sure, well it's going to be climate change work, there will be work for you
that's good work and here's how I try to encourage them. When I was in younger middle age there was
a joke, the one who dies with the most toys wins, it was a bumper sticker and it was making fun of
and expressing the meaningless cynicism of middle-class American society circa 1990, it was an 80s thing,
a 90s thing, people were worried, the capitalist wheel of birth and death, you work all your life
then you die, nothing matters, I mean what's the point here, so this is what the bumper sticker was
making a joke about, whoever dies with the most toys wins, obviously stupid, absurd, a lack of
meaning and this was the problem. Well now I can say to young people, your life has meaning,
we are in a crisis, everything you do can actually fight for the people of the future,
it's a cause and so life has meaning, it may be a rather scary and desperate meaning but it's better
than no meaning at all, which was the previous problem that's completely gone away, so sometimes
I try to cheer them up, you know you're lucky to have climate change because otherwise you'd be in
an existential despair because capitalist reality is totally stupid and you've got to get past that.
Yeah two comments there, first I remember seeing that bumper sticker, I didn't know it was a joke,
I thought people actually believed that, I didn't know and secondly yeah, I've heard this from a
lot of my students and colleagues, we have a lack of meaning in our culture right now,
you know kind of the theology of past religions and then the theology of economic growth
are waning and what is it all for, what is our purpose and what other purpose can there be
in my opinion than the viability of the ecosystems on our planet for the long term,
to me it all comes back to that and climate's a piece of that but it's not the only piece.
It's not the only piece, yeah, so you're living in Wisconsin and it's a Wisconsin guy,
Aldo Leopold, what's good is what's good for the land, well this is a very powerful statement,
very powerful, it's a philosophy, it's a religion and when he said the land I think he means all
the living things that make up the land of course, it's easily understood and it's incredibly powerful
as an ethos but also as a decider, you can say well what's good, I mean you've got your opinion,
I've got my opinion, you can't determine it but what's good is what's good for the land
because that's what'll be passed on to the other animals and to the generations to come so
the Leopoldian land ethic as it's called in ethics and philosophy classes,
an ecology classes, this is a very, very high statement of how you can,
in a single phrase, you can make up a new religion that makes sense.
I love that, in my job now I'm non-ideological because I'm trying to unite many different groups
of humans towards a common path that's going to face all of us so I'm apolitical but if I do have
an ideology, it's what you just said, it's that I deeply care about the ecosystems and other
species and irrespective of everything else that I write and speak about at the end of the day,
that is something that I have no shame to tell at the rooftops to any political group or age group
or that's what really matters during our times right now. I'll just throw that back at you
intendedly, what do you care most about in the world? I mean you're a very accomplished
author and activist but at the end of the day, I think I could probably guess but I'll ask you
anyways because I ask all my guests, what do you care most about in the world Stan?
Well I'm just like everybody else, the answers are immediate and instinctive, I care about my
family, my friends, my community, that I care about animals in a way that I didn't when I was
younger, I just recently went to India for the first time and what I noted immediately was they
live their lives with animals still as part of daily town life in a way that's incredibly beautiful
and inspiring but maybe I'll turn it back and I just want to say that an ideology is the imaginary
relationship to the real situation and therefore everybody has one and has to have one, if you
don't have one that would be a mental disability quite severe so we all have that imaginative
relationship to the real conditions of existence which is what an ideology is so you have one too
and that translates to a politics which you have one too, it can be ecumenical, it can be
directed to a particular kind of point that tries to transcend stupid partisan divides
in the current mediated American landscape or older visions of left and right etc etc etc
sure those are deserved to be transcended in some kind of biophilia, some kind of land ethic, we'll
do this for the good of our land in the local area, all the creatures on it including the humans and
that will be you know that's a little vague it's more like a religion than a politics but it can go
to a politics yeah there we go we are looking at biophilia by Edward Wilson, beautiful concept
yeah I have almost all those books and I agree with what you said earlier
um what uh well actually I wonder if I have uh well he oh yeah here I have this book
the super organism by Yeo Wilson I wrote an academic paper about the super organism
which I'll send to you so um in all of your travels and your lectures to young people and
your work what things have you noticed or experienced in the last couple years since
ministry came out that really give you hope and motivation about coming decades despite all the
craziness in the Twilight Zone-esque sci-fi world we're living in? Well it's a little um technical
but it's true I've been encouraged by the 30 by 30 movements and the COP 15 the biosphere
treaty in Montreal that the Chinese hosted with the Canadians last year astonishing the ocean
treaty just signed astonishing these are big victories and even though they're just promises
that nation states make to each other in other words they can be broken by other people later on
those promises matter because it's a putting forth of uh statements of intent and that these
things are important I learned that there's a network for greening the financial system that is
owned and operated by and and joined by about 90 of the biggest central banks on earth including the
super big ones out of the G7 and the G20 although central banks are trying to green the
financial system such that that sounds like an oxymoron to me well but but that that's uh that
would be bad if it was an oxymoron you want to correct that um the um money needs to be spent
which is to say human labor needs to be expended and you have to be able to make your living
doing good biosphere work rather than bad biosphere oh so this gets back to the ecology coin
we talked about earlier something like that yeah yeah and and uh you can look it up the network
for greening the financial system has a website it has a white paper with nine suggestions they
they're pretty technical like two of them I don't even understand um but what they're really saying
is that money itself is a political act the and the fact that everybody believes in money
and you can go down and stick a piece of plastic into a slot and then someone will give you a cup
of coffee so that's that kind of belief is very deep and cooperative belief in money if money itself
was greened at the roots and is being made up at its very start by central banks and this is fiat
money in other words the u.s. dollar being spent on green projects first and then circulating in
the general economy of that itself might drive a lot of restoration actions and might
allow us to dodge the mass extinction event so I will look into that I think I at least partially
agree with that but with a big old asterisk stand which is as long as we have GDP as our global
cultural goal we will burn more energy and consume more stuff and if we get more efficient we're just
going to burn more so if we have a an overlay in there of green of where the money goes into
something green first I have to think about how that would work no and no I take your point and
both of the things you said are right GDP is wrong um it is a rubric an index and a way of
measuring human civilization that is flatly wrong and destructive and so growth of which is usually
a shorthand for growth of GDP that's a growth of destruction and is like a cancer so human
development index gross national happiness this is a butanese thing other indexes that rate the
human economic efforts by a different set of standards these are crucial that's a crucial part
of the work so if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your actions
what is one thing that you would do to improve human and planetary futures and as a science
fiction author I'm imagine you have dozens of such ideas I don't know I I I mean it all it sounds
so instrumentalist or technical and maybe I should put it at the level of the structure of feeling
like you've been talking about a different attitude towards life I mean some of it is
absolutely simplistic if people would spend more time outdoors it would reorient their
sense of reality in fundamental ways that changes the view of everything we spend too much time
indoors we live in boxes looking at boxes this is silly stuff and it's distorting our sense of
what's real and what's important so I mean that's a little simple you could also go technical like I
have been in most of this talk if fiat money was created with a good green spending of it first
off the bat then many other things would be better 30 by 30 if I could if I could instantly say that
50% of the earth and the ocean were left to the other animals and that we concentrated our
activities on 50% of the earth and 50% of the oceans if if I could wave that magic wand and
here's the thing people are already waving it the 30 by 30 thing is profound when I first read the
eel wilson book half earth I thought beautiful idea will never happen and here 20 years later
it's happening well I'm stunned and now it's worth following for a second why is that happening
I think everybody at the level of decision-making and policy and also all well-meaning citizens
who understand that their lives depend on science and what they're scared for their lives they run
to a scientist which is to say their doctor they looked at the evidence they've taken it in they've
realized we're in a biosphere emergency and that civilization will crash if the biosphere crashes
and we've only got 1015 years to cope with it but it's better than having only one week to cope
with it which we couldn't do and it's better than having 500 years to cope with it because we wouldn't
pay attention so we're in an emergency and people are acting like it but it's an actionable
emergency space in other words we've got this 10 or 15 years and I think the good things are
happening because there are so many people who actually know this now and they are doing something
about it. So last just personal question how many hours a day you live in California so
that's different than Wisconsin but how many hours a day do you actually spend outside
and how is that different from 10 or 15 years ago? Well because I moved my writing life outdoors
and my recreational life which is you know an hour of throwing frisbee golf at a running pace
with my friend and going for a walk with my wife I'm calculating here as I talk
and you can well you can't see it in this morning light my poor skin is taking a hit from all this
outdoorsness I should use sunscreen it's probably I'm outdoors about eight hours a day. Awesome
and is that an increase from 15 20 years ago? Yeah but that's a simple structural change I
started writing outdoors rather than indoors and so that's five hours a day. Yeah awesome
Stan this has been great thank you so much for your mental neuronal connections that end up creating
new mental imagery and connections in other humans it's an art and a skill and a gift
and I hope you have a great next novel in mind and we'll have another conversation.
Well thank you Nate it's been a pleasure and I might not have another novel for a long time
but it's okay I am I'm doing other things I've had an awfully long writing career and so if I get
a few years off to kind of reorganize my poor brain that's probably a good thing too so I'll
do having fun. Yeah thanks Stan.
