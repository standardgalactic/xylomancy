At the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individual's fault that
we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you were born in
to contribute towards responding. So I would love to see older generations firstly stop saying
that it's down to our generation. Secondly stops having conversations about these topics in closed
rooms amongst academic elite and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational transfer of
knowledge and expertise and skills so that our generation and younger generations can be equipped
as best as possible to face the challenges ahead. Today I am joined by three humans in their early
twenties who have found themselves immersed in the work and scholarship surrounding the great
simplification. As you might be aware the viewers of this channel and this content in the world
tend to skew older but it's my belief that bringing young voices to the table, getting their
perspectives on the future, platforming their ideas is essential for us to navigate the coming decades
especially those young humans who have a systems understanding of the complexity and the risk that
we face. As such this reality roundtable is focused on the perspectives of youth today,
how they feel about the current state of the world, what their hopes are for the future,
what their ideas are for the future of society. Joining me today are Priscilla Trinh who currently
serves as the director of communications at the Post Growth Institute and co-coordinator of the
Minnesota Youth Institute. She's the creator of the Post Growth Jobs Board editor at the
Blue Marble Review and contributor to the Minnesota Women's Press. Also joining me is James Brannigan,
a writer, philosopher and content creator with a YouTube channel of his own. James is committed
to the task of addressing some of the many facets of the human predicament with education
and food production systems being two of the more appealing ones for him. He is Irish and currently
lives in Spain. Last but not least is Natasha Lindhart who is a recent graduate of the University
of Amsterdam with degrees in economics and business and electives in degrowth and critical
theory. Natasha has been a volunteer for our organization for the past year and she will
be starting full-time as a research associate this summer. I hope this is the first of many
roundtable discussions with young humans. I hope you enjoy it.
Welcome young humans to reality roundtable number nine, Priscilla Natasha James. Great for you to
be here. Nice to be here too. Thanks for having us. Thanks for having us. You're welcome. You're
very welcome. I would like to have more young humans on the show because you are going to be
living a long lives during the great simplification and what's ahead. So let me set the stage for
this. I know all three of you. Priscilla was one of my students. Priscilla I've known you since you
were 17 or such and you were my teaching assistant for my class reality 101. James and Natasha I've
met online through the podcast. So I have various hats especially for Priscilla. I was a professor
and a mentor and a coach and a friend. For the next hour plus though I am just a podcast host.
I want you each to speak your authentic selves about what you believe and feel and think about our
world and our future. Before we get to that if you could maybe each of you give a brief
introduction of who you are and what you're doing right now. Brief bio. Natasha we'll start with you.
Yeah so hi I'm Natasha. I'm 23 years old and I usually live in France but I'm currently in the
British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean because I'm doing a few months of backpacking and traveling
before starting work full-time with Nate and his organization and yeah it feels very surreal to be
here because I've learned so much from this podcast. So thanks for having us. Priscilla.
Hey everyone Priscilla Trinhir. She, her pronouns. I am also 23 and calling in from Oceti Shacoenlands
also known as Minnesota United States and I do communications work in the realm of
alternative economics and food systems and that's my job and energy right now.
James. Hey I'm James. I'm 25. I'm Irish but currently in Granada. I just love biology
and environmental science and as with Natasha I came across the great simplification and it's
pretty surreal to be here but right now I'm studying regenerative agriculture and how to
work the land that way. Excellent. Well thank you all for being here. As he's usually the format
I'm going to have a framing question and you'll each have five plus or minus minutes
and then we'll carry on and have a conversation after that. So I would love each of you to respond
and describe your own personal journey learning about the various economic and environmental
risks and crises in the world around us and how has that shaped the way you see the future
and your own place in it? Yes in my journey understanding about the meta crisis specifically
and how the different environmental and economic risks and crises are related and interconnected
that journey was life-changing. It was definitely a roller coaster and I'd say it was made up of a
few different phases. The first being a sort of awareness phase which started about two years ago
and that was triggered by a few different events and circumstances that maybe we can dive into later
but it was basically a six month period in which I exposed myself to a lot of information about
the various crises we face at the moment both environmentally and socially and economically
and I came to realise that they were all just symptoms of something more complex going on
beneath the surface and that was the time period where I came across your work name across this
podcast and that awareness phase really taught me firstly that we have this socioeconomic reality
or this economic superorganism as you call it that's the outcome of institutions and behaviour
being oriented around profit maximisation and the expectation of continued growth
and the dynamics embedded in that socioeconomic system are driving the crises that we face
and the fundamentally incompatible with the long-term wellbeing of the planet and of people
and that realisation for me was really hard to take because I'm a part of that system right?
We all are to lesser and greater extents so I had to come to terms with the fact that I was part of
something that was driving the crises that I cared about and I cared about addressing
and then it didn't get much better because during the awareness phase I also learned about energy
and about ecology and I learnt that this economic superorganism and this version of humanity was
coming to an end and was self-terminating because it could only function by continually destroying
the things which its survival depends upon so that meant I had to throw all the expectations I had
about my future out the window and at that stage I entered a phase of grief I suppose I was grieving
for the death of an illusion that I'd had about reality but also about my future
and that period really sucked I don't want to sugarcoat it I would cry a lot whenever I was by
myself I felt really really lonely and at that stage I felt very powerless it wasn't very fun
but I will say that it was a hundred percent necessary because only by going through that and
feeling those things could I then get to a phase of acceptance and that phase of acceptance really
meant for me internalising and really fundamentally accepting inside myself that the future was going
to look very different from the present that the future was going to look different to what I've
been taught to expect it to look like and that this version of humanity that I'd come to consider
the norm and which had characterised my life up until that point was what had passed its sell by
date and was going to have to come to an end if we don't want the biosphere to come to an end first
and for me realising those things and internalising them meant that now there was no way that I could
have a career or a role in the world which actively contributed towards maintaining and
perpetuating the status quo so I had to totally redefine the role I saw for myself in the future
and moving forward and now I very much see that role as twofold firstly we need to be
putting in place safety nets we need as many people as possible going into the future with our eyes
wide open and planning and putting in place structures so that the transition to a lower
energy throughput future can be accompanied by the least suffering possible because I think
there will be a lot of suffering especially in terms of material wealth and I really really
really fear that if we carry on going blindly into the future then when shit hits the fan
we will turn to the worst versions of what humanity is capable of and we know that humanity
is capable of some really horrific stuff but we're also capable of some great things so I think
the second task is to actively sow the seeds and create an alternative an alternative socioeconomic
reality and I think that's quite an exciting task that everyone can play a role in because we need
as many ideas and skills as possible to create a version of humanity that can not only outlive this
one but also which gives the biosphere and society the best possible chance of thriving
long into the future so I see those as the roles I can contribute to moving forward in the short
term I think we need to be raising awareness and bringing this stuff into the mainstream so there's
many people as possible can be contributing to those tasks so that's what I want to be focusing
on energy on in the near future but yeah that's sort of where I'm at now and to be honest since
reaching the acceptance phase I'm very very content and very happy and the lifestyle changes
I've implemented as a result of becoming aware of all this depressing content have actually had a
hugely positive impact on my well-being and happiness so yes the grief sucks but it's necessary
and it's worth it and yeah at the end of the day we still have life and that's amazing so I try to
enjoy it as much as possible I resonate with Natasha's grief period but I would say the metaphor
I would use to describe my journey is a happy tumble down a hill I was rolling down into these
rabbit holes picking up flowers and rocks along the way this clarity that's exhilarating like when
you're rolling down a hill right but you're also as you are tumbling along gaining all this knowledge
there's also this back of the mind fear like what if I bump into something that I don't like and I
don't want to hear and it's scary to really internalize that information and then finally get to the
bottom of the hill and I have to look up and I'm breathless by all that clarity but also exhilarated
because now I'm looking up at an amazing valley and knowing that even though the road ahead is very
long and uphill it's beautiful because I'm not doing it alone I think when people have asked this
question in the past how did you get to where you are it's always been explaining it as oh you
know we did the canon event of going to college and becoming radicalized but it's a lot longer than
that having reflected on my positionality how I've come here growing up in an immigrant family but
I'll get back to that later I really think your classmate was kind of the catalyst for connecting
all the dots right you realize that it's not money that makes the world go around it's energy
and then when you combine that with an understanding of evolutionary psychology
it really undoes the whole monolith of human nature and it really made me appreciate the
plasticity of culture and that gives me a lot of hope as I learned about the biophysical limits
of our world I was also moving more in the direction of activism intersectional feminism was a huge
part of the lens in which I view the world and it was a mixture of what I learned in class but
also the communities and spaces I entered during my organizing years understanding that energy
privilege is tied to class race gender sexuality all struggles are connected and moving into how I
understand about the existential risk and crises really from a place of collective liberation
we're all in this together it's liberation for all and that includes inter-species liberation as
well and again undoing the whole binary and notion of tree huggers versus realists because
everyone is affected albeit differently and everyone is subject to being oppressed or becoming the
oppressor right it's not just an identity politics thing it is decolonization for everyone and it
looks very different for the individual and as I got more into food sovereignty spaces I have a
background in food systems specifically organic agriculture horticulture did hydroponics research
for two years and through direct action through organizing I came to really day by day and more
convinced that local community power building is where I want to be it's about channeling the big
picture understanding into my corner of the world right we think about how it's not effective to be
perfect it's not about being the perfect activist the perfect vegetarian the perfect you know
bike your way to work type of person in the US I feel like given where I'm at and along in addition
to my full-time job it's also a job to be embodied and authentic and slow and intentional like Natasha
said to really cultivate yourself so that you can be self-sufficient but also community sufficient
whatever you learn can be re-gifted to everyone around you and I always come back to this quote
by Audre Lorde about how caring for myself is not self-indulgence it is self-preservation and that is
an act of political warfare and I think now that we see everyone converging on this narrative of
connecting these levels and systems at play on a planetary level on a political level it's
really cool to be here and alive during this time and I know the word unprecedented was
really ruined for me during the peak pandemic era but I think it's really cool that we're alive in
this really unique time in history and knowing that every generation before us has had to do with
their own risk for me I'm gonna die before you know probably peak climate crises hits but knowing
that I can do something about it is fine the allure of being the charismatic speaker with a huge
megaphone convincing people does not hold the same weight anymore for me it's really about
seeing how I fit into community and learning how to then cultivate myself to be a part of that
community that's how I see it thank you Priscilla and it feels odd for me to call you Priscilla
because for the last four or five years I've called you TrimTab which I will share publicly
Jeff Bridges movie living in the future's past he talked about TrimTabs which is the
little thing behind the rudder of a ship that influences the direction and your senior project
was so colorful that I sent it to Jeff and he loved it and then since then I've been calling
you TrimTab so we'll put we'll put that I think there's a hyperlink to it we'll put it in the
show notes of this episode thank you James Bryan again yeah so just a touch on Priscilla's point
that she made just there about the reduction of these complex issues into just what I consider
to be nonsensical binaries I think to overcome the allure of that because so many people fall
prey to that accepting one of the two ends of the extreme and to overcome that I think you have to be
fairly critical in your thinking and so one thing for me that I think about when I think about this
metacrisis or ecological issue that we're facing is that it is calling forth the best of us as
individuals because it has to we can't continue doing what we've been doing for the past however
many years you could say since the agricultural revolution to your point about surplus accumulation
and how that self-organizing around profits is one of the key generator functions driving
the problems that we face this has to change somehow not to say I know how but somehow that
has to change and just to be aware of that at first is of course the first step but to your
question about becoming aware of the ecological and economic issues I suppose it's just a combination
of like intellectual honesty and curiosity about the world because when I was younger obviously I
loved nature well that's not not so obvious but I really loved nature I loved playing out
in the fields in Ireland I loved being among the trees I love being by the river I love
making fires I loved making slingshots I loved these sort of outdoorsy activities as a kid
and so I sort of continued to follow that thread I was interested in biology and school so then
I followed that on and I wanted to remain as broad as possible in my study of the world because
this is so complex and I suppose as a young kid I was thinking all right how do I
learn as much about this as possible and not like specialize down into something too narrow
so then I went on to study general science in college or university and then environmental
science just because they're so broad but yeah so I suppose it was just a combination of that
intellectual honesty and curiosity and then also the internet the internet is a huge thing here and
the proper or appropriate use of the internet instead of falling into the trap of just being
caught by the algorithm with the short term stuff and losing your attention or losing time by having
your attention grabbed by that algorithm we can I think figure out a way to wield the internet
to our own advantage as individuals and then hopefully collectively and I think that that's
going to be one of the key tricks to figure out and I suppose I heard that actually that sentiment
echoed in an episode you did Nate with Thomas Bjorkman and he said about the Scandinavian
secret one of the keys there to modernize the Scandinavian countries rapidly was the implementation
of these schools where people could go and learn not only about the external world and what's going
on technologies so on so forth but also inner sort of spiritual or emotional development and how
the two relate to one another so yeah I guess that's it it's the internet curiosity and just
not falling prey to many of the pitfalls and traps that people who think about the ecological crisis
tend to fall prey to thank you thank you I have a bunch of questions for the three of you are there
any thoughts that bubbled up after the those the three of you spoke that anyone would like to follow
with yeah I just want to echo what James said about curiosity because I think that's what's so
special about this field is that there are so many different ways of getting into it but for me
yes I always cared about nature growing up and especially about social issues but no more so
than any other sort of environmentally and socially aware average human so for me the reason that I'm
here is purely driven by this curiosity and this craving to understand reality and the world around
me as much as possible and to get as close as possible to the truth rather than holding to any
set of beliefs and I think that's yeah also what really motivates me in this field is that it is
it's based on science and it's based on fact and if you're curious enough to go there yeah this is
where we get in addition to that curiosity has also helped me navigate triggers you have to
protect your energy and pick your battles online especially when you're trying to be a communicator
like myself it's not about being this missionary convincing people they should care about ecological
collapse it's really leading with questions if someone disagrees with you and I try to remind
myself why do they think this way and then lead with questions rather than falling into arguments
or that divide that we see so present across geographies and cultures right now so I love that
curiosity framing talking about binaries let's go to the one about intergenerational
relationships with the climate and energy and economic situation I'm about 30 years older than
the three of you and so you know I've I've got 30 years of living in a world that was largely
functional and amazing under my belt now educating younger people on these things
how do the three of you and I'll let each of you speak feel about the seemingly perpetual
intergenerational conflict and blaming in our current culture and from your perspective
is it possible that we could move past such a phenomenon and and how
in one word heal everyone needs to heal intergenerational trauma has been a big
topic on my mind a good chunk of my life and I think it's really important to unpack when talking
about conflict and blaming I come from a family of immigrants who fled the Vietnam war I'm Vietnamese
my parents are immigrants and refugees and outside of their story universally there's
conflict militarism war PTSD everyone experiences trauma to some different degree and that really
affects parenting that manifests as in money trauma how we relate to the economy and that
affects how we relate to each other as people and so to address intergenerational conflict
and blaming I think we have to then recognize intergenerational value for those of us who
are lucky to have elders in our lives you know I had my grandma I'm eternal grandma and I think
about how in the US there's such a sad attitude about older folks there's ageism in the workplace
there's ageism when it comes to political social values but we have to know that all these movements
that we're a part of now the environmental movement the economic movement they were all
founded by people who came before us right so elders have wisdom and value and Nate I don't
think you're an elder quite yet but in some ways you are like our community elder right you have
lots of ideas and experiences share right and it comes back to the whole constraint of our economy
because capitalism in the US means that we're bound to our day jobs we have time constraints and
then we don't have the time privilege to then invest in relationships and I think investing
in relationships healing recognizing when our emotions get the best of us is really key to then
unlocking very generative conversations and having intergenerational movements because
it's not young people versus old people at all you need all of us involved and one book I read
recently there's an author a local author here in the state she wrote a book called can we please
give the police department to the grandmothers and I think it was a beautiful exercise of
imagination and how we can then rethink the way we relate to one another rethink what it means
to be safe because at the end of the day we're very emotional beings and everyone is really just
seeking to be heard seen understood and that affirmation is important if we're really trying
to build safety nets safety nets for whom who who is benefiting from these safety nets we think
it's good for us but maybe someone else doesn't feel safe from that safety net so when we begin
to heal and talk about mental health and really holistic health I think it's I think it's going
to be a big part in moving forward to to bridge these gaps yeah I couldn't agree more healing is
important and I remember in my mind I thought of it this way I considered there are sort of four
key elements in like the individual human's life and I call them the most basic basics it's like
food make sure you get your food right make sure you get your exercise right make sure you get your
sleep right but also make sure you get your social relationships right so that speaks to
Nate I think you formulated it by saying something like become a fully stacked behaviorally stacked
human being and you yeah you pointed the same thing sleep food exercise because how can we expect to
face these issues and overcome them if we're in any way ill in terms of our health that's not to
say it's impossible but why not optimize for these elements of human life because we can but to this
point about blaming to be honest I don't really I don't really see it I don't see my generation
blaming the older generation one thing that annoys me is this the fact that it's the older
generations who have all the resources and money but it's the younger generation who has all the
energy but missing the resources and money so there's a clear sort of niche there for collaboration
and why it's not happening I'm not sure so I wouldn't really blame I actually I don't even think
blaming is productive what's the use it gets us nowhere so why not instead of blaming seek to
collaborate and seek to somehow create the mechanisms that can funnel resources from
the older generations to the younger generations in a collaborative sort of
agreement between all of us yeah I couldn't agree more with that I think it's about collaboration
rather than blaming I really see intergenerational blaming as a huge waste of time and waste of
energy because at the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individuals
fault that we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you
were born in to contribute towards responding and yeah as James said maybe we have our generation
has more energy or time hopefully over which to enact those responses but there is no way that
we can do it without the experience and also importantly the leverage of older generations
so I would love to see older generations firstly stop saying that it's down to our generation
secondly stops having conversations about these topics in closed rooms amongst academic elite
and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills
so that our generation and younger generations can be equipped as best as possible to face the
challenges ahead and also I'd like to see the older generation engaging themselves in facing
those challenges and many are already but we need more people in all generations doing that
in terms of moving past the intergenerational blaming what I would love to see is if somehow
we could adopt a collective mentality which saw this current version of humanity not as a final
product that either has to be defended by older generations or destroyed by younger generations
but rather as a work in progress and within that having the collective maturity
to acknowledge and accept human fallibility like we're not perfect we're very very far from
being perfect we make mistakes and we get things wrong and that's okay but it means that we have
to be learning from those mistakes we have to constantly be trying to improve and I think if
somehow we could get to that collective mentality it would go a long way to moving past these cycles
of blame because it would mean that we could on the one hand be grateful for what older generations
and prior generations have given us and the experiences they've given us access to while
simultaneously acknowledging that mistakes were made and there was incomplete understanding of
reality which means that from today we can't make those same mistakes and all of us in all
generations have to do things differently and do things better and we still won't be perfect
but at least we can work towards creating something that we can be proud to pass on to future generations
I'm with Natasha that there needs to be shared values and I think it comes down to a rebranding
issue right I think many of us are disillusioned with ESGs and the global north framework of
environmentalism activism and systems change it's a very global north eurocentric approach and
recognizing there's a plurality of work that's been done over the years is important in bridging
the narrative right caring about our crises is not a trend it's not something new solidarity is not
you know something that you do now because everyone else is doing it and I think it's really
flipping the narrative of how these conversations are not just happening on podcasts for people who
have time to listen to them they're happening on the ground and it really does come back to what
James was saying it's about this lack of resources how many of us do not have time especially
in the global north where we have day jobs that keep us from advocating for things we want to do
and then you got to wait until retirement when you have time to advocate in lobbies so is this
mismatch between what we're bound to financially in our well-being because everyone needs a paycheck
to survive in parts of the world now and then how can we then cultivate time and space do that
and that's going to take a bit of help outside of the typical at least in the US nuclear family
or young adult living by themselves in an apartment yeah so that is such a great point
the fact that most of us don't even have the time to engage these topics most of us are too
concerned with yeah how to put food on the table or pay the rent to have time to consider these
topics and so this is actually one of the main reasons why I'm doing what I'm doing trying to
figure out I hesitate to call it like an alternative lifestyle because it sort of has hippie connotations
but I'm trying to figure out how to live a life where I can fully study these topics
and also pay the rent so I don't know how to do that but also then attach it to your point about
like looking to the older generation to try and teach us better about the world is I wonder
of course the older generation there's value in what they have to say but I wonder if that
impulse to you know find an authority an authoritative figure from which we can be confident
um about their teachings and how we learn about the world is itself sort of preventing us from
understanding these problems more deeply because I'm not sure the older generation even knows
about how to deal with these problems because they're so novel again it's not to say there's no use in
deriving knowledge from the older generations like Nate for example the the great simplification
thesis is hugely explanatory and it helped me put the right words to the thoughts I had sort of
intuited about the world but then again I can't just rely on Nate to do the work that we need
to do we need to sort of relocate the locus of authority in each of ourselves as individuals
and then work in collaboration with each other every everybody having done that
towards solutions or long-term management plans that can actually address the novelty
of the problems we face is that changing like Priscilla um from five or six years ago when I
met you these things climate change was known then but energy depletion and um polarization and
addiction and AI and some of the other biodiversity ecological crises like PFAS and plastics and ocean
issues and all these things they weren't really on a lot of people's radar are these things commonly
discussed uh with age in age groups of 23 to 27 like like you all are or is it is it um
somewhat rare and in a second part of that question is um is it because of ignorance and in
energy blindness or systems lack of systems knowledge or is it because I don't want to
talk about this stuff I just want to enjoy my weekend and and the beautiful day and and not
have to think about these things do you have any thoughts on that I think it really depends where
you're coming from where you are located geographically and culturally I feel like when
you're talking to us it's a bit skewed right we already give a damn but I think in the Palestinian
lands um that that would be a dumb question for me to ask but I think it's becoming a bit more
apparent I am very much sensing in the US and in the left bubbles that there's this convergence on
connecting the dots between economies environments and social issues and while there is still a huge
spectrum of nihilism to paralyzing fear most people probably fall somewhere within the middle
right some people are like I'm just here to make bank do my job retire and die some people are
it's out of my control it's too big I don't know what to do let's retrain to the woods which is
also just another form of dissociation and I think the narrative happening elsewhere global
south and other parts of the world maybe they don't use the same words that we do but they
are thinking about it because they have no choice but to think about it in the US they're still
quite a bit of a buffer for some folks and most folks in the US still live paycheck to paycheck
so we're very much closer to being houseless than billionaires and I think that squeeze economically
is really forcing people to think about more than just what's hurting their wallet what's
hurting their relationships and the future so I think it's becoming more and more people's radars
but they might be doing different things to address it or using different words they might be
advocating on parts of the system which I think is important it's hard to tackle big picture always
I think it's okay if it's a little fragmented and then politically that the vocabulary is catching
on but it's being so quickly co-opted that's why it's so difficult to have these conversations
because you don't know who you're in the room with anymore someone could say the word sustainable
or regenerative and you don't know if they if they mean green growth are they a techno-optimist
or are they an anarchist like it doesn't it's not clear anymore so that's kind of the the nice
thing about it that with this digital amplification you don't feel as alone sometimes because people
are using a shared language but it's also very quickly co-opted and misinterpreted so it's it's
a mix of both I would say thank you James you wanted to say something and then Natasha yeah
sure but uh just to the point about the shared language thing it's just so important to
understand each other and use the same language not yeah the same language and understand that
here's actually what I mean by this but that's so difficult to flesh all of that out it takes a lot
of time like the perfect example for me is the idea of organic farming to the naive lay person
he or she thinks like yeah this is like no chemical this is pretty natural and all
but it turns out that in the industry it just means something like less chemicals than
the industrial agricultural model but so yeah to the question I think for me anyway I'd be
amiss my friend group would be a misrepresentative sample because obviously I gravitate towards
these topics and so I tend to talk about them too and so I'm surrounded by people who also
tend to talk about them but not very money does that make it easier though I mean I would imagine
you you strongly value such a group oh my god I can't tell you how much I love the people the two
people I talk about this stuff with I love them so much two two of my best friends Sean and my
brother Patrick but uh doesn't make it easier what you mean doesn't make it easier having less
people to talk about it with or how do you mean easier well if it was just you in Granada
reading this stuff online and thinking about it is not the healthiest trajectory so if you
have other people to share even if you don't come up with answers just a community I think
is really important which is why my class worked because we had 23 people in a circle talking about
these things and sharing because this is heavy stuff to take on just as an individual person
yeah no doubt it makes it easier and that's why I love that we can have this conversation now because
I wonder if it will work like an attractor and attract other people through the interwebs
cyberspace to be able to have these conversations by the time this episode airs our great simplification
discord channel will be live and people can find out where people are in the world and
have conversations either online or in person because I think that I think that's important
Natasha what do you think yeah I mean like James and Priscilla I do also gravitate towards people
who do care about these issues and I have an amazing group of friends and we have really
interesting discussions about these things I would say that generally there is you know people
in our generation do care I mean it's our future and there is general awareness about all these
crises but there are so many barriers to diving deeper into the sort of root causes and the why
of these crises and looking sort of beneath the surface I think those conversations aren't happening
as much as they as I'd like to see them happening and you know a big part of it is time as we've
talked about people have jobs and you've got to feed yourself and your family and it takes a lot
of time I mean for me to be honest I spent more time educating myself about this stuff than I did
focused on my university degree in the last year of study like it's a lot of content to get through
and also there's one thing having access to the content and the other thing is being in the mental
space to be willing to take on this content and to really engage with it and I spent a long time
in my youth being aware of these crises but not really caring about going any deeper than that
and it wasn't until I was in a mental space where I'd removed loads of distractions from my life
got off social media was creating a lot of time and space for silence and reflection
that then when the content hit me I was willing to engage with it and get really deep into it
so I think there are a lot of barriers that we can work on removing. Thank you, excellent
so I will remind you all that I am not a teacher here I'm just a podcast host
but I just having this conversation this is like the first conversation I've had with more
than one young person at a time since I taught last in 2019 and I do miss the life and vitality
and curiosity and emergence that comes from speaking with young people. Let me ask you
put you on the spot each of you out of all the things that you're learning about some people
call it the meta crisis I usually call it the human predicament you're well familiar with
the different buckets of risks and crises we face like what is one thing in coming decades that
you're most concerned about out of the whole universe if each of you could just speak to that
for a minute or two. Yeah so for me I just love my food and one of the main things that
I'm concerned about is no longer being able to produce food at the scale that we do currently
because the fertilizer pesticides and whatnot won't be available anymore or if not that the
fuel for the tractors that we rely on now to produce this food will just will be reallocated
to other places or just it just won't be there for certain local areas and that's
one of the reasons why I'm doing what I'm doing now is to relearn the old ways of agriculture
not to return to an old way but to understand how do we do this in the absence of oil and machinery
I think that's a I've just found that intrinsically motivating to do that because
for the you might call it selfish reason that I love food not that I think the food is going to
disappear in my lifetime but just as a silly example that's why one of those with that is one
of my main concerns. It's not silly and I don't consider it a selfish interest and I love food
as much or more than you do Priscilla. Similar to James that's why I entered the field I am in
right now I remember when I told my parents hey I want to go to the college of food agricultural
natural resource sciences at the University of Minnesota and they looked at me and they were like
we crossed the Pacific to escape rice paddies and now you want to go back into food what are you
going to tell your grandmother and I told them you tell her that as long as people eat I will
have a job and it's really the basic currency of our societies because yes we need energy to produce
food but without food there's no peace you can't change the world on an empty stomach and so I really
am concerned about our food and water quality and the the resource wars that are going to break out
militarism is on my mind a lot everyone jokes about world war three we are living in the apocalypse
already and that's one thing that gives me hope when you understand the planetary boundaries
and the social boundaries of human patterns right all empires collapse eventually and so
thinking about it that way means that it really singles down a few of the things you should be
actually caring about and I think food and water is one of them and how are we going to set up
governance models and frameworks at different levels neighborhoods towns cities municipalities
what governance structures are in place so we can navigate these hard conversations about
how to allocate resources because we do have enough food in the world to feed everyone it's a
resource allocation problem and you know a corporate monopolization problem with big food big ag
controlling our food supply chains right now and I feel like it's doable and I don't think the answer
is a million organic farms that's not sustainable or viable it's not about everyone becoming a farmer
that's not how society functions we need all roles all skills all types of passions but
yeah food and water is something I'm taking on myself to cultivate skills related to that because
I think it's fun like you all have said I love food and so that's something I'm focused on both in
my personal and professional life that's a difficult question because there's so many
risks and crises that we're facing to be honest I think I'm more concerned with the way that we
respond to those rather than the risks and crises happening because I think they will happen
and I would love to be proven wrong on that I think that we will have food shortages and there
will be problems with water and there will be civil unrest what I'm was scares me more is the way
that we respond because if we look through history the times when the economy's gone bad and we've
had shortages in terms of resources that has had really really bad knock-on effects in terms of the
version of humanity that we become I mean we become really really awful people so yeah what I really
fear is that these conversations don't translate to the things that Priscilla's talking about us
actually thinking about different governance structures and thinking about how we're going
to distribute those scarce resources and how we educate people so they have the skills to
manage when we have to relocalize and can't depend on these long supply chains
rather than just waiting for it to happen and then it turning really really bad
so I guess that's what scares me
yeah if I might just add also that that's also a motivation for me it's not just my
own love of food it's an understanding that when human populations feel the squeeze and they see
another human population over there who's doing well they this human population who's doing poorly
understands also that they can just steal what they have and that gets nasty and that is sort of a
pattern that you can read from history that tends to happen
so following up on that each of you how do you maintain hope and cultivate resilience in the
face of what you know about the world and and I would be so bold as to say you know more than
the average 23 and 27 year olds about all these risks and systems especially given
reading the news every day of what's going on in Israel and Palestine and Ukraine and it's
45 degrees Celsius today in India which is like 110 or something like that
you get daily reminders of this stuff so how do you maintain hope and practice
resilience and healthy habits knowing all this stuff
yeah I don't think we can just magically have hope from some external source I think we have to
actively create hope and yeah I see so much beauty in the world in nature and in people
and in relationships and communities but also in art and knowledge and culture and
when I started realizing the extent to which we're destroying that beauty in its various forms
I would shift between two mindsets on the one's hands I think well it's all fucked anyway so
there's nothing I can do excuse my French and on the other extreme I think that I have to
personally save the world and neither of those are helpful because neither of them lead to action
so the mindset I've developed instead through which I find a lot of resilience
is firstly to feel those things so you know I do get really really sad when I hear the news and
when I see nature suffering and people suffering I'm really feeling that but then also feeling
the joy but at the beauty that's still there so and the sort of mantra I use to motivate myself is
how can I use what I have to do what I can to protect some of the beauty and bring it forward
with me into the future and I think that if everyone does that even if it's in a really small
way like taking better care of your back garden or helping out an elderly neighbor if we all
use what we have to do what we can then we're creating hope I would say deep time deep time
gives me a lot of hope because when you zoom out and understand how we got here you realize how
recent the current order of things are dominant global north white capitalist whatever you want
to call it society is so new and back to what others have said before when you understand that
it recalibrates your expectations and that ironically gives me more positivity in the face
of the poly crisis because when you've understood that there are material financial and social
limitations it recalibrates your expectations and yes that comes to the period of grief like
was mentioned before it also alleviates a lot of pressure yeah we might have some sort of mad max
guns defending farm period but it's not going to last forever right nothing lasts forever in
nature and so nothing bad will last forever in human human systems yes there will be ecological
system impacts that will probably last forever in the Anthropocene but I I think going back to
social governance like all the dire things we're seeing in the news those will stretch out for
relatively long period of times compared to our lifetimes but I know that the earth will rebound
we will find a place in the future to govern ourselves in a way that's equitable and sustainable
and just understanding that no revolution has been peaceful and I don't mean just like the
revolution on the streets I mean the revolution inside doing that healing work that shadow work
that unlearning the breaking and creating cycles and friend circles and families and communities
it's not just about your neighborhood it's about the regional impacts and what gives me hope is
cultivating myself it's about gardening cooking at home foraging being a better biker because
right now we're living in an information economy data knowledge cells in the future that knowledge
and data has to be uploaded into our brains it's a very fair and height 451 situation but knowing
skills and having less dependency on scary supply chains that are fragile gives me a lot of hope
and empowerment make friends with people who know skills that's how you build community it's not
about having a million people behind you and honestly you know there's that often cited
often cited number of like you need two percent of the mass to have a critical mass to do something
I think it's even less than that now considering we have relatively stable telecommunication
systems right the message can be amplified so much quicker now and so your community extends
beyond geographic boundaries and then what also gives me hope is communications really trying to use
asset-based communications because that really flips the narrative it goes from deficit and
scarcity which is what is used in propaganda and news and media to really feel like we don't have
what we need but we do know what we need and we do have what we need and it's just again trying to
create narratives even the most well-intentioned circles like charities will say we need more
volunteers because there's too many poor hungry homeless folks and I yes but we could also state
it in a different way that really empowers people by saying we have the resources to house feed and
uplift everyone join us in this movement it really you know lands emotionally different
in people and it might instigate action no matter how big or small I think it's this weird world is
small and big at the same time and people do not fit into it but just pick something if it's safe
enough to try go for it I think this this at least in the US the academic system that many of us go
through really kind of pushes for perfection and if it's not going to work don't do it at all
but I'm trying to push back against that myself and not be stuck in this cerebral space of just
like despair so that's my take on it one of the things that really
makes me study this and makes me like want to be a human at this time is the fact that there's no
guarantee that we make it through this bottleneck or these bottlenecks of the coming decades which
is like there's a sense of danger in that and it's kind of scary but at the same time that's what
makes it exciting and then also there are like human experiences that at an embodied level
I have felt and I know like for example I love Jujitsu I love training when obviously not when
I'm traveling but when I'm back in a stable environment and there's something about that
combat and exerting yourself so strenuously that after it you're steaming up and there's just sweat
pouring off you and the endorphins that are released at the end of that and the conversations
that are subsequently had with the friends that you have made in the gym there's a comradeship
there that is just a beautiful feeling and so to maintain hope in this situation I know that that's
that's like intrinsically rewarding and valuable and there's there's no amount of theory that's
going to refute that for me I know that that is valuable and so I say to myself okay this is worth
preserving so and then I bounce out and I as Priscilla said I try to gain a perspective and I say
okay across time I would like to preserve this if that's possible how do I go about doing that
and then the how do I go about doing that is the challenge that's the exciting part
and there's no guarantee that we win but why not give it our best shot is how I'm thinking about it
so so building on that you mentioned jujitsu uh Priscilla mentioned a couple things um maybe
each of you could expand a little bit on the practices or uh meditations or skills or new
behaviors that you've incorporated in your personal life as a response to your own understanding
of the metacrisis the great simplification and how all these things interrelate
yeah so for me understanding the metacrisis I had to realize that I had several behaviors
and ways of thinking that I took for granted but which were actively reinforcing the super
organism so over the last year I've tried to adopt lifestyle choices and behavior choices
which I can imagine as being more characteristic of a more sustainable system so firstly I really
tried to move away from this constant craving for more and more more and more stuff more and more
stimulation and that's a constant battle but I've tried very hard to actively slow down my pace of
life to value quality over quantity and to remove as many distractions as possible so that I can
focus on the present and what we have and that's been helped through meditation through getting off
social media and just yeah actively creating space and time for silence and for silent reflection
and learning to actually crave the silence rather than the stimulation so I really enjoyed that and
then learning to take joy and pleasure out of stuff that comes for free I realized that previously
a lot of the stuff I found fun was in some way associated with consumption whereas now
I take a lot of pleasure out of things like time in nature I love going on long walks
time with friends and family an interesting conversation and dancing and writing and trying
to incorporate those things into my daily life and then in terms of mindset changes I've had a big
change related to nature primarily through food because like James I also love food and
I've been putting a lot of more intention and awareness behind what I'm putting in my body
and where it comes from and I'm so lucky that I live in an amazing part of the world with amazing
local produce but this sort of intention behind what I'm putting in my body has made me realize
that my health is totally tethered to the health of nature and of earth's ecosystems and my actions
are impacting that health and that has given me such a profound respect for nature and for all
forms of life right now when I look out the window I see life in the tree I don't just see a tree
and that's a very different mindset to oh I should make the environmentally friendly choice because
of climate change so that's been a mindset a big mindset shift for me and then the other
one I just want to touch on briefly is moving away from closed-minded in-group out-group thinking
so I really tried to actively seek out and engage in conversations with people who have
opinions I disagree with and who come from different backgrounds or beliefs and going
into those conversations with the attitude that I want to learn as much as possible and I'm open
to the idea that I'm wrong and I'm going to update my opinion based on that conversation
and that also has been a big a big mindset shift for me and it's really taught me to be a lot more
open-minded and to realize that I am basically wrong about everything yeah and I do think overall
the more I learn about the metacrisis and the more I develop sort of a nuanced understanding of it I
do think it comes down to a shift in consciousness so yeah I try to live the change I want to see
in the world and hopefully can inspire some people to do the same because if we all collectively do
that then it triggers change higher up. Let me ask you put you on the spot Natasha do you think
there's something unique in your situation or your genetics or your upbringing or are the changes you
may that you just described easily adaptable by people watching this episode that are 23 and
having similar thoughts? I think that definitely these changes can be adopted by anyone.
What I will say is because I have thought a lot about this what I think is unique in my
upbringing is that I was exposed from a young age to very high-level conversations. My grandparents
lived in this little town in south of France which was like this hub of international academics
and creatives and film directors and artists so from a young age I'd be at dinner parties with
like Nobel Prize winners and that was normal to me and so I learnt from a young age to crave that
learning and to want to be more interested in learning something new than in whoever I believed
in and I think that's led me to where I am now because my involvement in this space and this work
was in no way predicated by me being like a tree-hugging hippie or a radical anarchist or whatever
it's purely from that craving for knowledge and then when finding that knowledge that makes sense
being willing to incorporate that so I think anyone can make these changes but it's about
being willing and open to finding out something new and the idea that everything you might have
taken for granted and believed up to that point is wrong. Thank you. What are some practices or
meditation or new things that you've incorporated into your personal life after integrating this
into your mental view of the future? A very basic thing is something Daniel Schmockenberg
mentioned at the Norsegan Foundation. He said curate your social media feed so that the sorts
of things that crop up are related to this like the Stockholm Institute planetary boundaries framework
that sort of thing and that's actually that really works because I'd find myself going to my phone
and then seeing this stuff late at night and my head is like no I don't want to study that anymore
I'm too tired so now I'll just put the phone down put another thing that helps me sometimes I think
of this knowledge as like a burden sometimes I frame it in that sort of a way and I say oh my
god why do I have to know all this why do I have to be here in this time when all you and me both
brother? Yeah when the shit's hitting the fan and it's chaotic and it's tumultuous but then
I say to myself okay useless you're here now so let's just be here and see what we can do about
this and I sort of recalibrate or reframe in my mind how I see it and I say to myself all right this
is probably one of the biggest the human predicament the metacrisis slaying the super organism whatever
you want to say is probably one of the biggest challenges that humans across the whole of our
evolutionary history has ever had to face have to have ever had to face so to me that's quite
motivating and I say to myself okay so either you step up to this challenge and make something of
yourself so that you can address it in whatever way possible and try to make that addressing it
as big as possible because I remember I actually mentioned something like doing the gardening and
stuff like this and don't get me wrong I love all that and I'm here doing the regenerative agriculture
stuff but at the same time I think there needs to be like agents of change who are so disproportionate
in terms of the consequences of their decisions or choices or actions that
they they're in a position of power that they can make those disproportionate
changes happen the whatever decisions they make have highly are highly consequential we need to
also figure out how to find ourselves in those positions and I guess they're just a concern
comes up it's like okay you you'd want to know what you're talking about and what you're at when
you're doing that so that also is quite inspiring for me building off what others have said about
phone use I think it's a very powerful tool I myself have started to use social media more as
I got older and going back to that generational thing sometimes I look at gen alpha because I'm
gen z and I'm like oh god we're fucked because you're ipad kids but I also have to think like I
don't blame you for wanting to dissociate on your phone because the world's a scary place
I dissociate on my phone too I'm subject to that have it as well but in my role as a communicator
for my day job as a friend as a neighbor I'm not going to post something unless there's a sense of
agency that you can gain from it her writing avenues and pathways that then take action I think
it's good to affirm and put out some really emotionally charged content but I don't want to
be a click to this you know where you become complacent and complicit just because you posted
something online and think yep I've done my part I also don't want to rage farm you know that that's
a term rage farming you're just fueling the fire without really directing people to any channel
of action so that's one rule I've held myself accountable to yes affirm people but also try to
provide agency where you can when you're doing your stuff online and I think it's it's funny this
ironic momentum around re-indigenizing right there's the the sense that people want to go back
to the land and live simpler lives and like really change the culture and now today and throughout
recent history certain advocates of that especially indigenous folks global south folks people of color
all other communities that have been socially disadvantaged or marginalized in the past like
that's stuff they've been doing forever but also you have to counterbalance that with not painting
a monolith right I don't think we have to look too far many for my observations I've noticed
many immigrant families in the US who come here and fully embrace and get ensconced in the American
dream they are fully in survival mode they're they are just trying to make as much money climb the
ladder and that's a capitalist mindset and then they give birth to children like me who are very
against that so it's very complicated depending where you live the privileges you have it's a
privilege to be having these types of conversations but I think when I am in a space to have these
conversations I'm really trying to cultivate facilitation skills how to hold effective meetings
how to make everyone feel seen and heard in a conversation for effective governance decision
decision making models and I really think that's scalable I think that's going to be pretty key
to understanding the crises and then how to address them because right now no matter what type
enterprise you're in or workplace you're in I think there's room to improve for facilitating
effective like congregations of people to then come to consent or consensus around certain issues
and values then to move forward with that so really if I'm asking people to change then I have to
embody that change myself and again it's not about being perfect it's just about being authentic
and within your rounds within the privileges you hold.
Thank you and thank you to all three of you for putting in the time to learn this stuff and be
willing to be on camera to to share some thoughts is there is there any question that you would
have liked me to ask that you'd like to close with some some comments or anything else that each
of you would like to say to our viewers? I do just want to briefly say that if there are young
people watching this who are getting exposed to this content it can be really scary and tough
if you don't have people to talk to about it so hopefully as you said Nate there's going to be
like a discord channel by the time this is out but speaking for me personally I'd be very happy
to chat to anyone who feels like going through this cognitive journey by themselves so just
putting that out there. Yes I also want to plug the emotional container model you do really need
to hold space for people to process this and I'm proud of the work that I've done with my peers
when we founded a nonprofit called the Overstory Alliance and out of that came movement school
and it really was about educating and then providing a space review to process and then providing
perhaps an avenue for them people to manifest whatever change they want they're interested in
interested in chicken coop go do that you're interested in building furniture go do that
you're interested in becoming part of the system changing from within that's okay too but yeah
really emphasizing the emotional container key to preserving yourself and not burning out.
Closing remarks I can't really say much to be honest what I would say is because I'm not sure
what it was within me that made me realize oh no that's not quite true don't believe that or don't
fall into that trap maybe there's something sort of innate to humans that can guide us like that
and I would say listen to that inner voice that guides you in that way and don't betray it don't
betray it not for money nor for people in your life who would convince you that no no no this is
the way to see the world I'd just say stay true to that inner voice.
I didn't Priscilla I don't even know if you know this but I almost called my class at the
University of Minnesota things you always knew but never knew you knew but it was too convoluted
and long so I called it reality 101 instead yeah Priscilla. After you left Nate you know a few of
us adapted your course to become another seminar led by students for students and we titled it
what to do about a fucked up world and we just live with humor. Our humor does a great service to
people in healing and navigating and honestly we live in the age of memes so why not. Yeah thank
you all young humans friends of mine to be continued and and thanks for being curious and
wanting to share and try. Thanks Nate. Thanks everyone.
