So most of what we've seen is a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we
have, have come from that increase in energy. And now we're cooking with gas in that sense
because we're finally acknowledging the role of energy in production. But that's not what
neoclassicals are doing, of course. I'd like to welcome Professor Steve King back to the podcast.
Steve is author of Debunking Economics and the New Economics a Manifesto. Steve is,
among many other things, a research fellow at the Institute for Strategy, Resilience,
and Security at University College in London. He is writing a new book and today we discuss one
of the chapters in his book, which is an economic sleuth story on the origins of energy blindness.
We go back all the way to Adam Smith and look at a series of wrong turns in the road that
classical and that neoclassical economists made on the treatment of land, energy,
and things that are not capital and labor. This is a difficult podcast. Steve is an economist,
talks in a lot of economist language. I barely understood what he was saying, but I did understand
the critical importance of his main message is that our main shaman of our culture today,
those that we look to for answers and explanations of what's happening and what will happen in the
future, are truly divorced from our biophysical and ecological reality in their formulas.
This ultimately is a really big deal. There's a chapter in Steve's upcoming book on that,
but this is a one and a half hour treatment of energy blindness and its origins.
Please welcome back to the show Steve King.
Steve King, good to see you. Welcome to, good to be back again, my good talk.
This is a monumental podcast for three reasons. One, it's my last podcast of 2023 recording.
Two, it's my first podcast on prep for a colonoscopy, so hopefully we won't have to interrupt it too
many times. And third, I think this is a, you have just finished a detective story about a
concept that I often talk about, energy blindness. I know the result of why our culture, why our
institutions are energy blind, but you have just written a book and a chapter on the energy
production function and you've gone back to the original papers from the classical neoclassical
economists and figured out why humanity has over time completely neglected the role of energy
in our descriptions of wealth and productivity. So we could talk about climate change. You know a
lot about that. We could talk about money and you know a lot about that and we probably should,
but today I want to just unpack your story of what you've been working on in the last couple
months with respect to energy blindness. Okay, let's roll. First question.
All right, so take me to the beginning. We had classical economists back in the day, right?
Yeah, and virtually every economist, if you ask them who's the father of economics,
going to answer Adam Smith. And in a sense, I was inclined that way, except that I've read
previous economists to Smith as well, including the physiocrats. And my attitude was that the
physiocrats were more advanced on important issues, both macroeconomics and the role of energy
in production than the... Who were the physiocrats? They were a bunch of 19th and 18th century
mainly French, but also some Irish economists who worked in French. And this is in France. And
this is before we actually had the term of economist in many ways. So there were people
who were trying to analyze how the production system works. And they're called physiocrats because
the leading personality, the leading intellect in the group was Francois Connet. And Connet was the
physician to the king of France. And he was working at the time when we were having a very
first autopsy is to find out what was inside a body. Because for a long time in the West, there
were religious rules against carving open a dead body. And then we started to do it.
And Connet was involved in this. He found all these tubes running all over the body and had
this vision of a system of circulation for the body. And then when it came to looking at the
economy, they had the same idea. There's a system of circulation. Goods go from one spot to another,
money goes in the opposite direction. And there was this sense of saying, we can see the economy
is a dynamic system in the same way we're now realizing the body is because all these tubes
flow down and flow back up again, the arteries go through the body, they become veins, come back
up again, there's circulation of blood, there's mixing of blood with oxygen, all these sorts of
things where the vision and in that sense, the basic paradigm they started from wasn't mechanics
as neoclassical economists have ended up doing. It was biology. And that was a far more sensible
starting place. And so instead of calling them bureaucrats, they were physicians that were
advising the king. So they call them physiocrats. Well, the most dominant personality was Connet.
And there's two combinations of he was a physician for the king, literally the king's
physician. Now, that did two things, gave him enormous prominence. It also gave him plenty
of spare time because he only got one person to occasionally have to do something medical with.
So for the rest of the time, he was working in trying to work, and the interest was in
how the economy functions as a sort of monetary and physical goods version of a body circulation
system. This was in the 18th century in Europe? 1700s, yeah. And they were trying, as people
like William Petty was trying to work out how the economy functioned in England at similar times,
Sip Smith afterwards, of course. But the curious thing about being based in France is that France
at the time compared to Scotland, it's we're not comparing France to England, but France to
Scotland because of Smith. France was still overwhelmingly agricultural, okay, agriculture
dominated production in France. You had, you know, some some level of manufacturing, nothing like
what was developing in Scotland at the time. Smith's book came out, I think, the same year
as the very first James Watt steam engine was sold. And but of course, we had the previous models
before which are much less efficient was still steam engines. And you had steam power and water
power and wind power being used in all the factories in Scotland. But from the point of view of the
physiocrats, they said, Well, what they were looking at was, you know, rural France. And what
they saw was a farmer would plant one seed, and 1000 seeds would come out of it. And so their
orientation was that wealth comes from the land. And it isn't the labor that goes into making
something that gives it the value, they didn't even talk about that. Well, they did, but where
is a secondary factor. So they said the source of wealth is the land. And the husbandman, as they
call the farmer, is the one who exploits what they call the free gift of nature. And their
perspective was first of all to say that the land is the source of all value. That was the opening
four or five words of Richard Cantillon's an essay on economic theory, which was published in
French 21 years before Smith wrote the wealth of nations. First of all, for a French, not only did
Smith read French, he was in France, taking a young nobleman around for education and met Cannae.
So he was quite aware of the literature in French, before he wrote the wealth of nations. And we'll
never know whether Smith derived his ideas partially from the physiocrats and interactions
with them, because he insists that all these notes were burnt upon his death. So we don't have any
long term record of the influences on Smith. But this school of thought was very strong,
and had a definitive foundation for explaining where wealth came from. And it wasn't from labor,
it was from land. And then there was steam engines. And we were off to the races. And our stories
changed influenced by Adam Smith. Well, that's much right in the wrong direction. Because what
the physiocrats also said was, because with land, they said, well, the land receives the free gift
of nature. And that had many potential meanings. But fundamentally, from our perspective, looking
back, it was energy. Because the sun's energy lands on the soil, plants absorb the energy,
the plants grow. The husbandman's actual labor is far less important than the productivity of the
soil and the exposure to natural elements, the climate, the sunshine coming in. And that was
the source of wealth. And they said that the husbandman is the only source of wealth. And if you
look at the writings that people like Turgo and Candle on and Cannae had, and you look at it from
the point of view that you and I have of the role of energy and production, they are fundamentally
saying the free gift of energy is what enables us to produce anything. And what we often would
be called a surplus by other schools of thought is the gap between the energy put in by the husbandman
and the energy retrieved. And there's a wonderful sentence from Turgo, where he says, the husband
receives the free gift of nature, which he did not pay for and which he sells. Okay. Well, that's
a microcosm of our entire economic system today. Exactly. So in that sense, the physiocrats had
it right. The one mistake they made, and this is the thing where the whole thing fell over,
and Smith played a role on this, is that they could not see the same thing in manufacturing.
So what they saw for manufacturing is that manufacturing receives the output of the
agricultural sector and transforms it into some different form, but does not add value. Now,
what we know, of course, is that manufacturing also receives the free gift of nature in the sense
that we're exploiting fossil fuel energy, which has been there for millions of years, but it's
basically stored solar power. And without that input in manufacturing, there'd be no production
for manufacturing either. And at the same point, the manufacturing transformed the free gift of
nature, which is raw energy into useful energy. So the sensible perspective would have been
to go from the physiocrats vision of the role of agriculture to then say, well, it's also in
manufacturing. And Smith could have done that, because Smith could have thought, well, we don't
have much farming in Scotland comparatively compared to France, but we do have manufacturing.
And in manufacturing, we're using the free gift of nature as well, putting coal into the early
steam engines. We've got water power, which is another gift of nature, wind power to some extent,
but predominantly it was steam power and charcoal power began and coal, coal is becoming very important,
becoming dominant actually, before Smith published the wealth of nations. So he could have said,
well, that's also the free gift of nature, but he didn't. What he said is there was labor is the
source of value. What you have out of that is a switch from seeing the external, the existing
universe being the source of us transforming the inputs we form find there into something useful
for us, which is consistent with the laws of the laws of thermodynamics into labor being the source
of wealth and division of labor being the source of growth of wealth. And this is all effectively
inside the economy. There's no reference to outside the economy. So I see Smith by simply
changing one word, you have Richard Cantillon saying that land is the source of wealth to Smith
saying labor is the source of wealth. And that completely pushed economics off the rails.
We can only speculate why that happened, but possibly because Scotland was further along
on industrialization. And all of a sudden, we had this wealth and higher goods and services
than a few decades earlier. And there was maybe a human exceptionalism dynamic look at how clever
we are and how industrious our citizens of Scotland are. We're creating these machines and
we're creating this productivity. And so that statement, that shift from the focus of free
gifts from nature to the husbandman, the farmer or the laborer, that was the origin of our current
energy blindness, you're saying? I think so. And like, I can't criticize Smith for this. I mean,
I'm safe to break pity, but I can't criticize him because he had no idea of the consequences.
He didn't know the laws of thermodynamics. He can't criticize him for breaching something
which wasn't developed for a century after he actually spoke. But when you look at the,
I'm not going to look at some of the- And even the word, even the word energy was
invented after he wrote Wealth of Nations, I think.
Either it's 1809, I think. So the word itself was taken from Greek, but it was made up in the
early 18th century by an English- 19th century. Early 19th century. It's easy to make that
mistake. No, no, no. I always get that confused too. Sorry, I interrupted you. You were saying-
It's quite an 1802. So we can't blame them for not using post language and we can't blame Smith
for not knowing that there's a law of conservation of energy. The story continues though. It wasn't
just Smith. The errors compounded. So what's next? Well, the next stage is once he said,
Smith said that labor is a source of all value and division of labor is the increase in value
and wealth. You then, initially, that was used by Smith and Ricardo to attack feudalism and argue
in favor of capitalism. When you look at the role of the classical theory of economics played,
it was to promote trade. It was to promote freedom of movement and freedom of enterprise
against all the restrictions of the feudal system. So in that sense, it was pro-capitalist and that
was the way in which it was used by Smith and Ricardo. Nobody regarded Smith and Ricardo as
calling for the oath of favor of capitalism, but along comes Marx. Now, Marx, not only Marx,
were plenty of what they call Ricardian socialists before Marx turned up, who took the same idea
that if labor is a source of value, why is the wage not equal to the entire product? Why does
profit exist? That was the twist that was then taken of interpreting the classical argument
that labor is the source of wealth. Say, well, it were the source of wealth. Why don't we get it?
And you have to go back and think about the state of industry in the 18th and early 19th centuries.
I kind of fall over that 21st century thing, the 1900s all the damn time. But if you think about
the state of Scotland at the time, if I have any analogy to what it was like, it was Calcutta in
the 1950s. It was stench everywhere from pigs being disemboweled, chemicals pumping out,
smoke out of the chimney stacks, etc., etc. And I've forgotten who coined the phrase of the
dark satanic mills. But that was what Scotland looked like at the time. And you had people who
used to work in an agricultural environment with quite a few rights that peasants had back in that
time, who pushed through the enclosures movement, became landless laborers fundamentally, had to
work in the industrial systems, then found themselves working 14-hour days, normally six
days a week, thank God for the Sabbath. But six days a week, often sleeping inside the factories,
it wasn't exactly going to conducive to making you think what a great system capitalism is.
On the other hand, of course, the capitalists themselves were benefiting from all this and
bleeding the industrialization and so on. And the technological change, they thought it was great.
So what you had was for the working class and for the urban poor, Ricardian and Smithian economics
became a ground for arguing for revolution and for fairer share of what's being produced.
And that political shift was brought to a head by Marx in starting in 1857. Well,
he was prominent well before then, but 1857 with his work on what's called the Grangerisa.
And arguments for developing Marx's particular version of the classical theory. And Marx,
was far more eloquent than saying, capitalist exploit labor, he actually said, capitalist pay
workers precisely what they deserve to be paid in the commodity production system,
they get their means of subsistence, that's the cost of reproducing the worker. That's not a,
it's again for the buyer of labor power, that there's a gap between labor and labor power,
but by no means an injustice to the seller. That's a quote from Marx. But anyway, what you got was
Marx being used as the means for saying, let's have a revolution. And now in that setting,
the classical school from being regarded as positive by the capitalist class and the
ruling class. The classical school being Adam Smith and the like.
Adam Smith, Ricardo, and through to ultimately to Marx. But all the time there was a subgroup,
which was called, it had no particular name, but they were what I'd call proto neoclassical
economists. And the most prominent would be Augustine corner, who gave us the mathematics that
what's called corner oligopoly theory and so on, comes from Augustine corner back in the 1820s.
And Jean Baptiste say it was a complete believer in a utility maximizing view of human behavior
and equal utility maximizing view of capitalism as a system. And he was, you know,
vehemently pro capitalism, which I'm not criticizing here at the moment at all.
But I'm saying he had a subjective theory of value, whereas the classical school was objective.
So Ricardo, for example, at one stage said, the price of coproducts is set by the cost of
production, and not, as has often been said, by supply and demand. So Ricardo was anti supply
and demand. Most people, including the classical economists don't realize that. But when Marx became
the bastion of the classical school, this is in the 1860s and 1870s. At that stage,
there was a very rapid turnover in economic teaching at the universities, where the subjective
theory of value became dominant. And it's passing on from, say, in corner to Marshall and Jevons
and Wal-Rah. Can you briefly state what subjective versus objective theory of value would be?
The objective values of theory says that the price of something is set by cost of production.
So they ultimately, the cost of production determines the price something sells for.
Whereas the subjective theory says it's a combination of the utility maximizing
desires of the buyer and the profit maximizing desires of the seller. The two together set
the price. And as Marshall ultimately says, it is as ridiculous to ask whether supply
and demand sets price as to ask which blade of a pair of scissors cuts the paper. So they saw
both having to play a role. But they also came down to saying that it isn't just labor that
is a source of value. Capital is also a source of value. Now, Marx, when you read Marx properly,
and I think there are three people who have done that, I'm one of them, Rostovsky is another.
But most Marxists don't realize that Marx actually had an explanation for how capital can add value
or be a source of surplus value in his terms. I won't get into that here, but that's saying
the Marxists don't read Marx properly. But anyway, the convention-
Let me ask you a clarifying question because where we're headed, we're going to talk a lot
about labor and value. Labor is pretty clear. It's the husbandman. It's the worker. Now,
how do you define capital back then? And is it the same today?
That's two of the most difficult questions in economics. Capital is fundamentally machinery.
Capital is a word for machinery, which we also use almost identically as a word for money,
accumulated value of money.
There is no simple mapping from the physical machines to the monetary value of machines.
And we'll talk a bit about how an energy approach makes it easy to understand the role of machinery
later in our conversation.
So with the old equations, if you substitute the word machinery for capital, and then you
say labor and machinery in these 19th century formulas, that would be correct. That would be
the same inference. That makes sense. So the Marx art, the physical machine adds no value to
production. This poses a distortion of his own philosophy, which is a yet another issue for
another day. But if you have the labor theory of value interpretation of Marx, a machine adds
nothing. It simply contributes to the output, what it cost to make it in the first place. There's a
famous phrase in Volume One of Capital, which says, no matter how productive a machine is,
if it costs 150 pounds to make or three weeks of labor, then it adds to the product 150
pounds or three weeks of labor. So it simply transfers its value, whereas the increase in
value comes from labor. That was Marx's labor theory of value argument. Now that
it contributes to the whole political battle between workers and capitalists over who should get
profit, should the capitalists deserve a profit, etc. etc. And that was where the classical school
suddenly became on the nose for most capitalists. So the subjective arguments of say and corner,
and then ultimately, Vorar, Jevons and Menga became much preferred. And I really don't know the
politics of the switch in the 1870s, but in 1850s and mid 1860s, the classical school was still
dominant at universities and dominant in public discourse. By the 1870s, it was the neoclassical
school, which was completely dominant, and classicals were effectively marginalized, pardon
the pun. So the marginal school takes over, and the argument is both labor and capital contribute
to production and contribute to output. So Marx actually directly or indirectly
influenced the birth of what we refer to as neoclassical takeover of economics?
Yeah. Now, when that happened, of course, the real thing I'm interested in is not Marx in
particular. It's a piece of particular. He's an actor in causing this, but he's not the main
stage. What started with the physiocrats had the proto version of energy as the source of value.
And that's correct. We know from the point of theory of thermodynamics, we know that
there is a set amount of energy in the universe. And what humanity does in its manufacturing
process is take significant concentrations of energy and use those to either to convert energy
something more useful or to do motive force with that energy. And that is work. And that is what
enables us to produce goods and services. But we cannot create energy. We take energy in one form.
We put a transfer it into another. We actually degrade it according to the second law of thermodynamics.
So there's no surplus in that sense. What there is is a gap between the energy input needed to
harness this free energy and the energy in the free that the energy contained by that free
source as well, the coal mine or etc, etc. And that is what we're we're taking advantage of.
So we should have an energy theory of production. And if we'd had the physiocrats, we would have
got there because once the physicists in that sense caught up with the economists and developed the
laws of thermodynamics, economists said, ah, that's what we've been talking about.
And we can simply integrate perfectly with that. Instead, we got the wars between labor and capital,
workers and capitalists over who's the who's the source of value. And that completely ignored the
role of energy. And so the neoclassical economists starting in the 1870s continued to build on this
separation from a biophysical physiocrat explanation of our wealth and productivity,
kind of at the same time that coal started to expand, we had just found oil and we started
the Industrial Revolution in earnest. Then what happened in the field of economics and the
description of our productivity and bring us gradually up to the present moment?
Well, you had Kanay having a theory of production, which is fundamentally a
multiplier version of investment and being multiplied by transfer between different sectors
and so on. The first mathematical models came out with both Marx and the classical school
and the neoclassical school. But there was still no, there's we're used to today, no models,
no series of production, which is the mathematical equation saying here are your inputs, there's
your GDP as output. So until that point, it was just stories and rhetoric. And all of a sudden,
then at the late 19th century, we started to put math to it and equations.
Marshall and Volra and Jevons being the main three that did that,
Marshall adding into the 1920s. But the first attempt to have an actual school,
aggregate production function. So trying to relate the aggregate level of output
to the aggregate level of inputs at the level of a macro economy, the first attempt to do that
in the neoclassical school was the Cobb-Douglas production function. And in both the
Marshall's work and in Jevons work, you can find this idea of inputs having marginal
productivity. So you put a certain amount of labor in and you get a certain level of output,
you add more labor, you get not as much increase in output as the previous level,
but still some positive returns. So this idea of marginal productivity of labor
and marginal productivity of machinery, which turned up in the neoclassical theory.
And I think in 1898 or late 1890s, JB Clark developed the marginal productivity theory
of income distribution, which said that workers receive the marginal product
capitalists receive their marginal product. And so that concept became built into neoclassical
theory. So the wage is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last worker
hired and the rate of profit is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last
meat machine turned on. But how did they know what percentage of the value of the
product that was created was from the worker and from the machine?
Well, they didn't actually know in that sense and they're wrong with the answers they gave.
But the basic concept with the marginal productivity theory of income distribution
was that the marginal products would be based upon the share of income going to different
what economists call factors of production. So if labor gets 75% of GDP, and that was roughly
the term that applied in the 1920s, and capitalists get 25%, then the marginal product of labor
is 0.75 and the marginal product of capital is 0.25. So that was the general expectation,
but nobody put a mathematical number on it until Cob and Douglas, one being a mathematician,
the other being an economist. Douglas being the economist.
And this was 1920s, 1930s?
1928, I think it was. Cob and Douglas?
Yeah. So they had painstakingly assembled a set of index numbers. Again, this is why
it's important to know your history because as well as knowing how things happen, you also know
the context in which they happen. And today we're used to getting GDP figures off the
Bureau of Economic Analysis every three months. And then we get a breakdown of the
distributions from different sectors, and there's huge tables and statisticians,
groups of statisticians that are involved in making this all look consistent. Back then,
there were no numbers. There was one person maintaining an index series for GDP,
but there were no numbers on the amount of labor and no numbers on the amount of machinery.
So Douglas made up fairly carefully, but put together a number of different
series that he could find to produce an index of labor, an index of capital,
and had this index of the output of machinery, not the entire GDP, that was pretty existing at the
time, and put together the data, annual data between 1899 and 1922. And then fitted that data,
the mathematician Cobb doing the work there. Again, of course, this is on paper.
We probably had manual calculators back then. I imagine that would be extremely expensive.
They would have existed. Maybe it was done by hand, but the calculations were much,
much more painstaking than we used to today by pumping numbers into a computer programming,
almost instantly getting the result. So just 23 numbers, all index numbers,
all starting at 118 and 99, and then going through to different values in 1922.
And when they did a regression against that, they use what's called a homogenous of degree one
production function. And what that means is that you had output being some constant, and it was a
constant, not a variable, a constant, multiplied by capital raised to one power times labor raised
to one minus that power. And so the question was, what is the term? I'll call it alpha here,
because they use k and one minus k, and that's getting too confusing. Most economists use alpha
for the share of machinery in GDP, or share of capitalists in GDP. Now, back at the time,
roughly speaking, the share of capitalists in GDP is 25%. So the value for alpha is 0.25,
and therefore the value for one minus alpha is 0.75. And the reason it's homogenous of degree one,
if you multiply all labor and all capital, you double it, you get twice as much output,
because the exponents sum to one. So that's the term they found. And lo and behold,
the regression came back with values of 0.76 and 0.24. And they said, hey, this is so close to what
we expected. That's pretty close to 0.75 and 0.25. Yeah. So they got a number which, and in fact,
I've redone it just using a modern program, of course, and I get exactly 0.25. So you get a
very strong apparent confirmation of their data. And the correlation, they gave this a correlation
coefficient. The r squared is the square of that, of course. And the r squared for doing it now is
0.94. Now, the correlation coefficient is 0.97. The response all looks fabulously high correlation
coefficient. And it fits exactly what we expected from Neoclassical Theory. Now, they got a lot
of pushback initially, but that was a major reason for why it became so popular, because
the results looked very strong and they supported Neoclassical Theory.
But the entire formula was based on a data set from 1899 to 1922.
Yep. And what Cobb and Douglas did, they showed the numbers, the regression for
regressing GDP against the index for capital and the index for labor. But they said that their
change data also gave the same correlation coefficient at 0.97. And what they used was not
what we do use today, which is the annual change in the indices would take the log and
the log difference. Or they'd look at percentage rate of change and say, what's the percentage
rate of change? That when you do it, and this is where I start finding a bit of, you know,
there's a hole in the bucket, derelizor, derelizor. The correlation coefficient that they claimed
was 0.97 for exactly the same value of alpha. So you got to, you know,
confirming, you didn't just get the high correlation with what's your GDP and out labor
and capital, which are all growing. Okay, so there's a code word, you know,
the fact that they're all rising at the one time will give you high correlation. They said,
same correlation coefficient, same value for alpha. When I do it over the alpha of minus 0.15.
And why is that? Because they didn't use the annual, the percentage change,
they use the three year moving average. And I don't know, I wouldn't be able to find their
original notes, but it wasn't the same result that they got for the data, which was all rising at
one time. And any statistician will tell you that if you have data, which is all rising,
you're going to get a high correlation coefficient just because they're all growing,
not because they're related to each other. So we should be looking for the differences
and try to get something where the trend should be around zero. And even that doesn't apply to
the first differences here. But in other words, they didn't get the results that people accepted
that they did. And the confidence people had in the results wasn't justified.
But people were confident. Like in the 1930s and 1940s, this was considered a valid and
profound explanation of the inputs and outputs of an economic system describing our wealth and
productivity. Yeah, now we had all sorts of other approaches to how your model production in the
meantime. And there was a long time, and this actually still applied when I was doing my PhD
back in the 1980s, or 1990s, that the neoclassical economists were doing what they call computable
general equilibrium models. And these models had an input output table as part of their production
system. Now, that's all sorts of issues for them, which would dig in that's
tangential, what we're talking about. But at the same time, you had the rise of the what they call
themselves the new classical economists. And these are neoclassical economists who wanted to revive
the idea of the market economy being perfectly flexible, get rid of this nasty Keynesian stuff.
And they started using much more commonly the Cobb-Douglas production function because they
replaced an input output model for the production today with the idea of production over time.
And they went back to a single commodity idea. This is the aggregate production function. Of
course, they use the Cobb-Douglas production function. Now, we had 30 or 40 years of that,
and typical neoclassicals, they don't know their own history. They've forgotten they
ever used anything different to that. And all of them use a Cobb-Douglas production function.
And they've all done what Solo brought in in the 1950s. And that's bringing in what they call
technological change as part of the system. So they have output as a product of the state of
technology, which they use the capital that are A for, what applied by labor to one minus alpha
times capital to alpha. And that's where I think everything went wrong. Not that there was already
going wrong with Cobb-Douglas, but this is where you got-
Well, there's already gone wrong with Adam Smith.
Yeah. It's era after era. Economics is, I can define economics as compound era.
Right. We're going to eventually translate all this because I'm mostly tracking with,
I mean, you're an economist and you're a friend and you care about the system of humans and our
planet. But you're also here, you're functioning as a historian, which is a totally separate skill
that you have. And I've talked to you offline on what you've all been working on. And it's
quite the detective story. So keep going and bring us up to the present. So what did Solo do?
Well, you started with the Cobb-Douglas having their function was a constant multiplied by
L over the one minus alpha times K to the K to the alpha as the production function.
Now, then one of the criticisms that was made of Cobb-Douglas by other neoclassicals,
there's always technological change here. And Solo said, well, we can bring technological change in.
This is in 1956 and says 57. We can bring it in. And the way we have to do it, there's a cost,
I'll actually read them here. The new wrinkle I want to describe is an elementary way of
segregating variations in output per head due to technical change than those due to changes in
the availability of capital per head. Naturally, every additional bit information has its price.
In this case, the price consists of one new required time series,
which is the share of labor in total income, and one new assumption. And here we go.
That factors are paid their marginal products.
There was rather than being a mathematical derivation by Cobb-Douglas that alpha is 0.25 and
one minus alpha is 0.75. Let's just assume that they're what the current value is of
the share of labor and capital in output are alpha is 0.3, which means capital is get 30% of
output and labor gets 0.7. So we just assume that and then we fit the data to the, we have
a data series for labor, a data series for capital, a data series for GDP. We don't have
technology. So the gap between the result we get for GDP and the sum of labor and capital
is what they call the growth of technological change. And that ended up being 0.85.
So 85% of the variation in output was explained not by the proportions of labor and capital to
each other, but by this technological component. And that became known as a solar residual.
So hold on a second. So from 1928 onwards, they had 75% was described by labor and 25%
by capital of our productivity. Productivity is basically could be could be said our wealth
change year over year. Then 30 years later, they changed it and said that 85% is
unexplained, but it's by some change in technology. And how does technology,
how does technology in solos definition versus your definition, how does technology differ from
capital? Well, this is the problem. Technology, in my opinion, is embodied in the capital.
In that sense, when we have technological change, what we get is new machines that have a higher
capacity to process energy and produce more complex goods than the previous ones had.
So Cobb and Douglas, when that stands right, not to differentiate our technology and capital,
but by bringing in this idea of a residual. First of all, he assumed that the exponents
for labor and capital were given by income distribution data. By that stage, it was 30%
going to capitals rather than 25%. So he did do data from the 1920s to the 1950s and the 0.25,
0.75 shifted to 0.3 and 0.7. That's what he found. When he's looking at his paper, he does
include the national distribution of income. And it's pretty much the 30%, 70% can't be a
capital of some workers. But he looked at the numbers and said, wait a minute,
there's something not right here. And when you find a residual of something, a residual effect,
sometimes it's 5% or 10%. But in his case, it was 85%. The vast majority of the productivity
could not be described by capital and labor. Well, actually, 87.5% is your paper. And that's
okay in one sense. You can say, well, the most of our improvement isn't a case of adding more
labor or more capital or getting the ratio between labor and capital correct. It's technological
change. But fundamentally, that was because technological change turns up on the machines.
And the labor component, when we're talking about unskilled workers, you basically have people
working on a process line. I've actually done that at some stage in my youth. But you just
get told now, press this button, pull this lever, press that put that thick, that hanging
the jig on that watch and we'll call it. And that's your role. Okay. So what where the technological
change actually turns up is in the machine itself. So if you go back before I worked as a manual
hand inside a factory one stage, you would have used rivets to weld aluminium together. And now
you're using spot welding machines. And so the technology is actually embodied in the machinery.
And this is where the confusion of machines with money becomes a reason why your mind gets clouded
if you don't distinguish the two. But the terms we use capital for machinery and capital for money
and capitalists for the social class does confuse the matters. And what I'm talking
about is progressive confusion. Yeah, I'm a little confused myself now. But I know you're
telling a really important story, which you outlined to me on the phone. I mean, on our call
earlier this week. So keep going. And by the way, from Marx onward, Marx and Cobb and Douglas,
and Solo in the 1950s, they're all using terms like land and capital and technology. And the word
energy is found nowhere in these papers, correct? The only one who really does, I mean, for example,
Marshall talks about energy. He uses the word 79 times in his Principles of Economics. Every last
time talking about the innovative spirit of humans, not energy. Right. Energy is our, yeah,
not fossil energy, but energy and spirit. Yeah, human spirit. So he actually talked about energy
as various raw materials, which of course contain energy, coal and oil as inputs. But when it came
to talking about energy itself, there was no awareness of the theories of thermodynamics,
or the role of energy as a production force. Whereas in Marx, Marx was actually reading
the early thermodynamic workers and going to lectures in London and so on. So there's more
awareness of the role of energy in Marx than there is in the neoclassicals. But what's happened
is energies dropped completely out of the picture at this stage. So first of all, Cobb and Douglas
give you a theory of production, which fits the marginal productivity theory of income distribution.
They give you coefficients, which are what neoclassicals expect them to do, but they're derived
from the data. And then along comes a solo and said, let's assume those coefficients are correct.
So the marginal product of labor is 0.7 and it is equal to their contribution, their share of GDP.
And then let's work out the residual on all I got 87.5. But that's okay. We're talking about
technological change. But it was an unnecessary fudge. And it then shielded neoclassical economists
from looking at the data again to see whether the share of workers in GDP is equivalent to the
contribution that labor makes to output and capital makes to output. And that's where it goes all
awry because when you take a look at the data that Sola was looking at and data subsequent to that,
and you do a regression based on the change in white GDP, the change in labor and change in
capital, rather than getting a coefficient for labor of a capital of 0.3, which is close to the
income distribution, you get a coefficient for capital of 0.85. And that suddenly means hang on
a sec, we've got a contradiction between an empirically derived term for the contribution of
capital to output and the theory of income distribution, the return to capital is actually
much higher. So the exponent of the capital is much higher than capital share in GDP.
And suddenly, we would have seen this if Sola hadn't jumped in with the idea of separating
our technological change from capital itself. Oh, so that was like red herring that took us down a
different flawed pathway on understanding the production function. So what happened after?
Go ahead. Well, leaving energy out all the way through. So what we have is in the neoclassical
camp, the idea that labor and capital get the payment of the labor and capital affects their
marginal product becomes just ingrained in the mindset of neoclassicals. And they stick with
the coefficients that Sola first worked on in 1957 and half a century still today, they haven't
changed them. So if you look in any almost any neoclassical paper, you will assume the exponent
for capital is 0.3 and the exponent for labor is 0.7. Using data that Sola used from 1928 to 1950s.
Yeah, if anybody's smart, they might go and take a look at the income distribution and find that
capital now gets 40% and labor gets 60% so they change to the 0.4 and 0.6. But they simply assume
they can use the income distribution data to choose what the exponents are on the production
function. When you're getting a PhD in economics today or when you were in school, was it a
requirement to read these fundamental papers of Marshall and Cobb Douglas and Marx? No?
No. I mean, this is one of the reasons why neoclassicals, economics has gone so totally off
the rails. They don't even know their own history. And so they, if you go to a, like when I went
through, you had to sit through master's courses on advanced micro and advanced macro and so on.
They were part of, there's now what's called an America ABD, all but dissertation. So you do,
and the American system has enormous coursework load. And I'm not sure. I thankfully, I didn't
go through the American system, but I think something like two thirds of your time is spent
doing courses rather than writing a thesis. And you don't go back, the oldest paper you might read
is one where the Lucas critique was developed in the 1970s. So they just don't know their own
history. What's the Lucas critique? It's another rabbit hole, but arguing that macroeconomic,
macro should be based on micro. That's the fundamental idea behind the Lucas critique.
Okay, so from Adam Smith to Marx to Marshall to Cobb and Douglas to Solo,
we've had a progression away from the physiocrats of something physical back in France. It was land
and the free energy from the earth. And then we had a bonanza of fossil carbon added to our
economic system. What happened next? Solo all the way to the present day, or was there another?
Solo all the way to the present day, in terms of production and function that neoclassicals use.
And then, of course, energy, we've got to bring our people back to energy all the time,
because the thing thing is what happened to energy? We know energy is absolutely critical for
production, but it's left out of these theories. And you then had a group of non-orthodox economists,
Bob Ayers being the main one, a physicist who became fascinated with economics, and then realized
economics didn't include the role of energy and thought we've got to bring energy into production,
working with CUMOL and quite a range of other non-orthodox economists.
I know both Bob and Rainer. And so did I. And you. Yeah.
So for Bob Harding, what about three, four weeks ago?
I know. I know. I saw that. Maybe two months ago. Now, I'm glad I got to see him.
Would have been only two months before he died in Holland at a conference that we caught up.
So working with Bob, I thought we've got to bring energy in. There simply has to be a way
of bringing energy into production. And what CUMOL and Bob were doing was, at some point,
they went from using total numbers to index numbers in what they call the Linux production
function. This was the attempt to bring energy in, but through the legs of the Cobb Douglas
production function. So at some point, they had the idea of index number values for output labor
energy and capital being part of the way they derived the Linux function. And my discomfort
was that was that fundamentally what they were doing, and this is what neoclassicals themselves
have also done, is add energy in as an additional factor of production. So you say the way you
produce output is you combine labor and capital and energy. Now, there's two problems with that.
One is that if you combine labor independently and machinery independently and energy
production independently, you don't have output. You've got an explosion. Energy has to be an input
to labor and capital. And so what have finally occurred to me literally while being in Bob
airs his flat in France, which was full of statues, they're walking through it one day
on a trip from the bathroom. The little thought popped in my brain, labor without energy is a
corpse, capital without energy is a sculpture. And bang, that's it. And I sat down at a table,
five minutes, typing in a program called Matcat as it happens, and feed that into the
Cobb Douglas production function. So the basic idea was that energy is not an independent factor.
It's the fact that you have to input to labor in one form and input into machinery in a different
form. Otherwise, they can't produce anything. So it said differently, the laborers need food and
housing and shelter and such. And the machine's capital need to be turned on and powered by
electricity or heat or movement, which absolutely requires energy. Without energy, the machines
are worthless. Yeah. Now, what then happened out of that was that in the Cobb Douglas production
function, if I fed energy as an input to labor, the basic point was that is the amount number
of workers you've got times how much energy they consume multiplied by how much of that energy is
used in production. Now, if we go back to the days of the Roman slaves, most of the energy they
consumed went into production or fed a pittance, worked to the bone. And therefore, if they got
given like 200 watts equivalent of energy input, they could put out 100 watts output. And so their
factor is 50%. But if you fast forward today, you and I are surrounded by energy. We're consuming
tens of thousands of watts of energy in our houses with our devices, the heating, hot water, etc,
but only a tiny amount of our energy actually now goes into production. And fundamentally,
the amount of physical work we can do runs out at about 100 watts. And I'm terrible on the terms,
by the way, being an economist, I haven't been properly trained on the terms of energy and
watts and jewels and so on. So I'll make all sorts of mistakes there. But the basic point is
the energy input of a worker to production is in terms of actual measures of energy is no greater
than it was 2000 years ago, because we haven't evolved, in any sense, to be able to consume more
energy and output more energy. On the other hand, machinery has had an incredible increase in the
energy input that a machine can take. My favorite instance, I like what Musk is doing with SpaceX,
so I'm a bit of a space junkie. And a friend of mine was being abusive about this last rocket
blowing up. And I finally, I worked out what was the energy equivalent of the energy inside
that rocket was one third of a Hiroshima bomb. Now, for that to actually not lead to an explosion,
the devastated Boca Chica, but led to a rocket taking off and reaching 100 kilometers above
the surface in a few minutes. That is the amount of energy that the ultimate machine of our day
can consume. If you go back to James Watt's steam engine, it was about 30 tons of coal a day.
Now, that's a dam site less than one third of a Hiroshima-Shiroshima bomb. So most of what we've
seen as a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we have, has come from that
increase in energy. And now we're cooking with gas in that sense, because we're finally acknowledging
the role of energy in production. But that's not what Neoclassical is doing, of course.
So, this was a story of kind of false turns at intersections all the way. And now,
what would a Neoclassical economist listening to this last 45 minutes say to you in rebuttal or
defense or contradiction or alarm? I'm going to get a bit of fun here. Rudy,
if you're listening, Rudy Bachman solved me the case of saying what a Neoclassical economist would
say by actually saying what he said in a paper, because now I'm going to come down to how economists
on the very few occasions have tried to include energy in a Cobb-Doctor's production function,
what they've done, and what they've therefore reduced about the role of energy in production.
And I really think I haven't got a sense of him, but I laugh at him all the time. So,
I want to show why I do that. So, Bachman and Ko, about three or four authors,
wrote a paper for a German language working paper with an English translation on the issue of what's
going to happen to output in GDP of Germany if we're cut off from Russian energy during the
Ukraine war. And the argument they made was that was done by saying, we're going to include energy
in the Cobb-Doctor's production function. Now, what they did, and this is where the mistakes
compound upon mistakes, is they took the standard coefficients of 0.7 and 0.3 and then said,
let's allocate 0.04 of capital's coefficient to energy. So, you've still got the same
homogeneous production function. Because energy is 4% of GDP. Therefore, okay, the coefficient is 0.04,
and this is where you get the total, this is where the twist comes in.
Because the coefficient is 0.04, the mathematics of the Cobb-Doctor's production function that
entails you, that the contribution of energy to change in output is also 0.04.
But all of the labor and all of the machinery is fully dependent on the energy?
Far more important. Now, here, I'm going to get some quotes out of Rudy here. Okay.
So, they compared their work to what's called the Lyontia production function. We haven't
even mentioned yet, but I'll bring that in now. And Lyontia, vassally Lyontia was one of the few
winners of the Nobel Prize that I absolutely applaud. He was a Russian mathematician, stroke
economist, and he gave us input-output analysis and a whole range of other positive contributions.
But when looking at the ratio, a good level of capital, a level of output, in most economies,
doing whatever, however the numbers were developed, what he realized was the ratio of labor to a
capital to output was roughly constant, different between different countries, very different
between developing and developed countries. But generally speaking, the ratio, whichever
your way was roughly constant. And he then said you could use that as an aggregate production
function. So, rather than saying the aggregate level of output is, you know, labor to one power
times capital one minus that power, you said output is capital divided by capital output ratio.
And it was just an empirical regularity. And the post-Keynesian school, which I'm part of,
basically said that'll be our production function. So, rather than the complicated neoclassical with,
you know, exponents and marginal products, et cetera, et cetera, we just say output
is K divided by V. And V normally, in terms of the conventional figure, people normally used
about point, about three for the value of V. So output each year is one third the value of capital
that same year. And that's what, and then we get ridiculed for that. And because they say, oh,
you don't enable the possibility of substitution between labor and capital as input. So you must
be less sophisticated than we are with the production function that can enable for substitution
of labor for capital. So Rudy then dived in this and took a look and compared
the Cobb-Douglas production function to the Leontief using a form which is called
constant elasticity of substitution. But I won't go into that. Basically, in regard to Cobb-Douglas,
one extreme of that and the Leontief at the other. And they said that if you have the
standard Cobb-Douglas production function, then it tells you you have a 10% fall in energy inputs.
You will have a 0.4% fall in GDP. So we lose 10% of our energy and GDP goes down by 0.4%.
Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's ridiculous. I know. You and I both know that's ridiculous,
but he didn't know that because they don't look at the data. So what they then said was that,
and this is the quote from Rudy's paper, the heading is extreme scenarios with low
elasticity of substitution and why Leontief production at the macro level is nonsensical.
So they had the blue dashed line and the figure shows that output falls one for one
with energy supply in the Leontief case. The marginal product of energy jumps to 1 over alpha,
which is the exponent they use for it, so 1 over 0.04. While the marginal product of the other
factors falls to 0, and then here's an assumption. If factor prices equal marginal products,
this then implies the price of energy jumps to 1 over alpha and prices of others fall to 0.
This also implies expenditure energy jumps to 100%, blah, blah, blah. We consider these
predictions to be economically nonsensical. They are, but not because the Leontief case is wrong.
Leontief actually fits the data. It's because the assumption that wages equal marginal product of
labor is wrong. So it's an empirical contradiction of the neophysical theory of production.
And the basic argument is that they think that production is quite insensitive to energy. That's
also a quote from the paper. So because the exponent of 0.04, that means that 10% change in
energy causes 0.4% change in output. So labor is far more significant than capital
second, and energy are far distant third. When you look on the data, energy is 100% of the answer.
Explain that. I mean, what is the truth based on all your work with Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuhl
and others? What is the actual equation of labor and capital and whatever other variables?
The basic truth is that the output is fundamentally energy transformed into a useful form.
If you take a look at the rate of growth of energy, the rate of change of energy,
and the rate of change of GDP at the global level, you find a correlation coefficient for them,
and I'm looking for this now, of 0.7 roughly. And the relationship between change in GDP
and change in energy is 0.97 times change in energy. So in other words, fundamentally what
GDP is, is energy transformed into useful work. And so the core flawed assumption, which is taken
built upon some basic flawed assumptions and changed over centuries, is that
we can describe our wealth. I mean, it's almost like there's been a supernova the last two centuries
of energy use and wealth and productivity, and people are just trying to scramble in real time,
putting math equations on that, and increasingly divorced from the truth because the supernova
keeps growing. And so the energy blindness is that adding more energy, particularly
energy dense, fossil energy to the whole thing every year, that itself, that little addition
of more energy is a big explainer of our productivity. It's the fundamental explainer.
And therefore if we, and what we've really done over time is develop machines which can handle
more and more energy, more and more precisely, that's where our wealth has come from. And we're,
again, economists have been blind to that by having this, first of all, inversion by David Smith to
throw out the physiocrats and say, labor's the source of value. And then you have the neoclassical
saying it's labor and capital. Then you had Cobb and Douglas saying, well, it's 0.7 and 0.3,
which means that the contribution of labor to change in output is 70%. And the contribution of
capital is 30%. That then gets locked in by a solo to turning their empirical non-discovery
into an assumption, and then putting it all in technological change which becomes disembodied
from capital itself, but also hides them from the fact that the relationship doesn't hold up on the
data any more anyway. And now when they come bringing energy, they just tack it on as a third
factor and give it a coefficient based on the percentage of energy in GDP, which is trivially
low, and therefore say energy has almost no role in production, which is complete bullocks.
And part of the reason is that the energy input into our machines and into our economy
is only the cost of energy that it is to extract, plus a little profit for the
oil company or whatever. It's not the value that it provides, which is four or five years
of my physical labor and all that. An inch per hour of oil. Yeah.
I mean, seriously, this is Nobel Prize sort of observation, I think, because it's so decoupled
from what people say at high positions of authority in our world. Again, I'll ask you,
what is just a standard economist, not Rudy, someone you know, but just anyone listening
to this who has a PhD in economics or maybe someone who's in grad school getting a master's
or a PhD in economics listening to this program. Is their initial reaction going to be one of
critical rejection? Steve doesn't know what he's talking about, or is it like, yeah?
Absolutely. I mean, because it affects their identity or because they know otherwise in
their research? It affects their identity. I mean, if a younger one might actually go,
hang on, that's surprising, you'll get a few who might react that way and change,
but the old ones are locked in their ways. Okay, so speak to the young ones right now.
If they're curious about this and something doesn't sit right with what they've been told
and what they've just heard, what would you recommend that they do to get clarity on the
truth? The main thing is to realize that economics can't be derived from the laws of
thermodynamics, but it can't be inconsistent with them either. And what you're being taught with
your production functions and so on is leaving out the role of energy in an absolutely critical
way. Now, if you go and want to do it empirically, you go and take a look at what is the relationship
between energy and production, drive it empirically, and you'll find that it's somewhere
between like a point in GDP is 0.7 to say 0.95, my 0.97 has gotten that particular XL regression
of the value of change in GDP. So the fundamental insight from a thermodynamical point of view
within economics is that the first to a first approximation, GDP is energy turned into useful
work. And then that means that the whole argument you were taught in neoclassical economics that
the wage reflects the marginal product of labor is completely wrong. The wage and the return to
capital for that matter have nothing to do with their contribution to production. What labor and
capital do is harness energy successfully in factories to produce output. And that will
normally be done with machines that machines have very fixed ratios of per workers per machine
and energy throughput per machine. So fundamentally, you get a fixed ratio on that sense. Leontief
is an empirical observation we now have an explanation for that explanation is that the
Leontief production function is actually output is equal to machinery,
multiplied by the efficiency with which machines turn energy into useful work.
Neoclassical economists, I mean back when I was in school are among the smartest people in my class
and smart people can be fooled, but they're not dumb. So like really, it still today boggles
my mind how neoclassical economists can totally neglect energy given anyone with three minutes
on the internet can find that a barrel of oil has 5.7 million BTUs in it, which is a lot of energy
relative to the 0.6 kilowatt hours that I do per day. So what do they really think this?
They really do. And the trouble is this is where your mind gets set by your training.
So if you get trained on the idea that production is a combination of technology,
labor and capital and energy doesn't even turn up there, you don't even think about energy and
you can be completely energy blind in the sense that I now leave that book with that it would
like we know him is no better, much about energy is fish do about water. They simply take it for
granted. And then you see this when neoclassicals actually come to pose themselves the question
of what is the role of energy in production. So this is again, this is from the paper by
Backman and Co about the impact of the loss of Russian energy on German output. And they
to take the Bob Douglas production function and differentiate it with respect to the inputs
and then say that the role of it, we can say what's going to happen to GDP from a change in
energy. And here's a quote from the paper. Therefore, for example, a drop in energy supply
of minus 10% reduces production by 0.4%, which shows that production is quite insensitive
to energy as expected. This is expected to be quite insensitive to energy as expected.
Expected on neoclassical economists. Right, it's a tautology of sorts. It's a tautology. They
think that energy has a trivial role because it has no role in their production function.
But why aren't there people calling them on this? Like a prime minister or a senator or a CEO?
They all do one unit of economics. They all get the idea of labor and capital producing output
and the production function if they go that detailed in first year. But fundamentally,
they get taught the whole idea that we get paid our factor products. And that actually
ideologically is very reinforcing for a CEO because it says my enormous weight per salary
is because of my huge contribution to production. So it ends up having an ideological role and that
lines them to the physical reality that you simply don't have that impact on production.
If you come down to the nuts and bolts of it, it's energy which is producing the output and you
are getting a share of it and now an overblown share given your system and the power structure
of capitalism. So if we truly defined energy correctly in the production function, that giant
gift from nature might not all be funneled to the top the way it is now. And that of course leads
to one of the reasons why people continue being energy blind because it enables them to be blind
to their outsize share of the wealth of the civilization that goes their way.
And also continues to indicate why we're blind to the waste component as well. Because if you
include that, that reduces, yeah. Yeah. The other side of the production function is waste. And
when I do the ontario function which makes sense with the empirical reinterpretation or the logical
reinterpretation of the empirical regularity of the ontario, that output is capital divided by
capital output ratio. The coming output is capital times the efficiency with which machines turn
energy to useful work. That coefficient is going to be less than 0.5, substantially less than 0.5.
So it means most of what we've used is waste, waste energy. It can quantify it and say if the
energy, the efficiency with which machines turn energy useful work is about roughly 0.2 or 0.25,
then 0.8 to 0.75 is of energy input produces waste. And that's what we dump into the environment.
And that of course feeds back and damages our capacity to produce output. If we had that inside
50 or 60 years ago, we would never have got to the conundrum hour and now of relying so much
upon fossil fuel energy for our production today. Okay. I'm going to ask you an easier question,
but it might be a harder question for you specifically, Steve. What would you tell to a
graduate student learning about the world in another discipline like philosophy or French
or chemistry or biology who will never take a class in economics? Can you, to those people,
why is it important that energy underpins the production function and that our economists
and therefore our politicians and such have been misled about the core driver of our wealth
the last century plus? Fundamentally, human civilization only exists because we exploit energy.
If we didn't have energy in the form of the coal and oil deposits we found,
we would still be sitting around fireplaces starting fires with flints. We might have
moderately sophisticated culture to the stage that you got with your animal power and slave power
under Romans and the medieval period and serfs and so on, but there wouldn't be the philosophy,
there wouldn't be the art, there wouldn't be the computers that we take for granted today.
So if we don't understand the role of energy, we don't understand where our civilization came from.
And how does your view and that of Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuml and other what we might call
biophysical economists or in your case post-Keynesian economists, how does your current
understanding of energy and the production function differ from the biophysical economists that
started to gain traction in the 1970s? You know, Howard Odom and George Eskier-Roligan and
Charlie Hall and such. Is it nuance? Is it different?
It is just basically finding a better way to put it together. I mean, for example,
Bob of course was in the house when I made that discovery with the listang in his flat.
And it took me 10 minutes or less to work out the mathematics. It's ridiculously simple,
but he then just said that that solves it, that that rings in the role of energy.
So because he and Odom thought making energy and input into the labor and capital,
they had energy as a third factor. And once you just say it's got to be an input,
it all falls apart, falls together by the way. I totally agree with that. But here's what I
don't understand. If we don't have energy, all technologies are sculptures and I added to your
statement and said cities are museums. But we do have energy and we're probably going to have
less energy in the future. But how we use that energy, how we combine that energy with materials
and human imagination and creativity, that does add something to just the raw value of the energy.
So it's the combination of machines, raw materials like copper and silicon and
phosphorus, neodymium and water and phosphorus and the fire, some electrons or flame,
either kinetic or potential energy. And that comes up with a product that humans value.
And so how do you distinguish the contribution of actually the flame or the electrons versus
the machine and the new invention? I'm actually going to go right back to 1774
and give you an explanation for that. And I quote this in my new book, because I think Turgo
wrote one of the most brilliant paragraphs in the history of economics. And I just wish this had
been where economics came from rather than 1776, two years later, with Adam Smith. So, pardon me,
reading out a substantial slaver and looking above the camera to do it. The husband and the
mistakes are seen as just being without agriculture as any production system, including manufacturing,
obviously. The husband and the man is the only person whose labor produces something over and
above the wages of labor. He is therefore the sole source of all wealth. The land pays him
directly the price of his labor, independently of any other man or agreement. Nature does not
bargain with him to oblige him to content himself with what is absolutely necessary,
what she grants his proportional neither to his wants nor would have contractual valuation of
the price of his days of labor. And this is one of the punchlines. It is the physical result of
the fertility of the soil and of the wisdom, far more than of the laboriousness of the means with
which he is employed to render it fertile. So that's the role of humans in evolving concepts,
changing how we bring out the energy. As soon as the labor of the husband produces more than his
wants, he can with this superfluity that nature records him as a pure gift over and above the
wages of his soil. There's energy return and energy invested by the laborers of the other
members of society. This latter and selling to him gain only their livelihood, but the husband
who gathers beyond his subsistence a wealth which is independent and disposable, which he has not
bought and which he sells. Now all the ideas we're talking about are tied up in that one paragraph.
Earlier you said you had a quote that you start with a seed and you plant it and nature gives
you back 1000 seeds. But what if the husband was really clever and found out a way to plant a seed
and get back 2000 seeds? The gift would still be from nature, but it was doubled because of his
creativity and intelligence. And that's the line in the middle. It is the physical result of the
fertility of the soil and of the wisdom, far more so than the laboriousness. So in the tens of wisdom
what he's saying is we devise new ways of doing different things and that wisdom is far more
important than the effort we put in physically to do it. So again our ideas play an essential role
and we wouldn't be able to exploit this free energy without our minds that can devise new ways
of harnessing the energy far more rapidly and far more effectively. So the wisdom is definitely
in there and the wisdom itself turns up in the machines. So it is embodied in the machines. So
all this stuff, he said right back in 774, that paragraph has far more wisdom than the whole
wealth of nations. So this is all kind of testable, although we're on a roller coaster ride.
So I think there's a possibility and I know this is a totally separate conversation that
we could lose 20% of our energy in coming decades for various reasons or more. But let's just say
20%. So I would think that would cause a 20% or more drop in GDP. What would economists say?
Let's say of course 0.8% drop in GDP. 0.8. Yeah, that's a strict time.
Do you think most economists actually believe that?
Yep, I do. I've worked with them for long enough to know they swallow this stuff. So
if you look at the data, like changing in GDP and changing in GDP, that's figure 57 at the
moment in my book. It may change, but it's such a one-for-one relationship is ridiculous.
And yet they don't even look at it. And when Rudy and Berkman and friends made that comment
about the 0.10% fall in energy, 0.4% fall in GDP, obviously they didn't look at the data and they
ridiculed Leonty of when Leonty have actually reproduced the data.
That would be like the opposite of a Nobel Prize. We should develop something like that.
Well, the Nobel Prize is the opposite of a Nobel Prize. Do you think you are aware of that?
No, I don't. Okay, so there's that.
In economics, yeah. Synergy.
All right. Big, big picture. Let's move to the stratosphere here. What are the implications
of everything that you've said for our modern society and for our future and for our decisions
and planning for that moment? The fundamental grounding is that without energy, there is no GDP.
And we have been getting our energy out of fossil fuel forms. And of course, with fossil fuels,
we generate carbon dioxide that is causing global warming. And that is destabilizing the climate
on which our production systems depend. And we've been blind of that, particularly the
economists who so-called specialists in climate change, William Nordhaus and friends,
have no idea of this either. Right. So that's another flaw in the production function is there's
not the waste capacity that feeds back in to the biosphere that is our only source of wealth,
because without oxygen and viable ecosystems, we all die.
Yeah. Now, that's not concluded in the way the neoclassicals think about climate change.
And that's why you've got nonsense statements by Nordhaus, for example, saying that it's really,
really difficult to find any direct impacts of the expected climate change on the bulk of the
economy in the next 50 to 75 years. Now, by the bulk of the economy meant all of manufacturing,
even included all of mining, services, industries, government, et cetera, et cetera,
you can see no way in which climate change will affect that. Well, if we have energy,
if we get like a blanket ban on using fossil fuels because of totally destructive change
to the climate in the next five years or so, or 10 years, there'll be an incredible plunge
in JDP, and we're not prepared for it at all. And I think if James Hansen and his colleagues
are right, we're going to have a spike in climate warming temperatures in 2024 because we're shifting
from the PDO from La Niña to El Niño on the backs of the sulfur aerosols being reduced as a
masking of the thermal inertia. So we're going to see, and if we go up a half a degree Celsius
next year, as they're suggesting, that's going to have massive impacts around the world. And then,
yes, you're right, people are going to be like, oh my God, this is like real and our emissions are
rising and fossil energy is to blame. But I think most people still don't understand the deep
linkage between fossil energy and the size and scope of our economy because they're energy blind.
Yeah, and economists have contributed to this blindness rather than
clarifying that it's absolutely essential. And on your previous podcast here, this is your third
appearance on this show, you predicted that economists, because of their identities and
status and built personal situation, they will not change until there's a crisis.
So can we anticipate what's going to happen with the environment, with oil depletion,
though that's going to happen gradually, with what's coming and create some blueprints and
break grass in case of emergency plans that are actually based on what a physiocrat might
advise the French king, the modern equivalent of that? Can we do that?
I think it's incredibly late timing to be doing that. But as you know, we've depended on fossil
fuels for about 85% of our energy. And that hasn't changed much in the last 20 years. It's gone down
to some extent for some time because of growth in fossil fuel production decline in hydroelectric,
which is the main form. That's the main form of renewables even now as hydroelectric,
it's not wind and solar. So we're going to see quite serious climate catastrophes coming our
way. The ones with most of the climate scientists I'm in touch with are scared about are global
famine caused by a collapse in food output from one of the wheat belts or corn belts of the world.
And that then leading to a social breakdown because suddenly we haven't got the food we need.
Or wet bald catastrophes, the other one, which would hit third world countries more than it
would hit Westerns probably. But something which is catastrophic, which causes a massive
collapse in population and then leads to probably rogue behavior by governments around the world,
then because we haven't managed to even reach an agreement to phase our fossil fuels at the
last cop out meeting. It'll be every country for itself in what could be a very chaotic environment,
will be a very chaotic environment if we see something like a global famine.
So you're saying that we shouldn't look to the neoclassical economists who are the
current economic shaman and cheerleaders of our cultural narrative of the early 21st century.
We shouldn't look to them to change their minds and chart a different course.
They will be the most shocked and most confused about what happens completely. They're useless.
They've led us astray. It's just been a cascade of errors right back to Smith, as I've said,
that led us to the situation. But the last people have any understanding of the physical
role of production on the planet are economists. And the last ones who realize the dangers of
climate change are also economists. So I would just kick them out of the room. They don't belong here.
I tend to agree, but let me play devil's advocate. There are a lot of bright,
pro-future young people in college, in graduate school, in postgraduate. Couldn't some of them
take the kernels of truth bombs that you've been laying out here and contribute to the science
and understanding and translate between what you're saying and what the traditional neoclassical
economics departments around the world? I suspect your answer is going to be no, because
their boss and the people that gets the funding are the tenured economists, and they're not going
to fund this sort of research. Or what do you think?
It's your waste of time. Some of the young ones are worth reaching to say, look,
if the cards say, join rethinking economics, fight against your curriculum. But fundamentally,
if you want people to give you a guidance right now, it's going to be the engineers.
And they're the ones we should be. Get the engineers to look at it. The first thing an
engineer is going to look at is the energy supply. That's the nature of training of engineers. It's
all about how you use energy and how you direct it to produce useful outcomes rather than blowing
things up. So the engineers are the ones we need to rely upon, and we should have been getting them
to build the alternative technologies in the last 40 or 50 years, rather than
getting a lot of them to go off and work out as financial engineers instead and give a speculative
bubbles in real estate and shares. So we have had a huge misdirection of our intelligence
for the last 40 or 50 years. And again, economists, it'll blame for that.
When does your book come out? And what's it called?
Hopefully it'll be coming out. It depends upon the publishers process, of course,
but hopefully by March, I would say. And the title is going to be the Rebuilding Economics
from the top down. Well, I've read the energy chapter and it is quite compelling.
Steve, this is, I mean, you and I talk about what's going on now in the world,
but I didn't know a lot of the things that you have dug up by reading these original papers.
You also told me that most people in economics don't even read these original papers.
No, they never go back and read the originals. It's just terrible.
So this was a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes treatment of the history of the production
function and the complete absence of energy in describing our wealth and productivity.
And yet, energy is embedded in everything, including the labor and capital functions.
Do you have any closing words for listeners who might be a little shell-shocked by this conversation?
Just the main thing comes down to how economists, by not understanding energy,
have trivialized the dangers of climate change. So we are likely to see that striking this decade.
I mean, we both know the potential 0.5 degree increase in global temperatures out of the
both El Nino plus the hypothetical role of losing, leaving the sulfur emissions as
moving, masking some increase in global temperatures. That should cause absolutely
chaotic weather, probably starting in the next northern summer. So it's going to be brutally
certain that this starts happening and we have to prepare as soon as possible so all the XRI
activists dial it up. Engineers start realizing we have to, as soon as possible, start producing
whatever alternatives we can work out to reduce the amount of carbon we're putting into the
atmosphere as soon as possible. That's the most important thing to have some potential to
hang onto human civilization over the next two decades. If we don't do it, it's back to the stone age.
Thank you, Steve, as always, to be continued, my friend, and good luck with your book and all your
