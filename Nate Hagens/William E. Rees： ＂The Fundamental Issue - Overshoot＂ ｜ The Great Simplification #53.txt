Oh, how do I introduce my next guest? Let me count the ways.
Bill Reese is a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. He was the
former director of the School of Community and Regional Planning at UBC. He is the originator
of the ecological footprint concept and the co-developer of the method. He is a systems
ecologist long known in circles of scientists talking about global ecological overshoot
of the human endeavor. He is very involved in conversations about sustainable socio-economic
development of our culture and the challenges that we face as a global human species in
the 21st century. This is a rapid fire conversation. Bill is older than me but has much more energy
and I did all I could do to keep up with him. I think many of you will take away some core
insights of our planetary situation from this conversation with Professor Bill Reese.
Greetings, Bill. How do you do, Nate? Good to see you again.
Good to see you again. I was thinking about when preparing for this
when I first met you in person. Do you remember?
I have a clue. It was in 2005, 6, 7-ish at a ecological economics conference in Burlington,
Vermont. And I followed you around. You had a line of ecologist groupies that were trying
to get your attention and I patiently waited my turn to shake your hand.
You get a much better memory than an old guy like me, Nate.
So let's just start at the very basics. You were an ecologist. What is an ecologist
and how did you start thinking when you were a young man that, hey, I want to be an ecologist?
Well, an ecologist is someone who studies the relationships between living organisms
and their natural environment, which includes other living organisms. So it's really the study
of the ecological niche, the way in which organisms fit into the biophysical and biological systems
of which they are a part. Now, the interesting thing is that humans don't consider themselves as
part of ecosystems. So we have this odd situation where ecologists scarcely ever study human beings.
The whole idea of humans in relation to environment has been given over to economists
who know absolutely nothing about ecology. In fact, I once wrote a paper in which I argued that
economists really ought to be ecologists and vice versa, but it's never gone anywhere. We still have
that separation of silos so that ecologists don't study humans generally speaking. I have a really
long story about that and I won't get into it. Let me ask a quick question there. So they teach
human evolution in college, but they don't teach about what that means for our current situation.
So it's kind of like an anesthetized version of human evolution. Are you saying the same thing
happens in ecology that we teach about trophic pyramids and frogs and ecosystems, but they don't
include the human in that? Well, not in the way that we really ought to. Humans are always
noticed as being at the top of the food chain and so on. So when we look at food chains or
energy pyramids, that sort of thing, people are in there, but there's no real discussion of the
implications or what that means. So for example, if you look really at energy and material flows
through ecosystems today, human beings are the single largest consumer and producer and predator
and carnivore predator and herbivorous species in every single major ecosystem type on the planet.
Now think about that. Have you ever learned anywhere that human beings are the primary
species in every single ecosystem on the planet? Ecologists don't really teach that. They may
think about it themselves, but it's not part of any curriculum anywhere that I'm aware of.
So here we have a very odd situation in our culture. On the one hand, economics, which really
ought to be human ecology, because it's the study of how humans acquire and allocate and
distribute resources, which is a fundamentally ecological question, but it pays no attention
whatsoever to the actual ecosystems with which the economy interacts in the real world. Ecologists
who study primarily non-human species don't really interface in any significant way with
economists. So in some respects, neither economists nor mainstream plant and animal ecologists have
anything useful to say about the human conundrum right now, because one doesn't study the relationship
between humans and the biophysical environment. The other tends to study only non-human species
and ignores the economic implications. When I was, look, I want to go back to my early years. I
was extremely fortunate in having been able to grow up in my youth part-time on my grandparents'
farm in southern Ontario, and it was during that experience of being a farmhand, basically,
along with several other cussions that I recognized, and this was really curious for a 10-year-old,
I suppose, that, you know, the old expression, we are what we eat. So one afternoon, literally just
afternoon, we were sitting in my grandmother's country porch, a huge meal, because we'd all
come in 14 of us from the fields, and we're eating basically everything we had grown up until then,
June. So we're getting our first lettuces and tomatoes and so on and so forth, and it hit me
that everything on my plate, I had actually had some hand in growing. Now, I'm a 10-year-old,
and suddenly it was if somebody had pulled the chair out from under me, I just fell. I felt
like I was in freefall in an elevator and realized how profoundly connected to earth that I was.
We are what we eat, and to get what we eat, we have to expend energy and work and labor,
and here it was on my plate, and I was consuming it directly. It was a general purpose fund. We had
a market garden, 23 dairy cattle, and apple orchards. We were essentially self-sufficient,
and it struck me even then that this was a rare and privileged position to be in, because most of
my city friends had no clue about any of that, that they're connected to nature in any way.
So at 10, your path diverged from being an investment banker or a tech developer to
being an ecologist? Well, that was the first, I suppose, insight into the human ecological
reality that we are of the earth. So it was 10 years later. I was from a working-class family,
but I'm on a scholarship to university, and suddenly I had to make a decision,
what should I study? And I always liked science. I did very well in sciences,
and this whole experience that I just described on the farm came rushing back to me,
and it said, you've really got to learn more about this. You've got to become an ecologist.
So I wanted to be a human ecologist, and this is where I first encountered this
the siloed nature of our educational system. You couldn't be a human ecologist at that time,
unless you studied geography or a weird branch of human ecology in sociology,
which I don't want to get into criticizing the sociologists or the geographers. But what
they were calling human ecology was nothing to do with what I thought of as ecology,
is the biophysical relationships between organisms and their systems, the whole
idea of the thermodynamics of energy and material flows and relationships defined by those kinds
of things. So I was told over and over again, well, we don't do human ecology. There is no
course on human ecology in a biology department. So I had to settle to become an animal ecologist.
My PhD was actually on bird population and competitive ecology. And after I graduated,
I sought a job as a human ecologist. No university would entertain that position. And I mean,
I applied to dozens throughout the United States and Canada. I did get job offers from
three universities, provided that I got abandoned in this human stuff and did my standard bird or
small mammal ecology. And I was astounded, astonished. I finally got a job, but it was not
an ecology at all. I taught in a school of community and regional planning for the whole of my
academic career, because it was the only place at the time. We're going back to the 1970s now,
where I could actually apply what I learned in ecology to human beings freely without being hamstrung
by the departmental this, that, or whatever, over publications and whatnot, in ecology per se.
So I published an enormous amount, but it's not in the standard ecological journals at all.
So why was that the case then? And you and I both know that that is still the case now.
Why do you think that is?
Well, there's a whole number of reasons. But the simplest starting point
is something called human exceptionalism. There's a kind of philosophical underpinning to the whole
of, I suppose, mainstream techno-industrial society. It goes way, way back several hundred years.
But flourished in the, I suppose, the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution
that kept humans separate from nature. We are not like the other species. We are in denial of our
animal nature. And so this isolation or separation of humans from the rest of the nature is why
ecologists don't study human beings and economists in setting up the economy
don't consider it as part of the natural environment. Look at the horrible situation we're in here.
Another problem about human beings we can talk about later is something called the social
construction of reality. And that is we develop mental models of how things are.
And that's all there are mental models based on our beliefs, values, assumptions,
and experience in some cases. And then we articulate these models, we discuss them,
they become formal theories and people buy into them. But then we start to live out of these models
as if they were real. So if we look at economics, we start from the position that humans aren't part
of nature. So the economy is set up as a self-perpetuating, well, it's called the exchange
value model, okay, where you have firms and households. The households spend money on products
produced by firms, but then the firms pay the household salary and dividends so that money
comes back to the households. And so it's a circular self-perpetuating, a circular flow of
exchange value. But the basic models in every single economics textbook and that we're still
teaching in class shows as Herman Daley, the late Herman Daley has frequently pointed out,
and tried to get across, these models make no connection to anything outside themselves.
So we have the economy operating in complete isolation from the environment as a separate,
non-dependent system. And once you believe that and attach to it, the notion that human ingenuity
is our most important natural resource, so that technology will help us out of any kinky situation
we might get into with respect to the natural environment, those two beliefs that were separate
from nature and that technology can handle any residual problems are all you need as a mental
construct, a social construct, to develop a whole world economy based on the idea that there's no
limits to growth that technology can't resolve. And so we have now underpinned our belief in human
exceptionalism. It's now moving forward on a foundation of echolote or economic thinking
that completely ignores the natural environment. Now flip over to the ecological side of things.
Here we have an economy and a set of economic paradigms and laws and strategies and so on
that sees us separate from nature. When any material flows analysis of the kind we've done
in my work shows that humans are the single most important and major species in terms of
material flows through every ecosystem on the planet. So we're operating-
Exactly. And it's getting worse and worse. So how can you possibly imagine governing a planet
where we are the single largest component of every ecosystem using models that don't even
consider us to be connected? Well, here's a thought. So I agree with you that the genesis
of this was human exceptionalism. But now circa 2022, 19 terawatt metabolism,
climate change, species loss, everyone's becoming aware of these things to actually
open up and widely teach and disseminate human ecology is a bit like
having a cancer cell become self-aware. I mean, it's almost like a dangerous thing now to have the
full truth from a human ecological sense. Yes? Or what do you think about that?
Well, it may appear to be dangerous, but I think it's absolutely necessary. You put your finger on
something extremely important here. And that is the very recent awakening to the realities that we
are the fundamental. We're far more important than Tyrannosaurus Rex in any real ecological
consideration. But you know, it's all happened in many respects, almost all important respects,
in just the last hundred, perhaps 200 years. So if you think of the human species, modern,
anatomically modern humans, as being, say, 250,000 years, people keep juggling this number.
It took us the first 250,000 years, basically, of human history to reach 1 billion people
in about 1810. Then in just 100 years, we're more than double that. And in 200 years, by 2010,
we're up at 6, 7, 7 billion by 2010. So there's a 250,000 years to reach 1 billion. And then 200
years, that's 1, 1,250th as much time, we expand by sevenfold. Now, this is because we've become
ecological beings again. For the first long, long period, human population growth was held in check
by negative feedbacks, because we were part of ecosystems. And disease, famines, resource shortages,
those sorts of things kept human populations in check, just like every other species.
Humans are no different from other species in our population dynamics. We have a natural
propensity to expand exponentially, but we're held in check by the natural negative feedbacks
of the human ecosystem. Along comes fossil fuel, particularly in the early part of the 19th century,
when we began to use it in great quantity, as well as in advance of public health measures.
So fossil fuel provided the means by which humans could acquire all the food and other
resources needed to grow the human enterprise, and public health improvements increased longevity
and health of the population. So for the first time in human history, in the last night, what,
10th of 1% of human history, humans were able to realize our full potential for
exponential population growth. Until then, it had been suppressed. So we took the cork off the bottle,
and we've had this enormous population and boom of the whole human enterprise in just the past 200
years. So what we take to be the norm, I mean, this is what, 10 generations at most of people?
The last 10 generations of people who take 2, 3, 4% per year growth in, well, population never got
above 2%, but the economy has certainly grown faster than that. What we take to be the norm
is the single most abnormal period in human history. So I've begun to refer to this as the,
we are like any other species exposed to an abundance of resources that goes through a
population boom, there will be a bust. There has to be a bust, because the boom can't continue.
Any system, any system that is primarily driven by positive feedback is self-destructive,
because it means that it will grow forever in a situation, in a context which is clearly not
going to grow forever. And we're no different. Moreover, we've got this enormous population,
this enormous accumulation of manufactured capital now, all dependent on the continued
flow of abundant cheap energy and resources, but that well is running dry. And so we've,
we're in effect suspended, I've used this term in something I wrote recently, we're suspended on a
kind of a gusher of oil, but that gusher is losing its power and we're going to have to come down
along with it. And unfortunately, it, in my lexicon means that I'll put it,
broadly we are in the plague face of a one-off human population boom bust cycle. We're nearing
the top and we will come down because of the onset of negative feedback. Nature will restore
balance between that positive and negative feedback. And who knows what will come of that.
So you mentioned the plague phase from an ecological scientific perspective,
are you labeling humans a plague species? I'm not labeling us as a human, as a plague species.
I'm saying that our population dynamics resemble that of every other species that we've labeled
as a plague species. So if we are no different, in fact, we're acting precisely the same way.
We are going through the one-off population boom bust cycle. And if it happens with mice,
as it often does, or grasshoppers, we call it a plague. So yeah, it's not a stretch to say that
humans have become a kind of a plague on planet earth in the sense that we've reached numbers
that can't be sustained by the normal flow of energy and material from nature through the system.
We've got there because we've used an extra somatic or outside the body source of energy,
fossil fuels, but that too is running down. I have lots of questions, Bill. Let me insert this
thing that I've thought about. So what is the difference, since you mentioned mice,
what is the difference between an R-selected and a K-selected species? And I know that humans
are normally considered K-selected, but from a metabolism perspective, if you consider the 500
billion invisible laborers we get from hydrocarbons and fossils every year, might modern humans,
the last few generations, be considered a behaviorally R-selected species? What do you think about
that? Well, just for our audience's sake, when we talk about a K-selected species,
K stands for carrying capacity. So K-selected species have certain characteristics. They tend
to be large, they tend to have very low reproductive rates, they tend to have high degrees of parental
care, that sort of quality. So if you think of humans, we're fairly long lived as mammalian
species go, very high levels of parental care, and so on. And what this means is there's a high
level of infant survival, relatively speaking. So this means that K-selected species tend always
to press up against the available carrying capacity of their environments. They're always using
whatever resources are available. By the way, that was Malthus' great insight. He realized that
if more food was made available, human beings, being K-strategists, would in effect always rise
to the level of food availability. So in our strategy- So he was right about that, but wrong
about the timing? Well, I think that's exactly right. He wasn't aware of the power of technology
to increase, and it goes back to what we were talking about earlier. Nor of fossil fuels,
nor of debt or globalization, or in any of those canned-kicking measures that we did.
I'm glad you mentioned globalization, because it is currently one of the greatest
threats to the integrity of the ecosphere. We can come back to that later if you like.
But yes, he missed the point that human beings, this is where our ingenuity clicks in. We have
found ways to relieve the negative feedback, allowing the positive feedback to take off.
Now, as I said, the reason K-strategists are called K-strategists, because we're always pushing up
against that level of caring capacity. So our success, our evolutionary success, depends on
high survival rates of infants, and they're constantly pushing up against that caring capacity.
An R-strategist, R refers to the rate of reproduction. So an R-strategist is completely
different. They just throw millions of offspring out there, and not even a fraction of a tenth of
one percent of those offspring survive. But if there's millions of them, that's okay. So it's
two completely different approaches. Very few offspring, but you take good care of them and
ensure a high survival rate, or millions of offspring on the other extreme, with an exceedingly low
survival rate. But in each case, the strategy succeeds, provided there's an adequate replacement
of the adult, reproducing individuals in the next population. So I think that humans remain,
frankly, an R-strategist species. We are not, even with our 500,000 extra energy slaves.
What that means is we have an artificial means to keep feeding our K-strategic
way of being. And part of that I mentioned earlier is globalization.
There's a concept we haven't talked about called caring and capacity, which in ecological terms
is the average maximum number of individuals of a given species that can live in a habitat with a
wrecking that habitat. Now, if I'm going to take another step back, when I first went to UBC,
interested in human ecology, I was asked to present a seminar to a group of new faculty
members and old faculty members, kind of a get-together, to bring us together of many different
departments. And I was struggling in my mind, well, what can I say? What can I say? I'm an ecologist
in a planning school. So I hit upon this idea of carrying capacity. So I did a quick and dirty
estimate of the carrying capacity of my region, the so-called lower mainland of British Columbia.
And it turned out that the carrying capacity, the capacity of that region to support people
at our then current average material standards was about a tenth of what the existing population was.
So I presented this model to my group of colleagues, and it was politely received and all
that sort of thing. But at the end of the meeting, I was taken aside by a very prominent Canadian
resource economists. And he said this to me, Bill, you've got to come to lunch with me. Because if
you continue, don't forget, I'd only arrived at UBC a few months earlier, if you continue your pursuit
of human carrying capacity and similar ideas, I can guarantee you that your career at this
university will be nasty, brutish, and short. And he invited me to lunch to expand on this thesis.
And this is where I was introduced for the first time. And again, this is a terrible admission
to economics. You see, we're so siloed in our educational system that we never really
get educated. There's an old joke, a PhD means piled higher and deeper, you learn more and more
about less and less. But here I was encountering economic thought for the first time and being
told that everything I had learned in ecology was irrelevant. Why? Because humans can both trade.
Why should we be limited in this region to whatever the population estimate I came in? In fact,
he said, you've disproved yourself, the population is 10 times greater than you said the carrying
capacity was. And that's because we can import from other places. And if we did run up against
any constraints, like technology will take care of it. And he gave me a stack of papers
by economists this high to make the point. And by the way, this was of 72 when Limits to Growth
just came out. And he laughed, he said, that's the biggest piece of nonsense you could possibly
imagine. The economists have long shown that there are no limits to growth and carrying
capacities and irrelevant idea. So that was my introduction to academic life.
The way that I have presented it in public talks is I show an image of the tortoise and the hare.
And the hare is the economist and the tortoise is the ecologist. Because if that person who
was a tenured economics professor in 1970 or whenever he's probably no longer alive or retired
or something, but during his lifetime, it appeared that he was correct. Meanwhile,
our actual carrying capacity has been declining apace that entire time and the carrying capacity
for other organisms and creatures we share this blue earth with. So it's almost one of those
things that the truth will be back loaded and not really recognized until it's too late to
really do something about. What do you think about that? Well, I think you're absolutely right.
Economists believe in something called the substitution factor that, okay, so we do use
natural resources, but it doesn't matter. Because through technology, any product of nature is
infinitely substitutable by something that humans can come up with better efficiency
or some new material together. There was a management science professor at the University
of Maryland called Julian Simon. I guess he died in the mid-90s. But he's famous for this kind of
statement. We have now in our hands the technology to feed, clothe, and provide energy for an ever-growing
population for the next seven billion years. Now, when you again disconnect humans from
biophysical reality, and you believe in the ingenuity, these are the same people who think that
he made a statement, the human mind, human ingenuity is the greatest human resource,
then everything we've been talking about becomes irrelevant. And so you have that mindset, that
social construct, which is a very attractive one, keep in mind, because it does show no limits.
That's what the world has bought into. The biophysical reality is that human beings
in the growth of the human system have displaced
other species from their ego niches. It's a concept I call competitive displacement.
You know, human unsustainability is a natural phenomenon. We are unsustainable by nature,
because all we're doing is following our natural propensity to expand and to fill all available
habitat. But we do it better than any other species. So if you go back 10,000 years, humans were
fewer than or less than 1% of the biomass of mammals on planet Earth. Then with agriculture,
and just, you know, more recently, in the last couple of hundred years, with fossil energy and
the massive expansion of the human enterprise, humans have become 36% or 34% of the biomass
of mammals. And by the way, the biomass itself has gone up. But our domestic animals are another
62% or 3%. So that when you add all of that together, it means that wild mammals on planet
Earth today are about 4%, 3% of the total biomass of mammals. So all those great herds you see in
Africa are a trivial appendage on the biomass of mammals, which has absolutely been commandeered
by both humans and our domestic animals. So there's been an enormous displacement of non-human
species. And the remaining populations in the last 50 years have been reduced by 65% to 70%.
It's actually worse than that, because it's only, that's all mammals, including ocean mammals. So
if it's only land mammals, it's 98%. So let me, at this pace, Dr. Ries, we're going to run out of
time or your computer is going to run out of batteries, because I got a lot of questions for
you, sir. So getting back to Julian Simon, I think that was a missed opportunity, because
unfortunately, he got into a bet with Paul Erlich, who is a mutual acquaintance of yours and mine,
and Paul lost and lost badly. And now it's, you know, the cultural backward looking story there
is that Julian Simon was right. Even though the statement, the quote you just read, about
seven billion years, the sun will have cooked the earth long before that, not to mention many
other problems. But the general zeitgeist in our culture believes that Simon was right and Erlich
was wrong. Do you have any comments on that? Yeah, two. First of all, Simon was right because of the
a unique window in history, when in fact, resources were flowing at an extremely good rate. Let's
keep something in mind. Economists measure scarcity by one means, and that's price. So according to
Simon, resources were getting more and more abundant because prices were declining. But prices were
declining because we were using very cheap energy to exploit ever diminishing sources of resources.
The quality of the resource base has been in steady decline. And had that bet been made today,
Simon would have lost. That's my first point. Second point, his assertion, which many people
still quote and believe in, Albert Bartlett, who was a wonderful physicist at the University of
Colorado, wrote a little paper called The New Flat Earth Society, in which he took Simon at his
word, even contacted him. And anyway, Simon said seven billion years of infinite population growth.
So Bartlett said, look, let's give Simon credit. Let's assume that the human population, which at
the time is about five billion, grows at 1% per year for seven billion years. The bottom line of
this, he was readily able to show that the number of people would be greater than the number of atoms
in the known universe, something like 10 to the 37,000th of power. So that statement by Simon,
which is taken at faith by so many, or at least similar statements, is so mathematically challenged
as to be ludicrous. And yet that's, you said to yourself, that's the star we have hitched our
wagon to. And that is another reason why we're blindly going down this path to a big surprise
within this century. So this gets to another question. You and I both are active in this space
trying to educate and inform both policymakers, citizens, students. And in our networks, I come
across lots of pro future, well intended humans working on this or that aspect of our unsustainable
system. But I am starting to group people, I used to group people in those that watch TV,
or those didn't, because their behavior really different I had found. But now I group people
into those that view the future in an ecology lens, like yourself, or that view the future
in a technology lens, which is the 2020s version of Julian Simon with AI and renewable energy
and all kinds of other things. So let me ask you this, Bill. When I taught my class at the
University of Minnesota, the main textbook was The Social Conquest of Earth by E.O. Wilson.
And in that book, he said that religion and evolution as explanations for our origin and
how we're here are two views that can never be reconciled. So our ecology and technology,
a similar pairing, or can we reconcile ecology and technology somehow?
Well, I think they have to be reconciled, and they, in theory, could be reconciled.
Look, every level of human cultural development has involved technology of some kind or other.
Simple mallets and bows and arrows are technology. So there's no inherent conflict between technology
and ecological thinking. The conflict comes from assuming you can use the technology to
overcome the biophysical reality within which we are embedded. So if we decided, as a species
200 years ago, that the carrying capacity of planet Earth indefinitely was, say,
two billion people, we could have used technology at an appropriate scale to ensure the continued
well-being of some two billion people at infinitum. But we didn't do that. The assumption was that
technology can increase carrying capacity indefinitely, which is really what my economist
colleague was telling me, that carrying capacity, his words were, has no relevance to human beings.
He even went, you know, he got a little bit crazy on us because he talked about the planets
that are out there. And we have people today, Elon Musk, among them, who say, you know, we got to
get out there and colonize the rest of the universe. It ain't going to happen.
So in a recent paper of yours, and I can't believe how prolific you are as an emeritus
professor, you're writing like every, seems like every month or two, you have a new paper out there.
But in your public speaking, and in recent paper, you highlight, and this is a view that is
patently obvious to me, but I still think is a minority view in the environmental movement,
you highlight that climate change isn't the problem, but instead is a symptom. Can you unpack
what you mean by this? Sure. To do that, I'm going to have to take a wee step back.
I believe that human beings and our cognitive capacities have become obsolete in the world
in which we live. So if you think about the evolution of humans, we grew up in relatively
simple circumstances. We were in small groups living in home ranges that weren't all that extensive.
We lived and died within a few dozens of kilometers of each other. So there was no real,
I suppose, pressures on the human mind to think beyond simple, cause-effect relationships.
Bottom line is this, that the human brain, our cognitive capacities tend to be limited
in most people to rather simplistic, reductionist perspectives on reality.
And if you think about that, climate change is a perfect illustration, because there are hundreds
of things happening, but we fixate on climate change. The focus gets shifted a little bit when
something like a pandemic comes along, but then it's all about the pandemic. We forget about climate
change. Then there's the war in the Ukraine, and we talk about that for a while, and now we're back
to climate change. And nobody bothers to connect all of those dots, because human beings are not
inherently intrinsically capable of thinking systemically. When's the last time you had a
dinner conversation about legs and thresholds and chaotic behavior and collapse syndrome,
which is called catastrophe and systems theory, and so on, it just doesn't happen.
Okay, so climate change is our fixation, because there are obvious symptoms that many people can
relate to. But it's only one of, we could spend the whole day talking about plunging biodiversity,
ocean acidification, soil and land erosion, on and on and on. Every single so-called environmental
problem is a symptom of the same issue, which is overshoot. Overshoot is the fundamental issue,
and the fundamental issue is the cause of all of these other problems. So overshoot means that
human beings are using even renewable resources, the products of ecosystems, much faster than
they can regenerate. And we're dumping wastes far in excess of the natural assimilative capacity
of ecosystems, of the ecosphere. So on the one hand, we're drawing down all of our natural
capital, fish stocks are collapsing, soils are eroding at 10 to 40 times the rate of restoration.
We're polluting far beyond the capacity of the systems to assimilate. Climate change is a pollution
problem, because carbon dioxide is the single largest waste product by weight of industrial
economies. So the anthropogenic component of climate, the carbon emissions, is a waste product.
It's a waste management issue. The system, the earth system cannot cope in a timely manner,
will over time, but not in time with the quantity of carbon dioxide that we're putting out there.
Wait a minute. By weight, CO2 is the largest waste product? I never thought about it that way.
I mean, it's like an invisible gas, but if you add it up, it actually has a weight in tons.
We're putting out 36 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,
of which a significant proportion is the carbon. And by the way, what goes in as fuel,
the coal, oil, natural gas is all carbon based. And of course, it has to go through the system
and is emitted as waste. But as you say, because it's an invisible gas, no one tends to think of it
as waste. By the way, you get the counter argument from people who don't look systematically at this.
Well, carbon dioxide is essential for life on earth, green plants needed for photosynthesis.
So it's a good thing that this carbon is in the atmosphere and so on and so forth. But again,
you have to put this in total context. So overshoot is the problem. Human beings are
destroying the biophysical basis of their own existence. We are literally consuming
that which we need to maintain the system even at a reasonable size. And it's not at a reasonable
size any longer. How do you define overshoot and how does that relate to carrying capacity?
Well, overshoot means you've exceeded your carrying capacity. So that if you think,
any farmer who has a bunch of cattle knows that if you put too many cows out in the pasture,
they'll eat the grass until there's nothing but mud and then they die. Now, if you import
a lot of grass from some other farmer, you can keep your cattle going. So that's what humans
have been doing. I mean, we talk about urban ecology. That's nonsense. The city is not a
complete ecosystem. The city, as we currently think of it, is the human equivalent of a livestock
feedlot. Because you have all of these consumer organisms jammed in this one area. And you know,
geologists, you're not geologists, geographers and urban economists often say, well, cities are
no problem. Only two, three percent of the surface area of the earth. But that's from their narrow
keyhole reductionist simplistic perspective. If we look at human beings and from an ecological
point of view, then each city occupies on earth an area anywhere between 100 and 1000 times more
land than is within the political or built up area of the city. So the human urban ecosystem
now is larger than the entire planet because cities have become parasitic on their environments
because of globalization. I did an early study of Tokyo. Tokyo has 38 million people,
the whole population of Canada. Okay. But Tokyo, people used to say to me, oh, how can you explain
Tokyo? As I explain it this way, Tokyo uses more bio capacity than the entire nation of Japan.
Twice as much as a matter of fact. So the ecological footprint of Tokyo is larger than
the entire country of Japan. And it's only something like a quarter or a third of the Japanese
population. So Japan has exceeded its carrying capacity because of globalization, the capacity
to bring in the resources needed to sustain its overpopulation. And because we can do that,
we become blinded to the reality of our overshoot. As long as you can import from elsewhere,
you are blind to the fact that you've exceeded your local carrying capacity. But what you're
doing in the meantime is drawing down the available productive capacity in other places.
And every country in Europe is in that circumstance. Japan is in that circumstance,
where they are living on imported carrying capacity or the assimilative capacity of the
rest of the planet to absorb their carbon and other waste. We don't actually measure the other
waste. And this is in addition to the energy flux being provided by fossil carbon and hydrocarbons.
Absolutely. All right. Well, the next question on my list, our viewers and listeners might
speculate as to why this is the case. I was going to ask you, why isn't ecology more prominently
taught, not in universities per se, because I think it is, but in high schools and grade schools?
And if these are some of the things we learn, this is kind of a heavy load for a 10-year-old,
yes? I don't think so. Look, some of the basic principles are really easy. I often,
I don't do it anymore, but I used to go into grade schools and talk to kids. And I would make
this suggest to them, have you ever lain awake at night, staring at the ceiling of your bedroom,
asking just how much of the earth's surface is needed to support just me? So we've talked
a bit about food production and the fact that everybody uses. But that ought to be the first
question of human ecology. And it's not a difficult concept, because every kid knows that they have
to consume food. I have a wool sweater that comes from an animal which grew on land somewhere and
so on and so forth. So these concepts aren't that difficult, but we don't teach them because
we don't have to think about them. Why should anybody worry about this stuff? Urbanization
has done two things, many things, but the important things that is done from an ecological point of
view is to separate people psychologically from the ecosphere and separate them physically
from the ecosystems that actually sustain them. So many people can live all their lives and most
of our young people in school, in cities, with no psychological or physical sense of connectivity
to anything outside of themselves. So in some sense, it replicates the economist's notion
that we're disconnected from all things. When the reality is that every city on the planet
would curl up and die wherever we cut off from diesel transportation, the trucks that are required
to provision those cities, the trucks, the marine transportation, the aircraft. There's a huge arterial
network needed to supply cities, but in the process, we're depleting the resources of the
land base all over the planet. So let's say that everyone on earth understood and agreed with your
diagnosis of overshoot and carrying capacity and everything that you've been talking about,
but that none of the effects of this would manifest for 50 years, meaning we could continue
everything roughly like today, but in 50 years, there would be all of the negative things that we
can imagine. Would that change anything? Or are we such a biologically short-sighted
species that that would be like, oh my God, that's my lifetime. So it's not going to happen in my
lifetime. I'm not going to change. What do you think about that? Well, I think you've put your
finger on it right at the end there. Again, humans are an evolved species like the others.
And one thing that we have evolved to be is short-sighted. There's a number of wonderful papers
on the nature of myopia. So even economists have recognized this in the concept of discounting.
So we tend to prefer our present. We tend to prefer our close relatives and friends.
And we tend to prefer our home places over distant futures. Other people who are complete strangers
and other places. In fact, if you think of climate change, most people in our country
or the United States or Canada think, well, it's probably important, but it's probably mostly going
to hit somebody in India or in other lands far away. So it's not a big issue for me.
Except for that suburb of Vancouver last year. Oh, sure. And we all get hit from time to time.
But the point is, it's still, to most people, a distant prospect. So if you're a politician,
you would much rather risk future damage to somebody else somewhere else than to impose
right now on your own people today constraints on their consumption, their growth and all sorts
of other things. That's a certainty. And it's certain to get you thrown out of office.
So we have no incentives in the system, being natural discounters, to do anything about it.
And if you tell me something is going to happen 50 years in the future and I'm an economist,
my automatic response is, well, then we better grow and get rich to have the wealth necessary
to develop the technologies to head off those problems that may or may not come in 50 years.
So you see, in many respects, it's our human nature that has got us into this conundrum.
We operate from a belief set that is guaranteed once you relieve the negative feedback
that to get us into a crisis situation. But it's also human nature that has allowed
you and I to have this conversation. The technology that is allowing someone in Vancouver
to talk to someone in Minnesota and the care and wide boundary empathy that we're doing this to
hopefully somehow affect steering away from the worst trajectory and the pro-social sharing of
information to others using technology. So this too is part of human nature.
Of course it is. I mean, nothing's ever black or white. But again, Nate, first of all, the world
is not a uniform place. It's incredibly heterogeneous. So you and I are a very minority
culture now, the advanced societies at perhaps a quarter of the world's people who have the
privilege of doing what we're doing. There's another 800 million people,
nearly a billion who don't get enough food to eat every day, who aspire to acquire the same level
of at least material comfort as middle income countries. And then there's the middle income
countries, which are not only growing economically and hence consuming more and more, but have still
very high population growth rates. In fact, I've just finished a paper that shows population growth
is one of the major drivers of overconsumption. So it's not a uniform place. You're about to say
something. Yeah, well, I was more getting on to the cultural evolution side of things. There is
human nature, but is it possible that instead of universities advertising the STEM programs,
science, technology, engineering management, that it becomes steam and we put an extra E in
there for ecology? I mean, I guess I'm asking two questions. Could ecology become more prominent
in our educational awareness around the planet? And then a second question is,
we now know, thanks to the work of you and people like you, where we came from, how we got here,
what we're doing, what we need, what the consequences are, what sort of limits there are,
what technology and tandem with hydrocarbons and fossil minerals can provide. Is this a,
we had to go through this overshoot, we had to train people as human ecologists to figure out
our situation. Is that worth anything? Can that self-awareness as a culture at the height of
the carbon pulse amount to some possibility for change? Well, of course it can. Look,
I hate to be pessimistic about this, but we've reached the point where what you're suggesting
involves what's called social learning. It's a huge change in the nature of our education system,
which itself will take a decade to implement. And then for it to have any impact on the way
graduates think and affect societies, another two or three or four decades. So social learning is a
very, very slow way of moving us through the kinds of crises that I think we're about to head into.
So yes, it's a wonderful dream, but keep in mind there's no incentive for most people to do it.
You and I are talking here, we think this is necessary, but we're two people and not many
others would agree that this is a possibility at the present time. I see no evidence whatsoever
in my own university of anything like this taking over. In fact, I'll go a little bit further than
that. There's resistance to this idea because it goes against the fundamental grain of the way
people think today. Point one. Point two. If you plot, you said we know all of this now. We knew
all of this 50 years ago. I mean, in fact, exactly 50 years ago, the Limits to Growth Study was
published. And before that, we had Rachel Carson, we had dozens of other authors heralding the kinds
of things that we now see occurring around us. But if you plot the trend lines for various pollutants
or resource consumption against the number of meetings and so on that have taken place to declare
an end to all of this, there's no effect whatsoever. So for example, we've had what,
something like 30 climate meetings, 36 maybe, there's been 27 COP meetings, there's been six
formal agreements, all of them oriented toward reducing human emissions of carbon dioxide.
But if you plot the dates of those, along with the scientists warning to humanity, the Limits
to Growth book, and any other number of major announcements, they've had no effect whatsoever.
The trend line just keeps going on. So what does it take for social learning to kick in,
to have a significant effect on these trend lines? And I see no evidence whatsoever
that there's been an effect in the past 50 years, nor is it likely that there will be an effect in
the next 20 or 30 years, which I think is critical to resolving this in a relatively
peaceful manner, not peaceful, but less chaotic manner.
I'm going to come back to that because I have some questions on that. But can you,
as a former college teacher, do you still teach? No.
No, no, not formally. I mean, I get invited to do guest lectures from time to time.
Can you speculate, Bill, on the current relationship between science and postmodernism
in the universities around North America, or just on the scientific process in general,
circa 2022? Look, I've been out of it for 10 years now, Nate. So I think I'd be sticking my neck out.
My general sense is that postmodernism has been a catastrophe for teaching in universities. I used
to get students standing up in my classes from other departments, not so much our own planning
students, but I'd get economists and sociologists coming in and say, well, isn't that just your
opinion? Isn't that just your opinion? And after all, there's no objective reality. It goes back
to the social construction of reality that we were talking about earlier, that postmodernism,
in its radical form, really suggested that whatever one person thought was equivalent to
whatever somebody else thought, regardless of the evidence base upon any of these kinds of theorems.
So we wound up in a situation where you would get into class debates where people simply insisted
that their view was as good as any other view. And who are you to say that I'm not right?
So that, I think, has been a catastrophic development. And I don't know the extent to which
it still exists, but the whole woke movement is moving, as I think, even further in that direction,
where evidence doesn't mean a damn thing. And what matters is what you think about things,
how you feel about them, much more than what the evidence says.
Tomorrow, actually, the podcast that will be coming out on the Great Simplification is Thomas
Bjorkman, who had a really great example here on the relationship between oxygen and money.
If everyone agreed that we didn't need oxygen at all and we voted on it,
it wouldn't mean a damn thing because we absolutely do need oxygen. But if we decided that we didn't
need money, which is a social construction of claims on energy and resources and such,
we could do without money if we created some other alternative metric. So there are things
that are biophysical realities that someone's opinion doesn't matter. But there are other
things that are socially constructed. So I do kind of like to think about it that way.
I do, too. In fact, I keep saying things like this. I did a paper not long ago in which I pointed
out that economics is a social construct. There are many, many different forms of economics,
communist economics, neoliberal economics, and so on. But they're all invalid to the extent that
they don't recognize there are certain biophysical realities, which if they are not incorporated
into an economic theorem invalidate that economic theorem. So you're absolutely right. There are
certain real physical phenomena, which simply are. And what you think about it makes no difference
whatsoever. They are. But things like civil rights, democracy, communism are pure constructs of
mind. They don't exist in nature outside of the human domain. So those are things that we can
change, but we cannot change the fundamental biophysical realities and the necessity that we
have as human beings for fresh air, fresh water, decent food, and so on and so forth.
I've parsed that into the term energy blind. But I think we're also ecology blind and systems
blind as you've kind of pointed out. So piggybacking on that could a broader understanding of biophysical
reality either self-taught because of people are learning on the internet or YouTube videos or
formally taught in high schools and great schools and universities help in mitigating
our upcoming reality. Or does it just make people more depressed and anxious?
Big question. It's a huge question. I'm not sure I can answer it. I think that knowledge
is liberating if you actually understand the nature of that knowledge. We're in a situation
right now where you'll read, I read a hundred papers a week, everybody is talking about what
must be done. If only we changed our value system, if only we changed our behavior, if only we changed
this, it's all about the what, what, what, what. And there's almost no focus whatsoever on the how,
how, how, how. So how is it that you go into a culture such as western
techno industrial society where our entire geopolitical foundations, our economic foundations
are dependent on the concept of perpetual economic and material growth and tell people,
well, there's a limit on that. And now in order to be sustainable, we in the western world,
in fairness to other millions of human beings in poorer countries, we have to reduce our
consumption of energy and material by 75 or 80 percent so that the impact that we have is equitable
and fair and everybody living at that level would be able to live within the short-term
carrying capacity of the planet. How do you do that? What, by what political means, by what policy
measures do you take entire culture and convince them that they need to reduce their material
well-being? At least that's how they will perceive it by some 75 or 80 percent.
You couldn't do it for five percent even. So that's not going to happen.
So then what, so what are we stuck with? We're stuck with it.
Well, you know my view, Bill, is that we're not going to tighten our belts, but the,
the momentum and the metabolism of the financial overshoot, which is overlaid on top of ecological
overshoot is going to snap back. That rubber band is going to snap back and there's going to be a
20 to 40 percent drop in the size of the economy in the not too distant future. And from that moment,
predictions are futile, but we could then, if things are in place ahead of time, could be
resource and carbon taxes, all kinds of different possibilities, because if such a drop were to
happen, we would only go back to 1990s level of GDP, which wasn't a disaster. So I'm, I'm trying to
plant the seeds of what could we do during that moment or ahead of that moment? I mean, we're in
the liminal space between total belief in economic growth forever and the post growth living. These
years that you and I are doing these conversations and we're having emails and writing papers and
doing podcasts, this is the liminal space between those two eras. What can we be doing? What
recommendations do you have, even if they're not practical? What can people think about?
I mean, I do personally, I've gotten tired of watching environmental movies, look at what we're
doing to the oceans, look at what we're doing to elephants, but wait, it's not too late if we do these
wind turbines and a circular economy and there's always got to be a hope, little carrot at the end.
And I think, I don't know what you think about the word hope. I do think humans need something to
look forward to, and that's a dopamine thing. We need to have a motivation, but it has to be
grounded in some biophysical reality. And I think there are lots more humans than you might think,
Bill, that are ready for that path, which is the whole goal of this conversation. So what do you
think? Look, I'm on your side, Nate, but I look at history and I look at our current situation
and look at the directions we seem currently to be hitting. So if you asked me what we could do,
you've mentioned one thing already, I think ecological tax reform is an extremely important
first step that we could as a society in theory take. And by that, I mean that we attempt to move
toward what I would call full cost or full social cost pricing of our goods and services.
Right now, almost everything we consume is produced at less than the true cost because we're allowed
to pollute, we're damaging the ecos for changing the climate. All the climate damage costs are
really the costs of production that have not been included in the prices of goods and services that
we... Now the problem is, what's been the success in your country in getting even a simple carbon
tax implemented across the board? Zero. Absolutely. So if we started talking realistically about the
political willingness of a population, keep in mind that we go back to our earlier conversation,
we are still largely in ignorance about the nature of our dilemma. So there needs to be a huge
catch up in the educational system in the popular media. The media don't consider these issues,
but why don't politicians even get up and describe the situation in real terms? We have
to do this because they don't, because for one thing, they're beholden to the corporate sector
that has no interest in imposing these terms on their current... Well, and the other is,
from a discounted standpoint, the damages from climate change are largely in the future,
the big damages. And so if you discount that at any positive rate back to the present,
they're very small. Well, they aren't any longer, Nate, but again, it goes back to something I
said earlier. Politicians would much rather risk damages in the future that may or may not occur
and are more likely to occur to other people far away than impose immediate pain upon their own
people today. That's the dilemma they find themselves in.
Put on your crystal ball, Bill. Will nations in the world ever have systems ecology,
language, and politicians talking about the things you're talking about today? Will that ever happen?
I don't believe it will, Nate. Listen, we are embedded in a culture
that has a set of beliefs, values, assumptions, and narratives that have largely been socially
constructed during an era of abundance. You and I have lived through an era of unprecedented abundance
during which a whole set of completely unrealistic and false assumptions didn't matter.
Even if they were wrong, it didn't matter. And so we have acquired an incredible cultural momentum
such that it becomes almost impossible to start even here where we have the resources to do so.
To make matters worse, we've spread this set of beliefs, values, and assumptions to the entire
world. So we've created a set of human expectations that they too can follow in these
trends. By the way, they feel absolutely that they have the right to do so and condemn us for not
allowing them to do so. And by the way, they're correct. They're absolutely right in this. There's
no moral reason why they shouldn't be allowed to follow the tracks that we follow. We didn't pay
any attention to the constraints. Why should they? So I guess I see what we could do is completely
separate from what we will do because of the inordinate momentum that our culture has acquired
just in the past 50 years. Combine that with something I think most people again don't understand,
and I'll credit our Albert Bartlett with saying, the greatest shortcoming of the human race is
their inability to understand the implications of exponential growth. One half of all the fossil
energy, oil and gas particularly, ever used by human beings have been used since 1990.
I was born in 1943. 90% of the fossil fuels used by human beings has been used in my lifetime.
So with exponential growth, you have a constant doubling time, but the amount of materials and
energy and whatnot used during one of those doubling periods is equal to the sum of all
the energy and material used in previous doubling periods. So here we are on a planet
expecting to double the scale of the economy in the next 35 years or so, increase the population by
what, two billion or so, and we're already in a state of overshoot by something like 47%.
So if we maintain the current relationship between energy and resource use
and the scale of the economy, we will consume more stuff in the next 35, 40 years than has
been consumed since, say, the beginning of the Industrial Revolution at great damage to the
planet. We're already, as I say, in a state of at least 70% overshoot. So I don't see that that's
a biophysical possibility. I don't see that it's conceivable in the short time frame we're talking
about here because of this exponential function for social learning to catch up to the biophysical
reality within which we find ourselves. So yes, we could, but we won't for the reasons,
many of the reasons that we've been talking about.
So you were born in 1943 and you just said that our culture, our species has used 90%
of the fossil carbon and hydrocarbons ever since you've been alive on the planet.
Do you feel like you, as a human being, hit the lottery that you won or you have gratitude or do
you feel shame or sadness that they're simultaneous with that? There's an unfolding tragedy. How do
you, at approaching 80 years old, look at that all?
All of those things. Again, we're no different from any other species. Human beings have a tendency
and will consume only available resources. We could get into a big argument about this around
First Nations and indigenous people, but I'm not going to get into it because I'd have to,
oh, I will get into it. Let me say this, that in many cases the relationships, the stable
relationships that indigenous peoples have developed with their natural environments
occur after they've obliterated the natural environment. They occur after they've hunted
out all of the megafauna, the large, easily caught species. If you just think of New Zealand,
which has been settled since Christ, I guess 800 years ago or so, 12 species of gigantic birds,
the mowa, went extinct as a result of the deprivations of the indigenous people that now
occupy New Zealand. Australia is a wonderful book by Tim Flannery called The Future Readers.
The decimation of populations of large mammals in Australia just follows the progression of the
occupation of that subcontinent by aboriginals in the last 50,000 years.
Yes, we can develop a harmonious relationship with our ecosystems, but it's often only after we've
inserted ourselves into those ecosystems and appropriated the habitats and food chains of
many of the mammals that would have occupied. Do you think that 800 years ago in New Zealand
or Australia or any one of these prior cultures that had a negative effect on the population of
megafauna, do you think there were a few environmentalists at that time saying,
wait a minute, look at the population of mowa, they're declining, we need to hold off? Or is
energy privilege living in the era that you've just described allowed an environmental ethic to
populate and have this podcast and lots of people worried about climate change, etc.
Is our concern for the environment a product of our energy surplus?
I think our concern for the environment is a product of our capacity to see that it's coming
apart around us. But listen, Nate, I live in a privileged position. You live in a very privileged
state and neither of us voluntarily taken the steps that we need, we know need to be taken
to reduce our standard of living to the point that it could be shared equally by 8 billion people
on planet earth. So again, I just really have to emphasize here that knowledge per se doesn't
change behavior. Knowledge per se does not change behavior. There's been a number of studies of
the relative purchasing patterns of the best informed people on the environmental issues
compared to the average population and there's virtually no detectable difference.
So simply knowing the nature of our circumstances doesn't really alter behavior all that much.
I once at a meeting of what was called the heads of meeting committees at my university
suggested to my colleagues that perhaps it would be smart to show leadership
to the community by refusing our next salary raise on grounds that we were already overpaid and
over-consuming relative to the equitable capacity that we were entitled to. I was practically run
out of town. I can't think of a single circumstance in which a significant number of societies,
let's just leave it at that, has voluntarily said, okay, we've screwed up, we've now got a cut back
to the point where this, this and this is going to be the case and we will do that on behalf of our
in the future. I just don't see human beings in that light at this time.
Well, I've certainly not cut back to be the equal share of one 8 billionth of humanity,
but I have cut back quite a bit from when I worked on Wall Street 20 years ago and I think the issue
now is those people that can simplify first and beat the rush, not to save the planet or to be
equitable per se, but to be more resilient and flexible and act as pilots or examples of a lower
material throughput on the future, that's not a bad idea.
Doug, of course, is not a bad idea. In fact, if I had some hope, it's a very large number of NGOs
and community organizations that are attempting to do exactly what you're talking about. So,
they're fringe organizations, I think of them as the lifeboats. The mainstream society is the
Titanic and these little lifeboats are going out there exploring what the future might look like
with a much reduced material lifestyle, with much greater community development, with much
greater cooperative instruments and so on and so forth. But I look, I have to wonder myself
whether this is only possible because this is a time of relative abundance. What happens when
push comes to shove and the grocery stores don't have supplies? What happens when you can't get
around? What happens when we have to cut down every tree in the neighborhood to heat our homes
and so on and so forth? It should fossil fuels become too costly or simply run down in the next
30 or 40 years and there's no reasonable substitute in the form of alternative so-called green energy,
which to my mind so far is mythic. So, again, it's the sheer momentum of the situation
that scares me more than anything else. And the fact that we're sending out these little
lifeboats is encouraging, it's hopeful, but I just wonder whether they're going to founder
in the eddies and whirlpools created by the sinking of the much larger ship.
I've known you for a long time and I think you're such a kind and wise man, but you always
at the same time kind of bum me out when we talk. Well, I'm sorry about that. Look,
I don't know what to do about it, Nate. No, I know. I want you to be honest and I think
we have to have an honest conversation as a culture. I did not mean that comment as pejorative.
I love you, man, but this is heavy stuff and you are not afraid to say what you think in your
lifetime of scholarship on this, so I appreciate that. I think much of it comes, Nate. It goes back
to just basic population ecology. And the simple fact of the matter is that any species capable
of exponential growth will respond to a period of resource abundance. And many species in nature
go through cycles. Okay, it's a boom-butt cycle. Things get good, we expand, then negative feedback
kicks in, we crash, then we get good and expand. Humans have never done that, not globally. We've
done it locally. But now for the first time, we've managed to, in effect, colonize the entire planet.
We've grown, but listen, we are growing by liquidating our capital as a former financier. You
should understand what that means. You cannot continue to grow by liquidating the natural
capital basis of your own existence. And so we get to the point where we become so large,
they're simply insufficient there to maintain even the maintenance activities, let alone further
growth. Then things get really tough because you're now in a competition for the residuals.
By the way, what do you think is going on in the world today around food and energy and the
war in Ukraine and cutting off this, that and something? We're learning very quickly. And
maybe it's a good thing, the extent to which we are dependent on fossil fuel, the extent to which
we are dependent on global trade for fertilizers. What happens when we can't grow food with
fertilizer any longer? And we haven't taught ourselves about agroecology and all of the other
fundamental ways of growing food in equal abundance that don't destroy the planet in the process.
We've gotten lazy. We're intellectually lazy or technologically lazy because, look,
agroecology is a technology of superb potential. But we don't do it because it's easier just to
throw poisons and fertilizers out on the landscape and make more money in the process.
Yeah, we're going to need a lot more people that have to go back to the land instead of 3% working
on agriculture. It's going to have to be something higher.
If you go back to 1920 in the United States, there were 20 million horses working the fields.
They've been replaced by tractors. There'd have to be 75 or 80 million
horses working the fields now just to give you the same proportion of horses to people as there
were in 1920. But now you've got to have three hectares or three acres of land to feed each of
those 80-odd million horses. So it's a hugely complicated issue. We haven't really begun as
a culture to think it through. If we could stimulate one senior politician, supposing the next president
of the United States stood up in the world courts, the forum that presidents of the United States
occupy, and said, look, we've really screwed up here. And this is what we've got to do instead.
That would be an earth-shattering moment, a moment of unprecedented leadership
that would force everyone from the prime minister of Canada to Mac Hall in France to say,
my God, you're right. When is it going to happen?
You know, I both know the challenge of that is any person that would be willing to say that
wouldn't choose to be president, nor would they get elected.
Well, that's right.
So Bill, you are known for, among many other things, being the co-creator of the ecological
footprint. What was the thinking behind this metric? What is the ecological footprint? How
does it differ from the carbon footprint? And what has been its impact since you developed it?
The thinking behind it, Nate, was that I had a profound sense that humans remain utterly dependent
on ecosystem, the productivity of nature for our basic survival. And yet here we were confronted
with an economic model that suggested we were decoupling from nature and that the economy was
a separate functional entity altogether. So I set about to disprove that thesis.
I had been challenged at one point in my early career that ecological ideas such as carrying
capacity were utterly irrelevant to human beings. So I thought, you know, if I take the
economy seriously and think that we can trade infinitely, they're right. Why should this region
be limited in its population, for example, if we can import resources from everywhere else?
But there was something basically wrong. It's still stuck in my craw.
So if you turn the carrying capacity ratio over, instead of asking me how many people can this
region support, which becomes irrelevant if you can import stuff from all over the place,
ask a different question. How much area, how much productive ecosystems is required to support
this population, no matter where on earth those productive ecosystems are? So it struck me that
if we could develop a way of looking at this, a model using material flows analysis, incorporating
trade flows into the consumption patterns of a particular region, and if we could quantify the
amount of land area required to produce all those goods and services consumed in this region and
extrapolate that out into the rest of the planet, we would have some idea of the total, I used to
call it was it the human impact index or something of that nature. By the way, I got a new computer
which had a smaller tower footprint on my desk and one of my colleagues came in. I was just writing
the first paper on this other concept and he said, oh, you got your new computer. How do you like it?
And I said, it's fine. There's a much smaller footprint. Another epiphany. There it was. I was
writing about the ecological footprint, the amount of land. Let me define it formally. A population's
ecological footprint is the area, the physical area of productive ecosystems required to produce
all of the biological resources that that population consumes and to assimilate its wastes.
Basically, we looked at carbon waste. So it becomes the carbon footprint. So when we undertook
this kind of modeling, we discovered that the eco footprint was an inordinately powerful tool
in convincing students in our own program, a land use planning part of the program,
that the city of Vancouver, for example, wasn't the dot on the map, but rather an area about 325
times larger spread all over the planet. And we could create a map with, you know, little
stickers and arrows showing where all of our land imports took place and so on. So that's
what an eco footprint is. It's a way of showing through trade flows and direct consumption data.
It's a consumption based index and it corrects for trade both imports and exports. It's a way
of showing the absolute quantity of land required to sustain any defined population.
So what's the ecological footprint of global human civilization?
Right now, it's something over 21 billion hectares. So if, by the way, let me explain
something else. I was interested in showing this connectivity to the land. So it was ecosystem
appropriation, really the appropriation of ecosystems productivity by the expansion
of the human enterprise that I was interested in measuring. That's what the footprint shows.
So it leaves out all sorts of things. We don't account for many forms of pollution or the destruction
of land by this or that or desertification. So there's all sorts of other things going on,
which if you added them into the footprint would make the footprint estimate much larger than it
is. Well, not to mention that you're measuring ecosystem impacts and productivity, but we're
also adding historical productivity to our system in the form of fossil carbon.
Absolutely. So the basic global footprint now is over 21 billion hectares, but the amount of
bio capacity available on earth is somewhere between 11 and 12 billion hectares. So the actual
quantity- How can we consume more than we have by depleting what you've got?
Okay, you're a financier or what you used to think of an interest in a bank account.
If you had a million dollars in a bank at five percent, your income would be $50,000 a year.
Now, if you chose to live on 50,000 a year, you could live in perpetuity. This is a sustainable,
what we would call sustainable income because you haven't touched your capital. Well, ecosystems,
the soils, the fisheries and so on and so forth, forests, grasslands are capable each year producing
an annual output. If human beings were content to live on that annual output,
we could live in perpetuity without destroying the capital base, as it were. But instead,
we've continued to grow and grow and grow under the illusion that there are no limits because
trade flows abolish the illusion of limits. For example, it's only one of many things,
technology helps to do that as well. So what we've done is managed to grow the human economy
beyond the biocapacity of the planet. But that's why fisheries are being depleted. That's why we've
eliminated 94 percent of them mammalian biomass on the planet and replaced it with humans and our
domestic livestock and so on. So we are living literally by liquidating the basic
natural capital base that we are utterly dependent upon. Growth is destructive once you're beyond
carrying capacity. So to summarize that, roughly rough numbers, we have 10 billion hectares of
productive land. We're using 20 billion hectares worth of resources. So we're doubling our consumption,
drawing down our bank account. At the same time, the whole enterprise is supported by fossil energy
and materials. Absolutely. In fact, you've put your finger on an extremely important point.
The means by which we have been able to over exploit every ecosystem on the planet
is through the use of fossil energy. We all have these energy slaves digging deeper, farming more
and more soils, producing fertilizers and pesticides to enhance the productivity of those
things. And keep in mind, the footprint just measures the amount of land we're using with all
of those inputs. If the inputs were eliminated, if we abandoned fossil fuel use or ran out of
economically viable supplies of fossil fuel and were no longer able to fertilize or irrigate and
so on and so forth, then the natural footprint would increase by probably a half an order of
magnitude. So we're in rather more dire straits than even eco footprint analysis shows. Let me
just make two final points. We are currently about 75% in overshoot. We're using the planet as if it
were 75% larger, and that's an underestimate. And to put it in very simple terms, the per capita
bio capacity on earth is about 1.58 hectares. That's in 2018. So each of us would be entitled
to the productivity and assimilative capacities of about 1.58 hectares, a hectares 2.47 acres.
But on the planet right now, the average eco footprint at inadequate average material standards
is 2.77 global average hectares. So we're almost, as I say, 75% over the top. Each of us, and that's
average in North America, we're eight hectares per capita, which means we're three or four times
above the fair share of our planet. Does that include land all around the world that's maybe
less productive or nonproductive, like deserts and high mountains and things like that?
No. No, we're only counting in these numbers. We ignore deserts and ice caps and that sort of
thing. So we're looking at those lands and waters that are capable of producing adequately to support
a human population. And you had a second point. I think maybe I made it that are per capita.
I think it's even worse than that, what you just said, because if we have,
if there's 12 billion hectares and we're using 21 or whatever the number you said,
that presumes that all of those hectares of productive capacity are for humans.
And there's 10 million other species. Absolutely. And as I've talked about many
times, the expansion of humanity into other species' ecosystems. I mean, this is one of
the great ironies. Human beings, as I've said, are the single greatest consumer organism the
planet has ever seen. We're the major predators, we're the major herbivores, the major carnivores,
and every single accessible ecosystem on the planet. We're part of those systems in the biggest way
you can imagine. And yet we're operating from a model that says, well, we're decoupling from nature.
The economy is dematerializing. In fact, every growth of the economy, every growth and income
increases the human demand on the shrinking biocapacity of Earth. It's a perfect example of
how the mental models from which we live often have no correlate in the natural world upon which
we are living. What an incredibly stupid situation for a so-called intelligent species.
So of course, I know most of the things you're telling me today, but if someone was trained
in economics or in business, and it was listening to this podcast, this sounds obvious, but it also
sounds, how come I've never heard this before? How can this possibly be true? So let me just
start this where I'm starting to ask this of all my scientific guests that have
done work on something. How might you be wrong about this, about overshoot, carrying capacity,
or any of these things we've discussed so far? That's a really good question. And I have to say,
I don't think we could possibly be wrong, Nate. If you think of the climate change,
is that nobody disagrees, even economists realize now, we're deeply into climate change,
but it's interesting how they dismiss it. For example, an Nobel laureate economist is well
known for saying, well, you know, climate change is likely mostly to affect agriculture. And since
agriculture is only 3% of GDP, just two years of growth, and we've obliterated the effects of
climate change, well, that obviously is an extra, that's what I call a keyhole vision, the nature
of reality. And yet that's where most of us are coming from. So I suppose we could be wrong,
here's how we're wrong, we're underestimating the total human impact. We are underestimating
the total human impact. So I admit to being wrong, but I'm being wrong in the kind of
conservative cautious way of saying, look, if I'm wrong, what I'm saying is an underestimate
of what's going on here. We can't avoid the reality that humans are biophysical entities,
that we are ecological species that have evolved as components of nature,
and that we require just to breathe a certain energy flow. Historically, that energy flow has
always been full of solar energy through our food supply. We broke from that just about 200
years ago. And with this extra somatic or outside the body source of energy called fossil fuel,
we vastly increased our capacity to exploit and destroy the planet. And so we see everywhere
measurements of the decline in forest fertility. North America has lost 50 to 70% of the organic
nutrients that took 11 or 12,000 years in the Gloss glacial post glacial period to accumulate.
So in less than 200 years of deep tillage agriculture, half of that's gone or 70% is gone.
And the only product way we maintain the productivity of the Great Plains is through the
massive implications of fertilizers and pesticides and increasing irrigation.
US agriculture, heavily irrigation dependent, but the Oklahoma reservoir, which surprised so
much of that, the groundwater supply is drying up. California is in deep trouble. They provide what
a third of all the table vegetables in North America. And yet we're within a decade or two of
seeing the biophysical basis of that productivity destroyed because of the overshoot that we can
illustrate clearly through ecological footprint analysis. Now, the other side of the coin is,
well, technology will solve all our problems. That's the economist's talk. But it's an
article of faith of Josh Farley, a very good friend of mine, has said, look, I'm immortal.
How do I know? Because I've lived for 21,000 days. And every day that I live is additional
affirmation of my belief that I am immortal. And that's exactly how economists think.
You can make the same chart of a turkey that grows and lives until a week before Thanksgiving.
So you have... So far, so good.
You have... And Josh is a very good friend of mine, as you know. I have just made a
impromptu plan after hearing your last four minutes. I think it would be
great to have a friendly debate between you and someone like Bjorn Lomborg, the skeptical
environmentalist, who is a reasonable person, but he has a completely different lens with which
to view the future that you do. The challenge is that it's kind of like getting a Christian and
an atheist or a Muslim and a Christian in a debate. Even if they're well-intended people,
if they're using different lenses with which to view the future, it's almost impossible to
have a conversation. But I'm going to work on that, Bill. Okay. Just for your information,
I've actually debated Bjorn Lomborg right here in town. Oh, yeah. And in Nature magazine, he
published a critique of ecological footprint analysis. But it was clear he didn't understand
where he was coming from. And I had to rebut that critique. So that's in the record.
So, Bill, we don't want your computer to run out of batteries. So I'm at the point of the interview
where I ask you some questions, some personal questions that I ask all my guests. So first
of all, given your lifetime of scholarship, of teaching, of research, of reflection on these
issues, do you have any personal advice to the listeners of this program at this time of, as
you have adroitly pointed out, global overshoot?
Yeah. Look, this is an extremely confusing domain, obviously. And there are many different,
as you put it, windows on reality. So I think every person who has any even whisperings of
concern about this has a personal obligation to do what they can to understand the scientific
and material basis for the various claims that are being made. So first of all, educate yourself.
Follow those rabbit holes where they take you and then come to some kind of considered judgment
about the nature of reality facing us, keeping in mind that you and I, all of us are biophysical
entities that require a certain quantity of energy, a certain quantity of material just to
maintain ourselves, never mind to grow everything. And the point is this is a finite planet that has
a limited productivity, which is in now steady decline precisely because of overshoot and the
fact that we're depleting those assets. So self-education is an extremely important thing.
Then recognize that this is a, it's a collective problem. One of the kind of false
leads we've been given from our current very individualistic capitalist kind of society is
that there's 101 things you can do to save the planet. And we see over and over again this
offloading of responsibility under the individual. But individuals can't do screw all. I can't,
as an individual, create the rapid transit systems in my city that would greatly reduce the
transportation footprint. I cannot, as an individual, implement the ecological tax reform,
that the transfer of carbon tax is necessary to change the economy through the price incentive
into more conservative ways of resource use and so on. So individuals have very, very limited
capacity as individuals. But as a collective, we theoretically, certainly in democracies,
have control over the circumstance. So you have to become a political animal here. Even writing
letters important. I used to understand, I worked for a political party, I will leave it unnamed.
But for every 10,000 letters they got, they knew there was another 100,000 people out there
that thought the same way but didn't bother to write. So letter writing can influence the way
politicians think. We've got to appear at political meetings. We have what we call all
candidate party meetings up here, where during an election representatives from each party,
the several, get to speak. We need people in the audience to ask the embarrassing questions
that we're talking about right now. To force them to begin to think. Ultimately, however,
I think you and I are now engaged in and all of us on this podcast in what's called social learning.
It's an exercise in passing information, gradually increasing one's cognitive understanding
of the situation, raising to consciousness the nature of the problem. But it takes decades to
have an effect. We're getting to the point now where we don't have decades, where what is going
to make real change is people in the thousands, in the 10,000s on the street raising bloody blue
hell about the things that they can see going wrong on the planet today. I'll give you a perfect
example that I'd like to see happen. Right now, my own government, your government are both subsidizing
the production of EVs, electric vehicles, on grounds that this is a great salvation for climate.
Well, look, first of all, climate isn't the real issue. Overshoot is. Secondly, if you do a full
life cycle analysis of an average large EV, it's a worse option ecologically overall and also
culturally and socially because of the slave labor and all then in the mining and the refining
and manufacturing and so on and so forth. It's probably a worse option than a standard internal
combustion vehicle. And yet taxpayers are now being asked to, in fact, to subsidize an option,
which is really engineered not to solve the climate, not to solve overshoot, but to keep the
machine going, to maintain investment, to maintain jobs, to increase the span of the economy.
In other words, to maintain what I call business as usual by alternative means.
But it's business as usual that has got us into this situation. So get politically engaged.
And by an electric or non-electric bicycle.
Uh-huh. So moving on, you are a retired college professor who has outlined the human predicament
to students for a long time. What specific recommendations do you have in addition to
what you just said for young humans who become aware of energy, climate, biophysical constraints,
overshoot and the human predicament?
I guess my first piece of advice is to be aware that they're standing on very fluid grounds.
That it is very easy as a student, and I see this all the time, to get sucked into the need to find
a job in the existing system and so on and so forth. I think each young person today has an obligation
self-education beyond what they're getting in universities. Universities don't educate.
What they do is narrow your focus in a single discipline. So look beyond that. My education
didn't start until I graduated with a PhD and came face-to-face with economists and sociologists
and geographers and others who disagreed utterly with what I'm saying. That is the source of real
knowledge where you're confronted with your own beliefs. My other beliefs that are totally at odds
and you have to reconcile these things. Young people do that. You may decide after doing that
that you should get together with some other friends and even develop some kind of land
cooperative in the outback somewhere where you can perhaps salvage something of a life should the
great unraveling occurs rapidly as some of us think it may be occurring. If you look into the
historical record a very simple little society called Ticopia, an island in the South Pacific
just a few square kilometers, for some 3,000 years it seems managed to control its population
in the vicinity of 1,200 people. 1,200 people over 3,000 years but they did it using seven
forms of birth control including by the way when things got tough in the lean years the old guys
like me would set themselves out into the ocean and disappear. The Inuit in northern Canada in the
U.S. did the same thing departed on ice floes so that there'd be more resources for young people.
Now I'm not recommending that we do that. I'm just saying that in desperate times people do
desperate kinds of things but we can head off those desperate times by thinking through what our
options are and one of the options is to be prepared for the coming years of deprivation.
What tools would you need to survive in the absence of many of the kinds of conveniences
that we have today? What would you do if you were left with a very intermittent or perhaps no
electricity for days on end? We're getting some very valuable lessons I suppose out of the current
war in Ukraine and because what that war has shown us is the utter dependence of modern
techno-industrial countries on a constant steady supply of energy, a constant steady supply of
fertilizer, a constant steady supply of electricity and the water and so on and so forth but in the
great unraveling many of those things will just either gradually be whittled away so that we have
time to adjust or suddenly they just disappear. What would happen to a city like Tokyo or Shanghai
which is currently underdependent on fossil fuel transportation for its provisioning?
Those cities have ecological footprints several hundred times larger than the cities themselves
but all of the productivity of those ecosystems is being transported into the city where they're
consumed and wastes produced and exported out of the city by fossil fuel. Well what are you
going to do when you can no longer provision our major cities with fossil fuel and there will be no
alternatives in my humble opinion in the short period of time that we have left to consider?
That may be 20, 30, 40 years out so a young person that's 20 years old listening to all this I
was just more curious as to what you would tell them at a dinner table given them advice.
I'd tell them exactly what I've said now that you've got to look that far ahead what are your
children going to do? Look humans unfortunately and you've illustrated it right there are naturally
conditioned to be short-sighted economists call it discounting. Discounting that is to say
not paying too much attention what's going to happen in the future because after all
it's not going to affect me it's other people somewhere else. Well Nate it may not be 20 years
it may be 10 years. 10 years ago I didn't think it conceivable that I would see the obvious evidence
of the climate change that was ahead. A year ago in this region we saw billions of dollars of
damage to agriculture and communities that were completely flooded out by an unprecedented
atmospheric river that inundated this area in rain that we haven't seen ever before. So it's
happening now and you can't depend on it not happening for another 20 or 30 years. So it may
happen to you it'll certainly happen to your children kids and your grandchildren. Well I don't
have children for some of the reasons discussed on this call but I'll ask you a question I didn't
intend on it. Is there an information hazard here? People that tune into this podcast kind of know
what they're getting but if the whole if you could press a button and have the whole world
understand what you have outlined in this conversation would you do that and might that
have even worse effects if everyone believed what what you're saying? That's an unperformable
experiment I don't know the answer to that question okay but I do know this Nate that look
we need to have a common understanding of our future and perhaps this isn't the correct future
maybe I'm complete bullshit artist and everything I've said is untrue. On the other hand most people
don't know about the kinds of things you and I are talking about so I think we have an obligation
to put that in their toolkit of possibilities so that every individual at some point can better
interpret the kinds of information they hear daily coming through the media of one kind or another.
Eventually there will be a gelling around the truth about the nature of reality here. My primary
hope is that this gelling this this sense of communal responsibility for the future of our
species and that of thousands of other species is something we really have to take seriously
and I think unfortunately many of our cultural heroes today simply don't take it seriously.
If you think of the Elon Musk's of the world who want to abandon this wrecked planet and
and start all over again on a dead rock you know half a million light years away
it just makes no sense to me whatsoever. This planet is still essentially functional
and it makes far more sense to rescue and rehabilitate and reconstruct that which works
than to attempt to colonize a dead rock like the moon or Mars.
So slowing down a little here two more questions what do you care most about in the world Bill?
That's a really tricky question obviously I love my wife and my immediate friends and family
but in the world Nate look we have romantic nature images of nature but I'm one who has
been in places and when I did my PhD research in the Arctic in Canada I literally wept on
the ground sometimes out of the sheer beauty and the incredible illustrations of the productivity
of life there were birds nesting everywhere I mean I've seen wolves I've stepped on a polar bear
that was sleeping and nearly uh saw an immediate that was a really interesting story but that's
interesting it was astonishing no look nature is not all that pleasant you know if we go back
a couple a hundred years you're going to be have lice and fleas and parasites and nature is a
cool place it's a competitive ballgame but it's also a thing of immense beauty and when you begin
to understand how life itself is created the living film on the planet and maintains and regulates
the environment so that all of it can survive it becomes a thing of immense beauty just
understanding the way the system operates to self-produce and look all the material
necessary for the life as we see it has been recycling through the ecosphere for literally
millions of years you undoubtedly have thousands of molecules that once roamed the great plains of
what is now north america is tyrannosaurus rex we are the exemplars of natural recycling
and yet we're totally unconscious of this and think we're disconnected from it all
I think evolution is one of the most amazing things that have as or as have ever happened
and I think humans puzzling out that evolution happened is equally amazing and just what you
just said is a parallel to that that the natural world is so beautiful but understanding how it
works the systems ecology that you've helped us unpack a little bit in this conversation
understanding the drivers the biogeochemical processes the the trophic flows how everything
is connected that also is beautiful and maybe not to everyone but I think to you and certainly to
to myself and a lot of our colleagues the understanding of how the human and and earth
ecosystem fits together is a thing of beauty I think you're absolutely right human beings are
an ecosystem or at least part of every ecosystem and that's the thing we have forgotten
human beings are the major consumer organism in every single ecosystem we should be husbanding
and caressing every single ecosystem upon which we depend but we're operating from a mindset that says
it's not important we can exploit this to the hilt and then simply move on to the next ecosystem
or next planet an absurd self-defeating mindset in my opinion
so we have reached the last question professor reese and given everything you've said so far I'm
I'm reluctantly looking forward to hearing your answer if you were the nevel and dictator
bill and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one thing that you might do to
improve human and planetary futures I suppose the one thing I would attempt to do is to
create a new constitution for the world based on the concept of avoidance of overshoot and that
would mean recognition the need to implement somehow I would think in as gentle and a non-coercive
manner as possible a mental attitude a mindset totally different from the current mindset from
which we operate keep in mind the humans don't live in reality they live in the social constructions
the way they think the world's work well we created a mindset a paradigm if you want to
call it that a set of beliefs values and assumptions that are totally self-destructive
because they were created in ignorance as if we were apart from nature so the new paradigm the new
vision the new cultural narrative has to be one which sees human beings as an integral component
of the ecosystems upon which we uh literally at currently we were parasitic but we now have to
become become conventionalist how can we live on this earth in ways that sustain and support
the rest of the systems that support us and to do that we need to develop policies that increase
equity that is to say that the distribution of natural wealth among the human species we need
to do that while reducing our overall consumption by at least 45 or 50 that would be 75 or 80
percent in rich countries and we need to do this while getting a grip on human population
because on a finite planet with a limited reproductive capacity or bio capacity you can
support twice as many people on a little bit or half as many people on this what am I saying
if you have a given flow of resources you can either support x people or two x people but the
two x people won't be living nearly as well as the x people so that's a simple relationship
and we have to understand that we're on a finite planet whose capacity is actually shrinking because
of our overwhelming predisposition to deplete literally to liquidate the natural capital
of supporting it so population control is absolutely I think essential in the future
if we want to have a reasonable standard of living for say somewhere around one to two billion
people on a planet that could exist in perpetuity at least for the next couple of billion years
we won't be around for all of that but let's keep it going well you are 25 years older than me and
seem to have two x the energy so I suggest you do write such a constitution and maybe it would
serve as an overton window sort of tool for others thank you thank you so much bill for your
your lifetime of scholarship and speaking truth to power on ecology and these issues and thank you
for your time today thank you very much Dave I think you're both the only person who's listened
certainly none of the politicians have paid a whole lot of attention to what we've been talking
about there's there's been a pleasure talking to you again old friend take care thanks bill
