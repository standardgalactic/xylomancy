it would be better if more people understood what is wrong with the progress narrative
and understood what authentic progress actually entails and understood the caution and restraint
that it requires understood the emphasis on maintaining understood that very often the best
way to solve a problem is to remove its causes which actually involves reversing some stuff rather
than always create new stuff but the obviously market incentive is on create new stuff the history
books incentive is on create new stuff but as we think about how do we actually solve problems
in a way that isn't a racket right that isn't solving a problem that was caused by the result
of our previous problem solving and that will in turn create more of that today i am rejoined by
daniel schmockdenberger who is the director of the conciliants project and the co-founder
of civilization research institute where he and his colleagues have just written a new
paper called development in progress which is the topic of this long horizontally and vertically
deep conversation with daniel we talk about what is progress the history of progress who gets to
write the progress narrative and whether progress itself actually means betterment for society
for the well-being of the human species and the natural world you might not be surprised
to hear that this episode raised more questions than answers and in fact i didn't even get to my
questions because we were unpacking his paper those are going to have to be discussed in a
follow-up conversation i think we have to understand the problems the generator functions the dynamics
and start asking questions about where do we want to go and how do we get there from here
and i think these conversations with people like daniel at least start to uh um define
the parameters of the conversation and where we need to go please welcome daniel schmockdenberger
daniel schmockdenberger welcome back good to see you my friend good to see you holy crap you look
different uh one part gandalf one part zoos one part surfer dude you didn't mention uh
appalachia mountain guy that just stopped cutting it when i moved to the mountains out here all right
well you look you look happy and healthy i am uh happy it's the sun just came out like just a minute
ago from where it was raining and uh storming and there's a huge rainbow over the mountains right
out my window right as we're starting to talk wow yeah the last podcast we did we had a background
of just bright verdant green outside your window and i know you have a new set up there so we can't
see it um okay welcome back we uh believe it or not it was a year ago uh that we had our last
podcast which was on artificial intelligence and the super organism and and this is kind of the
first follow-up to that conversation one of the core themes we talked about uh before we got to AI
itself uh was the delineation between narrow boundary goals and wide boundary and wisdom
and and that uh brought you to talk about uh what you called then naive progress versus real
progress and you have now written a paper uh which i've read on this concept you're now
referring to it as immature versus authentic progress and that is going to be the theme uh
of today's conversation uh how would you like to start i uh played a role in writing this paper
is a our team wrote it so multi-authored um yeah the relationship between what progress actually is
how we think about it and what our goals are and how we go about achieving them uh if we are
having narrowly defined goals as we discussed last time that can be achieved while externalizing
harm in other places and we do a lot of that and we look at all of the goal achieving and not all
the externalities we can call that progress and for those that happen to make it through
that process that are not the uh losers of the war and not the species that go extinct or
not the animals that are in the factory farms or uh the cultures that are genocided or anything else
uh there's a survivorship bias of being able to say you know those narrow definitions those
narrow goals uh we are the beneficiaries of the progress of those narrow goals kind of
differentially and so you can make a progress narrative associated with effective achieving
of narrow goals even if they are driving rivalry and driving externality
and uh you know it's not a great definition of progress it's um at generously it's a naive
definition of progress less generously it's propaganda and apologism for winners and um
the way that humans think about what is progress what is actual betterment of the world what are
lives in service to in that way is pretty important because it's significant to how we
orient ourselves individually and collectively so that's why it's an interesting topic well
while i was waiting for you i looked up progress in the dictionary and it has different definitions
pretending on the context but as a noun it's described as gradual betterment and as a verb
as to develop a higher better or more advanced stage uh so so why don't you unpack a little bit
on why the concept of progress uh in our in our cultural goals our aspirations our narratives
the stories of modern human culture why it's so important i think most everybody watching your
show this is kind of obvious right they don't think that the totality of things that are technological
advancement or that drive gdp or you know other things aligned with primary civilizational
metrics that we're optimizing that we consider the metrics of progress are comprehensively
good i think that people listening to your show know that uh what we consider progress by those
definitions is not necessarily good for nature and is something that is not good for nature
that we depend upon a good definition of progress uh is not equally distributed good for
across wealth classes across global south across you know so many things like that
but we can just give a couple examples so in your definition it mentioned both advancement and
betterment which are different things and it's kind of important to think about that because
advancement could be purely a technological thing with no definition of good right so we can say
that this iteration of the iphone is more technologically advanced has more computer
processing more capabilities etc than the previous one so it's definitely progress from the definition
of advancement is the world better as a result better is a question that science actually can't
answer on its own because it's a question of good right which is related to ought not just is
and so now we get into moral philosophy we get into something that is connected to but outside of
the domains of the philosophy of science itself which is what is actually good and so let's say
that we look at the graphs that are very clear about how uh screen time associated with foams
corresponds to teen suicide suicidal ideations and self harm and you can watch that as cell phones
started to become ubiquitous and as people spend more hours per day on the cell phones and it's
easier to spend more hours on the ones that are more technologically advanced because they do more
things and end up being more addictive that body dysmorphia and suicide and mental illness go up
and so it's it's more advanced is it better for the people that are using it no um in a lot of
metrics that really matter right and if you look at the total supply chain effects of making those
and you look at the conflict zones associated with those mines and supply chains and everything
that's all part of the story of is the world better as a result of doing this thing there's
no question that the you know better living through chemistry uh leading up to the world
that rachel carlson wrote about in silent spring um like leaded gasoline did stop engine knocking
so it was absolutely better from the perspective of the uh efficiency of engine process not knocking
now DDT killed mosquitoes yeah very effectively so from the narrow definition of kills mosquitoes
and provide some convenience super effective and it was a great act of technological progress to
be able to figure out how to do this thing now did the DDT start kill like killing everything and
causing ecocide at scale and human health effects at scale and pollinators and ecological collapse
and did the leaded gasoline take a billion points off of global IQ and make us something
like four x more violent yes i did that too and so this is the thing is to think about
and again everybody knows from who's listening here that GDP goes up with war military spending
private contractors you know so if if gd if market size is a measure of civilizational
progress then war is awesome um GDP goes up with addiction right because if someone is addicted
to mcdonald's addicted to their smartphone and purchasing addicted to whatever it leads to more
market activity um it goes up with diseases that are treated through for-profit processes
and so there are a lot of ways and you know there are kids who do very well at the primary
metrics of school like SATs but who are suicidal or sociopathic so from the narrow definition of
did this way of raising kids and educating them do well SAT sure from uh did we raise
healthy human beings uh that can also contribute to a healthy society it's a very different question
and so the the idea that humanity has been making kind of these strides of progress as
we have had cumulative knowledge and we've definitely had cumulative knowledge and there
definitely things about it that are good um if someone was trying to figure out math from scratch
on their own and there hadn't been recorded knowledge they'd never get as far as roman numerals
right they'd get like maybe counting and but we can learn all of this knowledge and do things with it
so there is progress of stored knowledge there is progress of capability of achieving things
are we are the goals well defined you know are they good goals is a is a really important question
and um the progress narrative the idea that technology in particular is advancing rapidly
and is making everything better and better along with the market and democracy and science uh and
that this is the best time to be alive and that the Hobbesian view that you know the state of
man in nature their life is brutish short nasty and mean we have civilized ourselves everyone is
literate um you know et cetera nobody would want to go back to the days before novocaine
we have so much more wealth now et cetera et cetera and we're right about to develop
ai's that will usher in a phase of so much more rapid exponential progress that it will bring
about um you know abundance and utopia for everybody that narrative really took off
following kind of what we call modernity the enlightenment the scientific revolution leading
to the industrial revolution and the rapid changes that have happened in the world and that
corresponds with what you talk about of the carbon spike and it changed everything radically
and rapidly in a way that you know there was no precedent for that much change that quickly going
from half a billion people to eight billion people in 200 years where it had taken 200
thousand years to get to half a billion people of humans being here i'm just wondering if if the
carbon pulse and the um related economic growth enabled people to follow this uh idea of progress
and if we wouldn't have had growth they would have complained or we would have thought of
different ways but as long as it was possible for them to to be part of the winners um then this was
all accepted but now things are becoming too obvious uh to deny what's happening to the planetary
ecological situation um inequality um lots of pollution and and other things so has there always
been a critique of progress uh and it's just the last century or so it's been diminished because
everyone could ride this wave or or historically what do you think about that okay so i want to
come back to how the progress narrative kind of formalized in modernity um but let's go back
before that well before that well before the carbon pulse
it's a pretty simple thing to state that history is written by the winners of wars
the losers of wars don't get to write history books and the history that is written by the
continuous continuously written by the next winner of war creates a progress narrative
because the winner typically says it was a good thing that they want it wasn't a bad thing that
they want and so they will say things like we were civilizing the savages with our colonialism
and it's actually a great act of benevolence that these um you know naked barbarous savages
uh are getting taught english and christianity and literacy they were all illiterate you know
and so we will uh gruesomely straw man their civilization or culture if not totally
villainize it um and then you know paint a story of what we did that goes along with the
power conferred by doing it and so the if if you one view kind of a real politic a real
view of history is just study conquerors for a minute right just study the history of conquerors
gangas con killed roughly 50 million people in his life
and the estimates vary 50 million is a pretty standard estimate but like this was well before
industrial technology there were no tanks there was no air force right like this was cavalry
and he and his men killed 11 percent of the entire global population
mind-blowingly brutally unnecessarily and you know to then also recognize this
that something like 10 percent of the population of asia are all believed to be his descendants
now because in addition to the amount of killing the amount of raping that happened
so then you look at it till of the hun and then you look at alexander the great you look at
Caesar you look at Ivan the terrible you look at the the progressive history of that and
there were cultures that were way more peaceful that lived in let more harmony with nature that
were not focused on growth of empire at all costs if you actually look at indigenous culture
it's a very interesting thing the thing we call the beginning of civilization
it's such a funny thing right like typically somewhere around Babylonia Mesopotamia early
Egypt we call the beginning of civilization maybe now we say gobleci tepi but like it's very recent
like some you know 10 000 years and it has to do with animal husbandry agriculture and growing
large populations and permanent settlements and the written word and a few things like that
but humans have been here for a couple hundred thousand years before that they had
worldviews and systems of medicine and systems of music and art and poetry and dance and
you know like a lot of things there they had the same genetic brains we have and wisdom and
and they didn't live old people didn't live to be 30 years old that's just utter gibberish right
like yes infant mortality was high but old people were old people throughout history
and you'll notice that there's a reason why all those cultures stayed pretty small
right they stayed within one of the Dunbar numbers and it's not that they couldn't grow it's that
they had very strong reasons not to and we discussed last time a little bit that pretty
much any definition of wisdom that anybody offers usually has restraint as an embedded concept
wisdom involves what not to do where you could have personal advantage where you could have
some near-term advantage but it's actually not the right thing to do and so if you think about
the Dunbar number right kind of the the first one what do you mean by first one well the
original Dunbar number proposed was roughly something about 150 150 to 220 somewhere in there
and then other people have done kind of progressive Dunbar like numbers which are different numbers
of people where different coordination systems are possible up to that number
and there are some that are smaller than that and some that are larger than that
but let's just take that one because that was a very significant one
up to that number everybody can fit around a tribal council and all be in a single conversation
without amplification right they can all hear each other and possibly all contribute to a
really significant choice it's going to affect everybody's life everybody can know everybody
so if i'm making sacrifices for other people they're not anonymous strangers that i think are
assholes they're like people that have saved my life they're people that helped raise me they're
people who i helped raise there and so at the scale where everybody can know everybody everybody
can love everybody everybody has some connection with everyone and where we can all have a say in
that which our life will be bound to if there's a lot of reason to not get bigger than that if it
gets bigger than that and there's a decision to make and there's not time or capacity to hear
everyone's voice some people will have to subordinate and now my life is subject to things
i don't have a choice so so in some senses there's a negative feedback to progress and because of
so much social reciprocity that potentially informs wisdom and restraint at that scale well
it's that they had some insight that a larger number of people was not progress
and it was not better meant in the definition that they were interested in because it means
actually less having a say in your own life and less intimacy with everybody that you are
in engagement with right well but for a lot of part a lot of those millennia
they were running up against limits like they couldn't support larger populations necessarily
because of the natural resources and food and such no i think there were a lot of places
where they could and you had multiple tribes in the same place that ended up creating tribal
relationships with each other you can see this in the recent parts that we have in writing with
the Iroquois Confederacy and like that and yet rather than all make one giant city they actually
stayed in these separate bands or tribes and had relationships with each other and they actually
had things about restraint that were very clear and actually kind of amazing so for instance when
you look at the indians of the pacific northwest where the kind of caloric abundance was really
high right because of the salmon and you know other things like that when they made technological
advances like in better fishing hooks and longer lines there were rules to spend less to use that
efficiency to spend less time fishing not catch more fish so it was like an embedded anti-jevons
paradox rule yes and that's wisdom right it that's a way to think about the what the Sabbath is
right we've talked about this before the Sabbath amongst other things i'm not reducing it to only
this is a binding of a multipolar trap it's a binding of a maximum power principle right
which is if anybody works on sunday they can get enough differential advantage and get ahead
that they will end up you know beating everybody else so then everybody has to work on sunday so
now we have a world where everybody works all the time nobody enjoys it but everyone has to do that
and it's miserable no one can connect with their families restore regenerate themselves connect with
the divine or anything else so you just force nobody is allowed to do that you know they made it
punishable by death right and leviticus but what it meant was it bound a multipolar trap for everybody
it was actually using law to bind that thing there's wisdom in that and that came from a
wisdom tradition and the thing about the potlatch and let's get rid of this surplus let's not keep
this surplus and grow our population let's not keep this surplus and have a reason for another
group to come war with us to take the stuff let's actually get rid of the surplus and come back
into depending upon nature and being in kind of that relationship similarly with the we got better
fishing hooks we could catch a lot more fish and then we'll collapse the fishing the fish population
and create problems for our social structure and etc so let's just spend less time fishing and now
we have more time for art and love making and meditation and other things right and so the
technological advance didn't lead to a jevons paradox because in the same reason the same way
that we talk about now a jevons paradox if you have more efficiency that could lead to using less
only if you create law that binds that that's what it must be otherwise it you just get return on
investments of efficiency and maximum power principle right um maybe we'll explain that briefly
for anyone that is coming in this time who hasn't come in before well maximum power principle is
that we don't necessarily need energy but energy per unit time is what we're trying to maximize
and that in nature organisms and ecosystems self-organize so as to better access energy because
energy is needed for movement for for anything cellular metabolism digestion all things relate
to energy so historically those organisms and ecosystems that had more access to energy per
unit time had an adaptive advantage but i have deep questions about the relationship of authentic
versus naive progress as it pertains to maximum power as this conversation unfolds but is that
suffice for for your question um the thing i want to add is the just if anyone's hearing
about jevons paradox for the first time and what maximum power principle at the level of civilization
means well it it um the more technology that we invent like led light bulbs then uh they become
so cheap and ubiquitous that we actually use more lighting in the world so there's a rebound effect
as we develop more technology that actually uses more energy globally and this you see in so many
different ways i'll just add the for the people who kind of understandably think
couldn't technological advancement create more efficiency such that we could use less stuff
and still have you know uh economic quality in our life the jevons paradox is a really key thing
to understand which is if you make if you figure out how to get copper more efficiently or you
figure out how to get nitrogen more efficiently or energy more efficiently it also means that that
the cost of that thing goes down which also means that now the market input to a whole
bunch of areas that weren't quite profitable open up and so now you get a whole bunch of new
market areas and the net result is that when you a thing becomes more efficient rather than
using less you use more use more of that plus all the other things that are industrially connected
to it and as a consumer as an individual if i save money on some new technology i'm going to
spend that money at home depot or wal-mart on on something else that requires energy and resources
so if if we had the equivalent of the indians in the northwest that you were mentioned before the
native americans that we had some wisdom some Sabbath equivalent some we can't fish more hours
if we had that in our system then this technological innovation that we have might not be a result
in uh immature progress so let's talk about you know i think it's pretty clear that making the
lead of gasoline and making the DDT are definitions of progress that for a narrow
purpose are but are like obviously pretty terrible and the same is true when it comes to
advances in weaponry and um making i mean there's so many examples like
making food that isn't perishable great technological achievement um if you consider food
perishing a problem to solve technologically as opposed to a feature of life we're supposed to
relate with that keeps us living close to the living ecosystem and aware of biological things
break down which also keeps us aware of our own death which keeps us aware of the meaningfulness
of life and you know so many things like that so um if you look at the emergence of fast food
and uh convenience store foods that have much more addictiveness and much less micronutrients
and are comprehensively bad to the population physiologically psychologically you know etc
they're still progress and so i think that kind of progress everybody can probably get all right
there's a problem of that but even let's say that we're talking about things that don't seem to be
market driven but are even like trying to make progress on solving global problems
so let's look at climate change for a minute um
so the first paper on climate change scientific paper was published in 1938
UNEP was created united nation environmental program was created in 1972 to look at major
global environmental issues and have international coordination obviously climate change had a us
vice presidents popularize it has had almost every kind of celebrity you know
nasa and noa and the largest scientific databases and computational capabilities in the world
are backing it there's a trillion dollars in climate finance per year nuclear energy hydro
energy solar energy etc and the total amount of fossil fuel energy that is used goes up every year
that entire time and there's a place where we just have to pause a little bit if we take that in
to say wait wait so everything we've done towards climate hasn't decreased fossil fuel energy
it hasn't even slowed the increase in the amount that we use each year relative to the year before
we're continuing to grow the total amount we use like what okay so if you think about that for a minute
so because we want to get off fossil fuel energy we're going to make a hydroelectric
dam and it's going to destroy a whole ecosystem by uh you know flooding that whole area it's
going to stop migratory pathways of fish and correspondingly birds it's going to cause geopolitical
conflict between the countries that were involved maybe it's all those problems maybe all that would
be worth it if it was stopping the fossil fuels use but if it's just like oh there's another source
of energy all awesome we'll use that energy and the fossil fuels energy because there's
still positive returns on both they're both profitable to continue to use and think about
all the nuclear energy we've made right like all the risk of nuclear waste having to be managed
forever all the risk of nuclear power plants being able to be things that can be targeted
in war and become nuclear volcanoes even by non-nuclear powers the increase in visible material
all that risk and that didn't even decrease fossil fuel use
and so you're like okay well the way we've been trying to solve the climate problem empirically
is not working and many of the solutions add new harms without actually even addressing the
existing ones effectively at all so uh this is also not a good definition of progress right
but how much of your critique or the paper uh critique of progress is a you know a critique
of GDP as our cultural aspiration by a different name okay let's go back to Genghis Khan or for a
moment okay and friends because we were pre-GDP at that time right yeah and we were pre-carbon
pulse yeah so it is not true that all of the tribal populations were as big as they could be
throughout history limited only by scarce food that's part of the rewrite of history that assumes
that cities and bigger populations are better and that progress has been linearly happening and
etc um there is no when i said that earlier i meant like a hundred thousand years ago not
not you know ten thousand five thousand years ago but but go on the the archaeology gets less
good the further back you go which means it becomes more subject to the projection of your narrative
because you have less data and so you read this stuff through your narrative so if you have a
Hobbesian narrative that says their lives were brutish or nasty and mean but that same narrative
is why we had manifest destiny it is the manifest destiny of us colonialists to take over North
America to take it away from being uh a vast wilderness for squalid savages and to civilize
it so that it can hold civilization right like was it you read uh quotes from many of the chiefs of
like it was only considered a wilderness to them we filled with like terrible beasts and
stuff we considered it a beautiful paradise and we were friends with all the animals and it was
only them that considered it full of squalid savages because they didn't have any interest in
coming to understand the depth and intricacy and beauty of our culture but it was progress
because the winners wrote the books yes and so if there was a culture that didn't orient to its
maximum size and maximum colonialism and empire expansion and whatever because it wanted to not
train the kids up to go die in war wanted to train the kids up to have a beautiful life it wanted to
have not turn all of nature into military equipment and stuff and agriculture land but to
you know have some deep appreciation of what nature was those cultures usually lost in war
to the cultures that did the other thing well exactly so what if there were 10 cultures 10
tribes back in the day and nine of them were peaceful in harmony with nature music community
love making yes inventions if there was only one tribe that was a genghis khan type thing
that's who won won in quotes this is a really important part of the story of history in my opinion
is unless the person doing the tribal warfare unless the other 10 all noticed it and went
and stopped them from even being able to develop that capability then yes the person who starts in
the the group that starts investing in offensive tribal warfare is going to went and then what
and this played a role in the thing that we call cities and the movement to larger civilizations
is once we're in the age of tribal warfare smaller numbers are going to do much less well
than larger numbers are and so if there is any group that is now starting to do the offensive
warfare thing now a couple smaller groups need to unify together people will have less say and
they'll have less liberty but already more of them will have to train in military than in the arts
and other types of things because that multipolar trap is now in place but there's a very important
thing is we've talked about multipolar traps here before right in arms race is a multipolar trap
where everybody's racing to make faster hypersonic weapons and multiple reentry vehicles and more
effective autonomous weapons and whatever because we have to do that because what if the other guy
gets it even though we're making a world that is our own risk of dying at all those things goes way
up and is a comprehensively worse world so the arms race is a multipolar trap the market race
even if what it's doing is driving massive externalities is a multipolar trap the tragedy
of the commons we have to extract the resources even if we destroy the ecology before the other
guy because if we don't it doesn't protect the ecosystem the other guy is going to destroy them
all first and use that increased resource has competitive advantage to beat us so the multipolar
trap is it is one of the reasons why we can't do anything about climate change very effectively
right now is nobody wants to price carbon properly at a country level that has the rule of law to be
able to bind its own economy because it would put them so radically behind everyone else who
wasn't doing that economically and that economics has converted to military power and technological
innovation and everything else no one wants to slow down their ai to try to do it safely slow
down their synthetic biology so it's just kind of a full race dynamics now we've talked about
this before but there's something even deeper that you just mentioned which is
the multipolar trap is usually initiated by a psychopath and in our tribal past
subdued by numbers there was strong social reciprocity that would inhibit the the potential
power of a psychopath i want to build this out a little bit more and then i'll say that the
not everyone wants to go initiate tribal war and have their children die in war so that they
can have the glorious large empire that is not everybody's desire the uh the the people who have
one at doing that thing i can't imagine anything anyone not desiring that unless they are betas
who just couldn't win at it um because they can't imagine anything like fulfillment that is not
oriented on conquest or intimacy or things like that and so not everybody wants to do that thing
right but if somebody wants to do that thing there's something wrong with them there's
something really deeply wrong with them and but now everybody else has to do something that can
deal with that or lose by default right and yeah this is very much like the emergence of a cancer
in the body right the the cancer is not just another cell having its own individual freedom to
express itself in a slightly different way and it should be allowed to have its own individual
expression the other cells like there's a difference between the liver cells and the blood cells and
the kidney cells and the they're all different but they all have a shared genome and they're all
working as parts of this larger whole and they're constrained by that and that's okay because they
would also die like a kidney outside of a body is not that interesting it doesn't sustain itself so
all of the cells are constrained by being a part of a body to serve the good of the body
so they get to have individual expression but they also have interconnectedness and with that
an obligation the cancer cell it's like not fuck the obligation i'm going to do my thing and i'm
going to actually consume resources faster and replicate faster and if it does that and metastasizes
that idea right then the rest the rest of the body the immune system has to kill that thing
or that thing will kill the rest of the system including itself including itself right and
that's the thing is that the cancer cell is having amazing progress at consumption and replication
it's betterment for for its own goals yes it's succeeding at its goals and then
that there are the most number of copies of itself right before it kills the host and kills itself
oh boy so um certainly in the deep ecology movement um there are some people that view
humanity as a cancer cell and based on the last five minutes um you're suggesting that it's not
humanity it's some individuals that through some positive feedback uh in tandem with energy surplus
broke free of the the wisdom and restraint of small groups and it's it's that multipolar trap
that has created that has created a lot of these negative effects on the planet nobody can argue
that we that there are a lot of cultures that have no descendants today because Alexander or
Caesar or Genghis Khan killed them all and their memes and their cultures and their genes didn't
make it through that particular selection process and it that there that does not mean
that they didn't have higher qualities of life or more sustainability with nature it means they
weren't good at war and they weren't good at even if they were good at war individually right because
some people might take objection tribal warriors they were not good at scaled violence effective
scaled coordinate violence and we are the descendants unavoidably of the people that
scaled empire with all of the ecological harm warfare genocide etc that we are genetically
and memetically and culturally the descendants of those processes i i think that's a profound
insight but i'll i'll push back a little and say we're also the descendants of those humans that
killed off the neanderthals yes there is so i'm going to make some conjecture here that i don't
have the data to support um and i would really like to get the data which i which i know you by
now well enough these past few years is something you rarely do but um but go on the data for this
is not available that i have seen because it's ancient and our archaeology has too many conflicting
things so our early tool making call it stone tools and uh you know then fire right like very
early tool making was it a radical change and obviously that didn't start with sapiens right
that started with homo habilis or something like that um was a pretty radical change in
selection criteria from everything before and because now the selection criteria were not
the result of a genetic mutation that was corporeally built into our body it was the result of us
understanding how to extend what our body does extra corporeally where the ability to advance
those technologies was much more rapid than evolution's advancement of our body's
predatory you know capabilities or whatever kind of um selection capabilities and that was the
beginning of a really significant asymmetry that did not exist in the rest of the natural world
and the rest of natural evolution in natural evolution the mutation forces that are acting on
something that produce a bunch of useless mutations i'm using kind of standard evolutionary
theory they produce a bunch of useless mutations but a few of them are effective and they get
selected for those mutations pressures whether we're talking about gamma rays or oxidative stress
or whatever or just uh you know transcription errors are operating across the entire ecosystem
all of the beings there's an even distribution of kind of the mutation pressures and then there's
also a co-selection process so the mutation that leads to a predator getting slightly sharper
teeth or a slightly stronger jaw or slightly faster running it's only slightly right you don't get like
a massive jump like we get with AI systems from one generation to the next so let's say there is
a mutation that leads to a capacity that makes them slightly more effective at their niche
let's say it's a predatory niche simultaneously similar types of mutation pressures are happening
on the things that they eat that make them slightly faster slightly better at camouflage
have slightly sharper senses you know whatever it is right and so neither of them are getting a
massive asymmetrical jump relative to the other they're having similar kinds of very very gradual
increases and then let's say the predator had one first so it's going to start doing slightly
better at eating prey it's of course going to be statistically eating the slower ones more often
than the faster ones and as a result the inbreeding of the faster genes also leads to a change in
selection dynamics so both the distribution of mutation and co-selection lead to a process where
there is a symmetry of power that is maintained across the whole system and it's not just in a
one-to-one relationship right it's the predator with the prey it's that prey animal with the plants
right as it gets the ability to digest more stuff the plants start figuring out how to put
out more volatile oils or spread seeds faster or whatever it is but your point here is that it was
symmetric and it was really slow yes and as a result you're actually not getting power asymmetries
you're not getting concentrations of power you're getting distributions of power and the distribution
of power is that what's allowing there to be a harmony across that whole space
and it's why you don't get that what is good for lions as a whole is bad for gazelles as a whole
right of course this lion eating this gazelle that might be the case but lions as a whole
and gazelles as a whole are actually symbiotic species if the lions went away the gazelles would
actually do less well right they would have the weaker genes inbreed more often and you know
etc if the gazelles went away the lions would do less well so at the micro level it looks like
competition and even zero sum but at the macro level they're symbiotic but the key reason does
have to do with the symmetry of power in the relationship in the same way that like
fighting in your weight class is a thing right if you're competing and the kind of original
definition of competing means something like to strive together if i'm competing with someone
where they get a little bit better and it like it inspires and teaches and forces me to get a
little bit better you know there is some kind of co-progress together but if i am going to fight
with a guy that's just 10 times my capability and he just kills me right like i don't get better
from that there there's not a you know similar kind of progress the progress does involve a
certain kind of symmetry and the ability to navigate the situation
and so if you the first question with progress is progress for whom
yeah and then then we would say progress of what across what metrics across what way of assessing
what is valuable and progress that is progress for some that is totally bad for others but
also bad for others that that some depends upon is a very narrow definition of progress and even
like the cancer cell that will eventually kill its own host it's a definition that is not
actually long-term even viable for the for the interest of where the progress seems to have been
true so i can begin to surmise why you and your team spent so much time and effort writing this
this paper this is a central chasm in our discourse that we need to address
yeah so we've talked before that the metacrisis you know we have
lots of different global catastrophic risks just in the domain of ecology we're facing right we
could really mess the biosphere up just because of PFOS just because of pesticide just because
of mining waste just because of biodiversity loss just because of damage to oceans and dead
zone and coral like we have lots of different from the extraction side and the pollution side
catastrophic risks that are the result of our success at progress and by the way all those
things you mentioned are considered externalities that are currently not priced in our decisions
and our success metrics at all yeah and what is the cost of the Great Barrier Reef like what
should the value of it be what should the value of healthy soil microbes be well everything dies
without soil microbiology but like everything dies without air and the cost of air is nothing
and the reason the cost of air is nothing is because i everybody still has access to it
and i can't patent it i can't have differential access to it so it's just no need to bother putting
a price on it but that also means that it gets damaged through industrial process continuously
through air pollution through burning things where you're using up the O2 and turning it into CO2
etc and there is a slight decline in oxygen globally because of the burning of fossil
fuels and much higher in the oceans ocean oxygen has declined 2% in the last 50 years
obviously the O in the CO2 is there was carbon there were hydrocarbons that were getting burned
which means oxidized right so you're of course you're gonna have those things happen together
it's very interesting so not just the most important things like the soil microbiology
and the phytoplankton and the air that we are rapidly destroying that are the
the most priceless priceless things there could be right but if you look at people's deathbed
reflections at what they said was meaningful and i was very fortunate when i was growing up my mom
took me to uh old folks homes to spend time with them and i got to hear a lot of deathbed
reflections and it was very influential in my life the highlights of what people say was worth it
had nothing ever to do with anything that the market ever gave them
yeah and everything it had to do with was only the things that could occur in the time that they
were not an agent of the market where they were not working producing etc it had to do with their
time with their family their time with loved ones their time in nature their time in religious
experience but the market can't supply those things very well so it doesn't value them at all
and it emphasizes reward circuits that it can monetize so i don't want to diverge too much from
from your paper but if there were a billionaire i mean there's there's uh there's multi-polar
traps but there's also social traps um and if there were a billionaire listening to this agreeing
with the logic that you're laying out but saying i'm powerless to change my behaviors in trying to
maximize my own bitcoin fiat currency lead over my competitors because everyone else is doing it
this way so i see the world as being very messed up and getting worse yet for me in my position
i'm doing the thing that is best for my family irrespective of what the future is how do we get
beyond those i call them the 1500 elites in the world have to recognize this this this trap
that you're describing so the idea of an externality that we're building a technology or a business or
a law or a nonprofit or whatever to do something we're building it to try to usually solve some
problem where we can assess that in a narrow metric whatever that is or a small handful of metrics
but that technology and the supply chains that make it and the power dynamics it confers
whatever do other stuff they affect other stuff other than the stuff we intended to affect
and a lot of it ends up being negative we go those externalities there can be positive
externalities too and that's an important thing to consider um so there's this story
that it's impossible to forecast externalities because the world is so complex and you couldn't
possibly know in advance so all we can do is you know make something that is innovative and awesome
and then when we see the problem work to solve it and the continuous solving of problems is
is what humanity's here for and part of progress uh this is gibberish right this is just total
gibberish but it is self-motivated gibberish for the people who did not want to try to anticipate
the externalities or didn't want to admit them because they were going to privatize gains and
socialize losses and then later say it's impossible to predict what the externalities would be so
I think it was a DAO that just got a 10 billion dollar uh lawsuit settlement for PFOS remediation
that they have to pay like 10.3 billion dollars which is significant and it's because some of
the investigative journalism showed that not only is the is PFOS in every drop of rainwater
in the entire world in Antarctica and you know on all the continents and is it on all the water
surface areas and is it not just affecting human health but it's affecting all biology down to the
soil microbes in the phytoplankton in ways we can't understand all of and it doesn't break down
there are no biological processes because it was built as an industrial product to be a thing that
doesn't break down right to resist corrosion and then resist all of the various types of things
okay so just
I think it might have actually been Minnesota your state just one state's PFOS remediation
was estimated at costing 20 billion dollars if they were going to try to use known technological
methods to get the PFOS out so this 10 billion dollar from the primary producer globally is a
joke I can send the stats but it was something like 16 trillion a year to do total PFOS remediation
over the course of a decade so the entire global GDP to remediate one class of chemicals it doesn't
include agricultural chemicals and mining chemicals and everything else well that explains why we're
not doing it okay so stay with me I'm trying to construct something and taking a circuitous route
so it turns out that
investigation showed that that company knew PFOS was a carcinogen before it was ever put into
the environment or put into any industrial application they hid the science it had caused
cancer in the lab rats and so there was just like a direct cover-up and the same thing was
true with leaded gas right we the people who were inventing leaded gas were all getting sick
in the laboratory it was known to be toxic et cetera and there was just direct suppression of
that and if that's true and I believe you that it is why were those people suppressing it because
of short-term gain for them and the winners write the history books sort of story yeah so the short
term gain is hey if I stop this engine knocking thing and engines are the new thing cars are
everywhere right and I own the patent on this tetraethyl lead thing and I can add it to all gas
it's needed by everything we're gonna make a lot of money and probably it's not gonna be that bad
for people it'll be an air it'll be dispersed to want you know it'll be the parts per million
will be low whatever so there are lots of times where we actually know the harm something is gonna
cause whoever it is industry whatever ahead of time and do it anyways cover it up that's a known
thing there are other times where we just don't try very hard to do an analysis of
externalities because if we put money and resource into looking at is this gonna harm
things and the other competitor doesn't they're gonna get first mover advantage they're gonna
later be able to say we couldn't have possibly known and the money that I put into seeing those
harms might just tell me not to do the project and now how do I get a return on that money that I
put in and if it does show me a safer way to do the project it's probably so much later and with
less margins than the other thing and so at minimum there's a kind of negligence of if we do do
diligence we do this box checking plausible deniability version because we know we're gonna
be able to privatize the gains and socialize the losses right the apples of three trillion dollar
company that played a major role in smartphones in everybody's pockets and the fact that
teen body dysmorphia and suicide and porn addiction and mental health issues and everything went
up they don't have any liability for that and so they also have no incentive to really limit their
privatized gains to avoid causing those externalities let me interrupt you one more time which is
en route to the billionaire question so like you said in the day of unleaded gasoline
they were able to make a lot of money and they thought oh well this will be dispersed it won't
be that big of a deal but now I think a lot of people that work at corporations that are paying
attention to the metacrisis and the human predicament and climate and oceans and PFAS and social
inequalities and and addictions and everything else they have to be in these boardrooms wondering
this stuff is a little bit louder the externalities are are more obvious than this is a different
question that I would love to answer but if I do it I'll never get back to your first question
keep going remember yeah it's exactly the next place to go okay one is about
dark triad traits and sociopathy the other is willingness to be complicit with it okay
which are basically the two types of psychology that are conditioned for in the system well
can you briefly describe dark triad again I've done it on a frankly but maybe you could
describe it dark triad is the three and the the three qualities of sociopathy
narcissism and Machiavellianism and then sometimes it's referred to as the dark quad where
sadism is added as a fourth and these are like particularly dark aspects of human psychology
that can co-occur and so we're not looking here at a DSM diagnosis of a narcissist meaning
narcissistic personality disorder within cluster B or sociopathic personality disorder it's
sets of traits that people can have higher lower amounts of
and the same person in different environments can have higher lower amounts of you put a really
lovely person in a terrible prison and they're they better develop these traits they're probably
going to die right they're adaptive in some environments and so
you know people can look this up more but narcissism is roughly kind of an inflated
sense of their own entitlement their own importance their you know leadership worthiness that kind
of thing sociopathy is a lack of empathy for other people and not really caring to take their
worldview not really asking will this be progress for them not feeling remorse if they end up being
where the externalities land and harm is caused and Machiavellianism is the ability to sing
things strategically through you know a complex play right so if that Machiavellianism is in
service to self-oriented goals self-aggrandizing expanding goals that are not that attuned to
others you get problems with that thing right but those also make great leadership qualities
for the multipolar trap version of progress and especially in an institutional structure where
we have corporations and things like that relative to 500 or a thousand years ago well the corporation
I mean this is a great example right so 14th amendment was really everybody knows
to give personhood rights to black people following the emancipation proclamation in the end of
slavery it was for personhood rights for things that had not been considered persons black people
were not considered persons during slavery and the loophole in what was so obviously to give
personhood rights to people who had been previously slaves was then used to give personhood
rights to corporations by corporations that saw the legal advantage of being able to have
all of the due process and everything the persons have and I think in the first year after the
ratification of the 14th amendment the supreme court saw like something like 15 cases associated
with the 14th amendment associated with black people and it saw something like 350 cases
associated with businesses and corporate personhoods and the corporate person the entity that is the
public corporation is an obligate sociopath it can't so is a corporation an institutional
equivalent of a of a human dark triad trait this is what I'm saying a corporation does not it a
corporation is a you can think of it as a cybernetic entity right the the operating agreement the
legal agreements of what it is plus its whole operational machinery does not depend on any
particular person because you have an org chart and if you lose this assembly line worker or this
cheap marketing officer you replace them with a kind of market equivalent all the way up to a CEO
and so the entity is controlled by the cybernetic entity kind of controls itself aligned with these
legal operating agreements not controlled by anybody in particular and recognized as a
corporate person so it protects the directors from legal responsibility of what that corporate
person does even though of course it couldn't do it without running on the people and then
you have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profit which is a measure of extraction
and so and of course that corporate person doesn't have empathy it cannot it's not a
it's not a sentient thing right it is a cybernetic thing but it's not a sentient thing so it
doesn't have empathy it does have planning i.e. Machiavellianism it does have my own growth
should continue forever and I should be the market dominator that's narcissism and so yes it is an
obligate sociopath and it is actually legally required to maximize its shareholder return on
profit by the directors of the organization so the idea that you cannot possibly anticipate
externalities is not true but it's a useful idea of those who are going to benefit by causing
externalities and the people who benefit by causing externalities because they're privatizing all of
the gains get to write the narrative in the same way the history was written by the winners of war
previously like it costs a lot of money to affect the narrative of the world you see this in political
campaigns you see it in marketing campaigns but if an idea is spreading who is writing all
that stuff and who's up regulating it and who's paying for the commercials and who's getting
the data to do the personalized micro targeted ads and who's so the ideas that spread are not
just spreading through a kind of natural selection of the goodness of the idea they are getting
oftentimes amplified by interests that want those ideas to spread right we know this this is how
political campaigns work this is how advertising works this is how propaganda works this is how
you know on and on this is how religion works right there's a lot of money that goes into
proselytizing and getting the ideas to spread so there are a lot of ideas that are marketing and
or apologism for the dominant class in terms of power so the dominant narrative is usually
apologism for the dominant power system and that's why when we were in the age of colonialism
the narrative was that it was generous of us to bring this colonialism to civilize the savages
it's why we were in the age of spreading christendom through all of the various processes
that bringing christendom to all of the non-christians was the most charitable good act we could do
in the same way that like when we talk about externalities when facebook was in its early
phases there were people like you know jared lanier famously was saying this very publicly but there
were people coming from the mcluan school and um you know coming from various coming from the
mumford school who were saying hey look this technology where you're monetizing people's
attention and you're going to race to effectively monetize their attention and unlike where tv
commercials did that but it was the same for everybody you now get to have them interact with
it to gain personalized info to split test how sticky you monetize their attention a lot of the
things that are going to engage their attention more are going to be limbic hijacks they're
going to be things that make the person scared or horny or distracted or or uh in group out group
identity or whatever it is and this is going to be really bad for society it's not that no one was
saying that then it was being said it was being ignored it was not being studied and researched
and pursued because and then later they get to say we couldn't have possibly known it was going to
polarize society and break democracy and decrease everyone's attention spans so the we couldn't
have possibly known as a bullshit story if you think about well does am i saying that you can
anticipate everything of course not but am i saying you can do a million times better than
we even attempt to do now yes of course so in the process of developing a new technology say
could we proceduralize thinking through the total set of effects not just the intended
set of effects in the market benefits of those but thinking through if this technology really
takes off and goes to its full scale what is the pressure of that on all the supply chains
to make it and what is the environmental effects of that what are the you know political geopolitical
and etc effects what if people use it is it conferring some power if so what other thing
is it obsolete how will that change power dynamics etc you just kind of think it through now we have
a process that we've developed called yellow teaming red teaming is you know now become pretty
famous which is you're wanting to do something you want it to succeed red teaming is a process
you can do to see how it might fail how somebody could beat it or how it might fail yellow teaming
is if it succeeds where might it mess other things up so could we yellow team well yes you're not
going to predict everything but you predict a lot of the things and then you keep watching and when
you notice other things you procedurally internalize them now in the same way all this was to build up
to the billionaire question the long build up the people in a multipolar trap who are at the front
of the race could stop the multipolar trap but they don't want to because they believe they can win
so they use the multipolar trap as a story of their own lack of power to do anything else
as plausible deniability the littler guy cannot necessarily stop the multipolar trap
but someone who's at the leading edge of an arms race if they wanted to apply the same energy and
same sophistication to agreements to pursue because of course there's a situation that if
my country becomes more secure relative to other countries which means develops better weapons
it automatically makes everyone else less secure so now they have to do the same thing and
it just means that you have an arms race of increasing weapons forever and increasing
budgets going to it forever which is great for defense contractors it's actually great for gdp
and it's bad for everything else now if we could just say how let's make an agreement to all spend
less on weapons we can be proportionally less right proportionally less such that relative
security changes well of course people say well we can't possibly do that we couldn't get china
we couldn't get russia there's no way to enforce it etc and we're saying that right now with regard
to ai well even if we wanted to stop this thing from advancing that has that accelerates every
global catastrophic risk we couldn't possibly because there's so many places racing and we
couldn't stop china and blah blah blah therefore the only possible answer is to win the multipolar
trap because losing at it is too bad if you look at the resources we invest in figuring out ai if
we invested those same resources and actually creating healthy diplomacy where we were not ass
holes to our international neighbors and really tried to create global coordination to bind the
multipolar trap we could and so the billionaire that says well i don't know how to solve the
problems of the world like i'm too small right in the it's a hundred trillion dollar economy i'm
almost nothing i'm this little guy i couldn't solve the problems of the world therefore me
continuing to just pick up all the game theory tokens i can under a world of increasing uncertainty
the optionality of that is what's best for me and my family look at how much time you spent
figuring out how to gather all those optionality tokens understanding markets understanding
how to do lobbying understanding your industry understanding financial markets etc and look
at how much time you spent trying to say if i applied all of that same energy time thoughtfulness
resource to solving some of the great problems could i you have not put enough time to say that
you couldn't possibly it's just not in your interest this is what jeremy grantham's big
point at the end of our podcast was and i've i've talked to him about it subsequently he wants the
elites the rich people to divert their attention to the ecological crisis not only climate but
plastics and oceans and many other things because they haven't they they're unaware it's just out
there and it's a it's a big drive of his and some others and fingers crossed because that's what we
need and yet i've encountered so many more people who are conscious of what's happening to the
environment but like you just said they plan to give away some of their money in the future but for
now they're focused on their investments and they want to have a little bit more so that they can
give more to good causes in the future which i just scratch my head when i when i hear that
but you you could understand someone listening to this past hour you've just articulated that
winners write the history books and the situation is so bizarre and scary and complex right now that
if i don't have an answer i might as well just try to be a winner which means more
optionality tokens yes and i think there is a i mean that is definitely the state of a i in
development very centrally it's definitely the state of like the posturing in geopolitics
um and just financial markets it's the way of that too yeah now if you look at that path of
winning and realize it's actually self-terminating and it's not even a win for you that could be
the beginning of a pause and then if you look at that okay so you know people talk about like what
the the biggest Nobel prize you could want to win the biggest problem to solve for humanity oftentimes
like cure for cancer if you look at the graphs of incidents of different types of cancers
from 1950 till now you see a rise in heaps of cancers right lots of rise in endocrine
and reproductive cancers in different kinds of childhood cancers in very aggressive turbo
cancers and that rise in those cancers in terms of year over year rise maps very closely to the
rise of carcinogenic chemicals put into the atmosphere and so when you look at the 230 million
chemicals in the database of the american chemical society and you look at the huge number of them
that are put into the atmosphere uh an environment through the vocs and the paint and the walls and
then the carpet to the industrial chemicals to the agricultural chemicals the percentage of them
that are carcinogens is very high the other ones are neurotoxins or endocrine disruptors or whatever
so correspondingly the increased rate of autoimmunity of autism and Alzheimer's and neurodegenerative
disease of infertility and reproductive failure follow those curves quite closely is that the
only factor no is that a major factor yes the other factors are also the result of the progress
of the society in other ways like the processed foods that follow similar curves that mess up
the microbiome and micronutrient profiles of the body and stuff like that in your paper you make
a point of highlighting the Haberbosch process and and crop yields and food and that's been viewed
as progress but there's a whole lot of stuff it doesn't include yeah so i want to stay with the
cancer case for a minute when if you look at all of the scientific advancements trying to
cure cancer why don't they start with how do we get how do we stop putting carcinogens in the
atmosphere and in the food supply you know where there are continuous studies by groups like the
Institute for Environmental Medicine that show there's roughly 300 carcinogens the industrial
toxins that are carcinogenic in the breast milk of nursing mothers in the united states and whatever
why don't we work on getting those out because the vast majority of cancers we have are anthropogenic
they're caused by human activity we don't need to try to solve cancer and abstract like let's
start with that and oftentimes the right problem solving is reversing something that was already
the wrong path but i can't patent that i can't market that very well the new pharmaceutical
solution that i can patent that doesn't address the upstream causes at all might have enough ROI
to pay for the research that i need to do but if there's a thousand of these entities out there
and 990 of them take the higher the high road and why are we putting these chemicals in there
let's do it a different way it's those other 10 that decide to do it in our current institutional
corporation structure and it's just like Genghis Khan okay so this is important
if we build new types of energy but we don't create both cultural values and particularly
law that binds the use of the other energy we'll just use all the energy because more energy is
awesome more energy means more GDP means more you know all the things associated with what
interests of power so creating a new thing that is supposedly more positive in a way is
is not actually solving the problem if you're not binding the harmful thing because you will just
get both and it'll end up being market diversification and total more total market size
similarly like the organic food movement has been awesome in a lot of ways so there's a lot of people
who shop at the Whole Foods and buy organics and want there to be less pesticides and whatever
and yet more pesticides have been used every single year during that entire time so clearly
it's not actually decreasing total pesticide use because we're bringing increasing amounts of
pesticides to conventional agriculture to the developing world and the populations whatever
so it just okay it's like great we will add that organic niche market on top of the existing
market and get more total market share there has to be more of a focus of actually binding
the things that have to stop and so when you're mentioning if somebody does that thing
the interests of everyone else who want to again if there were nine if there were nine tribes
that were really wanted peace and wanted to be in peaceful arrangement and trade and whatever
with each other and they saw an early phase of another tribe moving in another direction
and they did interfere and not let it continue in that way
they could possibly have peace for everybody and that actually becomes the obligation so like I said
we have a the the system that emerged in the context of power competition selects for people
who are oriented to power competitions and other people who are complicit with it those
are the two things it selects for and is that dynamic that you just described what underpins
malak watiko kojana scotsy the super organism yes
the generative dynamic can be described a couple ways one is
humans get conditioned by their environment right I grow up in a tribal culture I grow up in a
modern technological culture I grow up in a city in the dark ages whatever I'm going to be I'm
being conditioned by the environment I'm in in terms of my language my worldview my technological
capabilities desires identities all those things so and so the civilization is conditioning the
minds which means patterns of perception identity value and behavior of the people
and those minds are in turn creating more of the types of things that they were conditioned to
and so there is a feedback loop between the individuals influencing the whole the whole
influencing the individuals and there's a particular thing that is getting up regulated
so let's talk about theory of hyperagents for a minute I think we mentioned this somewhere before
but we'll do it again quickly the gangist cons and the alexanders and the caesars were
obviously different types of people than most of the people that either worked for them or they
killed right and the you know kings following that and the and the robber barons and industrialists
and whatever they're like all have that in common up up to today of that how much power they have
consolidated relative to most everyone else is extreme and they're and it's not arbitrary there
were things about their psychology that had them pursue that and be good at it so agency our own
ability to achieve our goals and do the stuff we want to do you could say that a hyperagent
is someone whose focus is maximizing returns on agency they want to do the things that make
them capable of more doing right they want to and they they want to use their what end winning
this is a great question right towards what end is you were just mentioning it with your billionaire
friends who are like well the future has a lot of uncertainty the money gives me the ability to
live in one place or another place to build this kind of tech or that kind of tech to employ tech
or people or land it gives me the ability to influence minds through media it's a generalized
optionality tokens i'm just going to keep working to grow my total optionality tokens
so that i always have the maximum freedom and ability to do what i want to do every scenario
now one of the reasons is that one of the reasons is winning one of the reasons is their own fear
of death and wanting to be remembered in the history books forever whatever right some set of
reasons that are associated with personal expansion of power so a hyperagent maximizes kind of return
on agency it's important to state that return on capital can be return on agency but it's not
necessarily there are hyper investors who are really good at applying capital to create more
capital but are not using that to influence the world to a vision of the world they want
beyond that heavily right like Warren Buffett was not trying to change laws and politics and
culture all around the world he was a hyper investor not really a hyperagent whereas Kissinger
had much less money personally than Buffett ever did but had radically more influence on world systems
through the influence of a lot more total money of state funds and you know whatever so
hyperagency is the more fundamental concept which is kind of the return on agency there are people
who are also motivated to do that they're just not good at it and maybe they become like a
very controlling middle manager or a gangster or something but the people who are good at it are
good at scaling and that's through both the influence of a lot of people and the employment
of technology and that can be social technology like writing laws and influencing capital which
are social technologies creating narratives like the rise of Nazism or Mao or whatever right so
but they're good at being able to scale so the kind of tier one hyperagents the ones that have
the most influence in the world are not just oriented to maximize returns on agency but they're
good at it and if you look at the distribution of traits that humans have in a population
like empathy they'll usually follow a Gaussian distribution right you'll have most people are
here they have some level of empathy for some circle of people you know kind of average there
are Bodhisattvas on one side that are you know hyper empathetic and there are sociopaths on the
other side no empathy and we could also take say Machiavellianism how good someone is at like
long gaming chess and there will be most people are kind of here you have some that are really
amazing strategists and some that really suck at it and
there is a kind of a naive sociology that looks at the Gaussian distribution of human traits and
tries to explain the world by that distribution of traits and it doesn't work and it's because if
you look at the distribution of power which is what's influencing the world it doesn't have a
Gaussian distribution it has a power law distribution the power law distribution means a few people
over here have almost all the influence that's true in money it's true in the the stats of you
know the differential between the top wealthiest and the bottom poorest people continue to get
more and more extreme and the graphs that look at the power law distribution of money from 1960
to 2000 to now are amazing how much deeper that curve gets but I think it's something like the
top eight wealthiest people have more money than the bottom four billion people currently right
but does that power law also work within the top one percent there's another power law within that
top one percent where 80 percent have or 20 percent have 80 percent of the yeah that's obviously one
percent is a lot of people eight people having more wealth than four billion people is pretty
significant yeah and so this is true in terms of military power not that many people can push
nuclear buttons this is true in terms of media power this is true in terms of you know financial
power this is true in terms of technological innovation capabilities is that there's these
kind of power law distributions and so the people at the top of the power law distribution explain
the shape of civilization much more than everybody does and those people don't come from the center
of the bell curve of almost any psychological trait and in ancestral times we still had the
same Gaussian curves but we didn't have the energy surplus and the scale because power you know 10,000
years ago with 150 people or whatever and power in nature there there is only so much endosomatic
energy that an organism or a human pre modern human could use and so it's the it's the scale of
size of people and the civilization coupled with this giant dollop of historical magic dumped
in our economy a couple hundred years ago that allows the Secordian to spread upwards
they didn't have the same Gaussian distribution okay why okay so going back to this idea that
the people who are at the top of the power law distributions that have the most influence are
not at the center of the bell curve of psychological and behavioral traits they're
usually like two standard deviations to one side yep more sociopathic less empathetic
more driven and motivated towards narrow goals better at technology and propaganda and long
range strategic thinking and whatever right various things and just to interject there did
those people design our structures or did our structures self-select for those recursively both
right someone is born into structures someone who wants to be at the top of the power law
is a desire it's a particular type of desire that really really wants that and that is good at it
and can win enough win lose games to latter climb to the very top of it and can drive enough
externalities and rivalry and whatever to get there so they are the current systems are
selecting for the people that can win at the current systems but then those people in turn
change the systems in a way that continues to optimize their winning which is just like evolution
is the animal created by its environment or does it niche create to make more of an environment
that's good for it so we are both being shaped by the niche and the niche creating in turn
but the other thing is that it doesn't just mean that they're making so you know that looks like
somebody gets to a high position in finance and law in the current system and then they
change laws they do they remove Glass-Steagall they do financial deregulation they interpret
the 14th amendment as corporate personhood rights they interpret you know the the L'Oreal case or
whatever as to do fiducia responsibility for profit maximization so the people who can change the
system to continuously be better they they decide that bailouts for the banks that failed and too
big to fail in golden parachutes made sense so it's simultaneously or like someone is good at war
and then they innovate at war right so it is this recursion now the people who are in those top
positions are not only changing the system to be better for them they also are obviously invested
in that success so anyone else who would be very successfully doing something that would
mess that strategy up they have a maximum incentive to make sure don't succeed i did a frankly a few
months ago i forgot what the main topic was but i talked about dark triad and in my research it
said that around 10 percent of our modern population is is dark triad but that that is
probably an underestimate because of someone that's Machiavellian is not going to answer those
surveys in the way that would show that they're a dark triad but are you saying that 10 000 years
ago 50 000 years ago 10 percent of our population were not that combination of traits it's it's
something modern look at the story of how the spartans raised their kids
the you know the they're kind of famous stories that if when the infant came out if it looked
like it had any deformities or was small or a run kind of thing that it was killed right away
infanticide of ones it didn't look like they would be kind of maximally dominant and then
how early they were being trained in warfare and you know the the process that happened
when they were six where they had to kill adult slaves with tools and if the adult slaves killed
them great they're dead but only the ones that make it through are the ones that have this much
you know kind of vicious capability so is that conditioning the gout if you're in a spartan
society is that conditioning the Gaussian distribution of everybody of course it is yeah
if if you are in a and this is why looking at the kind of extreme outliers of the things that
we think of as human nature under different conditioning is so important is you can have
the janes who across the whole population nobody hurts bugs i met some janes when i was in india
they were just wonderful wonderful human beings yes and so it's clearly not just a
a Gaussian distribution or a genetic thing because you can have an entire culture where
everybody who gets raised there doesn't hurt bugs and then you can have the child soldiers and are
for Liberia or whatever where if you make it to adulthood you have killed people you've packed
people apart with machetes so our culture is recursively um building out the percentage
of our population that exhibit dark triad because of incentives and self-selection and
other things yes yes and no um i would say that there are not there's not the kind of data that i
would feel was meaningful to try to make really strong statistical claims but i'll say some things
about trends that i think will feel intuitively resonant to most people the um digital universe
as a native universe generationally has narcissistic conditioning pretty built in
meaning that if i'm in the the woods the woods don't rearrange themselves for me i can fall
out of a tree and get hurt i actually learned that there is this unforgiving nature you know
eric likes to call it uh of reality that i have to actually respect it and interact with it in a
you know a respectful way and it doesn't conform itself to me if i have a digital universe where
the news feed is literally conforming itself to maximally entertain and engage me and i have an
infinite amount of options and i can just all have to do is this and the whole universe changes now
i'm in this universe now i'm in this universe and it's maximized for my kind of dopamine optimization
do i have a world in which my conditioning is the whole world is supposed to conform itself
to what i'm interested in and i'm supposed to do very little and be able to get lots of reward
so so you're saying that what we assume is the good life and our own choice our own volition
is actually um manufactured demand by the the winners in in our current society
again if we go to the old people on their death bed reflecting on what was meaningful
most of what the people spent their whole life pursuing is what they wish in reflection that
they had not spent their whole time pursuing and most of the things that they called successes
and progress are not part of what is in their mind as they're dying that they wish they had
spent more time with well that begs the question how at what point in their life could they have
realized that and made different decisions and we will see times where someone decides to leave
the rat race and keeping up with the joneses where every time they get a raise they increase
their cost of living so they have to keep working more and paying someone else to raise their kids
and uh because the other person charges less than they can make and on and on and where they're like
no fuck it i'm out i'm gonna lower my cost of living and i'm gonna try to do something where
i can spend time with my kids and i can spend time in nature and i can reflect on why i exist at all
before i die and the sense of meaningfulness and fulfillment almost always goes up when people
do that as does the harm footprint they cause on the world to go down as does the intimacy
and meaning of their meaningfulness of their relationships and the quality of life of the
people they touch and and where do those people fall on the behavioral Gaussian distribution
or who knows well there so like i said the the selection criteria selects for people that
lead things that end up winning at power and other people that are willing to follow and
participate with that thing so um you know very famously in the nuremberg trials of nazis after
world war two when the nazis were being tried for the war crimes and they were all asked did you
believe that everything you were doing was good about 90 of the nazis said only at first
at first we were you know we had been in terrible poverty in the weimar republic our kids couldn't
eat and you know etc the jews had all this wealth um and you know we we believed that we were getting
supported to be able to you know do well for our people and whatever but as time went on
like no we did not feel good about putting kids in gas chambers
and we didn't feel good about seeing them starving like we felt really bad about it
like 90 of the nazis said no i did not feel good about it
and then when they were asked did you try to stop it they all said no and then they
quoted the same german phrase that translates to officers orders i didn't have a choice
and yet of course if 90 of them had all said that simultaneously which is a coordination
failure here on their part there would have been no holocaust but anyone on their own is
like if i try to defect i'll get thrown in the gas chamber too so it's best for me and my family
to just go along with it it's kind of a gruesome uh microcosm of what we face on so many levels today
yes and so the ash conformity studies and the milgram studies were so important and i think
actually uh under represent how deep those principles are right the the idea that when the
authority was telling the person in the scientific authority hey you're in a study do this thing
and we're doing electroshock therapy whatever that the person following authority would shock
the other guy to death even because of i don't have a choice the authorities telling me or in the
other one in the ash ones that if 10 people in the room were all saying this line is longer
than that line the person would defect on their own understanding to go along with that these are
very powerful insights and the smoke filled room if there's smoke coming under the door and other
people don't notice it or don't care about it i don't speak up yeah so we are social creatures
social conformity is a core driver so i if there was so imagine that you have a
that tin tribes in kind of harmony world and and for whatever reason somebody hits his head
gets traumatic brain injury that knocks his empathy out and now he's an asshole and uh
you know wants trevor warfare where it was not necessary before and figures out how to
try to make a story that it'll be in everybody's interest because the other tribes are really
plotting against us even though they aren't or whatever you could imagine a scenario where
the other people are like dude you're crazy like no we're not going to do that thing and
you need to chill out or you're going to get banished and that happened right that happened
a lot but if that guy succeeds because he scares people enough right let's say he's really big
or whatever it is or kind of brutal that nobody wants to stand up because even though if everyone
stood up together they could deal with him individually nobody wants to stand up to him
you can start to have a situation where everyone else has their survival strategy being um not
like getting the goods that guy is going to deliver he's going to deliver safety and he's
going to deliver economic growth and he's going to deliver whatever and you don't want to piss
that guy off and so you get a kind of fealty that's Stockholm syndrome with that kind of leadership
and uh and also a recognition that if you go against it it's not going to go well for you
and still won't change the scenario so then again you have this plausible deniability best for me
and my family is just go along with it that combination of distortion like profound ethical
distortion and leaders and complicity in others and the and environments that were already created
in power conditioning those psychologies and then the psychologies to get to the top of the power
stack conditioning more of systems that continue to do that the recursion on all of that is the
thing that you call that we call moloc or whatever it is the set of system dispositions that continue
to orient in a particular direction and this is why they have continued to orient in the direction
of more extraction more technological power more military capability more money more and
and it's advancement technologically is it progress in terms of good well obviously none of the species
we made extinct through doing it think so and obviously none of the animals and factory farms
think so and obviously none of the you know some odd 50 million people that are in conditions of
slavery today doing forced labor to make that system work think so no Native Americans in
North America think that the US progress story was awesome American descendants of slaves don't
think the progress story was awesome and not only that you know like even the people who are winning
so even the billionaire his body is being exposed to the carcinogens that the industries have caused
that the medicine cannot solve and
even if you look at the quality of life there it is actually with decreasing actual fulfillment
and the replacement of fulfillment with mostly addictive flashes
right reward circuits that provide kind of addictive flashes whether that's
you know food drug or new yacht or new position of market dominance
now this is actually another part that's so important
I want real progress I think it's a it's a very important thing to see that
we can grow and that we can add our life energy to the world in a meaningful way and
this is why really thinking about what would constitute actual progress that the world is
better as a result of us having done this better the world not my tiny world not better in this
metric but the world long-term thinking seven generations ahead thinking about all the other
species we inhabit with thinking about all of the different aspects of self like does my did my
cell phone enhance a lot of things yes did it diminish a lot of other things even for me yes
so what does better mean if I really kind of think and feel through that well
and so I want us to pursue real progress I want us to rescue it from the kind of bullshit progress
but also in a healthy life progress is not as important it's not as central because if life
is fulfilling now if life is a gift now I'm not exclusively focused on making it better in the future
and making it better that corresponds to winning usually uh or and I'm not even focused on changing
it as much as I am also maintaining it and appreciating it so progress gets a undo emphasis
when there is a disconnection from being where now is miserable so good has to be in the future
by me doing some new thing and if you if you think about the unlikely miracle of our existence
right and you think about the billions of years of stuff that had to happen to make a biosphere
with the complexity that we could exist and you think about the miracle that we get to see
colors and we get to hear birds and we get to exist and that we get to love children and we
get to like all the things and appreciating what already is that is so profoundly unlikely
that took billions of years to make and there's so much activity like there should be most of our
life should actually just be an odd appreciation at what is and then the desire to maintain and
protect it because it is so unlikely and so much work went into bringing this about
but nobody makes the history books for maintaining things they make the history books for making new
stuff or destroying stuff or you put the two together creative destruction which is the
creative society right now but like 99% of life should actually be maintenance 99% of life is
you feed the kids and the meal that you made then is gone and then you make another meal and you
wash the plates and then they're dirty again and the but you're actually maintaining the sacred
thing and then true progress is where I can add a new thing that really is factoring everything good
for the whole then yes I will add those things and that's progress but it has to really be good
for the whole factoring everything that's involved and most of my attention is actually needed to
maintain all that's happening so I both want to kind of like reclaim what progress is which is
important and sacred but also move it out of the center and that it's only in the center in the
same way that like when someone is more unfulfilled they have more addictive tendencies because they're
looking for a hit of something when someone is more fulfilled they have less addictive tendencies
there is a way that when someone is in appreciation of what is and they're in meaningful intimate
relationships the so much of the impulse of progress that is actually coming from emptiness
and the desire to be somebody I got that Nobel Prize I got that PhD I got that position I won
I whatever is a compensation for actual like trauma and emptiness and it's and so it's not
only that it's not authentic progress in the world it's that where it's even coming from in me is not
aligned with the fullness of the world and adding fullness it's aligned with my own emptiness and
the desire to do something that will fill that up that is not the right thing
so it's the hungry ghosts are consuming alcohol and pizzas and building shopping centers and
getting stock options and all that to fill a trauma and a loneliness
not not actually to achieve something monumental that's great for society and the future
yes but it will be sold as that
so is there any evidence that the people that are in the dark triad
or those people that are you know riding a high a top malloc and the superorganism
have a higher incidence of trauma and loneliness and and emptiness
I don't know stats on like aces right childhood trauma associated with
those positions there are certainly plenty of very traumatized poor people
and it's not like it's not like everyone responds to trauma in the same way right there the total
nuances of how trauma ends up affecting someone are
not easy to put an algorithm together to predict so someone is physically abused when
they're little and they grow up to physically abused children someone else is physically abused
when they're little and they grow up to be the most nonviolent person who doesn't ever want to be
like that maybe even to the place that as it's an overcompensation they don't stand up enough
right someone else has a the healthiest response and actually becomes a protector of children
right so it is not necessarily saying that the people who are in the highest positions of power
most traumatized but they had types of trauma that oriented themselves to both power seeking
and types of education that oriented themselves to good insights about how to do power at scale
effectively so i can tell you an n equals one uh uh experience um i was recently in india and i
spent a lot of time with uh 30 people every day chanting singing humming eating um doing sports
doing yoga etc and then i would go for bikes in the forest and record sounds of birds and
i came back and my addiction impulses were much lower yes because i had six weeks
living on more of a maintenance i'm i'm maintaining the thing i don't need other things
and i was like oh my gosh this is what we need to change the culture but the other part was when i
came back it was a week or two and i got sucked right back into the vortex of everything going on
in this culture yeah so we need both we need the personal discipline and change in a community
but we also need the infrastructure and the institutional change and and that crucible
think about this when you were in that environment with those people in india
the reward circuits that you were experiencing on a day-to-day basis were the type of pleasure the
type of reward that comes from intimate communion with other people that comes from listening to
birds that comes from people having authentic conversations that don't have status climbing
as part of them focused on meaningful and real things came from all that right and so
there's a fulfillment in that that is not oriented with how many likes a thing got or
how much we did this thing or you know whatever it those things weren't available i mean i had
internet there but there weren't all those other distractions except there were parties
with music and there were musical concerts every night of the week there those were the options
right so it but someone's not craving the other thing because the reward circuits are full
exactly someone's actually in a state of fulfillment and they're in a state of fulfillment
for things that make them healthier the relational network healthier and
the and that can align with stewarding the world well now if you go to an environment where there
you go to a different environment where there's nobody around you and there's no real intimate
connections and so again we're we're social primates this is such an important evolutionary
thing is that there wasn't a lone dude with stone tools in the serengeti making it with the lions and
the hyenas there were tribes of people that would make it and so the the idea of umbuntu i am because
we are that was this foundational concept of human beings before the thing we call civilization
right i am because we are was like just at the most prosaic level
nature did not select for individual sapiens it only selected for groups of sapiens individual
sapiens in evolutionary environments were all dead and so what's best for me that fucks the
tribe is not a concept that's not a thing right what is best for the tribe that i can't exist
without of i am because we are i would not exist i'd be dead without all of us that's like the
basic insight so i am because we are obviously just starts with i couldn't survive without us
but then it's also deeper which is i think in words that i didn't invent that all these other
people invented and but my own most intimate thing my thoughts with myself are in a language
that i didn't make i am my my thoughts were made by other people right the the the language of my
thoughts my understanding of the world was transmitted to me largely by other people
the tools that i use the things that i benefit from the all of that that i am almost all things i
think of as i am because we are right because of things that were created
okay now i have so many questions but and then it goes deeper because the we was never never
just meant our tribe it also meant nature in the extension to all our relationships and all our
relationships was all life and life didn't just mean biological which is why they were animistic
those cultures were all animistic the spirit of the sun the spirit of the river the spirit of
everything because it was a very clear understanding what would i be without the tribe i'd be dead what
would i be without the sun i i would have never existed what would i be without the galactic
center around which the sun orbits i wouldn't exist what would i be without the gravitational field
what would i be without the soil microbes what would i be without plants what would i be without
all of that i wouldn't be so i that is not the emergent property of we isn't even a thing it's
not even thinking about fast forward to today and when i'm sitting around by myself lost in my
thoughts my thoughts are in english which is a language of the winners um that i'm not even
aware of everything that came before that english was selected for in this progress a story over
the last few hundred years is that also part of the this story totally so
our umwelt are the things that are in our awareness the tiniest tiniest sliver of a fraction
of what is real in universe and so there's you know like within the progress narrative
most people don't miss the
being able to actually understand what the animals are saying in the way that indigenous
people have much more understanding what the animals are saying is they're growing up in
the environment listening to them right most people don't miss that because they never had it
and they don't even realize they don't have it and they don't realize how much more communicative
and alive the forest is to someone who knows how to listen and so they are impoverished but they
don't know it and they don't miss having a bunch of people that they can be completely authentic
with because they've never experienced that they've never been completely authentic with any human
being they are always fucking withholding and lying to some degree and always paying attention
to appearance so they don't miss a thing they don't know exists and they don't miss what it feels
like to have a body that doesn't have 300 petrochemicals in it because they have never
had a body that didn't have 300 petrochemicals in it and what real vibrancy feels like they
have no idea this has rhymes and and analogies to the movie the matrix yes and so some people take
the blue pill right because the reward circuits even once they see it and so one I have people have
a hard time imagining that there was a life that was awesome full of things that they have no experience
of or even awareness that is was a thing there's a cool documentary I think it's called everything
is rhythm that shows how in African tribes what when the way somebody was weaving and the way
someone was cutting something and the we're actually all making music and dancing together
right they were actually all in this experience of nearly continuous rhythm and whatever they
were doing and part of the communication process that was not mediated through words and semantics
like what does it feel like to be part of a culture where everything you're doing is song and dance
in coordination with everyone and that you feel this kind of rhythm with each other and the rhythm
with nature most people have no idea that's a thing and you know so many things like that so
it's hard to value things that you don't even know exist and it's hard to let go of the only hits
of pleasure you've ever had and so even though when you look at the graph of the reported
amount of suicide I mean the amount the recorded amount of suicide for teens proportional to the
number of hours per day they use their cell phone and that as the number of hours goes from a half
hour up with each hour up the rate of suicide goes up the teen doesn't want to give up their phone
they will completely fight to keep their phone and don't want to give up the pleasure hits they get
associated with the likes they get from the beauty filter on instagram that is what drives their
body dysmorphia well that right there is another microcosm of our entire gdp focused super economic
super organism culture yes advancement is not better meant and if you have if you if you go
back to Descartes so I said I'd come back to modernity at some point so there has always been this
story all that I wouldn't say always for a very long time there's been this histories written
by the winner and the winner usually says them winning was a good thing and you know Genghis Khan
united the disparate Mongol tribes and Alexander the great and Caesar you know united and expanded
their great kingdom and etc so there was always that element of progress but it was also kind of
bound with appreciation of certain types of tradition associated with religion and whatever
so see with modernity and kind of mostly getting like a decreasing the role of religion and the
then kind of rapid increase in scientific and technological progress the progress part became
almost the entire story and the idea of progress through these new institutions science technology
industry market democracy etc became like the dominant narrative and if you go to Descartes
and the separation of the objective world that you can measure we can all measure we can get
repeatable measurements and we can apply science the philosophy and the methodology of science
and that's the domain of is right but that science can't say anything about the domain of
ought because i can't measure ought right i can't measure we can't all independently
measure is that beautiful is that good i can independently measure how fast it is or how
heavy it is or you know how much kinetic energy it has or whatever so where does the ought come in
so you know Descartes like well that's the domain of religion and it can deal with that stuff
but science can't and so science is only going to deal with the is well but the is
is focused on
being able to reduce a domain of reality to a model
that emphasizes mechanisms that both allows me to predict things and then create the applied
side of science which is technology that can control things and so it's learn how leverage
works to be able to apply levers to build megalithic construction right it's learn how genetics work
to be able to do genetic engineering it's learn how chemistry and thermodynamics and mechanics
work to make internal combustion engines but if the applied side of is of science is engineering
what is a good technology well no no no we can't do anything with that right me so which thing gets
built is well where did the money for the research come from somebody that has money that is seeking
ROI on that money and so you don't really get science you get the R&D arm of the market
because the research money is going to be pursuing something that generally has some goal
that's associated with it and so the profitable extractive you know whatever thing and you know
because science can't say what ought with its methods because of that division of the subject
of universe and the object of universe which not all philosophies had even the Greeks didn't
divide those right and as far as westerns and definitely the Vedic system and the Taoist system
and indigenous systems didn't divide subject and object and make object that is measurable
repeatedly real with some methods and the other either not real or you know whatever so
because when you're just focused on the objects there is no meaning and and I can't measure
those things right I can try to measure a neural correlate when someone says they're in an experience
of intimacy but that's not the experience of intimacy so when von Neumann wrote economics
and game theory it's important that it was those two things in the book von Neumann and
Morgenstern right it was game theory the formalization of the mathematics of how to win at
win-lose strategy games under uncertainty and the theory of the market which was you know
application of that same principle so what is a good choice science can't answer but game
theory ended up becoming the best closest thing to what science a scientifically congruent thing
could say is the best answer or a good choice is the choice that doesn't lose
and so under uncertainty assume the other guy has more malicious intent more military and
prepared to not lose under that scenario and you know on and on and so that definition of
which has nothing to do with good right it just has to do with not a particular kind of bad to me
you know under that uncertainty
so if you can study the world down to the level of mechanism where you can then engineer to the
degree that you can land a rover on mars and you can split the nucleus of an atom and you can make
ai's that can beat humans at war games and you can scale up industrial technology to planetary
scales and and extinct species at scale and make new species with genetic engineering
that level of technological power in the domain of is applied is not bound by what is actually good
in some deeper understanding where the only good is that which wins game theoretically
that choice making system on that level of tech will self-terminate
in the same way the cancer does
in the same way so many earlier civilizations did
and so the fact that we have such a powerful system of the study of is that can lead to
all that technology we do have implicit within us the ability to have a comparably abstract and
deep and profound system of ethics or wisdom about the nature of art
to bind that other thing i know you've had Ian McGillcrest on in the framework of the master
in the emissary that the goal achieving has to be bound by picking good goals
and it is not the analytical break all the parts into pieces come up with the metric part that can
figure out good goals it's the field of i am because we are so is this a good goal for the
totality of we in my perspective seeking and feeling and then being engaged with the reality
for everybody are they all at the table such that it could be so if we get incredibly powerful at
goal achieving with shitty goals very narrow goals that are beneficial in the increasingly
narrow metrics with increasing harm externalization as we're passing thresholds of harm
externalization capacity for the planet that thing terminates so to steward that much goal
achieving power we must meet it with what are good goals what is actually progress what is
worth maintaining what is worth for sure protecting and maintaining what do what should be reversed
that already harmed things where the actual progress would come from reversing some of the
stuff not just making more new stuff so what if we had the ability to take a hundred or a thousand
billionaires but not just billionaires but the the social power equivalent modern day of Kissinger
as you said earlier and like in clockwork orange like force their eyes open and watch this entire
episode what what would such a group of people and beyond be able to do from the moment we are
in 2024 and you know the the metacrisis at its current state what could we do to step more towards
authentic progress and the maintenance of just the good things that make our planet and our
civilization viable and and get rid of the the bad goals so there's this quote from
general Smedley Butler and he called war as a racket it's very famous i'll read just the
beginning it's long and people can go check it out and you know i'm assuming people know what
a racket is a racket is like a classic example is a protection racket where a gang will come
rough up a store so the store thinks that they need protection and the police aren't protecting
them and then other members of that same gang come offer them security services for sale
and so they are protecting them from themselves for a fee so they are basically manufacturing
the demand and then offering the supply the amount if you if you look at
how much of our modern market and market government system meets the criteria of creating a problem
that's a result of some part of market or technology that some other part of market
and technology will come to solve that will then simultaneously create new problems the
whole thing being a racket is actually a very important insight but with that definition of
a racket what he says here is war is a racket it always has been it is possibly the oldest easily
the most profitable surely the most vicious it is the only one international in scope that's not
true anymore he wrote this in like 1881 um oh no 19 something um it's the only one which
in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses are in lives racket is best described
i believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people only a small inside
group knows what it's really about it's conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of
the very many out of war a few people always make huge fortunes i mean again another microcosm of
our situation but now i'm seeing war in light of this conversation as as a progress narrative
erasing parts of history and and writing a narrative for for the masses that feels good
sounds about right but is really divorced from what could be possible given our history now
people will say that i'm romanticizing indigenous life and don't i know that there was infanticide
and blah blah blah i'm not romanticizing it i'm saying that the hobzian story is the villainization
of it and that's definitely self-interested propaganda that justifies evil and that um
there was obviously a humongous range of the way tribal people lived over 200 000 years in
different environments with different groups of people oh this was the unsubstantiated thing
i was going to say earlier now it comes back it so we were saying that there was this kind of
symmetry of power that happens through natural selection that of you know where the increase
in power happens with this evenly distributed mutation with co-selection but that when we
start developing technologies that increase our let's say coordinated predative capability faster
than the rest of the environment it can also be increasing its resilience to it then we can
over hunt an environment and rather than have our population shrink either start farming the
environment or move on to the next population move on to the next environment and start over hunting
it so there is some indication though it does seem like the the jury's still a little bit out on
some of this that the extinction of a lot of the megafauna and the earlier hominids was the result
of sapiens success at this strategy meaning it was uh extinctionary including to the other kinds of
humans we could be inhabiting the world with early on it so the hypothesis i have is that
the early indigenous wisdom traditions were learning from some of those mistakes
and there are certainly indigenous stories that indicate this that when some of them have stories
that when they saw the destruction that they were able to cause with their stone tools they
realized that they had to bind them with wisdom and that the kind of wisdom traditions emerge to
take more careful responsibility and that there may have been something like
one phase of a unrenewability and then lesson that led to a more kind of sustainable phase
um so that's the thing i'm saying is i can't substantiate across the board but sounds probably
at least part of the truth you increasingly talk about indigenous cultures indigenous wisdom
and you bring up examples that i've never heard of how do you learn all this
uh there are
obviously some books and papers studying this and there are increasingly
indigenous people who are becoming scholars who are also but who speak their native languages
and are translating it um but i've also just pursued making friends with people of that type
particularly the ones who are have studied their own histories and kind of understand modern
anthropology evolutionary theory sociology and can kind of explain the um parallax on those ideas
and this is an area i would i actually really want to invest a lot more time and attention
because the thing that we call civilization has been around for a very short period of time
the thing we call industrial civilization an even shorter period of time the
it's the thing we call civilization is fair to call the domestication the beginning of human
domestication where the other thing was more sapiens in the evolutionary environment right
we call it wild now it was not but they wouldn't have called it wild and the domestication of
humans at scale and the domestication of livestock went together and this is actually really
fascinating right which is the and we've talked about this before that the emergence of
the plow and kind of ox drawn or you know um donkey or horse drawn plow creating grain and
surplus you could call the beginning of the Anthropocene uh where if i'm hunting and gathering
i don't want to change the ecosystem i want to partake in the abundance of the ecosystem right
maybe within the trees a little bit um but even if i am digging with a digging stick like an
early horticulture i can't do vast spaces so i don't need to clear cut land to allocate it to
agriculture once i get and grains aren't useful in small amounts but once i can have
an ox draw the plow and i can do these vast kind of row crops now i can get enough grains and i
can store them better than i could store other stuff that i can get this kind of vast surplus
so we can see why the the ox drawn plow was a massive advancement in the ability for surplus
which meant that you could grow a much larger population it meant that you could
send that surplus along war routes so that you could support much larger wars it meant that you
could with that large population have more specialization and division of labor so you could
advance the total tech stack you know means all of those things but with the emergence of the plow
was also the end of animism because in the hunter gatherer life sometimes the animal kills me sometimes
i kill the animal just like in the predator prey kind of relationships i can pray to the spirit
of the buffalo i can apologize for needing to take its body i can say when my body dies and
goes into the earth and becomes the grass that its ancestors will eat that we are part of this
great cycle of life and we breathe our spirit into each other but i can't domesticate that
buffalo into an ox and yoke it and beat it all day long and still talk about the great spirit
of the buffalo and so then we move to man's dominion over kind of models religions that the
animals god put us here to rule over they're all here for us dominion etc and the domestication
of the animals where their well-being didn't matter they were here for us also core corresponded
to the beginning of slavery so that's all those things you just mentioned are a story that the
winners are telling totally and it's why the indigenous narratives of the early civilization
are very different and it's that the agricultural revolution was not an awesome thing but if the
population that does that thing will become a larger population with more specialization
division of labor and then it will win in war against the cultures who don't so one of the
insights is that when a new technology emerges there's two insights here that are important
first is technology is not values neutral we've talked about this it actually changes human
values because in using it like if i go walking around in a forest with a camera what i perceive
changes because of holding the camera i'm looking at different things if i go walking around with
a gun my perception of the forest changes if i go walking around with an axe my perception of the
forest changes the affordance of that tool attenuates my attention to the things that that tool can do
something with and so the process of even engaging with the tool attenuates attention right changes
the nature of attention and then it also makes a different behavioral pattern beating an ox all day
long is very different than hunting it's a so i'm going to have agrarian mythos rather than
hunter or gather mythos i'm going to be dreaming and thinking and feeling in those types of ways
i'm going to be conditioning my nervous system based on the movement patterns that my body's
going through in those ways i'm going to have radically less complex total movement patterns
than i had in the other environment which leads to less complex and dynamic thought and
phenomenological patterns and on and on so and then of course i can't believe that the animal
is animistic and as soon as i do the dominion model then and they were here for us then the
women are here for the men and the lower classes are here for the upper classes and the slaves are
here for the slave owners and the and the what was a forest that we had the clear cut to turn it
into ag land is all fine and so that model starts to develop so the first thing is the technology
is not values neutral it will code our attention and change our behaviors and as a result change
our psyches and societies and heaps of ways so the externalities of tech are not only physical
they're psychosocial the next thing is that if that thing confers advantage game
theoretic advantage it becomes obligate because the people who don't use it will just simply lose
in power competitions even if what wins at power sucks for all kinds of metrics of what is beautiful
and good and so the technology is both mind altering value altering attention altering
culture altering behavior altering and obligate and this is why the Sabbath was about controlling
the use of technology and controlling productivity this is why wisdom around when a new technology
came out do we build this or not and if so how do we use it how do we change those patterns
we consider it is necessary and if you do not have that then everyone becomes the result of
dominant culture dominant technology because it has to the whoever is best at running the system
of technological power and that was cavalrymen at the time of Genghis Khan and it was industrial
tech at the time of Rockefeller and it was computer tech at the time of Gates and it was
the people who it is now at the time of AI and etc whoever is best at the power associated with
the tech stack will also then determine the narratives and they will be narratives that
support that power stack as good so I know you and your organization are working on some pretty
important projects yet you spent the time these last few months to write this paper on immature
versus authentic progress presumably because you think it's critical that people understand this
and think about it and presumably because you see some sort of a maybe thin but narrow but
a path forward where we can head towards a more authentic progress for our fellow
humans alive on the planet today and in the future can you outline that or are there still
foundational pieces yeah so
there are many famous authors who have contributed to the progress narrative and of why
antibiotics and vaccines got rid of pandemics and plagues you know etc and why
the Haber-Bosch and the Green Revolution led to being able to feed so many more people and why
you know on and on all the good things and why it's getting why the world's getting better and better
and there's not no truth to this
but it is definitely cherry-picked it is definitely what is better for those who were
not genocided or extincted or killed in war or are still in the positions of poverty that the same
system that is offering those things to some is creating for others right it's definitely cherry
picked in terms of who it's looking at progress for and it's definitely cherry picked in terms of what
value metrics it's considering and which value metrics it's not considering
it's definitely also framed that the types of value that were destroyed are not even mentioned
or talked about the types of value that are not really real value they're basically like
racket type value or overemphasized a lot of the comparisons are decontextualized there will be
things like in 1815 the average American only you know had a dollar fifty a day and now inflation
and just did they have ten times that or you know whatever it is like yeah but they grew their food
in a way that didn't take dollars and they made their own house and like the idea that
dollars were mediating their life was gibberish that's not true so you're decontextualizing
the fact of dollar as how their life was mediated which it is now to then is not true right so
there's a place where that is we wrote another paper called how to mislead with facts and it's
cherry pick the facts decontextualize the facts and then kind of lake off frame the facts and you
can make specious conclusions from true facts right so that's that story and so I'm not saying
that there are no truths in it but like okay if the if you take the best examples that there have
been like the the progress stories darlings you know hoverbosh is obviously one of them
which is the creation of synthetic nitrogen and then you know beyond that synthetic fertilizer
which is now you know NPK which did make a lot of unarable soil arable and did allow us to be
able to grow a lot more total crop through you know industrial agriculture and that did play a
major role in the population going from half a billion to eight billion in 200 years which is a
16x in population and as you state the in the industrialized world the resource consumption
per capita was not just the food but all of the energy for the entire system the energy the tractors
are using in the lights whatever and that's something like hundred x during that same time
and that hundred xing per capita and 16xing the capita in a very very short period of time from
what was already kind of a steady state post agrarian revolution right which was had brought
the numbers to way higher than they were in the kind of hunter gather time
is all using resources from the earth faster than they can regenerate and turning them into
trash and pollution faster than they can be processed even calling it resources right this
is when you're talking about language the idea that an a whale is a natural resource as opposed
to a sentient being with its own life is not that different than the idea that a person as a slave is
a natural resource rather than a sentient being the idea that a 3000 year old redwood tree is a
natural resource because I can make timber out of it and we you know in business we talk about
human resources which is not beings that are whose moms had hopes for them and who are going and
who have children and who are going to have deathbed reflections they are resources that we
want to employ in a way where we get more out of them than we put into them
fuck right like it is such a it's such a psychopathological worldview and the instrument
instrumentalizing of everything in that kind of way so nature is not natural resources nature
is nature nature is all the beings that were here for all this time before we were here
and that our life doesn't exist without I am because we are right um so you look at the
Haber Bosch and you say okay was that exclusively good that thing where that population grew and
the resource consumption grew but there's a curve that looks at human population and
species extinction and shows how closely those are correlated and the dead zones in the ocean are
the result of the agricultural affluent from the Haber Bosch right and like it's a three-quarter
water planet and we have 500 dead zones that are the result of that mechanism and a lot of the health
issues that people have are because we're not putting everything that came out of the soil
back into the soil we're taking everything out and putting three minerals back in right a very
tiny subset so you get micronutrient deficiency so you look at that darling and you're like this was
not exclusively comprehensively good so we're just fixing the prices uh on environmental
externalities energy and other non-renewable inputs get us much of the way towards uh real progress
kind of sort of
because all those negative things that you just said none of those are in our price system at all
right indulge me quickly on the this one other example I wanted to give of a darling of the
progress story which is like the one that is so easy to sympathize with of who wants to do
dentistry in the time before novocaine like fuck that that seems dreadful torturous
okay now I can't say that I know for sure how dentistry in the time before novocaine
but in the indigenous world specifically so this is important a lot of the dreadful world
before the progress narrative was the already civilization system right people living in
cities during the dark ages and whatever where we saw the great plagues do you have huge plagues
that are zoonotic when you don't have animal husbandry where you have you know close proximity
with all of the rats and the cats and the all of those types of things with the grain stores and
the animals that are there inside of large population density urban centers no right yeah
it's a very different situation and so so many of those problems like a high population density
city high population per capita shitty hygiene and animal husbandry you know in the environment
yes that's a pandemic breeder and but the answer could have been to change the city design right
not just you know vaccines and you know antibiotics etc I actually think we might
under attribute how much just plumbing and hygiene went to the benefits that occurred there
but so if you look at the so much of what we think about how barbarous dentistry and medicine
whatever were was also again in the post the the post Caesar Genghis Khan you know etc era the
post civilization era you go back to indigenous world and western prices work and I know there
are questions on replication and whatever on western prices work but western prices work when you
involved in founding the American Dental Association he was looking at the last hunter
gatherer tribes around can turn of last century that had not adopted grain into their diet not
gotten into agriculture because it's not grain and hunter gatherer and he found that they had no
cavities and they didn't have a problem was with wisdom teeth and they didn't have major
occlusion issues they had these amazing teeth right this was a huge thing that he documented
and he's like we didn't just evolve wrong we have wisdom teeth issues we're eating a diet that
demineralizes our bones so that we don't actually have the bone density to be able to get that last
part so we have wisdom teeth that's also the occlusion issues and it's also the cavities
these people didn't have toothpaste or toothbrush but they also didn't have cavities then watched
when western diet was introduced specifically heavy grain diet and they all started getting
cavities and having occlusion issues so again from the racket perspective
do i like novocaine if i have to get my mouth drilled on yes
is it entirely possible that a huge amount of the dental issues were already the result of
having solved problems in shitty ways that caused externalities to our orthodonture into
our dentistry itself where then now you need that thing and the right answer would have been a
comprehensively different tech stack right that didn't have most of human diet come from something
that we didn't evolve to eat do we even as a culture as a species have the ability to measure
and govern such complexity like obviously once western price and other people like him figured
that out was there a vector to change what was happening or was it the the racket and the one
person in 10 that had the dark triad traits just swamped everything else the direction of
more new technology keeps increasing novel complicating effects that are very hard to
monitor but like let's say we're let's say we're talking about humans in a state of nature right
vast majority of human civilization do we understand how the whole world works
no do we understand everything about hydrology and how all the convection patterns work and how
all the funguses and bacteria and kingdoms and everything work no of course not but does it
work yes and did it take billions of years of radically complex evolution doing distributed
information processing to make that whole thing work and it's still doing all that yes okay so
things that I do that are going to change that whole system in a way that doesn't have any
evolutionary precedence I should kind of go slow on I should kind of like really think through and
do some tests and really look at all of the effects now if so can let's talk about the complexity for
a minute let's say we discuss the movement from what we call currently conventional
which is kind of this weird industrial agriculture method where you turn natural ecosystems into
basically desertified soil that you spray NPK on you put highly hybridized row crops in that are
designed for combines and then you cover them in pesticides herbicides and fungicides that
are designed to kill the most robust creatures and then humans are both getting trace mineral
deficiency super weird genetics of the plants dead microbiome of the soil that modulates the
genetics of it and covered in pesticides and herbicides so then we have all these diseases
so you see disease on the rise but then the answer is pharmaceuticals and they're regulated by the
same industry food and drug and the NIH puts money into drug studies and stuff but not into
dietary studies which is why the food pyramid is created by the American Dairy Council and
American grain council and you know so so you look there's a racket right of course it's a
fucking racket and whether it was designed or emerged through shared system incentives is actually
mostly irrelevant to the point of course it's some of both and but if you say okay
how does soil work in a natural system everything that comes out of it goes back into it
there's a loop closure right so the tree when it dies decomposes into the soil the leaves when
they fall decompose into the soil the animals that are eating the things their poop goes into
the soil and their bodies go into the soil every everything that comes out goes back in and it's
actually all made of the same atoms right the same distribution of atoms basically like six
elements that make up most everything in the distribution of trace elements if I take stuff
out of the soil that involves all of the living compounds and the complex chemistry the humic
and folvic acids and the and the amino acids being produced in the etc and all the trace minerals
and I put back in three minerals that are enough to make something that looks like a plant
but has totally lower amounts of macronutrients and different phytochemicals and etc like it's
kind of can I predict exactly every single biochemical change no can I tell that's probably
going to have problems yes that's pretty easy to tell do I want to not spray things designed
to be poisonous to cockroaches that could make it through nuclear war and designed to be poisonous
to exoskeleton creatures do I want to not spray poisons like that on the food that we eat yeah
that like that seems pretty reasonable and um do we do we not want to grow food in a way that
is killing the top soil that we depend upon but they should be regenerating it so you start to
look at what are the principles all the stuff that comes out has to go back in there's going to be a
balance of things that fix nitrogen in the soil and use nitrogen the principle set to do it well
is amazingly simple and what is that this is I'm this is what I'm giving an example like in this
case of agriculture like how do you do agriculture properly put it put back in the soil all the things
that come out of it make sure that the things that are in the soil have a distribution of the
different types of things that are kind of like you find in a natural system natural system has
legumes fixing nitrogen and non legumes pulling it out and then it has plants that naturally
repel excessive amounts of insects of the insects that those come to there you can see those patterns
in nature so can we build off of that you know the kind of permaculture approach that just maps
some of what nature's doing and can we tell that if the trace minerals that are in the plants or in
the animals that eat the plants that we evolved with go back into the soil and back into the plants
that we're eating I can't predict exactly what percentage that will lower ms over what time
period relative to all the other multi factors but can I versus rheumatoid arthritis versus autism
but can I guess that as we get the trace minerals back in as we get the quality of the soil up as
we get the pesticides out following the way the curves of the diseases and the curves of those
things happen together that in general the health of the soil the health of the plants health of the
ecosystem and the health of the people are all going to go up together yes and I don't need to try
to optimize every I don't need to understand every bit of how the soil my microbiology does
everything it does I have to just pay attention to what it needed to do that evolutionarily
and continue to support that I but this is that thing again we have to appreciate the thing that
is already here with its evolutionary complexity and seek to maintain it and make sure that what
I'm adding to it is not debasing that which it depends upon. So in your paper you outlined
three strategies to move towards authentic progress and I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you to list those
in a second but first I want to read a quote from your paper okay progress worth believing in
progress that is really about increasing betterment increasing the goodness in the world must still be
able to be considered good once it is taken account of all perspective and externalities
so for such here's my question for such a metric to occur doesn't there first need
to be a culture wide change in our values otherwise why would such a thing come about
there's another paper that we wrote on perverse asymmetries and the perverse asymmetries are
kind of this like entropic gradient which is if I cut the tree down or I kill the whale or whatever
I didn't kill all whales I didn't cut down all trees there are still forests I can access
uh I can still breathe the air so I'm not experiencing that I'm causing the problem at scale
and in fact I'm not causing the problem at scale I'm causing some tiny little
paper cut towards it and everybody else is doing that but the advantage of the tree to my
family as timber and selling it on the market is is profound and obvious so there is this asymmetry
between how significant the upside is to me versus how what a tiny part I am of the downside
but then the system dynamics of everybody doing that absolutely ensures the downside and ensures
it to be something that will end up affecting everyone um so there's a lot of perverse asymmetries
like that like those who pay more attention to the risks of a technology up front won't win the
technological race and first mover advantage is those who pretend that it isn't there or cover it
up and make narratives about how positive it is and scale it rapidly ultimately we have to
overcome all of those perverse asymmetries because we are powerful enough that we are not small
relative to the ecosystem anymore you know or small relative to our own survival our own species
capacity and so this is a with that much growth of like no other species could
destroy the ecosystems that they depend upon so they did not have to ensure that they didn't
um because we can we have to ensure that we don't right and this is the whole that the same recursive
abstraction that leads to the ability for technological progress and war strategy and business
strategy that that same recursive abstraction can lead to the vow of the bodhisattva and the
recognition the conscious recognition when men are not the web of life we are merely a strand
in it whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves and extending our compassion to all sentient
beings in the universe we can expand our capacity for wisdom as much as we expanded for intelligence
we can expand the scope of our considerations of what a good goal is as much as we expand our goal
achieving what i'm saying is we must now you are asking is there a cultural thing that has to happen
yes obviously our culture as we already said is being shaped by our tools and by our social systems
so our our superstructure our culture our value systems our social structures our economies and
governance systems and institutions and our infrastructure our tool set are all co-influencing
each other all three of them are co-influencing each other so obviously we can't as you as you saw
when you're in india you change your environment and something that no amount of moralizing yourself
to do whatever work was automatic in a different environment and so can we achieve cultural change
by just moralizing people that they should culturally change while they're still in the
environment that is predisposing the culture that is here no that's not going to work that well
at the same time where is the intervention point is some people who already recognize that that's
not a culture they value enough they recognize the fail of it they meditate on meaningful enough
that they actually stop willing to be complicit with it and not just to remove themselves which
is a step which some people do but to say how do i dedicate my life energy to changing those dynamics
which should then entail a study of change efforts that were well motivated and failed
and or made worse problems so as to not repeat that to try to understand
why that happens to understand what change that would change all that could actually
would require and what it would be like now of course to really change culture at scale
we have to change the technology and what it predisposes right we have to change the social
systems as long as you have an economic system where putting the externalities are externalized
and cost then i can't empathize and take want to take responsibility for all the harm that i'm
causing if i'm competing against someone who's not internalizing those costs like economically
you can't you're economically incentivizing sociopathy through the cost externality so of
course that has to change and of course is that changes that makes possible a different value set
and the same way that like the algorithm on facebook could up regulate for different things
it could up regulate for exposing people to different worldviews and different ideas and
paying attention to only up regulating the ideas that drive common unity rather than you know division
so those are places where culture is affected by technology and social system
but how does it start it has to start with a culture first recognition of the i am because
we are the version of progress that is good for i that is not for we is actually not real progress
i remove myself from that thing i won't participate in the lie of it and i will dedicate
myself to wanting to understand what is what actually be good for the whole and make sure
my life energy is in service to that and then progressively that i am participating in things
that have more agency to be able to affect them so it starts with a change of values and
consciousness with some people and that expands upwards and ultimately i think
you're inferring that we need a modern day equivalent of a Sabbath superimposed on to
the superorganism structure that is leading us into a terminal phase i want to speak to
imposed people with a libertarian bent will be naturally concerned by some of what is being
said and i want to speak to them okay that was my word i could have used emerge or something
but go on but we did talk about restraint and then we talked about if someone wants to do
the thing that is more like a cancer cell or more like cause tribal warfare
they're not going to be the ones to restrain themselves from doing it other people will
have to that is something like law right that is something like imposition and so then we are right
to consider how those systems have went in the past and because using force to curtail someone's
liberty has its own problems even if what they're wanting to do with their liberty has problems
and that's already in in the zeitgeist right now a lot of people are worried that climate change
is such a thing that will cause people to eat bugs and not own anything and all kinds of authoritarian
rules yeah and i think if the people who were talking about the eating bugs or the solution
and not owning anything were themselves not major capital owners who were not applying those things
to themselves people might feel a little better about it but um like the dude that is a hunter
gatherer and he eats a lot of crickets and grubs and if he says like bugs are good like nobody's
freaked out about that they're freaked out about um it's a situation of radical wealth and equality
and class warfare and the class warfare telling more stories of justifying radical inequality as
the you know as the solution while they have the largest carbon footprints themselves um so like
understandable right um so the thing that i want to say is the
you introduced me to her um Vanessa andriotti who you had on the show who uh i had a conversation
with and just thought she was amazing and um really respect in her book she said that her
the chief of her tribe the his definition of colonialism she probably said that on your show
but i'll bring it up is that colonialism was not about taking other people's land fundamentally
or about abuse of land or abuse of people or anything that those were epiphenomenon that the
core of it was believing there are separable things and you can say even deeper than that is
being conditioned to perceive the world as a bunch of separable things which is what boom said was
the underlying cause of all the problems which is what christian marty said was the cause of
all the problems which is what einstein said so if i believe there's a bunch of separable things
and i'm separate from other things and i can optimize some things at the expense of other things
and then i can actually rationalize that everything is trade-offs and that's how it is
and etc and you know then reify social Darwinism and nonsense like that so the root one could say
the root of the issues is if people
want things that inevitably cause harm to others that's the root of the problems
either because they know it causes harm and they want it anyway so it's some kind of you know
rivalry or sociopathy or something like that or because they don't know it causes harm and it's
from you know ignorance and externality they just want what they want and they're not thinking about
what all the cause and effect would be because if you then say great let's let the let's let people
pursue what they want and what they pursue getting causes harm and then also creates propagating
patterns where to protect themselves against the harm the other people have to do similar
competitive things and blah blah blah and you have a world defined by arms races
but if the other answer is don't let the people pursue what they want use some kind of enlightened
law that says that's bad and prevented by force the oppression is inherently also bad and the
asymmetry of force tends to lead to an increasing corruption of the power stack and so neither
of those are good so as long as humans believe that they are separate from everything else as
long as they perceive the world separately you were mentioning language earlier and I think
similarly Vanessa was telling you that English has like 70% of the words are nouns in most
indigenous languages a very small percentage of the words are nouns you look at whitehead as
one of the kind of great philosophers of 20th century and the reason he came to process philosophies
is like there's no things like the things that we think of as things are processes of interaction
of other things right a tree is not a static noun it's the doing trillions of metabolic functions
every second it's interacting biophysically with the sun and the air it's interacting biochemically
it's interacting biologically doing gene transfer with the fungus on its roots and the soil microbes
like the tree is in a live process it's a verb it's a lots of verbs and the idea that it's a
noun just makes us think very poorly makes us very bad thinkers and the fact that we're thinking
in nouns all the time and built into our language is making us bad thinkers at scale that we don't
even realize because we don't know what it's like to have a language that doesn't see the world as a
bunch of nouns that are all separate so changing how a lot more humans perceive their relationship
to others to nature to the whole is kind of a necessary prerequisite for authentic progress
yes because if I
I was just giving this example to someone I'm a little kid who's at the phase when they say
what is that what is that what is that right and they're trying to understand they're trying to
like learn what all of the things are the anatomy of universe and that phase usually happens right
before the phase where they say why why why why why because they're they're trying to learn the
the mechanics the the dynamics of universe the kid says what is that and they point to a thing we
call a tree I don't say that's a tree or more specifically that's a spruce tree or whatever
because that's going to teach the kid a bunch of things it's going to teach them to just
accept a default worldview and not think for themselves it's going to have them confuse
the ground reality with a symbol it's going to have them think in generalizations of now
understand what are trees and what are not trees generalize all of them and stop perceiving
uniqueness it's going to have them you know like it does all that stuff to them right
so the kid says what is that and I'm like let's go closer and we go closer and I'm like touch it
and touch the leaves and then touch the flowers and touch the bark and you know touch all these
parts and like what does it feel like and then smell it and then notice the other little animals
in it and um and then you know just have them engage in that way and then say do you think the
tree stops there do you think what about this moss that's growing on it is that part of it or is
that not part of it what about the uh the soil is that part of it or not part of it and
and then I'm like what do you think it is to that squirrel what do you think it is to that little
bug what do you think it it is to itself and you know what do you what do you feel when you're with
it and eventually we'll come to in English we call this a tree in Spanish they call it arbolé
and in this language they call it this and they do different kinds of things but this particular one
notice that if we go look at this one they're different and in fact this one there's not
another one in the entire universe quite like it and it's not even the same as it was yesterday
it'll be different today so the only way to know it is to be with it fully more presently in this
moment and you know so imagine if kids grew up that way rather than that's a tree memorize its
name understand the botany associated with it blah blah blah like then they're using much more of
their whole self to understand reality in a much more full rich way that understands that that same
thing is different from every different perspective in so many different contexts and um and so
if someone is perceiving if they are supported to perceive the uniqueness of everything and the
interconnectivity of everything that nothing is fungible and nothing is separable nothing can be
standardized without actually causing harm and nothing can be optimized at the expense of others
without causing harm and they get that uniqueness interconnectivity of everything and they get I
am because we are for a we that extends to the stars and then what they want that comes from that
first hungry ghost desire is not the main thing that emerges this like awe and fulfillment and
fascination and gratitude and it emerges from that connection and it's actually the lack of that
connection that leads to the hungry ghost place that needs more and more hits in progress so the
first thing is just not that much desire emerges in the same the same way and then the desires
that do emerge are in connection with everything else that I'm connected with like is it it will
it be good for the tree is it bad for the tree what about the squirrels in the tree I just spent
time communing with them I love them I wouldn't want it wouldn't be good for me if it hurt those
squirrels now the desires that arise for people who are in connectivity with their interconnect
who are clear on their interconnectivity with everything those desires can be pursued in a
way that doesn't harm anything because their own identity is not separate from everything because
their perception is clear what percent of humans alive today would have to have such a value and
consciousness change to effectively change the superstructure social structure infrastructure
going forward I don't want to critique
too harshly
but if you look at what we said that since the climate movement started
all of the work that has happened has not actually empirically decreased the fact that fossil
fuel use goes up every year and emissions go up every year yeah and the environmental movement
has not changed the fact that more tons of pesticides are used each year than the year before
and that species extinction continues even the not market seeking best motive
there's clearly something off with how we're doing stuff right like clearly we don't just need more
of that thing that not only is not effective but then makes nuclear and dams and other things that
don't get off fossil fuels and cause other problems so there's the mind that was conditioned
by this kind of system can't avoid making more of this kind of system
it is part of an autopoetic process and there is a need to extract oneself from it and then actually
D program then the nature of that kind of mind that started by a language of nouns and perceiving
everything as separable and separate and then in rivalry and from a place where I think my
fulfillment comes from status and getting things and just all the nonsense right to where there is
a mind that and a being whose motive is not what's in it for me who actually feels a fulfillment
that they get to exist at all who feels an awe that they have already got to see sunsets in color
feels a fullness in that whose motive is actually in service of future beings that they get to keep
experiencing it and their desire to protect and maintain and serve life and that can perceive
the interconnectivity of things enough to not over focus on one part in a way where the solution
to that part will externalize harm elsewhere without realizing it so if one wants to really
not participate in causing more harm and maybe really change something one does have to look at
how this system has actually conditioned their own mind and how they understand what problems are
and what solutions are and how to figure those things out and how to measure them and how to
scale them and how to all like that and come to say like how does nature work and how do I understand
how nature works that's that I can work in a way that is aligned with that and
yeah there's there's profound deconditioning and re and new learning that has to happen.
It feels right to me because I've experienced it and I notice it in you since I first
met you even just the change in your language and and some of your ideas. I have
12 questions that I had prepared after reading your paper and we're already three hours in
so I think we're gonna have to do a part one and part two but but let me ask you this
and then get your your input on how you'd like to proceed. Here's another quote from your your
paper. Philosopher and psychologist Eric Fromm wrote that optimism is an alienated form of faith,
pessimism an alienated form of despair. If one truly responds to man in his future in effect
concernedly and responsibly one can respond only by faith or by despair. Rational faith as well as
rational despair are based on the most thorough critical knowledge of all the factors that are
relevant for the survival of man. So with that quote Daniel what what are your goals and the
organization that you work with with publishing papers such as this one on immature versus
authentic progress. What are you hoping to influence and achieve and lastly how can our viewers
help in in those goals? Yes this is another open loop. We were talking about
about kind of how the progress narrative really accelerated post-modernity that if one has that
story that things are getting better and better because of tech which also includes having written
the history as and alternate realities as you know worse than they were. And someone doesn't
think about all the externalities they think about the Haber-Bosch without thinking about the dead
zones and the ocean and the extinct species and the you know everything else. The default assumption
is that when new tech emerges it'll cause some problems until we figure out how to use it then
we'll rightly regulate it and net net it'll be good right that's kind of the default assumption
and so then that default assumption when we look at technologies that have radically more powerful
than anything power than anything we've ever touched that scale faster that have more complexity or
more not understandable and more unregulatable like AI like synthetic biology.
The default assumption will be yeah it it'll probably be net positive it'll cause some problems
we'll figure out how to solve those problems and I actually don't think a right assessment of the
history of technology warrants that nor do I think these technologies currently warrant that as the
right assumption and so in the face of exponentiating technology that is also exponentiating
destructive capacity and it's not just destructive capacity through its militarized uses it's even
through its market uses doing a thing that we want that is narrow progress that's driving
externalities more as we pass planetary boundaries if it is
I want more people to have a wider kind of clearer worldview through which they can look at
things that are being called progress and promising a better future to be able to look at
the issues that are emerging right now and have a different default assumption and a different like
where should burden of proof be actually some of these things are so harmful burden of proof
should have been proving led was safe before putting it in gasoline and aerosolizing it to
everybody as opposed to having irreparable harm that could never be addressed and then regulating
after the fact and so where there is truly existential risk portended burden of proof
shouldn't be that it is really dangerous it should be
we actually have to prove adequate safety through doing a detailed enough analysis of what
doesn't order face will be before we rapidly scale the stuff so that was the reason that we
wanted to put that paper out now is because the rate of technological I will not call it progress
I will call it advancement because it is definitely increasing goal achieving with it
with not the refining on what is a good goal without changing the economic incentive that
leads to externalities and all like that but the rate of technological advancement is definitely
in the verticalizing part of the exponential curve no one can actually really understand
the speed and the portent of it the fact that now you know that there was nothing like Moore's law
right it historically and it kind of ate the world and that was progressive doubling of compute
power every couple years and just the hardware on GPU based AI will 10x in the next six months
you know that the power will 10x in six months not 2x in two years right and then in six months
it will do it again in less time than that and the software and the parameters and the data are
also an exponential 100x in less than a year probably something like that and if you look at
I think it's a million x increase in the last 10 years and so
you know and if you take something like AI where we're developing it for increasing
generality it is basically a general purpose goal achieving tool do you want to beat people at chest
do you want to beat them at goad do you want to beat them at starcraft do you want to beat
them at missile targeting do you want to beat them at protein folding do you want to beat them at
comprehensive war planning or high-speed currency trading great let's increase the ability to do all
those things the technology will be developed for one purpose and we'll focus on the upside of that
but when the cost of the technology becomes cheap for that purpose and then the affordance
allows everybody to advance every kind of goal that has to be really thought about as part of the
externality set but I am the AI is another conversation that I want to have with you especially
with respect to to climate change and and the environment but on this topic isn't AI being
trained with the old linear model in English and with all the perceptions of what we just discussed
of of progress and isn't it like an exponential layer of the same on top like you said as humans
we have to change our perception of our relation to the whole isn't AI like being fed zillions of
times more the perception of the what we don't want yes but worse than that it does not you know
it has the ability to already do goal achieving obviously it does not have the ability for empathy
which means that goal achieving without empathy is sociopathic I'm not saying sadistic it doesn't
have interiority oh so so AI is only a dark triad not a dark quad the whole conversation around
will AI develop sentience or not is another thing more importantly is that AI doesn't operate by
itself it operates inside of companies and inside of militaries with the people that are there
as part of a cybernetic system so it already doesn't have to be completely general to be
part of a cybernetic system that is general because what the AI does what other types of AI so the
whole cybernetic system has a hybrid of cognitive architectures plus what it predisposes the people
to do you know is actually the thing that's being selected for so as we're in a place where technological
advancement is speeding up it is being sold as the solution to all these problems they're problems
that our previous technological success has caused the harms of these technologies are being
downplayed everyone is racing as we're crossing planetary boundaries it would be better if more
people understood what is wrong with the progress narrative and understood what authentic progress
actually entails and understood the caution and restraint that it requires understood the
emphasis on maintaining understood that very often the best way to solve a problem is to
remove its causes which actually involves reversing some stuff rather than always create new stuff but
the obviously market incentive is on create new stuff the history books incentive is on create
new stuff but as we think about how do we actually solve problems in a way that isn't a racket right
that isn't solving a problem that was caused by the result of our previous problem solving
and that will in turn create more of that first we have to say is this actually a problem is it
bad that food perishes and that's a problem to solve through artificial preservatives and
making Twinkies that can last 25 years as opposed to like fresh vegetables that start to decay or
is that not a problem it's actually a feature of reality we should interact with and embrace
there's that meme that shows a picture of a rambunctious kid and it says riddle and easier than
parenting is is our children wanting our time in our attention a problem that we need a technological
solution like an iPad for well yes because we have to work because all the other parts of the system
but like tribal life was the kids and the old people spending tremendous amounts of time together
as the center of civilization with everyone else spending time supporting that and so
the first part of problem solving is is this even a problem or is this actually a feature
of reality that yes it requires like do I want to automate every single thing that requires
muscular engagement where then you have a society of obese people with brittle bones and like that
or do you actually want that like all the dynamism of our bodies and the development
of strength in them is actually important it's actually required that I don't want to automate
all those things away do I want to remove every kind of pain like oh your family member just died
until you feel depressed here's a here's a psych med to take your emotions away is it a problem that
you're feeling emotions and the answer is a technological solution like a psych med or
is in the exploration of those emotions the possibility that you can have a meaningful
life at all because you understand that everyone you know and love is going to die you're going to
die what is meaningful while you're here why did what does it mean that you love that person that
you're in deep question some of the depression is like I was a shithead to that person I didn't
express my love to them as much I was too busy working at my job to have a cost of living of
that has a bunch of stuff that doesn't actually make me happy but that I think that I need
and I feel sad and I realize that maybe I'm not going to stop and then I'm going to die and there
aren't going to be that many people who are that touched by me and like fuck maybe that depression
is exactly what the fuck you need to reflect and make a meaningful life change not a psych med so
the first part of problem solving is is this a problem that needs a technological solution or is
or is this a facet of life that I actually need to embrace and be with
the next step is if it really is a problem what caused it it was this always the case and it's a
feature of reality or was this caused by other things we did where the first step is undo the
causes as opposed to ameliorate at the symptom level all those causes continue to express somewhere
else and you know so there are these kinds of steps of what would it mean to engage in problem
solving in a way that does not cause more problems and it is possible and it does result in
the possibility of having us have what we add to the world be actual progress meaning actual
betterment but it is different in process and different different in process and different
in motive in almost every way is there a third step
there's some papers we're going to publish on the processes that you can walk through and they're
not formal they're not algorithmic they're they're principled kinds of reasoning like is this really
a problem that needs a technological solution or is this a facet of reality to be with is this
what were the causes have I traced it back to the causes do I understand them do I understand
the cause of those you know like those kinds of things one of them is yellow teaming yellow
teaming is once we decide there is a thing that we want to create whether it's a law or a business
or a technology because there is some thing where we've addressed the upstream causes etc and
there's still something to develop then I really want to think through if this thing succeeds and
solves the narrowly defined definition of a problem what is the totality of the effects of it succeeding
on all the other areas and where is it going to externalize effects because it's going to have
effects other than that one area and if it externalizes more positives awesome that's a good sign
that it's in the right direction and if you look at like a tree a tree does a million positive
things for a million entities over a million timescales right the tree is causing benefit to
squirrels and to butterflies and to birds and to insects and to soil microbes it's stabilizing
topsoil and holding moisture in the ecosystem and causing transpiration and keeping the river clean
in the banks of the river so like positive externalities are actually the result of good
design based on understanding the interconnectedness of things negative externalities where you don't
understand the interconnectedness you optimize it for a narrow thing and externalize it everywhere
else so the yellow teaming is the thinking through the network of relationships and causal dynamics
such that you look at the externalities both physical and psychosocial see where there are
possibly harmful ones and say either we don't do the thing or how do we design such that that's not
the case that the externalize effects are positive and that is actually possible not perfectly but
progressively better it's sometimes uh with increasing frequency seems to me that we're
waking up as a species at the exact time the clock is running out that's the hope that's the
possibility yeah so uh isn't the paper in the public domain uh at a podcast about naive versus
authentic progress a tiny sign of authentic progress there are signs of authentic progress in the world
there are more people that kind of care about deep ecology there are more people that are
interested in thinking about long-term futures well you know there are more people interested in
approaches to healthcare that are not exclusively uh you know allopathic healthcare
currently the
rates of growth of the things that are moving in the authentic progress direction versus the
narrow progress harm externalizing direction are not adequate right and like i said many of the things
and and everybody that is contributing to the meta crisis thinks that they are contributing to real progress
right i'm i'm providing a product or service that the market wants which means there's demand
for it which means it's increasing it's solving some problem for someone that makes their life better
and i'm employing the tools of science and technology which is this awesome system that
allows us to understand the world in a unified way and improve things and like that's the story so
it's like the and that's why people can come out in such defensive fossil fuels of look at all the
things they give us and um you know and of the market and and they do and they give all of these
externalities and while that has benefited some and sucked for others it also benefits some
dimensions of self and sucks for the dimensions of self even for those most being benefited
and it is in the process of self terminating where it will be a benefit to know but no one
in which case the damn i really don't want to be complicit with that thing damn i really don't
want to just what's best for me and my family is continue to have optionality tokens
and damn i don't want to try to make things better where i end up making them worse because
i am coming from the same type of mind that engages in rivalry and cause that does a movement
in a way that creates counter movements and that optimizes for one thing in a way that ends up
you causing harm elsewhere so i want that the activism the protection impulse and me reconnects
to the source of reality deeply enough that i know how to participate that i'm guided and how
to participate in a way that is actually meaningful so i would actually like to see a slightly slower
movement into action a deeper movement into withdrawal
and a deeper understanding of the history of well intended failed actions more rigorously
it's very painful and a deeper being with the emotions about the whole thing and really taking
it all in and noticing how much of our desire to make it better is still ego is still
an avoidance mechanism for not wanting to feel it is still a problem solving mode that is
reductionistic that will end up contributing to it and like letting that stuff settle
to get to a place where one can engage in how to shift the system dynamics of the world in a
way that are actually what's needed here here once again you have surprised me i read your paper
i understood it and this conversation went in a different way than i expected
what would you like from our viewers how would you like to wrap this up and what are next steps
you mentioned 12 questions that we didn't get to and yes you know some viewers may have questions
thoughts so if there are interesting questions then maybe we can do a session two particularly
if once we publish some of these papers people have questions on them because we don't
have where we're publishing them the ability to answer them there
um i think the thing that i would hope people leave with is
deepening appreciation of the tremendous amount of non-human activity that it took to make the
world that you exist in the incredible uh preciousness and miracle of it and the desire that
the thing that makes your life and the life of everyone you love possible you want to have
occupy more of your attention than it does now
and that the places where your attention and your time and your energy are occupied by the result
of a system that resulted from selection of coordinated violence and like that
that you really want to root that out of your own self and psyche
and and you want to just like appreciate the the universe and world that gives rise to the
possibility at all and then seek to explore how do i like there's something like a vow
like a Hippocratic oath it's like i i'm not willing in pursuing a narrow definition of
advancement for me or whatever or in being complicit to cause harm to this like miraculous
world not willing and i'm going to look really carefully at what does that and rather than
jump so quickly to well yeah but i can't because i have to work whatever try a little harder to
say do you have any other possibilities like don't jump to your own lack of agency so quickly like
we said about the billionaires that would say oh i don't have agency or else would do the thing well
like how long did you spend thinking about it like how many options did you really pursue and
and i think the combination of the removal of some of the energy from this world
world system the increasing appreciation of the natural world and the commitment to both not
cause harm the study of what does and then the commitment to be part of what can actually protect
against harm can result in like that is the movement or the set of cultural shifts that i
really like to see that's a hell of a start my friend for my part it's about a half hour away
from being dark here in minnesota and i'm going to bid you good night and i'm going to go sit by
a tree and reflect on it's not just a tree and all the processes and parts and relationships
and just do a little bit of a pre dusk sitting gorgeous this this was a lot it was beautiful
and wise and has given me much to think about thank you for all your work all your thoughts
and all your efforts on behalf of our planet the future and all of us striving to play a role
thank you my friend likewise my friend it was a delight to be with you today
