There are so many contingencies, particularly actually on the geopolitical side, that can
derail what seems to be passive development at any one time. And it's a strange...
And this is why I think it's hard to think about, because on the one hand it is systemic,
but on the other hand, it is vulnerable to contingent events.
Today's guest is Professor Helen Thompson. Helen works at Cambridge University, where she
researches the political economy of energy and the long history that underpins the democratic,
economic, and geopolitical disruptions that we're seeing now in the 21st century.
Her most recent book, Disorder, Hard Times in the 21st Century, is kind of a
political science mirror twin of the logic of the great simplification.
Today we talk about the history of the United States in the Middle East, Israel and Hamas and
Qatar, Ukraine and Russia, the importance of energy in the history of the world,
and some speculation on what's ahead. Please welcome Professor Helen Thompson.
Hi Helen, great to see you. Hi Nate, good to see you too.
Although we've never met in person, maybe I should call you Professor Thompson.
No, call me Helen. So you have an impressive economic, political,
science background covering history, energy, economics, politics and much more.
Can you just give a brief introduction and how did you first get interested in these
topics all the way back to college or high school or what was your path?
Not at all really. I basically got seriously interested in energy in I think 2013
and I came at it via really the monetary environment of the post-2008 world.
And I was sufficiently, I wouldn't say aware about energy questions, but I was sufficiently
aware of the macroeconomic implications of energy to understand that there was a relationship between
the post-2008 monetary environment, quantitative easing, zero-interest rates and the shale boom
in the US, and to understand that the world economy needed shale oil. I wouldn't say that my
understanding was much better than that at that point. But I was trying to work out what I might
write as a long book project for an academic leave that turned out not to materialize for
various reasons. And I kept thinking, you know what, I'm going to have to bring oil into this.
And I kept trying to work out a way of doing what I wanted to do about the crash and about the
eurozone crisis and bring oil into it. And then I realized that was completely the wrong way to
think about things and that I just needed to go in like via oil. So I started trying to think about
how I might write a short book by this point about the macroeconomic consequences of what I now
believe to be a serious oil problem for the world economy. But I quickly understood that in order to
think about that, I needed to think about geopolitics in a way which I'd never really done before,
not in any sharply incisive way anyway. So I try to teach myself to think geopolitically
around this time as well. And things have really moved from there. I mean, the only thing I would
add to that is I'm a child of the 70s. I was born in 1967 in Britain. My first memory of national
life in Britain is the winter of 1974, sitting around at home, seven years old, my mother trying
to cook in the dark evening after evening with two small children, candlelight. So I understood in
a quite visual sense in a way that energy had a profound impact or could have a profound impact
on daily life. And I never lost that. But I wouldn't say that until some point after 2013. I connected
that in any way to what I was trying to do as a scholar. I have a ton of questions for you,
as you might imagine. Could you give a one or two minute elevator pitch of your latest book,
Disorder, Hard Times in the 21st Century? So what I really wanted to do in disorder was try to
explain the political shocks of the 2010s, with which people obviously were very familiar, not
least in Britain and the United States, because high on the list of shocks of that year were
obviously Brexit or were seen to be anyway, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump,
and to give them a long history. And I didn't think that they were just episodes, if you like,
of psychodrama in British politics or American politics. I thought that each of those two things
had more of a structural explanation than that. And I wanted to run with the thought
that actually, if I started thinking seriously and systematically about these events having
an energy history, that I will be able to get somewhere in explaining them that more
conventional accounts wouldn't. Now, I'm not enough of an energy determinist where politics is
concerned to think that energy explains absolutely everything. And indeed, if I had thought that,
I probably wouldn't have spent time in the third part of disorder writing about democracies quite
in the way in which I do. But I wanted also to grapple with what I see as the long standing
historical problems that representative democracy faces as a form of government.
And I thought there were some things, particularly actually in relation to the United States and
its history as a domestic oil producer, where it was possible to say that there was a story
to be told about the American Republic and what was going on in oil politics as well.
So my book kind of tries to say, look, we should have expected the disorder of the 2010s,
because there were these significant structural forces at work
centered around not only the problems of fossil fuel energy, but the difficulties of the energy
transition, the geopolitics of the energy transition. And then unless we could understand
those things, we weren't going to get really anywhere in understanding the economic, political,
and geopolitical world in which we live. So I'm glad we're finally having a conversation
on camera. My work, as you know, focuses around the concept of energy blindness
in finance, in economic theory, and in broader culture. And it's always refreshing to talk to
someone who sees not energy as everything, but energy in everything like I do in a different field.
So you're a political scientist and a political economist in your academic stripes.
Are your fields political science? Is that energy blind as well? And is that changing?
I'd say that political science is energy blind largely. I'd say that political economy has
a more complicated relationship to this. I think if you go back to the 1970s and the political
economy that came out of the 1970s, indeed, some of the stuff that say I was taught as an
undergraduate, I don't think it was energy blind. I think that political economy was relatively
energy aware, not necessarily in the system dynamics of energy, but the economic and geopolitical
importance of energy. And then it lost that awareness. I think it kind of lost the awareness
at the same time in a way in which the politicians in Western countries lost their awareness. So
I struggle sometimes to think, to know where I think this began. It was the late 80s or
sometime in the 90s when I think then energy blindness took over. I think in political
economy over the last few years, there is quite a bit of evidence that actually,
at least some people are getting serious about energy again. And I've had a lot less difficulty
explaining to people since my book, this book came out, this longer book Disorder,
why energy is as important as I'm presenting it to be. When I wrote this short book called Oil on
the Western Economic Crisis, which came out in 2017, then I still think most people thought,
why is she writing about that?
Well, it didn't hurt the tailwinds for your book that it came out the exact same time that
Putin invaded Ukraine. No, I mean, in the UK, it came out on the actual day of the invasion.
Oh my gosh. So that was a strange experience in itself. But there were things that I was saying
that suddenly people who weren't particularly interested in energy and I think didn't think
they wanted to be interested in energy suddenly would tell me that they were reading it and they
would say, oh, that makes sense. And I give you one clear example of that was what I wrote about
the Suez Crisis. And I spent a lot of time thinking about the Suez Crisis trying to offer
a somewhat different interpretation than certainly we usually get in Britain. And I remember when I
was writing that chapter, and I just took the decision one day that I was actually going to
make it the structural pivot of the second geopolitical chapter. And I thought this could
go very wrong. I mean, people would just think that it's some kind of apology for British imperialism.
And then because of what was happening with Ukraine and the pipelines and the issue of
transit and these big shifts, then almost everybody who was asking me questions in the
first few weeks after the book came out in the UK wanted to talk to me about the Suez Crisis.
I'm going to jump around a bit, Helen, but since you brought that up, could you briefly describe
the Suez Crisis and speculate on whether we're going to have another one?
Yeah, I mean, the second part of that's a really very interesting question. I think that what's
important to see from the British point of view, which I'll start with on the on the on the Suez
Crisis, is that in 1956, when the British took military action with France and Israel
against Egypt in the weight of the light of NASA, the Egyptian president nationalizing the company
that owned the Suez Canal, in the British mind, government mind, the British were doing exactly
what they were supposed to do in the post Second World War, which was to act as an imperial power
in the Middle East to guarantee the oil security of Western European countries, because American
presidents were very clear in the post-war Second World War world. They wanted largely the oil of
the Western Hemisphere for the Western Hemisphere, obviously not least the United States itself.
They were only willing to provide oil to Western Europe countries in an emergency. They didn't
really want Western European countries buying oil from the Soviet Union, certainly once the Cold
War got going, that meant Western European countries and Japan needed to import oil from the
Middle East and they didn't want to have any military responsibility in the Middle East
for ensuring the free flow of oil through the Persian Gulf. That was the British job.
Obviously they didn't want the British behaving in brazen ways like an imperial power that made
it very difficult with them for them with Arab states, but nonetheless, if there was a threat
to Western European energy security, then Britain was supposed to act as an imperial power and do
something about it, which is what British did in the autumn of 1956 and then Eisenhower obviously
up for re-election didn't want that kind of display of European imperialism, particularly at a time
when the Soviet Union was sending tanks into Budapest and put such financial pressure on the
British government. Financial pressure that was made possible by Britain's desperate need
now to find dollars to buy American oil because the Arab states were boycotting the
sale of oil through one of the pipelines and the Suez Canal was closed, that it was very easy for
Eisenhower to tell the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, you're out. With the British not
being able to continue neither could the French and neither ultimately could the Israelis. If we
just look at it for a moment from the Israeli point of view, what that showed in 1956 was how
vulnerable that they were on transit issues and that was both about the Suez Canal itself, but it
was also about the Strait of Turan, which is like water that gets them up the eastern side of the
Sinai Peninsula and made it possible, would make it possible in time for Iran to sell oil to
Israel and that became a really central issue for Israel, including then in 1967 when NASA closed
the Strait of Turan again and then kept the Suez Canal closed for eight years, the second time.
So what happened then during those eight years as the ships had to go all the way around?
Yeah, I mean if it wasn't coming pipeline, it had to go all the way around Africa and interestingly
in that context, that is part of the reason then why from 1967 the British government concludes it
can no longer stay in the Middle East, it can no longer carry on being an imperial power there,
because suddenly the oil costs that Britain faces in the wake of the Six Day War, where it's also
subject to a embargo, a much greater. So in addition to culture being energy blind, it's
possible that energy experts and culture are geopolitics and complexity blind. I mean can
you imagine, I'm sure you can, you're an expert on this, the importance of the Suez Canal and the
Strait of Hormuz as being open and free and navigable for the rest of the world just in time
things and both of those are within the arena of the current conflict. I think most people don't
even think about those important choke points. No, I mean obviously this raises the second part
of your question. I mean if we look at Israel's position in this though, there's been a really
quite substantial change from the situation either in 1956 for Israel or in 1967. So in the aftermath
of the Suez crisis through to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, then Iran was the principal
exporter of oil to Israel. None of the Arab states were willing to sell oil to Israel. The United
States was operating with its not exports accepting an emergency. So the only state really that was
willing to sell oil to Israel on a contracted basis was with the Iranians and that was one of the
reasons why in 1967 that NASA blockaded the the Straits of Tehran because he wanted to stop
Iran selling oil to Israel. He thought that that was a fundamental weakness of the Islamic world
in dealing with Israel back in 1967. But then when we get to the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution
although that there's some covert selling of oil by Iran to Israel this time like through a land
pipeline rather than through the Straits of Tehran, Israel starts looking for other options.
It gets a guarantee from the Americans that in an absolute emergency the Americans will provide
oil. But if we look at who is the number one exporter of oil to Israel today, it's Azerbaijan.
It comes via like pipeline that the vulnerability for Israel in that is actually Turkey's position
because the pipeline's coming through Turkey. In terms of the relationship between the Israeli
government and the Azerbaijani government it's quite strong. Israel's also selling arms to
to Azerbaijan. But it's the transit. It's the transit through Turkey that is probably on that
respect. Israel's vulnerability. So let's put a pin in that. 1979 was a key year in the Middle
East because Egypt recognized Israel. The Shah of Iran was overthrown. Israel gave up its oil
in Sinai as a part of developing better relations with Egypt and the Iranian Revolution then cut
off Israel from oil supply that the Shah had provided as you mentioned. So you've observed
that these events made the USSR somewhat irrelevant in that part of the world until the Syrian civil
war 30 years later, 40 years later. Is there a parallel between the Abraham Accords in which Saudi
Arabia was was poised to join the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in normalizing relations with Israel
earlier this year and Iran now feeling potentially less relevant in the Middle East in the same way
Russia became after 1979? I think there are possibly some parallels here. I think that there's
well I think that there's a paradox which I don't still think I really you've got to grips with
in trying to understand the events of the last few weeks because if we think about the course of
the last few years and particularly actually the first part of this year we could see two
different things at least two different different things really opposite things going on. The first
of them is you said Nate it was the possibility the strong possibility it would seem that the Abraham
Accords were going to be extended to Saudi Arabia and at that point you could see that actually
not only was Israel going to be able to normalize relations with a growing number of Arab states
including now the most significant one but that that was quite complementary to various of the
economic relations including energy relations that Israel was cultivating with Arab states
not least being able to do so because since some point in the 2010s Israel has been able to export
I think it's from 2017 is being able to export gas from its offshore eastern Mediterranean
gas fields and two of the states that it exports to have been Jordan and Egypt. You've also got
involvement in at least one of those gas fields so you could see that there was a kind of not
economic unity would be going too far but economic interdependence growing between Israel
various of the Arab states takes Saudi Arabia into that that is a big deal a really like big deal
and in one sense transformative I think from Israel's point of view and then you might say well
Iran shut out of that no possibility of that kind of relationship between Israel and Iran
tries to sabotage it though that runs into the issue of whether they really did know
that Hamas was going to attack but on the other hand if you look at what was going on this year
is you had the rapprochement the diplomatic rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran
and brokered it would seem on the surface anyway by the the Chinese perhaps United Arab Emirates
played some part perhaps Pugin played some part so actually you had growing Saudi apparently
anyway growing Saudi Iranian relations or defrosting let's say relations during the same period in
which Iran might not like it's being left out of the Abraham Accords and I and I still think
trying to understand like how both those things were going on at the same time I still think
that's a bit of a puzzle is it possible I am absolutely no expert here which is why I'm asking
you but there has been obviously tribal conflicts in humanity back to the Pleistocene but a big one
is between the Shia and Sunni factions of of the Muslim faith is it possible that the aversion to
the west the United States Israel is enough an aversion that it could unite some of the previous
you know antagonistic tribes in the area and it could be Middle East Asia versus the west
from this current conflict do you have any thoughts on that
I think that that is I think that that is quite hard to imagine or at least to not to see that the
the fault lines would assert them reassert themselves like quite quickly I mean I give you
one like example is the the complete difficulty that the the Bush administration had persuading the
Saudis that they had to make some kind of accommodation with post Saddam's Iraq
once that the Shia majority were the dominant political force in Iraq and in that sense it
was easier for the Saudis to have I wouldn't say necessarily straightforwardly positive
relations with the United States but at least complicated relations with the United States
that had some payoff potentially for each side then it was to re-establish Iraq Saudi relations
in the post Saddam era I think as well that if you if you look at the internal politics of a number
of Arab countries including now like Egypt as well the idea that they really want to make
common cause with Hamas both in its relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood who obviously were
empowering Egypt from 2011-2013 but also then around support for Hamas that's I think pretty
destabilizing prospect for in in in Egyptian politics so I think we always have got a factor
into this like what the risks around domestic political stability are for any of the Arab
states in their relations not only with Iran but also with the Palestinian cause.
The Palestinian cause is obviously prominent in everyday news right now this is recorded on
Monday October 30th obvious to those people that understand the centrality of energy to our world
the effects of the Israel Hamas situation have clear consequences for the availability of oil
globally something like half to two-thirds of the world's oil reserves are within 800 miles of
Israel but how is this conflict taken a bird's-eye view especially during the late 20th century
how is the energy at the center of of this current conflict can you can you give a
stratospheric view of that? Well I think there are several different things going on here
the first of them is that Iran's position in the Persian Gulf and to some extent its
relationship with China on the Persian around the Persian Gulf are pretty central to any question
about the conflict between Israel and Hamas spelling spilling out into a an original conflict or
original war and I think that there's a way of thinking about that question that actually goes
back to the summer of 2019 which is actually where I started disorder because there we saw
what happened when Iran responded to what Trump called the maximum economic pressure being applied
after Trump had ended the Iran nuclear deal with various attacks on shipping in the in the Persian
Gulf then there was the attacks probably by Iranian proxies on the Saudi oil facilities
Saudi defense defense system essentially failed and then it looked like the Americans even under
Trump weren't going to make any response to that which made the Saudis incredibly angry and then
in January of 2020 so just as the pandemic was starting in China we had Trump ordering the
assassination of Soleimani the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the response of a lot of
Trump's critics to that was he's so mad he's just about to start like World War three so even in
the quite recent years with pandemic got in the way of people I think remembering what was going
on in the second half of 2019 and early 2020 we can see that conflict in the Persian Gulf has
got the potential to be incredibly like destabilizing and so any for any conflict that moves into
regional war in in the Middle East that is will be central to it how are we going to avoid a major
war in the Middle East I mean what would be the I think you don't need to paint the the worst case
worst case is is nukes all around the world you don't even need to paint the bad case which is
the Strait of Hormuz closes and and there's giant bombs and destruction in Middle Eastern countries
what would be a somewhat benign and a and a hopeful outcome of of the current situation
I I think the the benign version is that the presence of the American Navy in the way in which
it is now in that in then the Mediterranean is sufficient deterrent to Iran to ensure that
Hezbollah stays out of anything doing anything particularly significant in northern Israel
and Iran understood stands that there would be very direct consequences for it if it were to
engage in even in maybe even the kind of action that it engaged in the summer of 2019 in the in
the Strait of of Hormuz it a lot of times when there's and here's me saying this to a political
scientist expert but it seems like there's a conflict between a country and another country
but here it's like this complicated rat's nest of multiple countries and multiple groups and
demographics and initiatives I mean there's Lebanon there's Syria there's Russian support there
there's Iran there's Hezbollah there's Hamas there's all kinds of Houthi rebels and it seems like
there are tiny little Archduke Ferdinand possibilities everywhere no absolutely and but I
think some of that though there's a positive story to tell about some of the complexities of the
interdependence for instance as I said earlier Israel exports gas now at least it has been to
Jordan and to Egypt that means that these are countries that have got something to lose
from conflict with Israel in a way which is never historically being true before the
2010s when this offshore Israeli gas production began now there is some difficulty for Egypt
coming out of this and unfortunately it does have I think potential ramifications for Europe because
one of the fields the three main fields in the eastern Mediterranean that belong to
Israel and Tamar is in the rocket range of Hamas and so production is shut down at the
moment which means that Egypt isn't getting the liquid natural gas exports from Israel that it
would usually do it also exports itself because it has fields in the eastern Mediterranean that
means you'll be exporting less to Europe and we know that European demand for liquid natural gas
is much higher than it was two years ago because of the Russia's war against Ukraine and so these
things become interconnected and disruptive so I'm an American and I remember what happened with
President Bush and the war in Iraq and I have other memories of subsequent presidents can you
outline the shifting relationships and perspectives with the United States president's administrations
towards Saudi Arabia and the Middle East from Obama to Trump to currently Biden with the
fist bump to MBS or he refused to shake hands but it seems like this is all an unfolding
soap opera with massive consequences for our future yeah I think we probably need to just start with
like where things were in the Bush Jr presidency let's say particularly by 2005 so once it's clear
that Iraq is going to be a a quagmire our best and that if a crucial purpose which in my to my
mind it was of the Iraq war was to remove the sanctions from Iraq's oil exports rebuild the
Iraqi oil industry get international oil companies back into Iraq turn Iraq into
a large-scale oil producer rather than as it had previously been before the sanctions a medium-sized
oil producers so been producing more like 10 11 million barrels a day like the Saudis
could that wasn't going to work out it's very clear by 2005 so what we see in 2005 and I think
that the shapes of a world that we still live in is essentially that world oil production
stagnated and then into that in the 2010s came the shale oil boom in in the United States and
meant that that stagnation of production that was there I think by 2005 and it was for a whole set
of reasons including geopolitical reasons didn't play out in the way in which it would have done
otherwise so there was no way that George Bush could find a way out of the Middle East or even
think that he could find a way out of the Middle East I think the Iraq war should be understood
as trying to address what that administration understood really quite well was the stagnation
of production that was coming in a world in which Asian demand in general and Chinese in particular
was growing quite rapidly I think by the time that Obama's been in office a couple of years
by 2011 probably the people in the White House with him by this idea that shale is the fix
now shale is a partial fix it stops I think economically the 2010s being a lot more difficult
than they would otherwise have been but it isn't actually a route out of the United States from
the Middle East altogether not least because it's the question of like where the shale oil is going
to be refined and where the American refineries are themselves well suited to all the shale that's
being produced so the United States isn't actually losing its need to import oil from the Middle
East it's simply reducing its need to import oil from the Middle East but I think the Obama
administration is emboldened by shale I think it does several things it first of all thinks okay we
can now sanction Iran which they've been quite wary about because the Europeans will protest the oil
prices will go too high if too much Iranian oil is taken off the market we sanction them we bring
them to the table we get a nuclear deal with Iran the sanctions can come off we can normalize relations
largely normalize relations like with Iran that will put the Saudis in their place a bit too we
don't have to treat them so seriously as we've as we've generally been doing since the the 1970s
because we don't need them so much and obviously it doesn't turn out like that in terms of getting
out of the Middle East not least because ISIS comes along and then he's got American troops out of
Iraq by 2012 but the air force is going back in in 2014 now Trump I think then comes in the exact
opposite way of well let's I use Trump as a shorthand because who knows who exactly was making all
the decisions in the Trump White House but comes in and he is like no we need to be close to the
Saudis still we need to be tough on Iran and so he's willing to be quite tolerant of most things
to do with MBS cultivates personal relationship probably get some you know pay off in terms of
his own you know corporate material inch family interests but I think it's quite then revealing
that even when Trump is the president in the September of 2019 when those Saudi oil facilities
are attacked that the Americans don't actually make a response I think Biden comes in then and
he's back to flipping it the other way and he's got an added component to it which is is that
he I think quite desperately wants the Iran nuclear deal back because he wants Iranian
more Iranian oil on the the world markets because he doesn't want to look like he's got an oil policy
at all he wants his energy policy to look like it's just about climate and the energy
transition so Iran nuclear deal you have to know something to understand that that's it
oil policy but he's not able to do that but in that case you just made the supposition that Biden
cares more about appearing to be a climate president rather than actually being one because
he wants the US to use a less oil but if I ran if more Iranian oil is on the world market from a
CO2 perspective that's more fossil carbon being burned right yeah I mean I think where should
you put it there there obviously are like levels of like complexity to that I mean you might also
say I mean you know I don't suppose to know how much deep thinking there has been about this
question inside the Biden White House you might also say that it's quite useful if you really
understand that might be a medium to long-term oil problem that actually you keep some American
production like back and let others like take this case so there's level there's draining America
first absolutely I don't think that's the deep thinking but maybe maybe it is but what we know
whatever whatever thinking or was going on the policy didn't work and so already by the summer
of 2021 he was having to ask the Saudis essentially to increase output which they weren't willing to
do he then made is rather humiliating visit to Riyadh in the next summer in 2022 and the Saudis
have shown no willingness really despite the fact of working with the administration about
the Abraham Accords to accommodate the Biden administration's persistent desire for more
oil output from OPEC plus so what do you think about the fact that if you add UAE Saudi Arabia
and the new BRICS nations including Russia that the amount of oil purchasable in the open market
not the oil production but the available oil exports are now over 50 percent controlled by
BRICS nations first of all is that important and a related question I'm just curious
from a political perspective people living in those nations in the Middle East that are
selling the stored sunlight from beneath their lands to the global west and of course they're
getting dollars or or financial remuneration for that but it's it's their you know their legacy
of what they have in their lands and it's being sold to the west do the people there ever get
patriotic and nationalistic about that I mean what is the real feeling beneath the dollar signs
and barrels of oil that are flowing I mean on the first question I think that OPEC plus
matters a lot more than the BRICS okay I mean I think if you look at it in energy terms that
India and China and and Brazil as the founders are in a very different position than Russia
and I think that China has its own really quite severe still constraints around its foreign
oil and gas dependency and I think it's well aware of those I think in this case the Chinese
leadership really is energy aware yeah so I think that in terms of is there a power block
that would use energy as a weapon against western countries we should think in terms of like OPEC
plus and not think in terms of BRICS and I think you might say that it then really is quite
significant that the Saudi Russian axis in OPEC plus has held through Russia's invasion of Ukraine
indeed strengthened because if you go back to the aftermath of those attacks on the Saudi oil
facilities you pretty much had Putin laughing at the Saudis about the fact that the air defense
system that they bought from the United States didn't work if you go to the spring of 2020
so when the pandemic really started you have been salmon trying to flood the market
with oil after you can't reach an agreement with Putin about how to deal with the pandemic and then
you effectively have Donald Trump putting OPEC plus back together again because he doesn't want
the price of oil on the floor for American shale producers and having to threaten the Saudis
like with military withdrawal or you know military less military support unless that they
play nice with him about that so I mean OPEC plus looks pretty like weak as any kind of cohesive
block in spring of 2020 we're a long way away from that now OPEC plus can choose to inflict harm
on the Biden administration and I think chose to do so in the run up to those mid-term elections
last November when a quite substantial cut was announced just in the weeks before when
Biden had been pressing obviously for increased output I was going to ask you this near the end
of the interview but I'll ask it right now given what you just said have we reached the point
or are we approaching a point where the rest of the world can decouple or de facto sanction the US
and other countries in the US orbit without it having disastrous effects on their own economies
I think you can see that in Russia's case that it has been able to inflict quite substantial harm
on European countries and in particular Germany by cutting off the supply of gas through the
Nord Stream 1 pipeline which it began to do from the summer of 2022 if you look at the
economic data coming out of Germany over the last few months it's it's pretty difficult
that Germany has experienced a major industrial blow by what has happened and it's not clear
that the Russian economy has taken such a big hit for having done this certainly where oil is
concerned it's been able to sell pretty much the same amount of oil as it was previously doing
for a reasonably long period of time at a lower price than the market price but even that it's
not clear that that's true any longer it's been able to increase its liquid natural gas exports
that obviously doesn't yet compensate from those for what it's lost through selling through the
pipelines that the Yamal pipeline and the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to European countries but it's
got the capacity to increase LNG exports further I think the Saudi question is like more difficult
because the Saudis are obviously more integrated financially into the US world and the way that
the Russians were much less so since even just then since 2014 and certainly since those financial
sanctions and Saudi obviously has this does have a military relationship with the
United States and so that acts as some kind of constraint on what the Saudis can do too.
So it was three weeks ago just over when the Hamas-Israel situation exploded and at that time
I thought that the implications would be a premium on long-dated oil futures and instability
to the financial system and instead oil as of today three weeks later is about at the same
level it was before that happened maybe because you say the US Navy is suppressing volatility
but I was surprised and I don't like to talk about this much because you can get in in social
trouble really easily but since you're a professional in this domain it almost feels like this entire
situation unexpectedly to me and many people is like a Middle East version of a George Floyd moment
where there are people around the world reacting to what's happening and it seems like that puts
the international social contract of agreements and supply chains and geopolitical alliances and
everything that we kind of assumed would continue before October 2023 might change just because of
this zeitgeist is changing. What do you think about that Helen?
Well I think there's definitely something going on in that respect. I think that
particularly consequentially for the Biden administration just because the US is much more
important as a power than the European states although they face some of the same domestic
political issues around this they're going to come under considerable pressure and obviously
in the case of the United States with an election next year that is going to intensify that pressure
of how far they can go in supporting Israel without causing themselves very considerable
political problems. I mean I think that it is though aided by the fact that the energy situation
thus far is not particularly, I wouldn't say it's not particularly worrying because I think
it is worrying but we're not seeing a serious crisis in the energy markets in a way in which
we did pretty much immediately on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and I think that does go back to the
fact that the energy situation in the Middle East including Israel's vulnerability on energy
security issues is just not what it was in the past. Then we can add in the fact that the United
States as well as being now not insignificant exporter of oil has got the capacity to release
more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 180 million barrels released really in the context
of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. None of these things were true in the 1970s indeed.
The whole Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in response to the crisis of the 1970s instead of
being an exporter. The United States was on a trajectory in the 1970s to become in the largest
oil importer in the in the world and so I think that the immediate crunch points around the energy
situation are nowhere near as difficult as they were in the 70s. But just to go back to a question
that I didn't answer and I think this does come into matters though is I do think there's there
is still you know very profound resentment in a lot of oil producing countries amongst citizens
about what they look what looks to them like foreign extractivism with heavy legacy heavy
undertone still of the imperial past. I think if you say like why was it not possible for the
international oil companies that got those contracts from the Iraqi government the western ones
essentially to stay there and do well and turn Iraq into the kind of large-scale oil producer
that the Bush administration had in mind. Partly it is because of the domestic resistance that they
ran into in Iraq the political situation now partly that's to do with ISIS but it was also
to do with direct attacks on the headquarters of oil companies from angry Iraqi citizens.
I mean if the experiment was can western oil companies go back into a Middle Eastern
country after the age of energy nationalism of the 1970s and succeed well the answer turned out
to be no they can't. Have you been over there have you traveled in Iraq Iran? No I've never
been to the Middle East no. Okay and just as an aside are you teaching right now like this semester?
Yes I am. What classes are you teaching what is the title of the class?
I teach a first year course which is the introduction to politics for the students
in the undergraduate program and then I teach a course called the politics of the international
economy to the third years. Wow and how do you enjoy that? A lot I really like teaching. Yeah I
miss it. I'm kind of teaching with the podcast but it's not the same as sitting in the room with 20
19 year olds and having a conversation you know and they're so curious and bright and
have their whole lives ahead of them and it it feels like a privilege and also a responsibility
you know. Completely. Yeah yeah yeah so we're going to get back to the Middle East and I also
want to talk to you about Ukraine but you're a historian and could you speak briefly because
I also want to talk about the United States. Can you talk briefly about how energy and oil in
particular really set up Britain and later Germany to become key powers in Europe? I don't think
most people look at that history from an energy perspective. Yeah I think that if we
look at the the 19th century and the the real rise to economic preeminence of Britain. I mean
Britain had obviously established itself as a perhaps the dominant naval power even in the 18th
set by the middle second third of the the 18th century before the industrial revolution but
its economic preeminence comes with the industrial revolution and if we say then like well why did
Britain industrialize before any other country in the world I think that the the answer is not only
that it had significant or abundant domestic coal but also because they've been using coal actually
for a very long time for heating purposes pretty much again unlike anywhere else going back
even the 12th century certainly in the third by the 13th century it had incentive to find
ways of extracting deeper coal and the steam engine the first point purpose of the steam engine was to
do precisely that to be used in mining and then the steam engine ran off coal so you kind of like
it's a it's a circular phenomenon if you then look at the way in which British naval power developed
in the 19th century and you look at something that I think is pretty significant in in in world
history which is the and I say world history very deliberately is the first opium war and the opening
up of imperial China it's British steamships that now are able to be much more powerful than any
sail-based navy could be if you then look at the German story Germany is advantaged like Britain by
having coal a lot of coal but unlike Britain it actually doesn't have iron deposits that are adjacent
to the coal quite a lot of the iron deposits are in Alsace-Lorraine France doesn't have coal even just
saying that like that explains I think quite a lot as to why between 1870 and the creation of
Germany through the Second World War Alsace-Lorraine is a central part of the conflict between like
France and Germany explains why the European coal and steel community the first part of
the European project effectively was a means of giving France access to that West German
coal if we then bring oil into it the thing that's really hard for every European power except for
Austria really in the beginning of the 20th century is they don't have any domestically
if you look at the beginning of the 20th century the two large oil producers of the
United States and Russia I don't think it's a coincidence that they are going to go on albeit
in the case of Russia in the form of the Soviet Union to dominate the 20th century geopolitically
to take over the European imperial powers by contrast are going to be you know eclipsed
Britain tries to deal with its oil problem which it does sort of moderately successfully
by extending its empire around oil i.e sphere of influence in Persia
what will be Iraq in the post what was Mesopotamia what will become Iraq in the post First World War
world Germany loses desperately in that contest during the in the in the First World War it ends
up with nothing in the Middle East it tries to take Baku which is the basis of the now
Soviet oil industry and fails so Hitler's invasion of Russia has puzzled historians
but you suggested it was at least partly about oil did i understand that correctly from from your
work yeah i mean i'm not the first person who who who he's made this argument there are people who
know a lot more about that about this than than i do but i think that if you understand that Germany
was in from its point of view and this is i'm now talking about Weimar Germany so after the
the first war in a really very difficult position because it had lost the war in the Middle East
is its bank made well one of its most important basis on the its most important bank Deutsche
Bank which had effectively operated as its international oil company in the pre-1914
world held 25 percent of the shares in the what was then called the Turkish Petroleum Company
which had the mandate for the concession rather sorry for drilling in Mesopotamia and as part of
the peace then Germany had to hand over or Deutsche Bank had to hand over that ultimately to France
so the Germans begin in the Weimar period on a program of creating synthetic fuel which is
essentially to create an artificial version of oil from coal Hitler expands yeah Hitler expands
that program but there is no way that he can engage the Nazis under Hitler can engage in
war of conquest without much more oil supply than they actually have and by 1941 the second half
well by the summer of 1941 it's it's pretty clear that the conquered territories that Germany Nazi
Germany has by that point plus synthetic fuel is not sufficient and that Hitler and Hitler was
I would say apocalyptically obsessed with energy is is that he thought that there's
only way forward for Germany if it was going to stay in the war was to conquer Baku
which is in present day Abad Jajah which was then the center of the Soviet oil industry
this is going to sound like a obtuse question but if oil is the master resource and what you
said Hitler was obsessed with oil and Homo sapiens historically have gone to war when there are
resource or geographical limits could you imagine fighting a war a kinetic war on renewable energy
no not the same way I mean I think that I think that there is a difference between
the geopolitical ramifications of the arbitrary distribution either under the earth's surface
or under the earth's waters of oil and gas then there is of metals which is what is obviously an
issue in low carbon energy leaving the uranium question aside on on on nuclear and at a certain
point I mean people who are engineers maybe engineers is perhaps not the right word but
there are people who know a lot more about metals I just put it that way than I do and
it's not difficult I think though to imagine that at a certain point that it will be possible to
recycle the metals that are necessary for the energy transition and that it is also possible
that it will be possible that it will be possible to innovate technologically and find ways to do
what are presently being done done let's say by like lithium in relation to batteries in
different ways now energies we both know now it isn't like that you extract oil or gas and you get to
use it once and I think that that makes it like that is quite a fundamental difference between
where we might be going geopolitically with the Jewish now that isn't to say that I'm somebody
who is really like gung ho optimistic about the energy transition but I'm not at least yet
convinced that the the geopolitics of metals has to be quite as dangerous and fraught as the
geopolitics of oil and gas in particular oil were in the 20th century so your summary comments
there are that we're going to need a lot of metals and materials in order to decarbonize
but that rematerialization won't have the same geopolitical constraints of those nations that
happened to live where there were ancient oceans and therefore hydrocarbons were buried
but let me ask a subset of that which is
is the global cooperation and the geopolitics such that with this George Floyd moment in the
Middle East and the anti-colonialist kind of simmering up around the world will the global
North and West be able to forge agreements in African nations and in Southeast Asia where a lot
of these metals reside is is there still the the political economy that existed 50 years ago to
scale that is that a constraint yeah I mean that's the point where I'm much more pessimistic I think
it's a particular problem for European countries both because European countries are significantly
more resource poor than the United States they're also largely quite densely populated
there's going to be much more resistance to domestic exploration for mining in European
countries and I think that ultimately will be in the you know so I'm not saying there won't be but
I just think in Europe it's a really made proof to be a really hard constraint on exploring those
domestic possibilities and then for the European countries they're going back to try and cultivate
private sector investment backed by state support often in parts of the world that they once colonized
where people have got long memories about Europeans and resource extraction in those
countries and I think you can see that in what was happening in West Africa
just over the course of the summer Niger in particular where France had been getting
a quarter of its uranium from there was a coup the language of this is partly bound up I think with
a certain kind of resource nationalism and I think that is going to be the the norm for
Western countries and but particularly European ones in trying to cultivate
relationships economic relationships in places that are metal rich and it's going to be even harder
when actually European well it's not here it's just actually everybody
Western countries are saying look we're going to do the energy transition while we've got
keep our fossil fuel energy system going we're going to use that basically as our insurance
policy but you can't do that you've got to jump straight into this energy future that we don't
really trust is quite coming and we're going to make it a condition of us doing things that might
help you with the energy transition and facilitate our investments in your metal supply chains by
with conditional demands that you don't build new pipelines say oil pipelines or like gas
pipelines or you don't build new coal fired power stations and I just think that that that that's
just like politically just not it's not going to work at all and I think that everything that
happened last year in terms of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the European reaction to that
which was when there was a difficulty European countries including Britain which was hardly
the most exposed where Russian gas was concerned went back to keeping coal fired power stations
that were due to close open and they did this in the British case like just months after they'd been
copper Glasgow lecturing the Chinese and the Indians and Indonesians about how they had to
make commitments to phase out coal by 2045 and what they showed was Britain and others
European countries was in the emergency where electricity was concerned coal was the energy
source of like last resort so why should anybody listen so anything European countries have got
to say about phasing out coal when they've when when they've seen that and I think you can hear
quite a number of like Indian diplomats or Indian ministers say things that make pretty clear well
your hypocrisy was exposed really very very clearly we're just not we were not really interested in
listening to what you've got to say and right now as we speak India is bursting through all-time
coal production in that nation and the world for that matter yeah yeah so let's move to the
United States I knew that I would be running out of time with you and we're we're halfway through
the time period that I promised because you know there's horizontal and deep vertical complexity
on this entire situation there's geopolitics there's history there's energy and then there's
there's money which we haven't talked about so a large part of the United States geopolitical
strength in the mid 20th century came from dominance in energy markets and then we had
the conventional peak of U.S. crude in 1970 followed by Nixon eliminating the gold standard
and from that period on much of the U.S. geopolitical power has come from a huge expansion
of dollar-denominated debt predominantly in developing nations in combination with the
petrodollar to support the largest military in the world is this source of strength from
dollar-denominated debt strong enough to hold the geopolitical sway that the U.S. is used to
even if the dollar were to become unlinked from the purchase of oil in effect a decline of the
the petrodollar I think this is a really important question now I think if we go back to the the
70s and we say why didn't American power unravel more than it did in the 70s because obviously
in significant ways militarily it really did unravel in the in the the 1970s I think
the moves towards financial liberalization and the ability to reconstruct a new dollar system
after dollar gold convertibility been ended by Nixon and after the fixed exchange rate regime
had come to an end in March 1973 that is absolutely like central to that and if you push that thought
a little bit further and said like why didn't the world that was imagined by some in what now
gets called the global south of commodity exporters becoming more powerful commodity
importers falling down the hierarchy so to speak I think a significant part of the answer
is because finance became much more central to the way in which that the the world economy
worked and the United States was able as you said to basically have world economy on the
debt side credit side run through dollar debt it was able to pay for
its own imports of oil in its own currency which was a luxury that that nobody else had
the British had it for a while and got them in a way like through the the 60s but in the 70s
they were into well until the North Sea oil started but they end up with a dollar buying
oil in dollar problem indeed just on that I mean the French in the 1980s described
the strength of the dollar after the Volcker shock as a third oil price shock
so that there's lots of things that privileged the United States still about that world that
emerges out the world economy that merges out of the 1970s now I think there's an absolutely no
doubt whatsoever that that some of the large oil importers obviously starting with China would
like nothing more than to be able to be done with the dollar when it comes to buying oil imports
and gas imports for that matter too I mean China has enough problems it's generated by its foreign
and oil gas dependency without having to deal with the need to pay for this in dollars on on on on
top of or else but I think it's not so clear yet that that's really a very attractive proposition
to the sellers and certainly where Saudi Arabia is concerned because Saudi Arabia became deeply
integrated itself into that dollar world the post 19 the post gold dollar world let's call it that
that emerged in the in in the 70s it's willingness to buy American debt and I think then what has
happened since 2008 really actually since 2007 since the first bit of the financial crash in
August of 2007 is in terms of dollar credit the position of the United States and the Federal
Reserve in particular they've become significantly more important since then than they even than
they were before and that China is much more vulnerable to the Fed's monetary decision making
to crisis of confidence in the euro dollar system than it than it was pre 2008 because it was less
involved in it so is is that I think now that the the euro dollar system and and and dollar
dollar debt is actually probably more important than ever in some respects at least
and whatever the incentives to get out of the system which are overwhelming from the point of
view of of China the actual ability to do so is the actual capacity to do that is is much harder
than it would seem I think so there might be a a desire to get off of the dollar as the world's
reserve currency and the way that countries have to buy oil but the mechanics of doing that I mean
the dollar has lots of problems but it's better than all the alternatives let me ask you if you look
go ahead no no go on well I this is kind of a meta question but what really underpins
the strength and ubiquity and confidence in the US dollar is it the productivity and the size of
the economy or that we're 90 plus percent energy independent or is it really the military and if
it's the military we're printing more dollars and going further into debt a trillion dollars every
couple months to pay for the military and everything else there's this like unraveling
there of of of how it was all put together what do you think about that I mean I I think that this
is a is a quite hard question to unpack all the different ways in which dollar strength works but
my instinct is that actually it's the way the international banking system works that's actually
the most important thing now about the dollar's position and I think you can see that in the
ways in which the United States has under the last few presidents pretty much like all of them being
able to use other countries companies access to the American backing system to basically make
various bits of foreign policy work so if you say like why would they able to bring the Europeans
in line on the sanctions against Iran both in terms of Obama's initial policy of getting around
to the negotiating table and then in terms of after Trump ended the Iran nuclear agreement
it's because it's just too difficult for anyone's companies to be shut out of the American
banking system now again the willingness to use that weapon
incentivizes resistance to it because who wants to be constrained by American foreign policy
if they cannot be but actually finding ways out I mean the European as I understand it anyway
the European countries tried quite hard to find ways of still being able to make financial
transactions with Iran after 2018 and found it really pretty much impossible to do so
so let's move to Russia and the Ukraine since we're doing a whirlwind tour of
international political economy so Russia's invasion in Ukraine despite the tragedy there
nicely timed for your book release had profound energy price and security implications for Europe
as well as other parts of the world so Putin my colleague Art Berman said on a podcast has a
degree in economics focused on energy and there are some people
believe it was this ghost written or plagiarized but still he seems to know a lot more about
energy than most of his western counterparts so how much of this Ukraine invasion in February of
22 was about energy versus just a territorial play and how did his earlier campaign and Crimea
fit into this strategy I think that you can't begin to understand relations between Russia and
post-independence Ukraine so going back to December of 1991 without making energy quite
central to that and a significant part of that is obviously the pipelines that ran through
Ukraine or run through Ukraine I should say both oil and gas right so from the point of view
of Russia the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of Ukraine was a complete
strategic disaster where energy was concerned because at that point in the 90s all its oil
and gas markets go westwards and the pipelines now go through an independent state with which
it's got historically extremely complicated and so then I think you can say is is that Putin
from relatively early from when he came into power kind of worked quite systematically
to try to change that on terms of European markets and that was really not just what the
Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were about but his moves to build more pipelines under
the Black Sea and he wanted to be able to weaken Ukraine by shutting it out of Russia's transit
system and indeed from his point of view eliminate the risk that Ukraine posed to the reliability
of Russia as an energy exporter I think if you then go to the Crimea crisis you can see that he
even with Yanukovych he was supposedly Russia friendly in office is Yanukovych had been making
deals with various of the western oil companies including for exploration under the further
exploration under the the Black Sea and by taking control of Crimea and proving Russia's position
in the Black Sea the direct control of Sevastopol there was a certain energy logic to that too
I think if you then go though to the events of February of 2022 and say is energy an explanation
of this move this is where I think it's a lot harder to say that there was an energy motive that
doesn't mean to say that there aren't resource energy resources that issue particularly
in the in the Donbas and that that was the area or part of the area anyway where there were some
prospects of Ukrainian shale though I should say you shale gas that is that by the time that even by
the time that the Crimea had happened the annexation of Crimea had happened it was already clear that
the shale in Poland which had been particularly hyped up as possibly the equivalent to the United
States turned out not to be like that the rocks didn't fracture like in the same way so it may be
that Ukrainian shale was always a dead end but you kind of brought that to an end by the moves
in 2014 but I struggled to see really an energy motive for what happened last year I think that's
much more about a basic rejection of Ukraine as an independent nation state and some concern
about the growth of NATO power around the Black Sea. Do you think Putin imagined or predicted or
believed that he would lose Europe as a gas market when he invaded Ukraine? I think this is hard
I think you can see that he tried to put some pressure on the European governments in the
latter months of 2021 so there was some reduced supply through various of the pipelines going on
often sort of presented as being for technical reasons but I think it's probably better seen as
kind of like warnings that I could I could do a lot inflict a lot more harm on you than this.
I think that the thing where you can say that he may have misread the signals quite a bit is actually
on Nord Stream 2 encouraged really by the Biden administration which would move the sanctions
on Nord Stream 2 about six months I think it was it was at a May or June of 2021 so from that point
of view I mean the Germans who've basically been fighting a rearguard action trying to defend Nord
Stream 2 ever since the annexation of Crimea sorry after the year after so 2015 when they made the
agreement to build Nord Stream 2 must have looked like well we've held on despite all that American
pressure we've been vindicated we've got our pipeline we won't be dependent on that unreliable
supply coming through Ukraine for very much longer and I can see that Putin could have thought
the Germans aren't going to give up on this just at the point when they've got what they've been
secured what they've invested spent a lot of political credibility on but I think he just
misjudged really quite profoundly how difficult it would be for a German government to legitimate
the energy relationship with Russia in the context of all our war against Ukraine I just think
that that was such a shock in Germany that for Germany to then carry on with the status quo now
in lots of ways I think they carried on with the status quo more than it seems but they had
rhetorically to repudiate that relationship and I think perhaps he didn't really understand that
how did Europe become so dependent on Russian oil and natural gas and given your
knowledge of history and the world wars in the 20th century based on oil and coal underpinning
the first industrial economies led by the UK and Germany is this going to be the beginning of a
phase of deindustrialization because of what's happening in Europe? I mean I think the answer
from Germany's point of view which I think is the crucial European country where this
Russian energy relationship is concerned that in the age of oil that Russia whether it was Russia
or whether it was the Soviet Union whether it's back to Russia again is the most obvious
oil relationship for Germany to have if you think of it as there being three big blocks
the Americas the Middle East and Russia just geography alone would align Germany in Russia's
direction and then if you think about it historically the periods of aberration
until what's happened in the last year were the period when Hitler went from the Nazi
Soviet pat to outright conquest and then the period between well the first 15 years or so
of the Cold War when West Germany wasn't buying oil from the Soviet Union so in one sense you
could put the question the other way around is like let's explain why those ones were the way that
they were if you look at it then in terms of post-war history so why did that period of the
early Cold War come to an end? The beginning of the answer for West Germany is the Suez crisis
because Adonauer the Conrad Adonauer the West German Chancellor at the time he was utterly
appalled by what Eisenhower did he went off to Paris to see the French Prime Minister guy
Mollet he was there I believe when Eden rang Mollet to tell him that they were going to have to
pull out and Adonauer said Europe will be your revenge
meaning the creation of the European Economic Community but in practical terms is they began
which had already been started by Italian oil company further discussions with the Soviet regime
about buying oil from the the the Soviet Union now the Americans put sufficient pressure on West
Germany to make that really difficult again use of extraterritorial, threat of extraterritorial
sanctions so actually West Germany was quite late of the European countries or put it this way it
wasn't the first of the European countries to either get Soviet oil or later to make gas
agreements but once the taboo in Cold War terms had been lifted which it really was by the Johnson
administration in the United States then I think West Germany went back to what is the more geographically
obvious thing for it to do which is to have an energy relationship with what was then the
Soviet Union the the big problem for Germany in the post Cold War world was really this
Ukraine issue in this sense Germany and Russia were in the same place about this because they
the Germans didn't want to be dependent for their energy supply on a Ukrainian
economically christian-ridden country for a lot of the time in the post-independence
period where at times of difficulty there was siphoning off of the gas coming through the
pipelines in terms of the conflicts about pricing between Russia and Ukraine and that Germany would
take an energy security hit for the nature of the Russia-Ukraine relationship far better logically
from its point of view to have a pipeline that went under the Baltic Sea or two pipelines that went
under the Baltic Sea and bypassed Russia so bypass Ukraine and allowed for direct Russian relationship
but but now that's ancient history so now they're dependent on Middle Eastern LNG and stuff from all
over the world but now the Middle East is in crisis too so that adds further risk to future
energy imports for Europe no completely I mean you you can see that this
this nightmare in terms of like which poison do you pick here continues you have three European
countries in the space of the last three months that have signed long-term 20-year plus 27-year
plus I think in each case LNG agreements with Qatar the Dutch the Italians and the French
and Qatar as we know is the at least as important sponsor in a way of Hamas as Iran
is and that would be if there is a if there's the equivalent of the
Arab oil embargo on the US and the Netherlands back in
19 October 73 to March 74 it would be Qatar embargoing the sale of
liquid natural gas to European countries including Britain with which it's had
long-term contracts for quite some time. Well if that were to happen I mean that would be
a cataclysmic event for the world economy and for Europe.
Yeah and this goes back to the question that you asked and I don't think I answered about the
prospects for deindustrialization essentially in Germany and I think that that is real I mean
maybe deindustrialization is you know too hyperverbally but we can see that the German
industrial economy benefited very much from cheap relatively cheap pipeline gas from Russia.
Take that away Germany has to import significantly more expensive liquid natural gas from a starting
place in which it had no liquid natural gas ports let alone any long-term liquid natural gas contracts
it had to be bought in the in the spot market you can see all kinds of industrial production
that was heavily gas dependent closed down during the course of last winter that's one of the reasons
why European countries got through last winter without more problems where gas supply was concerned
because there was you know demand and destruction in the industrial sector particularly in Germany
if you then were to have Qatar being willing to use a gas weapon against European countries
after they've already taken it from Russia because we should remember it wasn't European
countries that stopped buying pipeline gas from Nord Stream 1 it was Russia that effectively
embargoed the sale of that gas. Is Qatar politically and diplomatically friendly with Iran?
I mean I think that that's that's not an entirely straightforward relationship either
what is true is is that unlike the Arab other Arab states they have shared gas
interests with Iran though those two countries have massive amounts of natural gas yeah I mean
it's because they're basically it's like one big gas field with a okay a Qatar side and an Iranian
side to it. So where does the UK your country stand in all this your well past peak in your
domestic energy production but like the USA you're also a financial and a military hub
so is the multipolar world the United States the UK and then a few satellites that that need our
military and energy support or where does the UK stand in all of this? Well I think one of the
things that's really interesting if you look at long history and look for the patterns like over
time is Britain withdrew from east of Suez so it ended as I said earlier its imperial presence
a military presence in the Middle East in 1971 announced that in January of 1968 it did the
British navy did have some presence around the Persian Gulf by the end of the decade but nothing
like the scale of the Americans then we have the period from late 70s through the 80s into the
into the 90s of domestic oil production being quite high via the North Sea and then since I
think it's 2004 Britain's basically become a net energy importer again so we're quite some time now
we're nearly two decades into Britain being back to being a net energy importer and what you can see
in the 2010s under the David Cameron's government is that a reorientation back to the Middle East
you might even say that Britain has gone back east of Suez again 2015 announced there'd be
a new naval base in like Bahrain clearly cultivating relations with the United Arab Emirates which is
an important investor in the UK and I think that the finance is I think it was actually
another agreement with the United Arab Emirates just like a couple of weeks ago a new investment
agreement sort of tied to energy transition too but the Gulf that Britain's going back to where
it's been because it's gone back into the Middle East because it's still got that historical
relationship particularly with those with those smaller Gulf states because it's become much
more dependent back on that part of the world post North Sea oil so when I talk to you Helen
it's like a positive feedback dynamic that I don't have fewer questions I have more questions
let me ask you a couple really hard questions about the Middle East
so if Israel pursues the brass ring moment of evicting Palestinian populations from Gaza and
the West Bank possibly is it possible that Arab governments collectively will have to
respond to that and what would be the implications I think that Arab governments would have to like
respond to that but I think that that very fact and the fact that the Israelis need to find a way
of dealing with or they have to have some kind of plan for what happens in Gaza once the
ministry action is over I mean that they can't alienate Arab states like that and cause them
that kind of difficulty I mean I think in this respect we really need to like understand just
like what a colossal problem is well now faces after what has happened because the status quo
any version of the status quo of the the previous day before the 7th of October is completely gone
I mean they're basically under Netanyahu treated Hamas as a quasi partner even I would go as far as
saying for isolating the Gaza problem from Israel and then relying on the technology of the wall
and the iron dome to deal with any potential security threat from Hamas so let Hamas rule
Gaza let it be the case that because they're Hamas we can't engage with a question about a
Palestinian state we defend ourselves with technology and it's all come crashing like
down around them but when all said and done whatever they do militarily somebody's going to have to
take responsibility for Gaza for them because I cannot believe that they're going to go back in
there either and expel the entire population because the United States won't let them do that
or think that they can rule it directly themselves they need Arab help in order to do that some by
some means or another okay this is a crazy question to ask and I know you're not a religious scholar
a political scholar but how much do end time prophecies around various religious groups play
into this situation specifically Israel's claim to rebuild the third temple and Muslim and evangelical
Christians and Mormons saying that such event would trigger the return of Christ I've heard this
all pined in the recent week I mean I actually am interest very interested in religious questions
but I mean I I don't even know really begin to begin to know how to answer that question I mean all
I would say is this is that I think that one of the conceptual failures let's call it that
of the way in which the Israeli government under Netanyahu dealt with Hamas was an inability to see
its millenarian fundamentally millenarian tendencies and that millenarian what is that
meaning like the the end times okay yeah justify any kind of like destruction in order to bring
like the new world right about and I I think that they didn't understand that aspect they
turned a blind eye to that aspect of Hamas so how how are we let's let's bring it down to a fine
point here with everything going on China Russia the US debts Hamas Israel energy depletion we
haven't talked much about climate change but as geopolitical tension increases across these
different power nodes globally I think energy insecurity for a number of nations will increasingly
be politically very important do you think that this is going to push nations towards
green energy aspirations or in contrast to our resurgence of coal use or maybe we're going to
have to learn to cope with a lower energy lifestyle which we've seen some previews with
last year in in Europe what do you what do you think about all that I think that there's no doubt
you can see this clearly in Europe that energy insecurity driven by geopolitics
increase the desire to speed up the energy transition but nothing that happened in Europe
last year in that respect changed the difficulties facing the energy transition indeed you could
argue and I would argue that they increase the difficulties because they made the monetary
and financial environments in which it has to happen harder than was previously the case because
they intensified what were already the growing pressures on energy inflation so
you can try and speed things up but desires say isn't going isn't going to do that I find it hard to
see a world over the next five years let's say certainly five to ten years where there isn't
going to be a politics of reduced energy consumption I think the politicians in western countries will
try very very hard to avoid that they will keep looking for fixes that aren't really there to deal
with these problems to kick the can down the road some more but
there are just a whole set and I think we would agree about this of systemic energy
difficulties across the different energy sources they interact with each other in quite dysfunctional
ways and there is of some kind going to be some kind of reckoning with that I don't know I know
enough to understand that making predictions about when those dynamics are going to play themselves
out all the form in which they're going to take is very very difficult because there are so many
contingencies particularly actually on the on the on the geopolitical side that
can derail what seem to be passive development at any one time and it's a strange and this is
why I think it's hard to think about because on the one hand it is systemic but on the other hand
it is vulnerable to contingent events well it's been forestalled by debt writ large
around the world I want to be respectful of your evening well let me ask you a few more questions
you're an energy scholar and a historian given everything you just outlined for me
what would be a couple of unofficial pieces of advice you would have to the leaders on Downing
Street or in your country ahead of probably reduced energy use you said earlier the political
football of energy and using less in the UK is probably in not too distant future do you have
any thoughts or recommendations I mean the thing that frustrates me in terms of what I see in in
Britain and I wouldn't go any further than that in this respect is that I don't see much evidence
the politicians think about energy across the board yeah I think they have bits of energy policy
here and there some of it perhaps better thought out than others but I don't think that they see
the ways in which all these different problems interact with each other and all the way in
which that they interact with the monetary environment in a way I think they've got better
understanding the geopolitics perhaps in the last year to some extent anyway I think that
is it possible that they could could they be educated or is this systemic story that
you and I are painting almost like impossible for an elected official to integrate
I think this is a really interesting question because I think in the past the politicians
have actually understood this quite well in western countries so I think that energy blindness to
use your language now has got a history to it it's not just a like static conceptual failure
it's things happen at some point in let's say we're gonna this you know 80s 90s whenever
it is some I think understanding that was sort of passed generationally down at least top level
politicians and officials that say in civil servants like in Britain somewhere got lost that
is my I don't have a really worked out history of that but I have a strong sense that that general
picture that I just said there is true so in principle I can't see any reason why today's
politicians today's officials can't understand the kind of things in which we've been talking about
and quite the contrary I mean I just say look at myself you know 10 years ago when I started
I think so you know this is literally 10 2013 I couldn't be gone so I've had this conversation
that we've been having now for like the best part like of two hours most of this is like
self-education over a decade because I understood enough back in 2013 to think I really really
should try to understand this because I think it's going to shape the world in which we all
live for some time to come now I see no reason that I can educate myself to do that I take it
from your story you've done that at some point too that other people who in positions of power
can't do this as well well the differences they are playing whack-a-mole every day and they have
15 minute time spans but let me ask you this so you're an energy scholar and a teacher I was
a professor but only a teacher really how much time do you spend Helen every week reading
or listening to podcasts or educating yourself on the world or the world's history
I mean I try to yeah I try to spend quite a reasonable amount of time each week I'm also like
very busy as an academic I teach quite a lot I enjoy teaching quite a lot so some weeks that I
do better than others and sometimes like a few months will go by and then I'll see something
and think god I should have understood that like at least six weeks ago and I've missed something
like quite significant and then you dive into it to catch up and then I dive into it and try it yeah
and then so I learn a lot on the run to be honest I mean that's part of the nature of the world in
which we live me too so so like me you are an analyst that sees all this unfolding but we're
kind of observing it like we're watching a movie and we're explaining it but we're also living it
Helen so how do you personally cope with learning about the energy geopolitical financial crisis
that we're facing and then living and this is your life and our life that that we're a part of that
how do you compartmentalize or how do you manage that that's a good question I
there are times and to be honest it's usually like at night
when I just think this is this is a world of like such such danger it's quite terrifying
my day mind is generally a lot better at coping and that was because you're surrounded by bright
smiling curious young humans and nice buildings and lots of books and food and such night mind
yeah but I mean I'm a quite a fan of Lord of the Rings me too and I say to myself and I say
I say this to my niece sometimes that I like that bit when Gandalf's trying to explain to
Frodo why when Frodo says I wish it hadn't happened in my time and Gandalf says basically
so do I so there's everyone who gets to live in such a time but we don't get to choose when we
live we just get to choose what to do with our time we just get to choose what to do with our
time and I think that is probably kind of the way that I do try and live in this respect and
I find for myself I'm not saying this would be true for everybody that I find that trying to live
open-eyed and trying to cultivate inner resilience that that is better for me than living with denial
well I think that is true for many of us and many of the people listening to this podcast
and building on that do you have recommendations for those listening who agree with your overview
and synthesis and kind of foresight of how things might if you squint your your picture will hold
together in in coming decades do you have advice for listeners
I mean I'm always very cautious about advice I mean because I just kind of think
it's hard enough for me to like get to grips with advising myself
um I mean I think that you know the the the qualities that are needed for the times in
which we live well the the quality perhaps is resilience and that we have to cultivate that
in our cells and sometimes that is going to mean changing that I think particularly like
in western countries those of us who've been incredibly privileged in so many
ways certainly those of us who live absolute lives in western countries because obviously
there are people who don't the more that we can understand I think the the economic and the
geopolitical contingency of the material lives that we have then the easier it is psychologically
to to deal with to deal with what is coming and that I think it though when it goes back
I think it doesn't matter how we choose to how we choose to live in these times I don't think
there's any reason to say that because it's hard and there's so many difficulties and
dangers ahead that that doesn't mean that we can't live our lives well
and you're a teacher and I don't know how much in those two classes you're currently teaching you
get to the depth of what the conversation we just had um but clearly your students are aware
of what's going on in the Middle East and Russia um and Ukraine so what do you what advice do you
give your students um at the end of the semester and and what advice would you give to young humans
listening to this episode I mean I don't tend to like advise um the students I have in the way
the Cambridge system like works I have about 25 students who I have a very direct responsibility
for like beyond um teaching um very interested in their lives and I try to engage with them
about that I have a strong sense that it really matters what is passed from like one generation
to the next I'm very conscious of what my inheritances have been in that um respect and I'm
interested I suppose as much in trying to give something back to them in a way in which I think
something was like given to me and that they then might like pass on um to I mean I do think I probably
encourage them to to try to historicize the moment and to try to uh understand that um
um human beings have they've lived through some much harder times than even the ones that we're
getting far harder and that they've survived and that the human spirit has like survived through
that I mean I think about Europe through the the black death uh century uh and that there are all
kinds of good things in the future we may well not live to see in this um respect but it's never
if you look at human history just a story of permanent disaster from which that there is
no escape and I'm not saying that because I want to minimize any of the catastrophes in the first
part of the 20th century which quite quite um the contrary um but we don't have to where our own
lives are concerned I don't think we don't have to be fatalistic yep I agree let me ask you this
it's my belief um that there's around 240 million college students in the world and I think humans
in grad school particularly and postdocs are an incredible and underutilized natural resource
um that we can have help tackling the systemic overview that that you and I have discussed
but within the current academy which is kind of part of the energy hungry superorganism and
linear and business as usual I don't think the creativity is being directed towards its best
use so in your field um political economy political science uh energy with an energy lens
can you offer a few big questions that uh postdocs uh and such around the world listening to this
program could be working on that need uh research and answers but might not be what's conventionally
chosen I mean I think there's one here I really would pick and uh for political economy and that
is the relationship between monetary history and energy history okay I mean I spent some time in
um in disorder trying to think about that in relationship to the end of dollar gold convertibility
and in relation to the 2008 crash but the nature of the book meant that I was just scratching like
at the surface I actually had an idea of trying to do something more systematically about uh
this myself including trying to think out about the relationship between the the 1929 crash the end
of the the gold standard the interwar gold standard and changes in the energy world particularly the
return of the Soviet Union as a as an oil um export and I think there's there may be something
in that but I think that that gets as well at a question that I think that is
really important beyond political economy in some ways it goes to the heart of like
the way in which economics is done academically which is this presumption that actually we understand
the economic world via a monetary lens rather than via an energy lens and I think that once you
bring the energy lens into political economy a lot of things start to look quite um different and so
I think um a project which looked at the relationship between monetary history and energy history
through the entirety of the 20th century and maybe even go back to the origins of the of the gold
standard in the in the in the 1870s would be very um would be very revealing and would have some
significance beyond just the actual history in terms of trying to bring a more well trying to
you know move the dial away from a monetary focus to an energy focus and understanding the economic
world okay thank you a couple closing questions Helen what do you care most about in the world
uh that's that is um that is a very non-academic question yeah because it presumes a quite high
level of self-awareness that one really knows what one does um care um about uh I mean in a
personal sense I I'm I'm passionate about the pursuit of knowledge that's I'm very intellectually
curious that drives quite a lot of um of what I do um I'm also um very interested in um
cultural and spiritual questions I don't think of this uh in terms of being focused on political
economy I don't think of that as being odds with a more spiritual way of thinking about
the world I'd rather try and think both materially and um spiritually I mean beyond myself I'd go
back in a way to the answer that I gave you know like earlier I mean I care very deeply about what
is passed between the generations I feel very that inwardly quite strongly uh in terms of my own
personal history but in tools also the fact that you know I've been working in a university
as an educator for nearly three decades um now and that I find that it's very uh well it's just
rewarding to I was going to say emotionally but that's not actually sufficient it's rewarding
to me as a human being to do that and it's very important to me that I continue to do that
I fully agree uh I feel the same way and that is uh why I continue to do this podcast because I
think education is the single no regret strategy given what we face um to to uh pass the baton
to the next generation as you say um if you uh and you I know you listen to my podcast so you
know what question I'm about to ask if you had a magic wand and there was no personal recourse
to your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures
I mean I thought about this quite hard and in one sense the easy answer I think given
we're talking about energy would be to say the success of fusion so something that would
that that would basically mean the human beings didn't have to think about energy in the same
way that they could take it like for for granted but they might start to think about that I thought
well actually nobody's got any idea what it would mean to be a human being after conditions in which
energy could just be like taken for granted maybe that just because for a couple of centuries
certainly that energy is being fossil fuel energy drove such conflict between states that if we had
an abundant energy didn't have to think about it maybe we would just do other find other ways
of doing bad things because we wouldn't be constrained by energy so I kind of a little
bit more would go with the uh making us all changing or having higher levels of self-awareness
a consciousness thing rather than the materials thing uh more aware of our own um shared humanity
more aware less selfish um consciousness more aware of our relationship to the uh to to the
to the planet and I don't think obviously that's a fix in um any sense um whatsoever um
but I think that the world would be would be a better place
that's a good wish um to be continued my friend thank you for your scholarship and
your teaching and we'll be in touch thank you thanks very much night if you enjoyed or learned
