You're listening to The Great Simplification.
I'm Nate Hagins.
On this show, we describe how energy, the economy, the environment, and human behavior
all fit together and what it might mean for our future.
By sharing insights from global thinkers, we hope to inform and inspire more humans to
play emergent roles in the coming Great Simplification.
I'd like to welcome climate scientist Leon Simons to the program.
Leon most recently was a co-author of James Hansen et al's paper Global Warming in the
Pipeline.
Leon is also a board member of the Dutch chapter of Club of Rome.
Most specifically, what we're going to talk about today is Leon's contribution to this
paper, which is breaking out the emissions and the aerosol contribution from human activities.
Aerosols and emissions have been going up in tandem, but the aerosols are masking the
expected warming from the thermal impact of a higher energy imbalance.
Global ships now have new regulations to reduce the sulfur particulate emissions.
When that happened, in the global shipping routes measured by satellites, the ocean temperatures
went up.
They were absorbing more heat because there was less aerosol masking.
This is a difficult conversation because the implications are that we're about to have
more warming in the pipeline than expected, and also because Leon is a scientist and had
scientific answers, which were quite dense, and yet it's a very important hypothesis to
put out there on how human particulate aerosols have been masking the warming so far.
Please welcome Leon Simons.
Leon Simons, koo de midak.
Koo de midak.
How are you today?
I'm good.
How are you doing?
I'm good.
I am nervous for this conversation.
Nothing you say will change what's happening in the world, the physical climate world,
but what you say may act as a bunker buster to my prior assumptions of my own analysis
of the future.
I'm nervous because I expect I know the things that you're going to say because I've watched
and read some of your materials.
Let me preface this conversation by saying this.
You are a climate scientist, but you're also a human that cares about our future, and you're
also a human that's living during this time.
You, like many of us, wear three different hats.
Part of our problem is that a lot of people merge the science and the response on various
things, and it ends up being muddled.
I'm going to break this interview into three pieces, and the first piece I want you to wear
your scientist at.
Then you can speculate in the second piece about the future and responses, and then finally
I'll ask you some personal questions.
We have a lot to unpack.
Can you start out with your broad expertise, your particular specialty in climate research
and maybe a couple-minute umbrella of your main thesis?
Yes.
My expertise originates from first traveling the world and trying to understand our impact
on the world, which I did after high school when I was 19 years old.
I traveled the world because I knew things were changing rapidly, and I wanted to understand
them.
Then I started studying.
I wanted to change the world for the better by studying tropical forestry.
What I've seen in developing countries where about three billion people still use biomass
for cooking, and I saw that this can cause rapid deforestation and change the place where
people live and destroy the environment.
Then I decided to drop out of school and to start my social business focusing on developing
clean energy technologies, especially around cooking for Ethiopia.
In the meantime, I've always kept up to date with the science.
I got involved with a think tank called Club of Rome in the Netherlands, and then through
that I kept always working on doing research both on the science, but also visiting climate
conferences and trying to understand the changes that are happening.
While doing that, I learned that the biggest uncertainty in climate science is the effect
of small dust particles, both natural like sea salt or desert dust, but also anthropogenic,
so human-caused dust.
These are called aerosols, and they change how much sunlight is reflected by the planet
by directly reflecting sunlight, but they also interact with water vapor in the atmosphere.
There's water vapor condensers to these aerosols and then clouds form, and without these particles
there wouldn't be any clouds, so I learned that this is a crucial aspect within climate
science and also the biggest uncertainty because it's so uncertain how clouds respond to these
particles.
But then you see that in the communication and in the about science, it's very rarely
this aspect is being discussed, and yeah, I think we'll get to that, but I think that's
I started looking into that, and then I found that in 2019 I learned that in 2020 there will
be this very big policy change over the oceans of reducing sulfur in the fuels, and that that
would change how much sulfur was being emitted, and sulfur is a very important aspect of sulfate
particles, which are the strongest cooling agents of our climate, and I got into touch
with James Hansen and I explained to him what was happening, first he was skeptical about
it.
He explained the science and the policy and how this is implemented, and then he asked
me to do the research with him on that, and that's how I got more involved into the science,
and I started spending more time on it.
So and that led to you being a co-author of the recent paper Hansen at All Global Warming
in the Pipeline, which I've read and is terrifying to say the least.
Could you give just an overview of the main thrust of that paper, and then we're going
to unpack the aerosol component?
Yeah, sure.
It's a very big paper and it brings together many different fields within the science,
and the co-authors represent different fields which come together.
So there's, for example, Norman Loeb is a scientist from NASA, he adds the series team
which provides satellite data, which we use in the paper, but the paper also looks at
the paleoclimate, for example.
So all these different parts of the climate system, the different sciences to understand
all these different parts come together and they strengthen the findings from one part
of the paper to the other.
So what we learned, for example, from paleoclimate data, that it was much with a less strong
climate forcing, the effect on climate was stronger than was previously thought.
That's what we learned from the climate data from millions of years ago.
But then also if you look at thousands of years ago, for example, after the last glacial
maximum, so the ice age, so to say, how fast the planet warmed and how long it stayed warm,
and what caused that, of course, we can learn from air bubbles captured in the ice sheets
and to see what the greenhouse gas concentrations are.
And then if we look at how the climate changed over time, some models don't understand what's
happening.
For example, the models look at the greenhouse gas, they take into account the greenhouse
gas concentration of the past, say, 6,000 years, and the climate should be warming.
Instead, there has been a slight cooling if you look at the climate proxy.
So some other scientists analyzed the climate of the past 6,000 years from tree rings, etc.
And then they noticed a slight cooling, especially over the northern hemisphere.
What we looked at is, for example, the aerosols, so these particles I talked about, might have
been cooling the planet while these greenhouse gas have been causing warming of the planet.
And then these two effects, these two forcings, they interact, and then there's a net, has
been a net, more or less, stable or a bit cooling climate, while these greenhouse gasses
kept increasing.
And those increasing greenhouse gasses from Rudiman et al. that research shows that it
might be or could likely be because humans spread across the planet and started de-forcing
the world, and they started producing rice, which creates methane, and this deforestation
of course results in CO2 entering the atmosphere, and these effects, of course, increase the
greenhouse gas concentration, especially if you compare it to other interglacial, other
warm periods after a glacial and after an ice age.
So we would expect it now, if you look at just as the greenhouse gas constraints, you
should expect it to the planet to warm up until the pre-industrial times, but now we
see that the planet, so the proxy show that the planet has been cooling down instead.
And then of course, industrial revolution happened, and then there was a big increase
in greenhouse gas emissions, but also an increase in aerosols.
And so the implications of the Hansen paper and the conclusions and implications?
Yeah, well the show with the paper led by James Hansen is that the rate of warming is
already increasing, so the planet is now warming faster than it was in the recent decades.
We show that the resatellite data mainly, that the rate of planetary heat uptake is
rapidly increasing, and that is mainly caused by the planet absorbing more sunlight.
And that's not because the sun is starting to shine brighter, but that's because there's
less light being reflected, and that's because there's less clouds, there's less aerosols,
and there's less ice and snow reflecting the sunlight.
And the cloud effect includes the effect of these aerosols, but there's of course uncertainty
by how much.
And that's what this data helps us, this is the greatest uncertainty in climate science,
this data helps us, and the data from what we call an inadvertent aerosol experiment
of rapidly reducing the sulfur emissions, this helps us to reduce the uncertainties within
the climate science.
And then while we're reducing these uncertainties, it shows, together with all the other data
I already talked about, it shows that the warming from greenhouse gases is stronger, very likely
stronger than we thought before, because aerosols cooled more and the glacial periods were cooler
than we thought.
That means that the change from greenhouse gas constraints is also stronger, the forcing
effect is stronger.
So the greenhouse gas will warm more if the aerosols cooled more.
And then that means that we can expect maybe a few degrees, it's like what you call a
gedankan experiment, so more a thought experiment, what would happen if the greenhouse gas would
stabilize at the current rate.
Of course that's not what's happening at the moment, the greenhouse gas are rapidly increasing
and the aerosols are rapidly decreasing, but we look at what would happen if hypothetically
the greenhouse gas concentration would stabilize, and with and without aerosols, then we could
have four to five degrees warming by the end of the century.
And then further in the future, that's of course very hypothetical because greenhouse
gas concentrations will not stay at this very rate indefinitely, but then we could see eight
to ten degrees Celsius of warming.
But that means that if all the ice sheets around the planet would melt and one thing
to take into account there is that also the sun is shining brighter and brighter over
millions of years.
So after about 50, 60 million years, the sun is shining about one and a half watts more
brighter over time.
So the greenhouse gas concentration of 50 million years ago is only part of the story
compared to today.
Yeah, I didn't think about that.
So the PETM mass extinction due to volcanic activity that took thousands and thousands
of years, that happened when the sun was less bright.
So if we have the same CO2 in the atmosphere from our Volkswagen's and Volvo's instead
of Volcano's, that's going to be meeting a brighter sun as well.
So higher sensitivity could be presumed.
Yeah, you have to take that into account indeed.
So this is horrible news because there's two phenomenon and we've been focused on one.
Let me unpack what you've just said and throw it back with some questions.
So humans burn stuff and the resulting CO2 and methane act as a thermal blanket on the
planet absorbing more infrared heat and ultimately heating the earth because there's a higher
energy imbalance.
So we've recognized that and we're focused on that and we're worried about that.
Some people who don't believe in climate change point out things like the little ice age or
why isn't the climate warming because you have all this CO2, there's not at the correlation
that you thought and there's stories like that out there.
But what you're saying is there were two phenomenon, two things that humans were doing in addition
to the sun and other natural things that were offsetting forcings, the CO2 but then the aerosols
that were created long, long ago, you mentioned up to 6,000 years ago from burning of forests
or riding horses and kicking up dust and anything that humans do and that that particulate
matter heightened the reflectivity of clouds and reflected more of the incoming sunlight
back into space so that we didn't warm the planet as much as the CO2 science would have
predicted.
Is that correct?
Yeah.
What you started off saying is that this is not taken into account the aerosol but it
is.
So for recent climate, the changes since the Industrial Revolution, since let's say 1750,
there is the IPCC for example, especially the part of the IPCC report, it's a very big
report for the most recent one for example.
It's split up in three parts and then there's a synthesis report but the first part, aerosols
are an important part of that because otherwise without these aerosols you cannot understand
the changes that are happening as you already just described.
But of course the scientists who are trying to understand, they do take this into account
and I can show that effect with one of my slides, for example, there's this slide showing
the main drivers of global warming and that's from the IPCC assessment report from the summary
of policy makers and I've taken out the two main drivers and if you see it on the left
it says total human influence and that's up to about 2019 and it shows about 1.1 degrees
Celsius of warming globally since the Industrial Revolution, so since 1750 I think this is
1850.
Okay.
And then there's one bar which shows that there's about one left degree warming from
well-mixed greenhouse gases and then one might think okay why didn't it want 1.5 degrees
Celsius yet and that's the main cause of that is the emissions of sulfur, sulfur dioxide
which cooled the planet by about half a degree and by the way there's a very large uncertainty
so this IPCC estimate saying that there's a half a degree cooling from sulfur but with
an uncertainty range of about 0.2 to 0.9 degrees and that's sulfur cooling to date so that
doesn't take into account the present energy imbalance so if all these concentrations
of greenhouse gas and sulfur emissions and all the other particles would stay the same
they would still be warming because there's still an imbalance there's an energy imbalance
so there's still more energy coming in than going out so until there's a balance then
there will be no more additional warming there's still more heat radiation going out
and sunlight being absorbed there's no balance.
So the IPCC does include aerosols in their math but you think that the cooling effect
the dampening effect of what we would have seen as warming is larger than the IPCC core
models.
So before we started this research we didn't think anything really we just thought okay
this uncertainty which IPCC shows in their graphs and in their text this uncertainty
is so large it's a lot especially with the interaction of particles these aerosol particles
in clouds it's the largest uncertainty within climate science so it's important to reduce
this uncertainty to understand how our climate will change and this natural experiment which
I'll talk about of rapidly decreasing the sulfur emissions over the oceans by 80% that
provides climate science with an experiment a natural like we called inadvertent experiment
to reduce this uncertainty and to understand what the real warming effect of greenhouse
gases is.
And how fast do you see a response if you stopped aerosols how fast is the cooling
masking disappear and we see warming?
Yeah so the effect we see are a direct effect so you would expect for some of these particles
these particles stay in the atmosphere for four days to weeks so when they rain they
rain out because it's solid and liquid particles compared to greenhouse gases the name says
it's which are gases which stay in the atmosphere until they react with other gases but then
the aerosols they rain out as I mentioned they cause cloud formation and they interact
with clouds and they rain to the ground and then they are out of the atmosphere and their
effect is gone.
But then how long does it take so we expected this to cause a forcing change so this cooling
effect of these particles to reduce right away but then it takes time of course for
the system to respond so if you take these particles out of the atmosphere the sun will
shine instead of it will reflect it and it will be absorbed by the oceans and then but
of course it takes a long time for the oceans to heat up because it's a very large mass
of water with a high thermal capacity so it takes a lot of heat to heat up and when it
heats up of course it also influences the climate as well because if it's warmer there's
also a change in clouds because there's less cloud condensation and clouds evaporate faster
so all these feedbacks these are feedbacks which also take time to come into effect there's
more evaporation so there's more water vapor in the atmosphere which also causes warming
but also if the plant heats up there's more thermal radiation so that reduces the warming
so all these different aspects should be taken into account and now we are learning after
now we have about three almost four years of data of what happens when you reduce the
aerosol emission or the the sulfur emissions over the oceans by about 80% and that's the
data is becoming in of course we've only had mainly at three years of La Niña another
aspect is a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation which our co-author Norman Loeb wrote a paper
about where he says okay if this Pacific Decadal Oscillation will be negative we expect the
Earth's annuals to decrease but it has been increasing instead so that's also a worrying
sign that this effect might be even stronger so you could I want you to unpack what happened
with the sulfur emissions but let me just ask a question on what you just stated this kind of
is a testable hypothesis because if we don't have the sulfur emissions from shipping the way
we used to so that we have less particulate matter and the dampening forcing is is less
and we shift into a El Niño we can predict right with high confidence that we're about to
have another spike in temperatures like in the next six months as we move into El Niño
yeah so that's what we also show in our paper and in other communication that we expect this
El Niño because we now have entered an El Niño and we are now starting what we've seen this year
is in part an El Niño but more even just the end of La Niña so La Niña El Niño is a cycle in
the in the Pacific Ocean where the equatorial Pacific sorry surface to surface temperatures
increase and they result in during El Niño it increase and it results in net global higher
temperatures and during a La Niña the sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific are lower
and that translates so generally to lower global surface air temperatures so we have had three years
of La Niña and three years of lower emissions too I mean not not carbon emissions uh sulfur
lower sulfur emissions indeed but also higher greenhouse gas concentration increase especially
with methane nitrous oxide so there's there's a force many things happening that's the problem
with all this isn't it it's this giant ten dimensional jigsaw puzzle that people focus on one
piece of it yeah then that's just climate and then there's economy and geopolitics and money and
energy and I mean the the whole thing is our species can't figure it out so you also have these
environmental regulations which and health regulations which I'm now talking about with
from the shipping but we do know where the ships are going so if you look at again at this this
graph I was showing on slide three I think slide three yeah so where you see the main drives of
global warming on the left and as she on the right you see the sulfur dioxide from the anthropogenic
and sulfur dioxide emissions and there you see that these emissions over the oceans over the northern
hemisphere especially of the north atlantic and north Pacific oceans are very high so that's the
yellow the the yellows and orange swaths over the ocean yes between the the land masses of Europe
and and and north and what are what are the red that's overland like the dark red is overland
which is mainly uh coal fire power plants mainly coal fire power plants large sulfur sources and
then the kind of yellow straight lines that go into the southern hemisphere those are the shipping
routes presumably yeah so the ship routes especially around Africa you can see that there's
the shipping routes going around Africa and of course through the Suez Canal through the
Mediterranean there's there's high ship traffic as well and so how did you use this data to test
your hypothesis so let me show a different this from the next slide we have this in our paper
it's from yinadal who's also a co-author of our paper this shows coastal sulfate so sulfur dioxide
from sulfates in the atmosphere the left map shows sulfate in the atmosphere uh parpetrallium
volume and then that and then do you see that of course there's a lot of sulfur again over the
northern hemisphere because that's where seven of the eight billion people live but there's also
natural sources but then on the right map shows the sulfates from shipping as a percentage of the
total exactly yeah thank you so there's uh indeed the the sulfate of shipping as a percentage of total
natural human anthropogenic sulfates so in the north pacific it's like 80 or 90 percent yeah over
the north pacific and over the the north atlantic 70 to 80 or 90 percent even at places and that's
because there's very little algae so natural source of sulfur in the atmosphere is from algae
but algae need nutrients so without these nutrients there's little algae so but over the
the vast oceans there's not so much nutrients and then so if there's no nutrients there's no
natural source of sulfur and then the effect of this sulfur from ships is much stronger because it
doesn't have to compensate with other sources of sulfur of of aerosols also other like natural
aerosols god i mean this could be a five hour conversation i know your family's coming so it
can't be but i'm gonna ask a couple of naive questions earlier in the conversation you said
that if they if there wasn't aerosols like sulfur there would be no clouds yeah but we had clouds
millions of years ago so is that from the sulfates and aerosols from algae and phytoplankton and
other natural sources yeah so natural sources of aerosols also create clouds of course so there's
sea salt there's algae producing sulfur through demethyl sulfide and then other like there's
all chemistry there which we are that's what the science is still learning about how it works are
there more clouds today can you speculate or do we know then there was 10 000 years ago because of
all the particulates that humans have kicked up and burnt up yeah 10 000 years ago it's of course
you also have to take into account the different temperatures and but of course we don't know for
sure what but you know that if you increase the amount of particles you increase how much
condensation nuclei there are so there's there's more particles for the water vapor to condense
and also especially there's some things to consider as well that some particles they are better for
ice clouds or ice crystal formation so there's more ice crystals forming around sulfate particles
than around sea salt particles which you can understand because especially in the Netherlands if
there's if we put on the road we put sea salt we put salt to keep the roads from freezing so
that's an example of sea salt reduces freezing but then the sulfate doesn't do that and that
four causes more crystals in clouds and cause whiter clouds and you can see so if you know clouds
you know that white clouds often are ice clouds and dark clouds or more water clouds also these
rain out faster if you see a dark cloud you know okay often you know there's rain coming right so
these are all the things to consider to give the aerosols overall cause clouds to be bigger brighter
and longer lasting overall and there's again there's a lot of uncertainty there with these this
inadvertent experiment to help to reduce right the inadvertent experiment of stopping or regulating
how much sulfur emissions in our global ships from our global ships yeah i'm going to get to that
in a second but let me ask you one more naive question there's lots of people from different
stripes and backgrounds watching this show you just mentioned on these graphs that the aerosols
are parts per trillion one two five the the real bright highly concentrated are 10 parts per trillion
is that correct yeah i'm a scientist and it's even hard for me to conceptualize that the difference
between two parts and five parts per trillion can actually significantly change that both the
clouds and the dampening effect and the albedo yeah and it's a similar thing that three four or five
parts per 10 000 on climate that can change the thermal imbalance on earth yeah talk to me like
i'm in a sixth grader if you see clouds that's about the same or of magnitude in particles
there's very little water condensate the water inside the cloud it's also in the in the parts
per trillion uh volume level oh that's helpful so when i see a cloud it's not like 50 of the mass
of the sky visually it is but the the actual condensation and particulate is in the parts per
trillion the rest is just air molecules yeah yeah so there's or water vapor of course so there's
gases gas water vapor is also gas so there's that also explode because you can see a cloud of course
but co2 is in the parts per million right so that you can see clouds when the concentration of
water inside a certain volume within a cloud is much less than the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the air but you can see a cloud you cannot see gases you cannot see greenhouse gas but if
you would be able to see greenhouse gas if you could see in the wavelengths greenhouse gas absorb
infrared radiation it would be black the sky would be black because it has much more particles
in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than there's water inside the cloud so let's get to this
inadvertent experiment so what happened a massive reduction in sulfur in global shipping can you
explain slide five yeah there's these emissions called sulfur emissions which are harmful for health
for for the environment for example i'm from a nice town called seto gombos in the south of
nalans which is beautiful cathedral and these statues on the cathedral they they were dissolving
because of acid rain and that was mainly because of the sulfur emissions from our coal plants
so in the 1980s there was sulfur regulation decrease to reduce the emissions from from coal
plants but over the oceans this regulation took a long time to come into effect around north america
and around around europe especially north sea these regulations have come into effect in the past
decades and have become tighter and tighter and especially in 2015 the maximum amount of sulfur
in fuels was reduced over these areas was reduced from one percent to zero point one percent so
reducing the amount of with ninety percent but globally there was still a lot of sulfur being
emitted but then in 2020 on january first 2020 the regulation which called imo 2020 came into effect
regulating how much sulfur is allowed to be used over open seas by ships and this decrease from
maximum of three point five percent to zero point five percent as the craft showed there's a big
decrease all of a sudden a sudden decrease in how much sulfur the ships are allowed to carry
unless they use what we call scrubbers which wash the sulfur from the exhaust gases so that started
in 2020 over these reasons so here you can see the next slide shows since 1900s to today how much
sulfur dioxide in thousands of tons shipping internationally globally was emitting every
year and that nose dived again in 2020 because of these regulations how much of that international
shipping sulfur is is that of all of the sulfur from humans a good percentage so from the total
amount of sulfur emitted globally the shipping is about 10 percent or was about at uh before 2020
it was about at 10 percent and that might seem like not so much but as i showed you the fact is much
stronger if it's emitted directly over the oceans because there's no other sources these ships are
they're all by themselves there's very little algae there's no coal plants there they are the only
source there so if you want to understand this effect you have to take that into account so
while the sulfur dioxide emissions from shipping have been plummeting the sulfur dioxide from
coal plants in china and everyone around the world are continuing over china has also been
decreasing its sulfur emissions very rapidly in the past two decades especially since the olympics
also through the installation of these desulfurization systems so all these new coal plants they have
the uh a system which uses chalk to wash the sulfur from the exhausts from the coal plants
and then the the product is gypsum and the gypsum is sold on the market and then through that it's
also relatively a cost-effective way to reduce these emissions but what i was getting at is if
we had a steep drop in sulfur from shipping that still is only the rest of the world is still
producing a lot of warming masking sulfates yeah so this is the real Faustian bargain we have to
presume that civilization continues and as soon as it stops as soon as the musical chairs game
stops and sulfates stop we have an immediate spike in temperatures coming our way yeah but
that's already what we're starting to see now even with just this little stop we're seeing that yeah
but it's not a little stop i think that's really important to understand because i think that's
there's a lot has been a lot of confusion around that on a very understandably of course because
it's not easy it's not easy to understand it's 10 percent and you think okay it's only 10 percent
but it's 10 percent over the oceans and the oceans are 70 percent of the earth's surface is oceans
but 90 percent of the global heat uptake is is by the oceans so the oceans 90 percent of the
heat from global warming so global warming is mainly ocean warming and then the oceans if you
reduce the forcing so that if you reduce the aerosols over the oceans with 80 percent the effect
is expected to be much stronger than if you would do the same over land because the oceans are dark
they have dark surface because there's no other aerosols to compete with and and because there's
more clouds over the ocean so that these regions are much more and because they take up much of the
heat and if the sun is shining on the oceans it's not just heating the first centimeter or the first
layer of the of the surface like when the sun is shining on the land land absorbs the the surface
the first centimeter of the land absorbs the heat from the sun and it radiates back as heat to space but
if the sun is shining on the water the water the the radiation of the sun it enters the water into
a depth of about 40 meters some of the radiation even deeper so that's also important to understand
that this all contributes to the effect of changes of aerosols over the oceans to be much
stronger than if you would do a globally average reduction of this effect so how about the next
slide which i see as slide number seven so what we did to try and understand what's really happening
because there's just models now before this inadvertent experiment there were just models
to try and understand what's happening but without data the models have of course limited
value and that was clear by the big uncertainty between models so some say that would be much
of an effect some say that would be a very strong effect about equal to 10 years of greenhouse gas
emissions but we don't know we didn't know and we still don't fully know what the real real real
real world effect will be and is and for that we need to we we now have the experiment in the
real world where we change this we're still taking shape of course and what we did was we looked at
these northern north pacific ocean and the north atlantic ocean to see how much additional sunlight
is being absorbed because there's less sunlight being reflected by these particles by less clouds
reflecting sunlight back to space that means there's more sunlight being absorbed and we compared this
to the region of the southern hemisphere with the same latitudes where there's no shipping or much
less shipping so there's also less of a forcing change and then we see if you see the the purple
and the red line of course there's variability there's this effect on the pacific decadal
escalation which i mentioned which around 2016 increased how much sunlight was being absorbed
because the oceans were warmer and there was less clouds formation but now pdo is negative so that we
would expect the red line to go much lower but it has been increasing very rapidly and it's likely
that this is because of this change in aerosols in in sulfate aerosols and the same over north
atlantic after 2020 we see a big spike a big increase in how much sunlight is being absorbed
and then over the southern hemisphere we don't see this happening so the difference on this chart
between the red line and the black line the red line representing the north pacific and the black
line the southern oceans is around three watts per meter squared three watts per meter squared is
like rcp 8.5 is eight and a half watts per meter squared i mean it's a big deal three watts per meter
squared yeah so the total greenhouse gas forcing so how much heat more or less the all the greenhouse
gas humans have put in the into the atmosphere since 1970 uh so the co2 but there's also methane
and nitrogen oxide and but also stratospheric water vapor and ozone so all these the combined
effects is about four watts per square meter okay and but it is indeed and if you have then now
a three watts per square meter increase over the north atlantic and north pacific oceans
which are areas of 40 to 50 million square kilometers above that's really an enormous
increase in how much heat these oceans are absorbing and i i can show you that of course we
expect that to increase the the ocean temperatures and in the end i can i can show you what we're
starting to see now with that regards okay so this graph with the uh the showing the ocean
absorbed solar radiation did you make that graph was that your data and discovery
yeah so this is what we presented in the global warming in the pipeline paper so when you when
you found this were you like holy shit when you found this was this like the smoking gun of
fitting together a lot of explanations that had previously been lacking yeah so again we
didn't know what would happen we didn't know if we would see what we would be seeing we just
that's what hypothesis was that it's from the from the climate research models looking at this in
the past was that there will be a decrease in how much sunlight is reflected and increase in
absorbed solar radiation but very high uncertainty in how big this effect is and now we see indeed
this spike happening we are now starting to see it and this is the 48 month running mean if you
look at it from the past years it's even higher so you see that so you see that by the at the end
of the graph it starts increasing more even it's still spiking so that's really indeed this yeah
you say holy shit i think that's the quite a appropriate way to put it because that's really
a lot of this implies that the cooling effect of these aerosols was much stronger and the
warming effect of greenhouse gases is also much stronger than previously thought or mode or the
best estimate let's say the best estimates of the ipc or of a lot of climate research
underestimates this effect and of course it's it's it's in the range because i showed it's it's
until now it seems to be more or less in the range but what what worries me because i'm
i'm still not certain that this is the end of it right i'm not certain that this is
this how bad it really is because the oceans are still quite cold relatively two other years
because of we had three years of la niña and this negative pdo i mentioned so now we are starting
to see what happens with rennell ninho and that's what we see is worrying because it's it's it's
that's what i mentioned is this spike still going up and probably still don't know what will happen
when the when the pacific decay loss glacial is another large cycle which takes longer to
variate that we don't know what will happen then and it might the hypothesis from nasa and nova
together is that it will increase even further so that's really worrying well i mean it's beyond
worrying yeah much scientific assessment is that it's worrying okay could you walk through the next
two graphs please uh earth's energy imbalance so here we're looking at the yellow is the absorbed
solar radiation and the red is the outgoing long wave radiation over the last 20 years or so can you
explain what this means yes so this is the global average incoming i sort of absorbed sunlight so
there's about 340 watts of sunlight coming in and about 29 or 30 to 29 percent of that sunlight is
being reflected back to space and then about 240 watts per square meter was absorbed by the planet
23 years ago okay as the graph shows this has increased by two watts per square meter so the
earth is absorbing two watts per square meter more heat than it was 23 years ago
and then that has been balanced a bit only a little bit by an increase in outgoing long
wave radiation and you might think okay why is there more heat going out while the greenhouse
gas concentration is increasing that's because the temperature has been increasing without
increasing greenhouse gas emissions there will be about four watts per square meter more heat
going out at the current temperatures than we see on this graph so it will be off the chart and
there will be more heat being radiated to space than there's being absorbed from the sun but now
we see so there's more heat being absorbed than there's being radiated to space and that's you see
the yellow part is growing bigger that means that there's more heat is absorbed faster so the rate
of heat uptake is increasing and that's what the next graph shows the rate of which we call the earth's
energy imbalance so the rate of accumulation of heat is increasing very rapidly so it was
beginning of the century this millennium it was about 0.6 watts per square meter and now it's over
1.8 watts per square meter over the past let's say two or three years it's 1.5 watts so that's
really rapidly increasing and especially in recent years it's been going up and up and up
so I have a profound question to ask here at one point in this graph the global net
heat flux the energy imbalance was zero in around 2010 why was that yeah then we can go back
and see that the red part was touching almost touching the yellow part that means that there
was not much more heat being absorbed than being radiated to space is that because of the the global
recession no yeah it's just I think that's mainly natural variability so yeah if I would take for
example a 48 month mean you wouldn't see that so it's really of course this is really 12 months
and there's just a variability in the system so it's an interesting question to ask and
there would yeah you could assess that right you could do an analysis and see okay why where was
it how hot and why is that maybe it was more hot over land which increases the outgoing thermal
radiation but it was still colder over the oceans which caused more clouds to be over the ocean so
something like that like I would assume this is my expert's judgment but that that's not really
what to look at of course it's more the long-term trend to look at and then that's really going up
right no I understand okay so what we've learned so far is that the earth's energy imbalance is
increasing the climate temperature response is not as high as it would be without aerosols and a big
component of those was just reduced in global shipping regulations yes without the decrease of
greenhouse gas emissions right so talk to me as if I'm a sixth grader right now what are the big
picture implications of this and the Hansen et al paper yeah so so what you would think would
happen if the planet is warming or so I think there's three things to take into account so what
we call a forcing is it's greenhouse gases are forcing so it's the climate is pushed in a direction
where it's warming aerosols are negative forcing and push the climate into a direction of cooling
so we've been of course pushing the climate into a warming state while also pushing in the other
direction so that's the forcing agents but then what happens in as a result of this net effect
is an imbalance so there's an energy climate response and is warming and when this heats up
at a certain moment we expect there's a new equilibrium so more as much heat going out as
coming in as you showed as you mentioned like okay around 2010 so if there's always
around zero there's an imbalance going around zero then there's no more warming
but now we are faster pushing it so we stopped some of the cooling effects so we rapidly we
call this a termination shock of rapidly reducing part of the cooling which causes a rapid warming
effect and we expect this to translate to of course higher surface air temperatures as well
and more ice melt and more fs the sea level rise and and so because there's more heat in the system
but we haven't seen that yet in the past years that's why some are skeptical about if this effect
is real but now we're starting with this El Nino this additional heat is starting to surface so
if this data from NASA is correct which it really seems it is then that should contribute the rapid
increase in the rate of surface warming as well so there are two opposing camps uh yeah different
extremes one is all those people especially in the united states who think that climate change is some
great reset hoax that is not based in science and the earth is always warmed and they don't believe
this per se and the other is the climate scientists themselves who have perhaps underestimated
the role of aerosol as a cooling forcing and underestimated so you can underestimate the
cooling effect and we're starting to learn whether this has been underestimated and it seems it is
generally so the best estimate has most likely more and more likely been underestimating the
warming effect of decreasing these green these aerosols but what's also being underestimated
is that the rate at which these aerosols can be reduced because it was always thought
James Hansen wrote in 1990 about the effect of reducing fossil fuel use and then that would be
first that would be warming because this would coincide with decrease in aerosols but now we
continue the use of fossil fuels we continue the increasing CO2 and methane going into the
atmosphere and the concentration increase but we are rapidly reducing the amount of
sulphate aerosols and that's combined that's of course we couldn't every expert who understands
this should expect the rate of warming to increase and that will also uh what now we're
starting to see that happening and if that goes on for the next years I think that will also help
some skeptics maybe not or some will double down on that that's what I was just going to say is that
in a horrible way this may be a science communication global alert if you're right
we are going to see a spike in temperatures next year with the change in the PDO and a shift to
El Nino on top of lower sulfur emissions yeah and if we don't you have something wrong in this story
I hope I'm wrong but so maybe I can show you just a second this graph I think the next graph shows
a lot I don't know if you can see it okay yeah there's a lot of information on this but I think
it's quite clear if you if you know what it shows so the top shows global emissions of sulfur dioxide
over since 1950 so we can see it had been increasing from 1950 to 1980 the global sulfur
dioxide emissions have been increasing and then the more or less stabilized and there was a dip
and then it increases again up to 2010 and then there was it it started to decrease and in 2020
it started there was a big dip the second part of the figure shows global chip emissions of
sulfur dioxide which over more or less steady increase up to 2010 and then the sulfur regulations
came into effect step by step and really coming into effect in 2020 when it nose dived and then
yeah you see that there's almost no more sulfur in the oceans yeah it's very sharp drop and then I
show three different sea surface temperature monthly graphs and warming stripes for the
northern hemisphere met latitude it's not only warming so it's also cooling stripes because you
see they the temperature has been decreasing since 1950 with the increase of sulfur coinciding with
the increase in global but also ocean sulfur dioxide emissions yeah that's what we would expect
if there's so if there's a lot over the northern hemisphere met latitudes where most of the eight
billion people today living today live that's where most of the cooling was from these particles
was happening and that's what once these emissions started to decrease the warming effect of greenhouse
gases was stronger than the cooling effect of aerosols and we see a rapid increase but now
in the recent years you see it has been increasing more and more and faster than the other region I
show in this the second lowest region which is the mirrored region of the north so the southern
hemisphere met latitude where we see only a gradual increase in temperature over the oceans
without much of an effect of these sulfates and then the bottom we saw the global effect and
there you also see that there's there wasn't much warming in the beginning up to 1980 and then there
was a gradual the warming started to increase and then your research years started to increase
faster but then now in the past now as all coinciding with the start of the El Nino we see a
big spike again and we can expect with this continuing decrease because there's also other
places where these sulfates decrease can expect the warming to increase further and that could also
have other effects for example the aerosols could have been keeping the amok stronger than it would
have been without these aerosols so the Atlantic meridional or overturning circulation could also
be impacted indirectly by these changes in sulfates so we really have to prepare ourselves for a lot
of very big changes to come to our climate and weather systems we also really started seeing
this in 2023 with a lot of crazy weather storms that formed within 12 hours from the storm to
five hurricane five hitting Acapulco in Mexico stuff like this these high sea surface temperatures
impacting coral reefs all these things happening so you're right it could help to open some eyes
maybe some eyes will shut even more because it's very inconvenient yeah to believe this that we
are responsible for this I agree who should have seen this coming and who hasn't seen this coming
are already starting to bury their head deep inside the sand or inside their models and pretending
is very punitive well it affects their their built identity and all the decisions they've
made in the world so I want to get back to the paper but first let me ask you this so yes if we do
get another half degree of warming and even temporarily because then it'll go back down
after the El Niña starts again and you know at some point it might but it won't go all the way
back down probably it'll just retreat higher highs and higher lows sort of thing yeah maybe
but of course we don't know but with this forcing the temperature might not even go below 1.4
ever again global average increase in surfs at temperature might it might stay very high
well ever is a long time yeah ever okay sure yeah I mean for in yeah this is a good point
in the next few thousand years um yeah but I like to focus personally I like focusing on on this
century because it's more it's what we understand most and it's also what we can impact I actually
don't like focusing on this century I because I think the climate won't stop warming in the year
2100 and I think one of the implications of of Hansen paper where you were a co-author is the
earth system sensitivity to a doubling in co2 is now based on your research much higher than is
conventionally accepted that if we double co2 there's a transient equilibrium and an earth system
effect after all the feedbacks are measured and if we only care about the transient one because
that's when we and our children are alive we're neglecting what happens to all the other species
in ecosystems and and the human species thousands of years from now so I agree on that but I think
also if people I think most people don't care about that much and then if you want to if you want to
take that into account if you want to the long-term effect to be less strong or less bad it's also
important to for people to understand that the near-term effect is likely much worse than most
think right because most don't know about these aerosol effects it's like in the cop in the in
in Dubai very few people were talking about it and the word aerosols don't are not in the agreement
right so people are blind very blind to the this effect so because they don't know well if this
could impact the overturning circulation they don't know that this could cause really rapid
warming where where they live themselves in the very near future and if they would know if people
would know they might I don't know but they might they get their shit together faster
emphasis on might let me ask you I have so many questions Leon I know your family's coming home
soon but there's a thousand questions so first of all yes we might say that a half degree additional
warming Celsius in the next six months due to the combined effect of the PDO switch and and the
sulfur would be an alarming don't look up asteroid hitting a sign that would wake people up
but on the other side is it possible either in the near-term or in coming decades that the positive
feedbacks from nature from low-lying methane producing areas and some of the the feedbacks
that are triggered from warming start to make human emissions not the dominant story in other
words could we trade off some alarm and political awakening to this with a pushing into a higher
percentage of biological feedbacks dominating the process yeah so that's what worries me personally
is the Atlantic Ocean where most of the heat flow from southern hemisphere to northern hemisphere
happens through the ocean and through the atmosphere over the Atlantic and then so that's
transported heat from south to north and then if we because we decreased the sulfates the ocean is
absorbing more heat than it would was without and then there's less need of heat transporting from
the south to the north and we also already see in the hypothesis I have that that this might contribute
to the melting of Antarctic sea ice so faster because there's more heat staying in the south
and which contributes to melting of Antarctic sea ice but also keeping it from freezing because
and then and then if the amox slows down of course that could influence global weather systems
could impact the monsoons it could impact the weather we have in Europe it could impact the
weather all around the world so that's really something to take into account and and some
part of the system might be less affected by it than others but and of course we have the Canadian
Forest another paper I was a co-author of this year by Ripple et al showed that present also the
different things happening to the climate system this year and one enormous spike in
forest burning over the canada was part of this and it's really really off the chart combined with
the sea surface temperatures and the surface air temperatures and the Antarctic sea ice and I think
there's already very worrying without even without what we might expect happening in the in the years
to come and yeah how people will respond to that do you feel some vindication that you've been
devoting a lot of your life's energy to researching this and and now it turns out that what you've
been writing about and talking about for the last 20 years is is happening or is it kind of bitter
sweet because humanity just didn't do anything yeah so it's very in a ways of course it's for
everyone it's personal right if my country is 30 percent of my country is already below sea level
and right that's increasing so I might lose my country because of this so yeah I was right but
I lost my country exactly so I rather be wrong I think that's that's important so but whatever
people say I think the data shows that it's likely worse than most people think and I cannot argue
with the data I can try but the data is there so what would the very senior respected IPCC
scientists say about the slides that you've shared with me today and and your your paper
and your explanation and your prediction that we're going to have a another spike in temperature
likely in coming first half of 2024 I think it depends whether they are listening and whether
they are reading the paper before they respond I think that's important I think the first response
might be this can't be right because I think that the first response of James Henson when I talked
to him about this was also this can't be right I respect him for that he's a puzzle solver and
he's skeptical and he's like a pit bull he wants to understand it exactly and here's the thing I
don't know him well but I would never discount what he said because he did this almost 40 years ago
was talking about this and what a burden that guy must carry trying to explain all this to
the public and to policy people for 40 years and all-time emissions all-time new coal capacity
building in 2023 yeah sorry to interrupt keep going no you're right and I think that's also
maybe a reason why Henson is sometimes using stronger language than he has in the past
he said that your research is a big fucking deal is what he said on some recent podcasts
exactly yeah so I think that's the research but I mean the findings it's just not just our research
right it's even before we present this research our co-author Norman Lope from NASA wrote a paper
in 2021 showing that until 2019 there was an increase in the rate in the earth's energy
middle is the rate in which earth is warming doubling in the rate of warming and it didn't
get much attention but this data is worrying it's not just what we how we present it it's the data
itself that is worrying so yeah and I wish people would look at this data and come to with different
conclusions and explain us why we are wrong using the data but I haven't seen that yet so that's what
I think what's important to see but if you say okay but what would be the response of
of IPCC authors which some are even part of our paper but what would be the response of
some IPCC authors I think please look at this data and tell us we are wrong I think that's
that's what we all want to hear thank you so I have so many more questions for you let's
let's move into the second part like you've been full scientists talking about the data and your
research so far now I still want you to kind of have your scientists hat on but also speculate
I'm going to ask you some questions so so given what you know now and of course this isn't can't
be proven this is just your opinion as a very well informed person under the default scenario
where do you think the ultimate what I'm referring to with my colleagues
Holocene Anthropocene Thermal Maximum will be where we headed temperature wise as the centuries
unfold if we do nothing and the default and I'm not talking about rcp8.5 biophysically
implausible coal and oil and gas availability but even a near term next decade or so peak and
decline in emissions what are we looking at so you want me to guess yes and then attach a confidence
interval to your guess so I think it's very very uncertain what will happen I think because well
you've already told me that we're headed to one and a half and James Hansen has said that in the
next two decades we'll hit two degrees and that will be kind of the baseline so we've got that
even the what we show in our paper we assume that the amok will not stop okay there will not be a
shutdown of that well it's already stopped 20 to 25 percent so it slowed significantly yeah exactly
so but it has stopped before right so it's in right after the last ice hatem but it has stopped
many times so we know that's possible almost stopped we know it can throw down significantly
and that within years the weather in Europe can change right so in the place where people are
producing food it can change and I don't know what what will happen like I don't know maybe we might
increase coal use again because we need to eat we need to heat our homes yeah that's a response
right it's not something I I think should happen or I want to happen but that's what humanity might
refer to in the with the same situation that or or we would chop down forests which would mean a
smaller sink for carbon yeah if you look what happened in Canada which I already mentioned that
we couldn't maybe cannot even cut it down fast enough before it started burning right so that's
also something to consider so there's indeed what you mentioned there's a lot of known unknowns and
then like personally of course surface air temperatures are interesting but for me in living in the
Netherlands I think sea level rise is much more important than global surface average
surface air temperatures are what are not what people really care about right it is not what they
feel strongly about it's it's a storm category six hurricane or this stuff like which we never knew
what could happen or these the floods hit in Germany a few years ago which are still rebuilding and
all these these things we cannot really prepare for like what happens if our solar panels are blowing
from the roofs and and the windmills are being destroyed or in the in the North Sea when we
are getting some super storms which we could we we or at least the engineers didn't expect
weren't warned about right so all these things contribute to change that could happen and I
think that's what really I think will happen I expect it more or less to happen this century
already and I think that's really something we should take into account so your recent paper
with James James Hansen clearly states that temporary solar radiation management SRM
will probably be needed in the future in other words we're going to have to purposely inject
atmospheric aerosols to limit warming in the future how do you see this happening this is
speculation of course this isn't your your core thing using what techniques under what scale
what time frame and under whose governance and control do you think this is coming let me first
start with saying this it's not something jim or we want right we don't want this to happen
but I think that's important to note or or that we think this is an alternative to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions it's what we see already we see now happening is that we are not decreasing greenhouse
gas emissions people are not decreasing greenhouse gas emissions at the rate needed and because they
are not doing that because of what we see happening in Dubai just some some weak tea and no real
action happening relative to the problem at hand we realize that people and the governments and
companies will likely revert to sunlight reflection methods SRM or whatever you call it and that's
what we expect and then we better prepare for that we better learn from what's happening to not do it
without the knowledge to not have agents trying to cool stuff down and causing a lot of terrible
things to happen elsewhere or even where they are trying to do it so I think that's really important
and then how it will happen I think that's that's very uncertain but I think that's also really
depends on where the effects are taking place so if certain countries are for example I think
India India I think likely will be one of the countries which will consider it maybe before
others because it has a billion people overbilling I think 1.4 billion people now living in a in a
country that's generally quite hot already and it's still being cooled by a lot of coal plants
putting a lot of sulfur in the atmosphere isn't this also the wouldn't have to be global
well could India do SRM solar radiation management alter the temperature yeah so they're already
reflecting a lot of sunlight with their sulfur emissions at the moment
all right they are already putting a lot of sulfur in the atmosphere and not just sulfur but also a
lot of brown carbon and black carbon and that has health effects so they are probably they already
have policy like China did and has and likes what's happening over the oceans they had policy
to reduce the amount of air pollutants including sulfur here's a here's a dumb question Leon if
India does some policy to change the sulfates or their emissions it's globally mixed won't it
want it be a little bit more impactful in India but basically be diluted around the world it depends
what how they do it right okay if they if they put it into the stratosphere there's much more
global effects than if they would do it over the surface over the oceans like to what the ships
have been already doing as a byproduct right put the ships in the but the coal and the coal plants
and and all the cooking fires the which kill four million people a year all the biomass cooking
fires also cause all these particles in the atmosphere and absorption of sunlight in the
in the atmosphere but the decrease in how much heat is reaching the surface and this all has to
be taken into account to to understand how India has has even cooled or at least not warmed a lot
in the past decades as it's developed industrially when all these emissions increase let's assume
that there is a technology to use solar radiation management and it's effective and that society
around the world is seeing how bad the climate forcing from emissions are and it's warming
and the energy imbalance is so high that we have to do something but isn't that like some modern
equivalent of the stone heads on Easter Island because as soon as we stop it then the heat comes
back with a vengeance so wouldn't it have to be done in perpetuity yeah we are already stopping
it so that's what's happening now we have been cooling not intentionally but we have been cooling
the climate we have been limiting the warming especially where we live and now we stop doing
that and then we're learning what will happen now and then of course just doing it intentionally
I think that's a very big discussion we and I think that should be held on a lot of levels
well well here's the thing Leon if you are really this podcast this conversation is
December 13th this will come out in January we're gonna know by March April June July of 2024
whether you're really right about this and I imagine that next year next summer you and
Jim Hansen and others are going to be bombarded with what the hell do we do
sort of questions or you're wrong and this doesn't happen but I find your your logic
quite compelling on this yeah the data is wrong I think that's because we're just presenting the
data right and then right then it will be the correlation is wrong there's no correlation
there's the causation there's a correlation for sure that's what the data shows but then there's
no causation it was just all the stupid coincidence and everything will be fine I hope so but then
you're right so I think that's if this in the coming months will take shape more and more
and if more and more people will be affected by this like of course we already see that that
there's stronger voices of intentionally cooling the climate and so on that note I know you're not
an expert on this per se but can you speculate are there other ways that humanity could use
technology to create global cooling like regenerative agriculture that sucks in carbon into the soil
and artificial whale poop and and other things or is there anything out there that you think might
play a decent role I'm all for whale poop and increasing the biosphere I'm a big fan of
James Lovelock and his theory about earth being a living system and because of course we know
there's life on planet earth and we know that plants grow and then that plant and that life
interacts with with its environment and the environment impacts life but life impacts the
environment as well and in a way we are the conscious of this planet we can have a positive
effect on the planet and I think I do believe in that and I think it's a very it's not easy
it requires stewardship it's an enormous responsibility and we can do a lot of things
wrong which we are doing at the moment but in the end I think I do believe that humans can have a
net positive effect on the planet and that's maybe that's very hard for many people to think about
even to see humans as a positive force for the good overall but I think that is possible and we
have a lot to learn on how to get there and yeah I think that an important part in getting there is
increasing the biosphere and to increase the potential of life itself to to create a better
climate well the the other additional pieces we have to increase the number of people that actually
understand what's going on and how how dire the situation is not only for our our economies
but for the oceans and the biosphere we've been treating the oceans like a garbage dump out of
sight out of mind and it's invisible CO2 that's just being absorbed by these giant bodies of water
so we're not going to have time for the 50 other scientific questions I have for you
I want to keep my promise to you on time but I would like to ask you now just wear your hat
as a human and by the way I don't think you can really do that you're always going to be a scientist
I can just tell by the way you you think but but that's okay I really value your contribution and
your heart on this I'm sure a lot of people watching this specifically tuned in to hear you
because they know of your work with James Hansen and they're very worried about climate change
and probably many other issues as well do you have any personal advice to the listeners of
this program at this time of environmental disruption and global anxiety what some people
might call the metacrisis but you could maybe even say specifically climate and what's coming
any advice that's a good question I think it's important to do what you're good at and to not
despair to not take everything too personally to not internalize everything you see and read and
maybe what I talked about to take it to heart but not to not let it affect you personally too much
but also try to work on solutions with the best of your capacity I think that's really
important to to see okay where can I be a force of good in the world and because I think that's
for everyone different so everyone would answer that question differently but I think that's
everyone can add value to this world and I think you all I think it's important to to see also it
look at the scale look at the scale the problem of course I believe in small steps but if everyone
does a little it only little happens I think that's true so take into account the scale of
of the planet of the of the problem at hand and try to add value there and you have children right
young children yeah seven and five years old seven and five what advice do you give for teenagers
and people in their 20s who are learning about all this and having to make decisions about their
career and their lifestyles and and choices would you change your advice for young people
or add to it yeah I think for young people I think it's important to again try to to do it
from your own perspective so do what you're good at because if you like not not everyone likes to
do science or do do data analysis or be an entrepreneur or whatever I did what I'm good at
and what I what I like to do and I I think that's really important if you want to do this for the
long run because we need people to really be committed and because the challenges ahead of us
are very complex and require commitment I think that's important and it helps if you do what you
like to do or if you do what you're good at that will help you to build a career it's important
but it's much easier to build a career around something what you what you are good at and what
you like to do it which also fulfills you in a way well you and I are both doing that I'm educating
the broader public on a system science with an environmental ethic and you are solving deep
complex biogeochemical earth system puzzles with your research what do you care most about in the
world Leon that's a big question I care about the the plan itself about life and about my
personally of course my family and and friends but I also know that if we want to
conserve a future worth living we have to be very conscious about the reality of this and
it's on time it's confronting but I think it's important to understand the reality and take
that into account to build solutions for the future and really look at the large scale of things
and I I like to look at it from the really like a macro large-scale perspective because that's
that's where things are changing and well we have to change that for the good I agree if you
could I don't think you've probably watched any of my podcasts we had conversations offline but
this is a question I ask all my guests if you had access to a magic wand and you could change one
thing and there was no personal recourse to your decision no status loss or anything like that
what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures I would try
or if I could change how humans interact with reality that would be great so of course humans
are not rational beings they think they are but generally they are not so otherwise we wouldn't
have had this conversation right because rationally we know what our effects are and we know how it
impacts and we know it we should do things differently but we are not we know the potential
is enormous but we are not living up to that overall I think I would like that to change
so that we can use the the tools which physics for example give us for example I don't like it
there's some subjects which even if you mention it you'll be put into a certain corner right so
including this subject this subject is a very good example of that indeed so aerosols like
if you even talk about aerosols even when you talk about it from a climate perspective and you say
this is the largest uncertainty in climate science and we need to understand this better
this provides us an opportunity to reduce the large uncertainty climate science people say
ah you must be pro geoengineering and you want more fossil fuels like totally ridiculous of
course but that's what happens and there's many subjects like that like for example nuclear energy
if you even mention the word some people might already just because I didn't say anything about it
people might think okay you're like this or you're like that nuclear energy renewable energy climate
change they're all polarized all of them exactly yeah exactly so I would like if I could have a
want and could change that just for things to be less polarized and more based on on the physical
reality of this world here here so we covered a lot here you are a scientist and know a huge
amount about this topic I would love to have you back at some point in the future if you would come
and we did a round two what is one specific topic and it could be as narrow as you like
that you think is relevant to human futures that you would want to take a deep dive and unpack
and tell a story about that one thing anything come to mind yeah what I would like to assess further
yeah I think that's how how in the past thousands of years humans have interacted with the planet
and how they changed the planet in many different ways and how that could take shape in the future
I think that's to me is very interesting and I think that's so how can we be in that force of good
for example one can think of his own carbon footprint and I've often people say okay I have to
fly there I have to fly and they complain about the carbon footprint what I then say okay what is your
net footprint if you make sure that some technology can decrease carbon emissions by a billion tons
for example you could fly anywhere in the world but hypothetically right so I think there's there's
many ways humans as individuals could be a force of good in the world but overall humans can be as
well and I think that's an interesting question to dive into further thank you do you have any
closing comments for the people watching and listening who kind of understand or maybe some
people this is the first they've heard that aerosols have been masking the warming in the pipeline do
you have any closing words yeah so if you are skeptical I think many people watching this might
be try to look at the data yourself I think it's the data is quite accessible and I almost
when I share my figures on on x for example I always add a reference and whether you have
10 followers or a million followers if you respond I always try to respond back and if you have
questions I can share that my expertise in how to access the data and how to try and understand
it because it's really I would love that more people look at this and try to understand what's
happening and then with the knowledge they gain do what they can to within their expertise to
to further the cause of humanity on this planet. Bedankt, thank you so much, Lian. You're welcome.
