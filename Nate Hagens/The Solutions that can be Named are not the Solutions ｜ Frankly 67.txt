各位朋友大家好. That's a very polite way to say greetings in Chinese. You know,
it would be great as an aside to have someone from China on the show to discuss the metacrisis
and how China is thinking about and facing some of these things. So last week I had a
frankly called the reality party. It was really my frustration looking at both parties in
the United States and I'm sure it's similar elsewhere in the world. Not really talking
about the core issues that we're going to be facing in the coming decade. And some of
the feedback I got is what would a reality party stand for? What would be the solutions
to the human predicament? What would be the policies that we would put forward? And today
I want to talk about that and talk about specifically why I am not promoting certain
solutions to what we face, at least not yet. And that is going to be the subject of today's frankly.
Okay, so brief recap the human predicament. We are supported by ancient sunlight and treating
it as if it were interest. We currently have a 20 terawatt, a 19 some terawatt global human
metabolism, which is around 190 billion light bulbs worth of energy turned on 24 seven. That is
impacting the biosphere and its waste absorption capacity. We're overlaying this with monetary
claims that continue to grow. We're in ecological overshoot climate change is just one of many
risks to the environment, including novel entities and plastic and PFAS and species loss, etc. It's
my belief and my 20 years of research has led me to believe that from 19 terawatts, we will hit 15
terawatts before we hit 25 terawatts. And we have a lot of things to do between now and then to make
the future, excuse me, better than the default. On top of all that is the evolved human behavioral
constraints and predilections of modern homo sapiens. So with that as the general problem
statement, and there's 200 of hours of content on this site that that unpacks the statements I just
made, with that as a general problem statement, what are the solutions? What are the policies? What
should we do? So first, I would, as I said last week, there are no solutions, right? There are
solutions to a problem. What we face is a predicament. And predicament, there are responses
and things that would make it better than the default. So I really don't like talking about
solutions, but it's quite a quite a common word. So how do we how do we think about solutions
mitigation to what I call the human predicament or the great simplification? Okay, so first of all,
the responses to the great simplification are not simple, they are complex. So first of all, the
categories of the interventions would fall into three broad areas. One would be using Marvin
Harris's framework, the superstructure, which is the ideas and the values and the beliefs and the
memes and the stories and the narratives. Another category would be the structure or what Daniel
Schmackenberger and I have started to refer to as the social structure, which is our laws and our
rules and our economic ways of transacting goals, etc. And underneath that is, of course, the
infrastructure, which is our energy, our systems, our buildings, our environmental waste capacity,
and all and all those things. So if we talk about solutions, which of those categories are we
referring to, and then to put this in a two dimensional space, those of you listening, those
paying attention to the future care about different scales. There's the individual scale. There's the
local and regional scale. There's the national and global scale. And then to make it three, three
dimensional, there's the time aspect, which is the pre crisis time, which is now to whenever there
is a financial or geopolitical cascade, which could be very soon, or we could have a decade
before that happens. That moment I call the bend versus break moment is how do we stabilize the
system and keep it going at a less complex, smaller scale. And then the third timeline is 20
years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, what are the technologies, ways of living
with each other and with nature, governance models, etc. for the longer term. So that's kind of a
three dimensional view of how we might think about the solution space. But then if we even took one
of those cubes, we could extrapolate it even wider. There are different sorts of people. Of course,
the world has 8 billion people in wildly different circumstances, but even the people watching this
show, they might have a lot of resources or no resources, they might have a lot of social
capital and friends and networks or just be by themselves in their off the grid home in British
Columbia or something. So people's circumstances, high to low. Also, people might be living in a
different culture that is not fully complexified. There's the global north, where I live near
Minneapolis, things are incredibly complex. But also, I gave a presentation last week to a bunch
of NGO leaders in India. India has not yet fully complexified, which is an advantage to them. So
the options available to someone living in India is to kind of resist the siren song of conspicuous
consumption in the global north. And they have actually less degrees of freedom on the climate
standpoint, but more degrees of freedom on how they organize things. And lastly, in this second
Rubik's Cube is what you care about. A lot of listeners to this show care about other species
and earth's ecosystems and future generations. Others just care about social justice and inequality.
Others care about local resilience and the economy where they live. So all of these things
make it clear that there isn't a one size fits all recommendation to people in the world or viewers
of this program. So one of the things that I feel strongly about and the purpose that I'm the reason
I'm doing this, this work is I think we have to avoid have more people avoid being captured by wrong
narratives that are dead ends. So in the sequence of being ecology systems and energy blind, the very
first step, and it is the most important step is to understand what's going on, to understand how
energy, money, technology and economic growth fit together, how we do these things to get the
same neurotransmitters of our successful ancestors and how this whole system has an environmental
impact. That takes a lot of time, but it's very important to understand. And this is politically
neutral. It doesn't matter who you vote for or what your value system is at this point,
just to understand it is integration of science. And no one including me knows all this stuff,
but we're all learning and headed in that direction to understand the present. Because as my former
guest at Conway said, we have to understand the present to understand the future and we don't.
Beyond that, once we understand that's when your values come in. What do you care about? What do
you feel? What is important to you? People that have followed me for 20 years or the last couple
years in this podcast know I deeply care about the natural world and the one and a half to two
million known species and the up to 10 million unidentified species that have no say in our
economic system. And I want to chaperone them as best as possible through the bottlenecks of the
21st century. I've concluded that we have to also help human systems navigate this bender break
in order for that to happen. So that's my value system. That comes across, I think, in my podcast,
but it's secondary for the work to have people understand what's going on. Then downstream from
understanding and caring about something is the plans and the responses and the solution set.
And to figure out what your strategy is and then downstream from that is engaging and executing
your strategies. By far the most important thing on this podcast is the understanding.
And I'm going to continue to say why I'm not going whole hog into the solutions, but this is one
reason why. Another reason why is as soon as you have a specific solution, you have narrowed your
audience dramatically. For instance, I've come up with, and I will be articulating this later this
summer, many categories of interventions. There's regenerative agriculture and technology. There's
what I call the real energy transition, which isn't transitioning to a type of energy. It's a
transition on how we use energy and interact with others and with our local ecosystems.
There's Goldilocks technology, not too hot, not too cold, just right for a lower throughput future.
There's advanced policy. There's a new framework for philanthropy, which I may call capital in the
service of life. There's different governance models. There's libraries of healing. These are all
general categories, but once you get more specific than that, what if your audience is an engineer
or a teacher or a celebrity or a college student or a college professor or a philanthropist or a
farmer? There's different answers for each of those categories.
Okay, another reason I don't talk about solutions is a delicate one, and I probably
could say a lot more about this, and I probably will already say too much.
Human systems, the way we have a shared mind space around the world with the 8 billion humans,
or at least the billions that are connected to the internet, technology has accentuated this.
This mind space functions very similar to systems in nature, and there are adaptive
systems, adaptive processes. There is a predator-prey-like relationship, and things move very
fast. To give a natural system analog, there are bivalves, which are like mollusks and clams,
and the thickness of their shell is based on the predators around them that would be able to crush
the shell. If there are no predators that have strong jaws in their environment, they don't need
to grow thick shells. Growing the thick shells is a waste of energy and resources. They only do that
in response to things. It's the same thing in human systems. Bucky Fuller famously said,
you can't change the existing system. By fighting it, you have to create a new system that makes
the old system obsolete. He didn't believe that. He was a military contractor that did the
the due lines and the Arctic for the domes to protect the ICBM nuclear missiles. He was the
contractor for those domes. He couldn't come out and say, fight the existing system, because then
there would have been an immediate adaptive response to that, and he would have lost
status and the voice that he had. Countless examples like that.
9-11, no one knew that you could hijack planes. Osama bin Laden figured it out, and it was
adaptive response. But the response in counter to it happened really fast, because I think it was
the third plane. On their cell phones, people knew that they were doing this, so they no longer
allowed that to happen, and the passengers attacked the pilots, and that's why the plane didn't hit
the White House. All of the information out there is very quickly adapted to and responded to,
and so the real solutions to the Metacrisis will not be televised, and they will not be popular
either. So it's good to talk about the framework that we face, and so people don't buy dumb narratives
like net zero by 2050 with continued economic growth, but it will never be a thing that the
solution set to the Metacrisis is outlined publicly. In a subset of that, that's not the
adaptive nature of it, is the universe of socially acceptable solutions, and then there's a universe
of effective solutions, and how much that overlap is is probably not huge.
And then on top of that, we've got climate change, and economic growth, and poverty, and
inequality, and biodiversity, and all these concentric circles. There's some overlap with
some of them, but there's no overlap of all of them, and how do we manage for that?
A deeper, more tangible example of this adaptive ceiling that I mentioned,
and I've been blessed with this podcast to come across a lot of humans who are working on
fantastic things. I met someone recently who is working on existing language that when a wetland
gets bulldozed over for a new Walmart or something, that community has to
procure a new wetland somewhere in the world, and this person is working on the language to
make that scalable in all communities in Canada and the United States. Another person I know
has individually conserved millions of acres in South America of biologically sensitive land.
These people, I want to highlight them on the podcast, not to say, hey, go do this, but to say,
hey, wow, look at all these things that can be done, but they don't want to come on the podcast,
because if they explain what they're doing, that creates an adaptive counter-response from people
that don't share their values and don't want those things to happen, so it actually causes their
special sauce to dissipate. The one example that I have had on the show is my colleague and friend
DJ White, one of the early Green Peacers and the founder of Earth Trust. He successfully stopped
the only drive kill of dolphins in history. It's over 30 years ago, and I think the reason he
shared why he did it and how he did it is because all the people in the Taiwanese government that
were involved in that, which he wasn't allowed to tell anyone, that was part of the agreement,
are no longer alive. The point is that there will be an in-service-of-life underground movement.
There will be things going on that are responses and mitigations to the problems we face that
no one knows about, and hopefully some of you listening to this will do that.
That leads me to policy. What are the policies that knowing about the human predicament and the
great simplification we could do? Well, on the surface level, there are some generic policies
that would just generally be good ideas like term limits or age limits or getting the money out of
politics. Most of the things that I'm talking about are not only in the future, but to avoid
these things from happening, the policies that we're voting for are exactly the opposite direction.
One of the things that I started a couple years ago, and I've spoken to around 25 senators,
governors, congressmen, is the concept of advanced policy, which is those things that we will have
to do in the coming decade, but that are socially and politically too advanced to be accepted by
the current political zeitgeist. But we still need to do them, to build research, to do scenario
planning, to build constituency, to create break gas glass plans. I did some of that with some
agencies of the US government back in 2014, but those aren't online, obviously, because
talking about them makes them become self-fulfilling prophecies or removes their potential effectiveness.
This is a long way of saying that solutions aren't going to just be
listed one, two, three, and followed linearly. I think the last reason that I don't talk about
solutions is probably the most salient one, which is truly I don't know. I think it's clear to you
all what I care about. I am learning along with you. It's one of the unexpected blessings of this
podcast is I've come across so many really smart, caring people who share my value systems, and I'm
learning along with you. If you go to a doctor and you're sick, the doctor will diagnose you and
give you a pill or do a surgery. If you go to an auto mechanic and he or she will tell you what's
wrong with your car and then they'll fix it. Describing the great simplification doesn't
qualify me or anyone to then know what to do. I'm trying to describe it. It's my hope that there is
a collective learning and a change in the conversation that creates emergent
ideas, emergent responses. My main goal now is to paint the picture as clearly as I can
myself and then get different aspects, different angles of it from my guests.
To further complicate things is we don't know what future is going to arrive. There could be the AI
more boost in productivity, more door economy where we have more growth and more environmental
impact. There could be the great simplification, this financial Wiley Coyote moment I've been
talking about or there could be a collapse. How do we plan for those scenarios? At this point,
although pro-social prepping is one of the categories I think is important,
this isn't just a prepping channel. There are other ones that exist and based on how my farm
looks, you don't want to use me as an example on how to prep. I'm still trying to save the whole
social system in a way that we can go to a kinder, gentler, more sapient economy that includes
the other species and the value of ecosystem services into our value system. I'm still trying
to breathe life into that vision. I hope this answers questions that none of you even had.
Actually, this feels important to me to describe what I'm trying to do and why a solution
for the Metacrisis is kind of a unicorn or a carrot. The reality is that's not how the world works.
I have a very intense personal, frankly, hopefully on deck for next week about my family.
Until then, we'll talk to you next week. Bye-bye.
