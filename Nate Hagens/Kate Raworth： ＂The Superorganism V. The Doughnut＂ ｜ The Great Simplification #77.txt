Welcome to another episode of The Great Simplification. Today, I'm very pleased to welcome
my friend and self-described renegade economist, Kate Rayworth. Kate is known for her book,
Donut Economics, Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist, and the related lab that she
co-founded, Donut Economics Action Lab, which is putting into practice the planetary boundaries
and human sufficiency in the donut around the world. She's also a senior associate at Oxford
University's Environmental Change Institute, as well as a professor of practice at Amsterdam
University of Applied Sciences. She's an incredible communicator, and I think her work on Donut
Economics is painting a picture that people can understand that we are part of a broader system
that we're influencing, and the current economic rules and institutions are not only
creating environmental overshoot, but they're really not doing a great job for the humans.
This was an incredible conversation. I hope to have Kate back on various reality roundtables.
She's doing very important work. Please welcome Kate Rayworth.
Kate, great to see you. It's great to be here. How are you? You are very busy, I imagine.
Yeah, I think everyone's busy, right? We can all make busy, but I'm well, and I'm really looking
forward to this conversation, Leslie. Thank you for all the important work you're doing. Your book,
Donut Economics and your ongoing work with Donut Economics Action Lab are influencing and inspiring
a lot of people, so thank you. Let me ask you a question. Many of us that worked in finance and
economics had a aha moment where we left the dark side. For me, it was 20 years ago on Wall
Street reading Herman Daley's book, but you're a classically trained economist, now an ecological
economist. What were some of your aha moments that caused you to pause and wait a minute? Do you
have any acute stories or memories? I studied economics at university in the 1990s. What's
the opposite of an aha moment? It's like, oh no moment. I can't just study economics because I
care about the environment. There's no paper on the environment at all. There was nothing. It was
like one week in public economics. A company paused chemical gloop in the river. That was it.
When we talked about inequality, it always would begin with taking initial income distribution as
given. Would this Pareto change, improve things and I was like, why do we take things as given?
Why don't we start with asserting human rights? So I had quite a lot of, oh no, this isn't turning
out to be the toolkit. I was really hoping it would be, which is why when I left university,
I didn't want to call myself an economist. I actually walked away from it for many, many decades,
but then like many other people, I had those aha moments that started bringing me back.
So one of the first ones was seeing the planetary boundaries diagram. I have it actually right
here. It was seeing it into my brain. I came back from maternity leave and somebody showed me this
and it was a massive, oh, that's the beginning of 21st century economics because like you,
I had just read Herman Daley's book, Beyond Growth. That made my brain flip and when I saw this picture
in 2010, I was thinking, well, Joanne Rockstone, Will Steffen and the planetary boundary scientists,
they have quantified that biosphere around the economy that Herman Daley drew. He conceptualized
it. They quantified it and we are game. We are on. Here we go. And that's why I drew a circle
within a circle and created the donor. That was a massive aha moment for me. Somebody else then
mentioned a couple of years later, well, of course, the work of Danela Meadows, Thinking in Systems.
I'm like, that sounds interesting. What's that? Then when I read Thinking in Systems,
it was a massive aha. There is no turning back from this. And why wasn't I taught economics
in systems thinking? Why weren't we taught to think of the economy as a complex adaptive
system in feedback loops? So it was a real deep frustration with what I'd been taught and just
a thrill of finding these ideas. And it was this collective series of aha's that made me think,
I want to make these ideas dance on the same page. That's what led me to write
Donut Economics. I want to see what happens when you bring Eleanor Ostrom's comments theory together
with Danela Meadows, Thinking in Systems, together with Herman Daley's Ecological Economics,
together with Feminist Economics. What do we get next? So it was definitely these aha moments that
brought me back. Why don't we teach Thinking in Systems and these planetary boundaries and some
of the things you just mentioned to undergrads in college?
Because the mainstream economic textbook and Thinking and the ideology behind it is a
self-contained, self-affirming system that has worked very well nicely. Thank you for decades
and carries on being taught and students keep enrolling for economics. And I think
there's a real inertia of self-questioning when inside the discipline and why disrupt
something that has apparently been working. I mean, to me, the most radical act
in economics would be to draw Herman Daley's circle of the biosphere around every single
model of the economy. Why don't we do that? Because actually it changes everything. And I
think it changes the professor's professionalism. It changes who is the expert here. It changes the
foundations of analysis. So it causes a massive disruption in the hierarchies that have been
built up around which are the best journals, which are the best frameworks, what's taken as
given. I mean, supply and demand curves, they haven't been peer reviewed. The exponential growth
curve for an economy that was never peer reviewed, but it's just taken as a foundational assumption
now. So it's much harder to move away from that system because everything, every new paradigm,
has it been peer reviewed? So I think that's why we see the build up of new economic thinking
off and outside major economics departments because the new thinking is coming from elsewhere
rather than within. But what thrills me is that students in high school, whether they're, you
know, 14 year olds or whether they're 18 year olds or whether they're undergraduates or master
students, they know that the ideas that will serve them to be economists, household managers,
right? Planetary scale household managers of the future, they know that the ideas that will
serve them are not the ones that are contained only in those textbooks. They are coming to these
new ideas. So I taught for eight years a class called Reality 101. And in my experience, the
students that had never had an economics class, like immediately got the content in my class.
But it was the ones that had had an economics class that there was this like mental speed
bump they had to get over on the assumptions and other things. It was very interesting to observe.
Yeah. And there's a great quote from Keynes. He said something like,
it's not the new ideas that are difficult. It's getting the old ones out of our heads that have
been ramified into the corner of our minds. How do we escape paradigms? So that to me is why I care
most about, let's call it Econ 101. I care most about the first course that any student encounters.
Often professors, when they're pushing back against what I'm doing, they say, oh, you know,
you're just talking about Econ 101. I mean, it gets far more sophisticated than this.
I would argue it doesn't. They don't suddenly bring the planet in when you're when you're a master
student or something. But the very first encounter we have with what is the economy? What is the
range of its scope? What are the foundational metrics? Is it price in the market? What are the
foundational institutions that we care about? These profoundly shape our worldviews and pictures
profoundly shape our worldviews. That's what I've really learned, the power of pictures. And so
if you want to dislodge a model, I think the best way is to propose a new model,
Buckminster Fuller, right? You change things by making the old model obsolete, propose something
new. So that's why the work I've done is really focused on proposing new pictures because the
power of our visual site going into our visual cortex, it really shapes what we see and what
we don't see, what's central, what's peripheral. So that's to me the most important economics
course to change. Well, let's get into that. Your very popular book, Donate Economics,
highlighted the outer core or the outer ring, which is the planetary boundaries that we don't
want to exceed. And then the inner ring was the human needs for well-being, the things that we
don't want to go below. And in it, talking about visuals and orthodox economics, you outlined a
list of old economic thinking like 20th century and new 21st century economics. And maybe you could
either visually or we could put up one of your graphics, just give a kind of a brief summary of
the, I think you had seven points. Yeah. So first of all, let me say that it was really important
to me what I was aiming to do in that book was to set out ways of thinking, right? Its principles
of thinking that will then be adapted over time between different countries that will be relevant
differently in Malawi or Sweden, but also that'll change over time as suddenly AI appears or as
crises hit. So I wasn't trying to say these are the policies that we should implement, but rather
what are some of the ways of thinking that will equip us to go well? And I'm sure there's many
more, but yeah, here's seven. And I'm just for the fun of it with you, I'm going to see if I can show
them quickly visually. This is going to become like a donut economics circus big tent. So let's
see if I can do this. So seven ways to think. The first one, change the goal. The goal of 20th
century economics was endless growth, right? There we go. Endless growth curve. It was just
implicitly underlying everything that we said we were aiming for, success of the economy. No,
that is not a sufficient statement of what success looks like. And we know that endless growth
actually takes us into a lot of problems. So we need, here we go, the donut that you just described,
a goal that says leave no one falling short in the hole, but don't overshoot Earth's limits.
Get everybody over social foundation inside the ecological ceiling. We want to meet the needs of
all people within the means of the living planet. It's a goal that brings together human rights
and ecological integrity. And I say, well, okay, that's the starting point on day one.
Bang, this is where we begin. What kind of economic system will actually take us there?
So, number one, change the goal. Two, see the big picture, right? If that's the compass, what's
the map? The map of economics. All mainstream economics courses start with this little diagram,
supply and demand. Now, that's a big act to put supply and demand on the screen on day one.
It means we put the market at the center of our vision. It means we make price,
the metric of concern, and everything that falls outside the price contract gets called an
externality. That's a big framing choice of the death of the living world. Oh, it's an environmental
externality. That is not nearly a big enough picture. There are no externalities, as Herman
Daly and I would say, your model's just not big enough. So I drew a diagram. Here's my embedded
economy diagram. Here you go. Let's see if we can show this. So this brings together ecological
economics. It brings together complexity. It brings together feminist economics and common
thinking. The economy is embedded in society, is embedded in the living world. It is a subsystem
and utterly dependent upon it. But also the economy is made up not just of the market in the state,
that very 20th century boxing match, the household, the space of unpaid caring work,
typically done by women, and the commons and an ostrom space where we co-create goods and
services of value. If we start with this big picture of the economy and recognize that all
economic activity has to operate within the planetary boundaries, and we can use these
different forms of provisioning, to me this is just so much a richer starting point for all
macroeconomic modeling. So number two, change, get the big picture. Number three,
nurture human nature. Who is humanity? How do we tell ourselves the story of who we are in this
picture? The portrait of humanity in 20th century economics. This guy, here we are, he's framed.
This is a rational economic man. I decided to draw him to make him visible. He would be a man
standing alone, no dependence. He's got money in his hand. He's got ego in his heart. He's got
calculator in his head, and he'd have nature at his feet. He hates work, he loves luxury,
he knows the price of everything. The real problem with this depiction is that the more
the students told, oh yes, this model is a sufficient model of us. Actually, we start to
mimic him. Students say over time they more value competition and self-interest over altruism and
collaboration because they start to mimic the model. So who we tell ourselves we are,
shapes who we become. Instead of this rational economic man, we need to recognize we are first
the most social of all mammals. We are social or we are adaptable. We are heuristic. We care
about other opinions. We follow the crowd. We are learning. So we have to start with the reality
of humanity, which we learned from cognitive behavior, psychology, from sociology, a much
richer picture of humanity. Number four, we've got to get savvy with systems. So instead of
assuming the economy is in equilibrium, like that supply and demand curve showed us,
recognize that it's almost probably never going to be there. It's a complex adaptive system.
For this, my favorite shape, little doughnut, springs into a complex adaptive system of interlinked
dynamics, reinforcing feedback, balancing feedback, tipping points, delay, resilience,
redundancy. That's the world of Donalamedos. So think of it as a complex adaptive system
that will ever be evolving. We can't control it. There's no levers to pull. The best we can
hope for is to steward that system. So how do we want to steward that system? We want to steward it
away from being deeply divisive. We've inherited a divisive economy that captures value and
opportunity in the hands of a few. Here's the rise of the 1%. We need to turn it,
steward that system, into a much more distributive economy. There we go. A system that shares value
and opportunity with all who co-create it. How can we make a distributive economy? So from divisive
to distributive, second big dynamic that we can steward in this complex adaptive system is from
linear and degenerative, stick it in the pipe of production, make staff throw it away.
That's what pushes us over plunge of boundaries into a circular or cyclical regenerative economy
where we use resources again and again from more collectively, carefully, creatively, and slowly.
So from degenerative to regenerative, from divisive to distributive. And then this takes
us to the seventh principle, that what is the future of economic growth? What does the future
look like? I mean, kind of coming back to where we began, the presumption was economies would just
keep growing forever. This says, well, maybe actually we need to be agnostic about growth
because what we really want are regenerative economies and distributive economies. And it
might come some point, indeed, they probably have already come to it in the especially in
high-income economies where they need to grow up, right? Nothing in nature succeeds by growing forever.
It grows, goes through a growth phase, and then it grows up and matures. What would it mean
to create economies that actually mature? Because if we don't do that, we're going to get that.
We're going to induce collapse, which is something very close to your
heart and focus and thoughts, right? So how can we not break? How can we bend? How can we bend
this system so that it actually matures and grows up? So those are the seven ways to think,
and let me just say again, that's just seven. Those are the ones that came really clear and
obvious to me. I bet there's more, and I offer people to keep adding to them.
Bravo. That was fun. I might have to make this entire interview a best of clip. That was
very impressive. Thank you so much for your work. While you were doing that, I wondered if you hadn't
chose being an economist. You could have been a stand-up comedian, and this stuff is not funny,
though. That's the problem, right? You have such a good delivery and are clearly very knowledgeable
and passionate, but these are really serious topics that we need to pass the baton to our youth
and people all around the world. It feels good because we're on the right side of the ledger
of humanity and the biosphere, but we're in a very tough moment. What you just described,
I just fantasize about leaders when Danela Meadows was working on these things in the 70s,
had we adopted some of this thinking then, but we were in the thralls of massive energy surplus.
The thing that I would add to your list is economics has focused on cost, not value,
and energy for what we pay for, just the cost of extraction, gives orders of magnitude more
value to the human enterprise than its cost. That's a big flag in economic theory.
I think for me, what comes very clearly from your work is, if I was to go back and add to,
well, I wrote about a little bit, but more, that the fundamental currency of our economies,
if we really want to get down to currency and to valuation, energy is the second law of thermodynamics.
It's the fundamental currency of life, and so we would do really well to pay a lot more attention
to energy, exactly as you just said. It's treated in economics as a cost, and it's, well, it's been
very low, but actually to understand energy and materiality, and I mean materials, the actual
real materials of the world, and the relationship between energy use and material use, and its
boundedness and its relationship between that and the delicate balance of the ecosystems,
the planetary boundaries, the life support systems of earth, to understand the interrelatedness of
those things, coming back to a point Satish Kumar from makes, how can you claim to be an
economist if you don't yet understand ecology, the living world, the systems on which we depend,
the cycles on which we depend, the materials at hand, it's a deeply physical and energy-based system.
I've been using this new chart. I'll send it to you after we're done. A little triangle that
shows politics, money, and technology as describing society, but then you blow up the screen and that's
just a little triangle on the top, and underneath it is this huge energy like flame, and that's
underpinning all that, and then you blow it up even further, and underneath that is the biosphere
and the ecosystem services of earth that support all of that. So I mean, what is the response from
some standard economists at your school at Oxford or around the world? Are they ignoring
this message from donut economics, or are they ridiculing it, or I mean, it just seems like
so much obvious common sense, or do they secretly agree with you, but the incentive structures of
status and tenure and jobs preclude them from publicly agreeing with you?
So when my book first came out in 2017, there was a lot of ignore. That's the first line of
defense, isn't it, right? If something's threatening, either ignore or kill, it's sort of,
and so there's also some ridicule, or the first comeback was this isn't economics. Now, oh,
no, no, you put your values in here. You see, by starting with the donut, by starting with
human rights and ecological integrity, you started with your values, which astounded me.
Wait, when you start with supply and demand of the market, do you think
you're starting with no values? Do you not realize that everything is starting with a set of values
of what we choose to show, what we choose to measure, and what we choose to call success?
But I have to say, there are, of course, there are, well, the ecological economists started
using it immediately because it brought a visual to what they and the inheritors of
Herman Daley's work have been doing for decades. Feminist economists, urban studies. So outside
of economics departments, many, many other people started using it at business schools because
business happens in the world, in the materiality of climate impacts and labor, labor issues. So
it made sense to them. And increasingly, there are people teaching economics in mainstream
departments who more and more, I mean, I only find out about it when I find out about it, right?
You only know what you know, hear of, who get in touch and say, I'm introducing this into my
macroeconomics class. Partly, I think, because there's a generation of students coming through
who put up their hand and say, what about planetary boundaries? What about the doughnut? The demand is
coming from the students. That's more and more where I see that it's come into economics departments
because the student body are born in, you know, the climate strikers are now at university.
And I see that in the group of student I teach myself. And so they're coming with a much more
political economy expectation of their education. And they're expecting to be taught tools that
will actually equip them with the crisis that they've been born into. So they are pushing
that agenda in a really positive way. But I instead of trying to hammer on the door of
economics departments that are shut, I've never done that. I go where the energy is,
where the interest is, because there's lots of it. And it's in other departments that are
grounded in real world challenges. Like I said, like urban design, urban studies, architects,
doctors actually, doctors who recognize human health and planetary health deeply into woven,
they're bringing it into their degrees. So I'm just going with that energy. And I believe economics,
it's a question to economics, are you, is economics going to catch up and embed itself in
the real world as all the disciplines are doing? And then it will start bringing this in as it is
already creeping in. Personally, I don't think economics will ever voluntarily give up the throne.
I think we'll have to have a crisis. And then new ideas that are laying around will replace
the brittle and outdated 20th century models. Perhaps yours would be one of them. But I don't
think they're going to say, yeah, you know what, Kate's right. That's just not the way of human
status and metabolism, I don't think. I agree. But what I do know is they're going to be crises
and they're coming. And more and more that these crises come. And I think it's in part why the
donut framework, oh yeah, there we are. This speaks to food prices and energy and climate impacts.
And it holds that space. But as you just, in passing quoted Milton Friedman, right, when
crises come, people turn to the ideas that are lying around at the time. And I like to say, well,
I just leave them lying around. Let's have them up and running. And that's why I co-founded Donut
Economic Action Lab. Because when my book came out, what thrilled me was that I was approached by
people who say, I like the ideas, and I want to do this. Some of them were teachers in school.
I'm teaching this to the kids now. It's not on the syllabus, but this is what they should be
learning. Some of them were city councilors, city mayors, state legislature. We want to put this
into practice where we are. So we work with them to start seeding this possibility. And what does
it look like when they actually try and start putting these ideas into practice? So that as
crises come, we can say, like as of today, I can say there are 70 city and local state district
governments around the world who've already chosen to start working with this model to bring about
the transition that they know they want to create. This seeds and grounds prove a practice of a
concept. So that as crisis hit, it's got that credibility. It's got that critical mass of
actual practical use. Yeah. So my podcast and my work is still mostly about educational, but you're
actually taking Donut Economics, the book, the concepts and putting them into practice in your
lab. You just mentioned 70 communities, cities around the world. Like, how are they putting
them into practice? Can you give some example or progress updates or interesting stories?
So I can give you an example. And those 70 are of local governments. There's a whole other group
of community organizations starting it up, but local governments. So the way it, having watched
it from, it began in April, 2020 in the height of the COVID crisis, Amsterdam. We created a city
portrait for them, downscaling the donut to the city. What would it mean for this city to aim to
live in the donut? And they launched it in the midst of COVID because they said, well, we're in
emergency, we're in a crisis right now. But as we emerge from crisis, they will be funding the economy,
we'll be opening up again. It's that question, which direction are we going to go in, right?
Don't waste the opportunity for crisis to change your direction. They introduced it at the heart
of their policy to become a circular city. So they said, they had a vision to create 100%
circular by 2050, 50% circular by 2030. And they recognize that circularity doesn't just mean changing
the flow of materials. It's not merely materials, it has deep implications for livelihoods,
for skills, for distribution, for people's access to transport and food and clothing. So they wanted
to bring the social in, and that's why they saw the donut really help bring together the ecological
and the social in terms of a bigger vision of a circularity policy. And that was a good example
of a place that already has a vision for transformation, put it together with their vision to
get rid of all fossil fuel transport in the city by 2030. So they're really
transforming some big systems here. The donut serves as a visual, clear compass that brings it
all together. And so often, that's the way I see it happening. It's not as if City Mayor sees the
donut and says, oh, that's an amazing idea. Now what shall we do? It's going to be seen by people
in places who already have this sense of we need to transition, we need to transform our systems,
our energy, our transport, our housing, our food systems. They come across the donut. This really
helps bring together these ideas in a clear way that we can communicate. And it's like a big
sale on our ship. It's very compelling vision. And also we're joining others doing it. I've just
come back from Cuenobre in France, where the city have one of the most recent cities to say,
yep, we're adopting the donut. So they downscale it to the national level, I mean, to the city level,
and they actually collect the metrics. What would it mean for everybody here to thrive? And is our
local ecology thriving? Do we have thriving nature in the city? Are we coming back within
planetary boundaries? And what's our impact on people worldwide through global supply chains?
And what kind of metrics could we collect so that this replaces, for example, saying, I'm making
this stat up, but for example, they might say, oh, you know, good knobs, GDP has increased by 1.3%
over the last year. I mean, is that good or bad? Or how will I know anything from that? But if I'm
measuring the metrics of a place in real terms, in terms of people's lives, in terms of the ecological
health and its impact in the world, it's a real story and a much more detailed story about what's
happening here. So they've introduced it. Like many cities transforming their transport systems,
getting reducing cars, bringing in public transit, and much more cycling, they've introduced a tax on
property, actually, because they said we have huge inequality in our city, we need to reduce the
inequalities. So this is a quite an elected local government with pretty progressive mandate that
are saying, yeah, this helps us go in that direction. And just in terms of the kinds of actions that I
see when I go to cities like Konob, like Barcelona, like Copenhagen, what recurs to me again and again
is a beautiful phrase that the environmental journalist George Mombio once wrote. He wrote
about the UK. He said, look, what we have here is private luxury and public squalor. And what we
need is public luxury and private sufficiency. And when I go to places like these cities, I see,
oh, yeah, this is what public luxury looks like. Fantastic public parks, incredible mobility, low
cost, fast, clean, efficient transport, good quality social housing. And we have private
sufficiency. And in France, there's a word that's really gaining currency, sorpriety. If you say
sobriety in English, people think, oh, you're not going to drink alcohol anymore. It's got that very
literal meaning. But sorpriety in France means a dignified sense of I have enough. This is sufficient.
My material needs are met. My mind and my intellectual life and my cultural and
common's life is flourishing. But sorpriety, it's really interesting to see the way this is gaining
traction. In Sweden, they have a term lagom, which means I have plenty and it's enough.
And we need language like this in more and more cultures to be able to express that sense of
private sufficiency and public luxury. And that's where we should be seeking abundance. So again
and again, I see cities that are actually starting to put this into practice. That's the
vision that they're starting to bring about. I love it. I have so many questions. So here's
the challenge that I see. Last week, I was in Germany and I spoke to a large audience of
climate energy tech investors with the basic messages, we're not going to solve climate change
and help the environment by growing the economy by electric cars and things like that.
And I expected it to not go well, but it went really well. And like this is a D'Nelamedos thing,
you can't understand our situation unless you look at the whole system. And the people in the room,
I told them they were wearing three hats. One was their hat as the managers of the sovereign wealth
fund of Norway or Fidelity or whatever, where they have to generate returns for their investors.
The other hat was their father, mother, sister, parents, whatever, they want to do the right
thing for their family. And then the third thing is they want to do the right thing for the world
as a citizen of the world. The challenges is that our prices and our incentives and our cultural
aspirations are having them focus on that first hat, where there is not a common plan of action,
where all three of those hats can align. And I would imagine that if we had better prices
on non-renewable inputs, if we had a complementary metric to GDP, because I think GDP does
still have some uses, but if there was a well-being metric attached to it for context,
and then suddenly all of your book and all of your seven points would scale massively. But until
that happens, the incentives and the prices that basically we just pay for the cost of extraction,
not the cost of creation or pollution on our main goods, are not going to allow communities and
cities and nations to embrace this writ large. What are your thoughts on that?
So I love those three hats you often I think many people are realizing over time that those
second and third hats, I want to be a good parent and I want to be a good citizen of the world,
these are coming much, much closer together. So I have 14-year-old twins, right? If I imagine
what will the world be like when they are 80 or 90, then I believe there's nothing I can do to protect
them that doesn't actually involve protecting the world because we utterly depend upon a thriving
world. So if you want to be a good parent, you need to care for the whole world and system. As
Janine Benius always beautifully says, you know, a species and a plant or an animal can't be around
for 10,000 generations, so it takes care of the place that will take care of its offspring,
and that's the best we can do. I completely agree that the incentives for the manager of a,
well, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, there's a lot of realigning to do that. But if any major
corporate designed company, the incentives are way off. So just to come directly to your point
about prices, yes, the price incentives are way out. I would fix it not only through changing
prices, but this will also change prices through changing regulations. So I really believe, you
know, I don't think you're advocating, you know, set the right price and the quantity will fix
itself. Like, I really like what Amsterdam are doing. They're just saying, in 2020, they said,
in 10 years time, in 2030, there will be no fossil fuel vehicles in the city, no boats, no cars.
So guys, get, you've got a long, loud legal message. It's very clear this is the transformation
that's happening. So nobody changed the price on that day, but they changed all the signals.
And of course, that has knock on effects of changing all the future expected price.
So we need to put in place regulations that just remove life destroying chemistry and introduce
only life friendly chemistry that just remove fossil fuels from the system. And so that we
put in that long, loud legal message that the system will start to adapt. But I also want to
come back to the point you say that the managers are not facing the right incentives. We can change
the prices that they face, the incentives around them. We can also change the deep design of the
organizations they work for. And one more piece of puppet show. This to me is a really key one.
And in fact, you know, if I could go back and rewrite the sections down economics, this is one
thing that I would bring up much more clearly. And it comes from the work of Marjorie Kelly,
who's a next generation enterprise designer working for the Democracy Collaborative in the US.
Marjorie's book that I read, Regenerative Ownership, she or owning our future, it's called,
she said, you know, you need to look at the deep design of an enterprise. So here's the five
deep design traits, right? What is the purpose of this enterprise? Why does it even exist? What is
it in service of in the world? How is it networked with its employees, its suppliers, its customers,
its industry allies? What relationships does it hold? Does it see everybody else as a competitor
or the allies in transformation? How is it governed? Who's at the table who has voice and
decision making? What are the metrics? How is it owned by shareholders, by a family for 300 years,
by venture capital, by the workers, by the state, because how its own is going to profoundly shape
how it's financed, where that finance is coming from, and what therefore it's expecting or extracting
or demanding. And so is it is the governance ownership and finance going to be in line with
maximizing returns to the owners, which is a very 20th century corporate design? Or is it
actually going to be in line with serving the purpose, which might be sequestering carbon,
building community, creating health? So to me, if I was looking around that room, I would say,
yeah, you're wearing a hat of the manager of the fund and strapped to your body is a structural
design that is informing what you can and can't do, what doesn't, doesn't have materiality in your
decision making. So in addition to prices, and how can we change these deep designs of institutions?
So, but don't it kind of section that we're working with companies that many companies come
to us and say, oh, we want to do business in the donut. We say, fine, we don't want to talk about
the design of your products. I'm sure they're very nice. We don't want to talk about the design of
that. We want to talk about the design of your company, because this is ultimately going to
determine whether or not your company can become regenerative and distributive of the value it
creates sharing that value with all those through the supply chain, rather than maximizing returns
to the owners, the shareholders, or not, whether it's stuck in an old pattern. Because what would
be fine when we talk to companies, I'll give you one example. I was at a circular economy
conference last summer and somebody came up to me at the end. She said, you know, I, she worked
for a major clothing company. She said, I'm head of regenerative clothing. And I've been asked to,
or the sustainability, I've been asked to come up with a line of regenerative clothing for our
company to signal we're part of this revolution. But I'm being told I have to generate 15% profit
returns on profit margins on it from the get go, the standard. There's absolutely no room
for this transformation. She said, it's impossible. I cannot do it. So these companies want the
regenerative label, the regenerative, but they want the bottom line because of the way they're
designed and owned and financed. We need to change that deep design.
So, okay, I'm with you on that, except our entire edifice is supported by the
one time endowment of the carbon pulse. So I don't know in donut economics and the planetary
boundaries, it seems like we're avoiding exceeding nitrogen, CO2, you know, biodiversity limits,
and that these communities are responding because they don't want to exceed those and
they're making like Grenoble and those other places you've talked about. How much of it is
in response to not publicly aware yet, but anticipated depletion of these energy helpers
that we get annually the equivalent of 500 billion human laborers worth of energy that we're just
pulling from the ground? Because as a corporation that wants to make regenerative clothing and
needs to make 15% a year, if you get these cheap fossil helpers, that's going to help you meet your
bottom line a lot easier. So how do we manage that? How does that fit into the story here?
Well, as you said, this one of carbon pulse, it's got a pulse away, right? Whether it's through
peak or whether the evident impacts in the world we need to let go of it and that's the
heart of your work, what happens next. I agree that so going back to the way economics is taught,
we are not taught economics saying, here you are on any course in the early 21st century,
by the way, you're studying economics at the end of a one of massive carbon pulse, which has created
abnormal temporary conditions, one of which the most important of which is because of the
availability of cheap energy, it's given us a phenomenal uplift of growth and we've come to
think that was normal and we need to be aware that that was historic and that's not the future.
So how do we move away from that? That's why I think it's important to question growth,
but I want to come back and question the design of the company because the way these companies are
designed, they're designed on the presumption of growth and therefore the planet may be going to
hand the handcuff, but I want my 15% and that's still deeply written into the mindset, you know,
there's coming out of the financial community, I want my high returns and that hasn't modified at
all in terms of the reality of what can actually be regenerated on a planet that isn't depending on
the extraordinary free cheap labor of fossil fuel, but actually comes back within the regenerative
capacity of renewable energies. To me, that's your question, are we going to get this before
it breaks us? Will we get this and learn to bend? And for me, part of the bending is bending in the
design of our institutions, so we create companies that don't depend upon endless growth, they
understand that they may grow until they're mature in size and scale, but then they can thrive and
then not owned in ways that continually expect to extract surplus profit because
it's not going to come, it needs to be reinvested in the enterprise which is invested in regenerating
the world. You first need to understand it before you can do it, so this is very important, I think.
One of my first podcast guests was Danella Meadows, husband, Dennis Meadows, and when asked
what are some of the pathways forward, he's like one of the prerequisites is to
extend the time horizons of institutions from quarterly or yearly to five years or 10 years
or 20 years, so there's something that some friends of mine are working on called the long-term
stock exchange, which is to duly list current companies on this long-term stock exchange
which makes decisions for all three hats that I mentioned earlier simultaneously,
because otherwise we're just in this short-term have to get the 15% now, we can't look at the
impact on the planet and depletion and these other things, so maybe that's one of the pathways.
Yeah, so I'm going to come back here, whenever I hear like an innovation like that, I come back
here and I think which bit of this deep design of the enterprise or its environment are you there for
adapting? So if you've got the long-term stock exchange, is that going to influence how is that
going to influence how the company's governed? Are you putting, for example, you could have,
if it's a shareholder and company, you could have shares, different voting rights for shares
that are held over decades or that you're committed to hold for many decades so that you give more
voting to the long-term view down to the short-term view. Other companies like Faith in Nature,
a shampoo and beauty company, they recently put literally one of their 11 directors has become
nature, they've put nature on the board because they said we kept asking what would nature do?
Well, let's stop asking this as a sort of hypothetical question, let's put nature on the
board. So nature is represented by an environmental lawyer who says in bringing naturally a long-term
view because nature wants to be the infinite game and thrive forever. So what would nature
vote for us to do on the board? So all sorts of changes that go on between how the company's owned
and governed, bringing in innovations like that, I think this is really where the future of enterprise
design lies and what it depends upon because if we don't bring that longer term and wider
thinking in terms of nature's interest, the supply chain's interest, the workers' interest,
rather than it being dominated and owned by the interests of finance, then we're just stuck in
a model that's just in service to finance and not in service to life. And to me, that's essentially
what fascinates me with your work is this ultimate question of what does it look like to design finance
that's in service to life, that actually finance that could contribute to be and be part of a
regenerative system because the financial system we've created is exponential and extractive and
it's like the antithesis of a living system. I fully agree and the default trajectory is that
the superorganism will eat the doughnut unless things change. So the doughnut is your best known
diagram but you flashed one up earlier which I think is equally important is the embedded economy
that replaces the circular flow of goods diagram and in there you had the household
and the commons. And could you unpack that a little bit? I mean, I assume the household,
you're talking about the care economy and could you expand on the importance of that and why we
need to include that in our metrics, et cetera, going forward? Yeah, so the importance of,
economy and society in the living world, the importance for me of dividing the economy up
was because the very 20th century economic debate and the kind of the debate between Milton
Friedman and or Hayek and Keynes was very much about the relationship and the roles
of the market in the state. And it's fascinating but if you focus only on that,
you get this very 20th century ideological boxing match, you know, you're a free market less
if you're a capitalist or you're a state-loving socialist. And in that boxing match... As if
those were the only two choices. Those are your only two choices, mate. It still goes on today.
I mean, I find it extraordinary, particularly in the US, I find if you critique the market,
oh, oh, oh, so you're a communist? It's like, is that it? So then that's why I like to bring in
new framing and not use that language, just speak in a different space. So the market in the state,
of course, that's what shows up in GDP. That's the market output of the economy. But the way I
think of these four sectors is they are four different ways, really useful ways, each of them,
that we provision for our needs and wants. So we can provision for our needs and wants through
market-based exchange, through price-based market. Adam Smith was onto something, right? The market
is an amazing mechanism with a lot of feedback loops through the price signal, sending messages to
buyers and sellers who never need to meet, who through that mechanism provide things that they
want to supply and buy. A couple of caveats, it only serves those who can pay the rest it ignores,
and it only values what's priced the rest it exploits. So big caveats, which is one of the
reasons why we obviously need the state, the state provisions, public services, public goods for all,
whether it's because it's a natural monopoly or because it's a human right. So we need that.
But this still leaves us in the kind of market-state dichotomy in marketed goods.
Many of our needs and wants are produced and provided through care, through unpaid caring work
in the household, where we all begin every day. It's the domain of the cooking, washing, cleaning,
sweeping, raising the kids, teaching them to be good members of society. None of which is included
in GDP. None of which, and yet which makes life work and it makes it worth it. And then the comments,
which Ellen Ostrom bought from political science into economics and said, well,
how people collaborate not through markets and not through the state, but as a community,
they come together and co-create goods and services that they value collectively.
And this can work very, very well. Garrett Hardin said in the late 60s, oh, the commons,
you know, it's a tragedy. And Ellen Ostrom comes along and says, well, you rift and sort of presumed
that the commons is a tragedy. I actually went and visited some, you know, they actually work really
well. Rice farmers in Nepal or fishermen in Maine, and they actually managed to create rules
that they follow together, collective discussions. There are punishments for breaking the rules.
There are all sorts of codes in place that make the commons work. So I think all economics should
begin, you know, with a classroom with 14-year-olds, teach them these ideas and then just say, go out
in the street. Go out in the street. Just look around you. You'll see the market. You'll see the
state. You'll see household care. You'll see the commons. You'll realize we're immersed in it all,
all of the time. And therefore, each one of us is a producer and a consumer. We play a role in
markets. We're a citizen and a resident, or your parents may be a public servant. They may be a
doctor or a teacher or a bureaucrat. We're all immersed in households. What are you doing in
a household? And what's the politics of household care? Who's doing that work?
And we're all commoners. We're part of a club, part of society. And we suddenly see a much
fuller economic view of ourselves. And then you can start talking about power because there's a
power relationship across every one of these lines, the power between the market and the household.
I know in the US, I understand that women have like how many weeks maternity leave before they
have to come back for work. It's just like weeks, whereas in Denmark, it's parental leave a year
between both parents. Very different negotiations of the market household relationship, but power
between the market and the state. Ronald Reagan famously told us to roll back the state, get out
of the way. Margaret Thatcher did the same. And I think we're seeing a lot of the consequences of
this kind of market fundamentalism, markets crushing out the commons, market society. Often
people say we live in a market society. And then are we now marketizing our relationship with a
living one? That's one of my concerns about bringing a market based economic language of
natural capital accounting or ecosystem valuation to the living world. But there's
relationships, power relationships across all of these lines. And last thing I'll say on this
diagram, one of the most interesting things is when you think about economic provisioning that
happens across these, so the state and the commons, the state commons, partnerships,
how can the state be a good partner to the commons? How can the state support the household
with childcare centers, for example? How can the market and the commons, you can have platform
cooperativism, right? So you can have a commons platform and then people can run small market
based enterprises on that commons. So some of the most interesting economic innovations in our
economies are happening at the intersections of these. And if you don't start by seeing them all
of them, you'll miss it. And you'll miss out that space of innovation. So yeah, this is a kind of
base map. If the donor is the compass, the embedded economy diagram is the base map. And it's
a real tribute to Herman Daley, it says, whenever you see a diagram of economy, you've got to draw
the living world around it and say, this is a closed system. And this is an open subsystem,
deal with it, create finance and create economic systems that actually
thrive within the dynamics of the living world.
Are you teaching right now or are you full time with Donut Economics Action Lab and etc?
I do teach a little bit in one course in Oxford, but I threw Donut Economics Action Lab through
teaching in Oxford. So I actually, no, let me rewind that. Two days after Herman Daley died,
I was giving a lecture on a kind of critiques of, you know, mainstream economics and new
economics. And some students rushed up to me afterwards and they just said,
why aren't all first year economic students taught these ideas? And it was just kind of
real frustration. And I just felt it was because Herman Daley had just died and just this
damn, the battle has really been passed to this generation now. So I just thought,
why the heck isn't it not? So I live in Oxford, I haven't to live in Oxford, I moved here 20
years ago to work for Oxfam and here I am. So my local university, Oxford University,
and I teach there. And I thought, right, I'm going to put on a course that's open to all students
who come to the city of Oxford, where the Oxford University, Oxford Brooks University,
there are two universities here, to study economics in any kind and it's free and it's on and it was
at night and it was student organized and it was fantastic. And we had 200 students to the
whole thing throughout eight weeks. Now, the reason I did it here in Oxford was to develop the
materials that I now want to turn into a course that we can share online with everybody. So
part and this is my work at Donut Economics Action Lab. How do we, you know, the real question of
Donut Economics Action Lab is how can we put these ideas in the comments? I've now put all the ideas
of Donut Economics in the comments and we share them and we've turned them into tools for cities
and tools for communities and tools for business. We ask only, as commoners, we ask that people
share back their learning and their innovation because that's what means we collectively learn.
But part of this is the future that we plan is to provide more training, provide more courses,
and provide the materials of those courses so that other teachers can then say,
great slide deck, thank you very much. And now I'm going to go and teach that so that it spreads
and scales. To me, always the question is, how do we help these ideas spread and scale at the
speed that these times demand? And how do you do that with an openness of sharing, but also an
integrity? Making sure the ideas don't get greenwashed along the way. And so it's continually
balancing that openness and integrity. And that's why we're in Action Lab, actually. It's all about
putting ideas into action. And it's a lab because the way we're aiming to do it, well, we're learning
along the way as well how to design these commons well so that they retain integrity, but that
they can spread as fast as possible. And I invite anybody listening to this to come and check out
what we're doing. It's donuteconomics.org. You can see our platform, you can join, you can browse,
you can use the tools. Please be a good commenter. If you use the tools, share back because we know
that the peer-to-peer inspiration, when a mayor says, I'm using this tool in our city, that's just
massive inspiration. It has, you know, has directly traceable impacts on other mayors and counselors
elsewhere who then get the inspiration, but also somehow get the permission. It's time to move.
Let's go. They're going. Amsterdam's going. Copenhagen, Brussels, Barcelona, and Grenoble.
It's time to go. Epo in Malaysia, South Hanna Bay in South Africa. We're on the move.
If I had taken your class, if I had been one of those 200 when I was 18 years old,
it would have completely transformed my entire life.
Well, I think if I had taken Reality 101 with you and in many students, it would transform many,
many lives. And I think these are the foundational courses that a lot of students,
again, as I said, born into climate crisis, born into an era of awareness of global north, south,
black lives matter, and born into a much critical, much more critical awareness of the inequities
thrown up by the systems we've created. They are looking for these tools that will help them
transform the future and at the very least steer through the future that they know crisis is coming
and we need resilience. So, yes, let's spread these ideas, you know, through podcast and through
online courses to make them available as possible. I get no greater thrill than when a teacher writes
to me on Twitter and says, I'm using these ideas and I'm teaching them in my class and it's like,
go, let's go, this is big team work. And we create a big team when we share and feedback and that
lovely feeling of, I mean, I'm part of a really big team and I don't even know the names of all
my teammates, but we're doing this together. Well, you're part of the right team. That's even more
important on behalf of nature and the future. If I can help you in any way on that, obviously,
we're doing this podcast, but let's continue talking offline because I think what you're
doing is so important. You just mentioned inequalities. I know that wealth inequality is
something that you often talk about. It seems that income and wealth inequality are incompatible with
what you envision to be a successful doughnut economy. Do you think that ecologically and
biophysically responsible societies need to go hand in hand with more materially equitable
societies? Yes, definitely. I mean, if I, here's the doughnut. Here's right. Here's the overshooting
and shortfall doughnut. So all the red in the middle is the extent to which people worldwide
are falling short on essential needs. And the outside is the extent to which we're overshooting
planetary boundaries. Actually, it's been updated and the 2022 data would show even more red here,
we're overshooting even more. So the scale of inequality in the world is just gobsmacking.
The richest 1% of people own half of the world's wealth. I can't actually, in my head,
hold that as the scale of inequality that has. There's no way we can meet the needs of all people
within the means of planetary boundaries in such an inequality. Because we need a massive
redistribution of resources and access to resource for all these people who literally don't have food,
health, education, housing, transport. We need to see the most economic growth and the most
well-being growth in the lowest income countries. That's where I absolutely believe that economies,
if we measure them in traditional way GDP, they will grow. Malawi people there live on an average
one and a half thousand dollars per person per year. Massive human shortfall. We need to see that
growth. And the only way that that's going to be possible within planetary limits is for those who
have very large material footprints now, which are very heavily coupled with high incomes,
to combat within planetary boundaries. So creating a far more equitable world globally
and also within nations is an essential part of making it even feasible to think about coming
within planetary boundaries. So yes, they have to be brought together. And many people I know
when they talk about the concept of a regenerative economy would say, well, a far more equitably
distributed economy is part of that. A regenerative system cannot thrive and continue if it's deeply
unequal. And I would agree. The reason I, in my book and in these seven principles, I pulled them
out, I said, I want to just distinguish between or highlight that as well as from degenerative to
regenerative, from divisive to distributive. Because I came working at Oxfam for a decade,
I came very much from a social justice background. And it's really important that the redistributional
intention or the predistributional intention is very, very clear. And I think sometimes when
people, some people hear regenerative and they think, oh, that's just environmental, just ecological.
It's really important to say, hang on, we're rebalancing both the ecological imbalances and
the social imbalances, and they have to happen together. So yes, crucial. And then it goes
back to that lovely phrase from George Monbiot, public luxury, it's accessible to all and
private sufficiency. That is very much a redistributional agenda that would achieve that.
I think we evolved with material equality because we didn't have any energy surplus.
Now this energy carbon pulse has created this just series of multiple scale power laws.
Let me ask you this. Do we need to change the prices and the cultural aspirations
before such a wealth transfer would take place? Because if we keep the same GDP as our goal,
prices are at the cost of extraction, not their real value, and we do a simultaneous wealth
transfer within countries and between countries to the global south, wouldn't that in itself
actually accelerate some of the exceedings of the planetary boundaries?
I think, so I think instead of thinking in terms of prices, I was thinking in terms of the actual,
that's why I prefer to think in terms of the regulation of saying we are going to eliminate
the use of fossil fuels here, whether it's the car or transforming, insulating our homes and
moving away from fossil fuel to renewable energy, so that we just bring down that intensive use
of fossil fuels and make available the remaining carbon budget to other countries that have massively
underused those. So let me ask a follow-up question there. There's a lot of built
infrastructure and momentum and sunk cost in the global north. Is it possibly more likely that a
culture, a community, a region to truly live like donut economics, minimum human needs and
don't exceed planetary boundaries in the global south, in areas that don't have all this infrastructure
and sunk cost of expectations in institutions? Would it be easier to start this in Kenya or
somewhere? I'm just asking. Yeah, and I think it's a really valid question. I think there are
two things pulling in different directions. There is not the sunk cost, there's not the sunk
infrastructural structure that's been put in place. You haven't got the intensive road-based
culture that say North America has been locked into. In the same way that they've jumped from
no phones to mobile phones, from no banking to e-banking, they've jumped all those institutions
in between. So yes, when there's no infrastructural in place, you can jump to a far better solution
and that must be why the global north and the world makes available resources to invest in
renewable energy, so they jump into renewable energy solution. So on the one hand, you've got the
lack of inherited infrastructure as a barrier, but of course the other side of it is that
high-income countries have so much wealth and resources and technology and skilled people,
so they've got the accumulation of wealth in resources that they can either convert or they
can use that skill and the institutional structures that enable that to happen. So the idea of saying,
you know, oh, this is much easier for Kenya or Malawi, they're on incredibly low incomes and it
would only be easier if we have the transfers that need to happen from the global north to the
global south due to historic responsibilities for climate and other ecological resource use
that should be happening. I mean, I think of countries in kind of three clusters
heading towards the donut, there are the low-income countries that like the ones we just
been mentioning that need to meet the needs of all people for the first time without overshooting
planetary boundaries in the way that countries before them have done and that's never been
done before. There's the middle-income nations like China and Iran and Mexico and Russia that
meet people's needs for the first time. Well, already coming back within planetary boundaries,
that's never been done before either. And then there's the high-income nations
that are in massive. All high-income nations are overshooting planetary boundaries.
If I showed you their national donuts, they're like big red overshoot. So first of all,
next time you catch or I catch anybody here or find ourselves saying developed countries,
advanced nations like, hang on, what are you talking about? Because there's absolutely nothing
advanced or developed about overshooting planetary boundaries. So we should be reframing our language,
but these nations need to reduce and come back within planetary boundaries, not just on carbon,
big one, but also on water use, land use, material use, all of those planetary boundaries calming back
within while finally meeting people's needs for the first time, which they definitely have the
resources to do. And that is an unprecedented pathway too. So every nation is on a pathway of
transformation. None of it's been done before. Some have the advantage of wealth. Some have the
advantage of not being locked in to existing infrastructure. And some, I think many of the
emerging economies, they're in the middle of those big infrastructural investments.
And this is the critical time to get it right. And of course, I think one of the dangers is the
fossil fuel industry, when they find themselves being closed in the global north, the real risk
is that they then go and sell their wares to the lower-income countries to get them locked in.
And how do we avoid them getting that lock in instead moving to the renewable energy future
that will actually power them and enable them not to get locked into endless growth. They
need to grow now, but not get locked into institutions that drive them to endlessly.
So what is the correct term, developed world that's creating global ecocide or the global north?
I mean, what is the acceptable term? Do you have any come up with something?
I use just very factual language of high-income, middle-income, and low-income because I'm just
describing their income levels. But I think we really need new language because the more that
we find ourselves saying, even if people say, well, developed nations, but you know what I mean
by that. But it still just keeps creating this idea that that's the aspiration and others should
get there. And I find it very powerful when I show national donut diagrams to countries like
Norway. You mentioned Norway, but people are whole Norway. I'll be in Norway, wonderful life,
high-income, great quality of air, and you can swim in the harbor, what's not to like.
Norway has a massive ecological overshoot, like all high-income nations. And when you show them
these images and that high-income countries are very far from living in the donut, Costa Rica is
much closer than any other nation. There's a real jaw drop moment, actually. And I've seen it visibly
on the face of officials of nations who used to being considered the top of the ranking. And
actually, it really repositions. And there's a humility that kicks in that there's that uh-huh,
or maybe it's an odir or gosh, look at us moment, that we need of humility and ambition of we too
need to deeply transform. And last century's economic theories were not designed to solve this.
So we really shouldn't be expecting them to deliver on this. We need new theories,
new textbooks, new courses, new ideas, new policies to get us there.
I just saw a graph this morning, which is another sort of a-ha, that Norway is probably the most
successful nation in the world on scaling electric vehicles, but their oil use is going up. So the
addition of electric vehicles replacing internal combustion vehicles has not reduced their oil
consumption. Is it their domestic oil consumption? Because I know they're a massive oil producer
and selling oil to others, but even domestic oil consumption.
The domestic consumption, yeah. I'll send you the chart. So here's a question, Kate.
And this gets to the competition versus cooperation, game theory dynamics of the world,
but if a country or a city or a region chose to, let's, we're going to live
in the doughnut. We're going to follow this from an energy surplus, power, money, potential
optionality on doing things in the world, they will be temporarily at least outcompeted
by those nations that continue to maximize profits because those profits can be spent
on things that either militarily or technologically will cause that first few nations or communities
to be outcompeted, not in the long run, because in the long run, it's a tortoise and hare sort
of thing and the tortoise we know ends up winning the race. But in the short run, they'll be outcompeted.
Isn't that an inherent like blockage to wide scale adherence of these ideas? What do you think
about that? Yeah, an important point. So let me start at the level of the city. When cities
actually start aiming to do this, I think they actually, they might not have, you know, grow,
grow, grow the city and many city policymakers say, that's not our goal. That's not what we
judge a success for our city, to get bigger, to bring in more and more big companies, to expand
more and more housing. People are creating cities that are great places to live where you can move
quickly, where the air is clean, where there are good schools for kids, where there's nature,
where you feel you won't be hit by a heat wave in the summer. These are all qualities of living
in the doughnut, where there's a strong community, there's public luxury. This brings people in.
I mean, these city connoble is an example. People are moving to connoble. It's seen as a, actually,
that's a really desirable place to live. So the city scale, I think, actually, it's a signal,
especially for industries where people can work remotely and parents as they can have their
parental hat and their work hat and I can actually be around for my kids and I can reconnect and I
want to raise kids here. It brings crowds of people in. So we need those bold civic leaders
to go in this direction, to then act as pilots of success living this way.
Yes. And I'm not surprised that cities are starting. Cities are more sites of experiment
and courage to start moving and I think nations are going, I'm hoping and I'm expecting nations
are starting to look at what's happening in cities and saying, actually, this is,
this is the seeds of proof of concept and can we start doing this national? But
this point you just raised, I think, is a really big one. And I, when we, when we say, okay, we need
to move away from growth dependency, the question becomes, how are economies currently structurally
dependent upon endless growth? And there are at least eight ways, right? There's four financial
ways companies pursue maximum returns for their shareholders, that drives growth, commercial
banks create money as interest bearing debt, that drives growth. When, if the economy is not growing,
but companies are still chasing labor productivity, that creates unemployment, so you need growth to
absorb the unemployment. On the other side, social lock-ins, right, people still after
100 years of propaganda, thank you very much, Edward Bernays for succeeding, right? Convincing
us that the way we will improve ourselves is to buy something more, so there's that kind of consumerism.
Having a growing economy helps avoid the ultimate redistribution question. And so it avoids actually
having to tackle redistribution. But one of them, a really important social lock into growth, and
it's kind of geopolitical lock into growth, as you just mentioned, I look at the G20 photo that's
taken every year, and I think, well, no leader wants their country to lose their place in that
G20 family photo. But if one of those nations, amongst them, said, we're no longer going to pursue
growth, we're going to pursue a resilient national economy, well, there is, particularly in the current
atmosphere in the world, there is the geopolitical power and military power and resilience against
threats. And I think European countries coming together and creating a region is one very good
example of how countries, individual countries can overcome that by saying, well, we together,
we are stronger, we stand so that we don't individually all have to keep growing, we keep,
you know, the size of us together. But I, but to me, this is one of the very
most challenging lock ins to structural dependency on growth. And I don't think the solution is an
economic question. I think it's a political international relations question. And just as
much as I would love these ideas to be taught in economics departments, I think every student
studying macroeconomics should absolutely be encountering a macroeconomics course in post
growth thinking. I think all schools of government should be introducing their students to questions
of how can we create, think about geopolitical power and power dynamics and relations and
international relations in a post growth context, because you've just pointed out one of the most
critical collective action problems we have. Why are schools of government not grappling with this
head on? I think they're too much influenced by schools of economics that again, thanks to that
one time power polls from fossil fuels, assume that growth is the norm. And so we do international
relations in the context of assuming growth is the norm for all nations. I think it's time to move on.
I think I on one of our one on one calls, I think I told you this story, but in the last 10 or 15
years when I'm talking to high level government people around the world, almost all of them were
either themselves or directly flanked by a PhD in economics or finance, like everyone. And it's
like they're the gatekeeper to the politician. So it makes these things hard. And there's like a
glass ceiling of what can be discussed at those levels. Except you were highlighted last month
at a Beyond Growth Conference, which the head of the EU Commission president started out. That
must have been a proud moment for you to highlight such an amazing thing at the European Commission.
Yes? Yeah. So the group of MEPs in Europe organized the Beyond Growth Conference
in the European Parliament. And it was opened by a Sivandala and she,
it was it was impressive to see her there. I say it was really important to see her there.
And to see her saying, I think she said, you know, fossil fuel based growth is in the past.
And it's got yeah, she didn't say just growth. No, she said fossil fuel based growth. Yeah.
It's still a win. But the fact that she came to a conference and stood on a platform where
it said very large letters behind a Beyond Growth. That's that's very different from 10 years ago.
And it was really important that that conference happened. And many excellent post growth thinkers
across Europe, degrowth, post growth, donate economics, well being economies
were there and talking about what does it mean and indeed not just Europe from around the world.
Really starting to dig into what does it mean in terms of the metrics, in terms of the macroeconomic
policies in terms of the labor transition, in terms of business design, showing that there is a whole
other form of economic thinking emerging and ready to be taken far more seriously. So I think
it was very, very important that that happened in the European Parliament. And again, I was
delighted to be presenting the ideas of donate economics there and talking about using these
metrics because I could point to so many pretty major cities in Europe, Brussels, the city capital
region of Brussels itself, Barcelona, where am I trying to say Amsterdam, Copenhagen,
Tome Lila in Sweden and more and more, Bad Nauheim in Germany. Some pretty big European
cities are saying, yeah, this we are choosing this the donut framework as our own new metric.
So again, it's from the city and regional level that it I know it brings it currents,
credibility and recognition within European Commission. And actually, there's been within
the European Commission, there's a group of civil servants within there who for the last
least three years from just before COVID, they created a group called Donut for EU. And they
within different European Commission and European Union institutions started saying, we want to
bring this language. And for me, it's a win. I don't, you know, you don't need to see the
diagram of the donut. You don't need to hear the word donut whenever I hear a policymaker saying
we are aiming for well being or living well within planetary boundaries or limits or within the
means of the planet. To me, the word within is a radical word, because you again, you're hearing
it the economy within the biosphere. So every time I hear a policymaker speak to a vision of
well being within the planet, you think, hallelujah, we are into a new paradigm with that one little
word, we're in a new space. So one of my addictions is unfortunately buying URLs that I might someday
use. And one of them I bought 10 years ago was livewithin.org. And it's just, I keep renewing it,
I haven't had time. Speaking of time, how the hell do you manage all this? You were like
the degrowth energizer bunny. I mean, do you have, do you come up with all these graphical
tools yourself? Or do you have like a professional PR toolmaker? Or are these your ideas?
Are you saying did I pay somebody to make these bits of cardboard for me?
Well, no, I meant the ideas. Like I want a graphical tool.
So, okay, so when donut economics came out, the thrilling thing for me was the number of people,
as I said, who came up and said, love the ideas, and I want to do this. I'm a town counselor,
I'm a teacher, I'm a startup founder, I'm a community organizer. So that's why I set up
together with a team, donut economics action lab. We are a remote team. There are 12 of us
working across different countries. And together we are creating these tools. So we knew right
from the beginning that cities would say, what would it mean to do the donut city? So we created
a tool, came up with a kind of conceptual framework that we make as a canvas, meaning it's
something you can put on the table, you can literally, you know, put things on it, make it
very visual, very tactile, very unknown, no equations in sight. We don't need equations for this.
It's a worldview reframing activity. And we do it in person. And you can do it online. So everything
we do, because we're a remote organization, it really helps us think remotely. And we make all
of our tools available on Miro and online, so that we can run web, for example, the government of
Bhutan got in touch. And they said, you know what, the concept of gross national happiness,
which guides us, it's actually got a lot in common with the donut. We want to see what happens when
we work together with the two concepts. And we ran some webinars for 100 civil servants of Bhutan
online to share these tools with them. So I'm working with a team of 12 people, and I have to
say one of the best things for me going from working alone when my book came out. And all,
you know, the interest that was coming, it was almost bouncing off me because there was nothing I
personally could do with it. But now there's a team. I say, you're a mayor and you don't want to
talk about cities. Let me introduce you to my colleague, Leonora. She's our city's lead. You
want to talk about business? You want to talk to Eric Sahan. You want to talk about communities?
Meet Rob. Talk about education. Meet Carolina. We've got this wonderful team of people who are
running with each of these and bringing practitioners together in a community and
conversation of peer learning groups. So it's a thrill for me in setting up an organization and
a team with my co-founder Carlotta Santh, setting up this team to say, how can we make this work
distributive? Just like this ball, right? At the beginning, it was all coming at me and this is
just like, I can't cope with all this. But let's distribute it across our team, but also across
the community. Of course, I'm working too hard and running too much, like many, many people and
personally, you think this is at risk of running me down and the times are urgent and the crisis
is now. And because of the crises that are hitting in the world, more and more people are suddenly
waking up and looking around for those ideas that are lying around. So how do we make sure that
they're really visible, really accessible? And yes, these are very serious issues, but how can we
make them irresistible? Because the last thing you want is people to say, you know what, this is
just too complex, too overwhelming. I find it depressing and overwhelming. I'm just going to
switch off from it. I want people to say, that looks energizing, inspiring. I want to be part of
it. And then to lean in. And that's why I aim to make it playful. Well, actually, I just also like
having fun. Hell, let's have fun while we're on this team, right? It's got to be the most fun
place to work. It's got to be the funnest project to do, rather than just extracting from the world.
Let's repair the world and have fun while we do it. So it's the team at Donut Economics Action
App and the community of over 10,000 people who've joined our website and our platform. And it's
just I get energy from every time somebody comes and says, oh, yeah, I'm using this in my town.
I'm teaching this in my classroom. I've used this in my class. It's just amazingly energizing because
we can see all the challenges in the world. And yet time and time again, you see people,
the opposite is happening. And it's not publicly visible all the time, but it's rising. It's
bubbling. It's rising. And I'm just going to lean all my energy I have into helping keep that rising.
Well, congratulations. With just 12 people, you are punching way above your weight on the
impact of sharing these stories with other people. By the way, last week I was traveling and I saw
signs there is already a national donut day, which in the United States, people actually just eat
donuts. So I'm very happy there will be an international donut day with our planetary
boundaries. One final question before I get to the closing questions. So you were at this
Beyond Growth Conference. You and I have talked about this before. I often state that degrowth
is what we should do because of global inequality and because of resource and climate limits.
But the metabolism of the system won't allow that. So we will hit a wall and then
bend, hopefully not break. So degrowth is what we should do, but post growth
is what we're going to have to do. So the way I see it is there's two tasks here. One is to
describe and flesh out and advocate for what a sustainable, desirable society might look like
with the governance and the commons and the care economy and everything you've stated. And then
how do we get from here to there, which is a related but distinctly separate question. Do you
have any thoughts on that dichotomy? So definitely spelling out the vision of where we want to get
to. And I really appreciated that you said that earlier on. I said, you know, it's easier said
than done. You said, yeah, but it's really important to say it. So we have a vision of it.
And that is where I've placed my energy. And again, in this big teamwork, that's the
role I've focused on playing of how can the donor acts as a vision of where we want to get to.
And it's an aspirational positive vision. And then setting out some of the fundamental diagrams
and the principles that would be part of an economy that's got there. And then there's a
question of, okay, if we do keep going, if we fail to turn and keep accelerating at the wall,
will we bend or break? I would say that I think the degrowth community, as I understand it,
they would say, when you say, can we bend not break? I mean, they would say degrowth is the
aim to bend. That's what people in the degrowth community mean by a just reduction of consumption
and production of less necessary things to come back within planetary boundaries in a democratic
way. That that is a beautiful vision of a bend. But I hear you're saying, well, if we don't bend
in time, then we're going to hit crisis. And it's going to be through shocks and through subsystems
collapsing that we're going to be forced into a post growth future. Just one reflection I'll
have on that. And I'm not saying having set out how to get there. I do think we need a positive
vision of what we're still aiming for. I think really key to that is looking at going back to
what are the structural dependencies on growth and how do we remove them? Doing that work now
gives us the best chance to survive an era in which growth doesn't come. And that's why I think
it's really an ethical obligation on economists to look at this, you know, the radical uncertainty
of the future and the existential challenges of what happens if the growth based thinking gets
it wrong. I think puts a huge ethical obligation on looking at alternative futures. But if I come
back and think, well, what if we find out that we're going to, you know, if we break, we don't
bend well, we will find we're actually spending much of the century continually outside of
planetary boundaries and people falling short. And the more that we stay out here, the more that
these crises are going to hit, the more the shocks are going to hit us. And the first time I asked
myself, okay, what if it turns out that much of the 21st century is going to be lived outside of
these boundaries and continue to be so? Does that change the goal? I still, it didn't make me move
away fundamentally from saying that the goal is still to come back to the donut. The goal still
to be as resilient as we can is to create systems that provision essentially for people's needs and
do everything we can to combat, you know, every inch here matters. Every inch matters the closer
we come to coming back within those boundaries. So it didn't dislodge for me the value of this
way of thinking. And I would love it to be dislodged. And I can I just add a comment here,
which is the donut may have come after, you know, kind of our common future, the Brentland
Commission and that definition of sustainability. And then we get footprints and the long comes
the donut. And I'm very aware it stands in a line of thinking. And whenever I teach it, I always
say to students, and then what next? This is a, it's not a fight. It's not an endpoint. It's a
point a long way. Our thinking is evolving. More people are coming saying, I want to create
something more biocentric, more nature centered. What would that look like? So I look forward also
to the day that the donut framework has been superseded, because we've moved beyond it, because
there's a generation rising who instead of seeing the donut, wow, I've been waiting my whole life
to see that like a 50 year old might say that, yes, I've always thought like this, 20 year old,
you show them the donut and they go, yeah, yeah, I get it. Come on. And go further. They're born
into that expectation. It's quite thrilling to see that. What are they going to create?
What's coming next? Well, you've, you've done such important work on the Overton window of just
thinking about how a new economy might be. I almost think that, and we've talked about this before,
that I'm trying to work on something called advanced policy, which is those things we're
going to need to do in the future that are politically and socially too strange and forward
to be accepted today. But if there was like a donut break glass in case of emergency blueprint
that all governments, you know, city, county, national had like a rule of principles and then
what to do once we're in this situation. But based on some of the core seven things that you
laid out, I think that might be kind of interesting. I like that. Yeah, yeah. Because I think at the
first rule is please break the glass now and use the donut now. Don't leave it.
Don't leave it sitting in the cabinet until the crisis hits, right? Well, at its core,
and you mentioned Eleanor Ostrom a couple times, at its core, I think we face a crisis of governance
because our governments were not created or the institutions for this sort of a world and we're
just stuck in our ways looking at old forms of governance and institutional thinking. So I mean,
I think education is the first central point and this is great. So I have some closing questions,
Kate, that I ask all my guests if you have a few more minutes. So more broadly beyond your books,
your teaching and the Donut Economics Action Lab, you've thought about since the 90s when you had
your aha moment and you left the dark side as it were these issues as a career choice. Do you have
any advice just to the listeners or watchers of this program at this time of global poly crisis?
If you are embedded in a world view that sees growth as the goal, really deeply ask yourself
a question that and move to, okay, my biggest piece of advice is to
tap into what we deeply know in our own bodies, right? In our own bodies, we know that health
doesn't lie in growth. I mean, when kids are small, yeah, that's a great sign of health. And then
there comes a point where you don't want them to grow anymore. It comes to thriving and health lies
in balance in our bodies. We really get that. I need enough food and not too much. I need enough
temperature and warmth and not too much. I need enough water, oxygen, stress on my body to
enough and not too much salt, whatever you want to add. That my bodily health lies in balance.
And if something inside my body tries to grow unstoppably, we call that cancer and we move
in and we stop it as soon as we can. We deeply understand that and each one of our own bodies
is a complex adaptive system. So each one of us is a miniature living ecosystem planetary
experiment. If we can take therefore what we deeply know, not just metaphorically, but really
deeply from the human body to the planetary body and say what makes sense for human health,
makes sense for planetary health and how then do I live when I tap into that
thinking and how do I eat and travel and invest and divest and protest and volunteer and how do I
protect the health of my body as part of the health of the whole planet back to
how does a parent look off their child by looking off the world, it's deeply interconnected.
That I think when we tap into that, we give ourselves the best metaphorical opportunity
to understand the much greater living system of which we are part.
Sobriete and Lagom. Yes. So how would you change that advice to a young human,
17, 18, 19 year olds who are sitting in your Oxford class? Do you change your recommendations
for a young person? Well, so these these many of these young people, as I said, they grew up
climate striking. Their teenage years were spent marching for a stable climate. They've come from
a very different place. And I would say to them have the courage of your age. And I mean your youth.
You know, I've been in places where a young person came up to me after a talk and she said,
I really wanted to ask a question, but I'm only 17. And I said, wait,
you should have put up your hand and say, I am 17. And this is my question because actually your
youth is part of your power and your saliency in this room and your presence and your long term
view to which we all owe you a long term answer. So hold on to that clarity of the demands of youth
and carry it through into the classroom and question why you're being taught models that
smell deeply dated to you. Because the biggest change that I've seen coming through,
like we're saying in academic economics, was when the students demanded it's coming from
below, it's coming up and believe that systems get transformed, you know, find out about the
history of the civil rights movement and Gandhi and the decolonization movement and the suffragettes
and the women's rights movements and always remember that it's been the rebels and the
disruptors who were so deeply inconvenient at the time and often maligned. They are now
celebrated on the classroom walls as the heroes of the age. And so those who protest and disrupt
and disturb the system, you are doing key work of transforming this. And I would say those young
people get involved because we know, you know, psychologists tell us and people feel, if the
people feel an anxiety or a stress of the context, it's when you get involved and you start actually
channeling your energy into being part of it and working with others and collaborating with others
who think like you, that you feel energized and empowered in this situation rather than
depressed and overwhelmed in the same situation. The situation around us is the same. How do we
change it by changing how we engage with it? Well, I feel energized and inspired whenever
you and I talk. So I agree with you that finding like-minded people that share your ideals and
visions of the future is one of the biggest pieces of advice I give to young people. And
there's a 17-year-old in all of us, isn't there? For sure. But I can't imagine being 17 today. I was
just complete child when I was 17 relative to the 17-year-olds that were my students learning
about ecology and complex adaptive systems. You know, the world is caught up to this story, Kate.
Can I just say then, when COVID lockdown happened, my kids were 11, my teenagers, and
we had to homeschool them. So I was like, oh, homeschooling. I thought, well, I know what,
I'm going to homeschool them first. I'm going to teach them system thinking. Because I had once
argued, I'd presented the seven ways to think like a 21st century economist with a very mainstream
professor, economics professor in the Netherlands. And he said, system thinking is far too difficult
for undergraduates to understand. So I thought, okay, let's take this on. So I taught it to my
11-year-olds. We sat down with a big white board. I drew some, here's a reinforcing feedback. Here's
a balancing feedback. And we drew some basic feedback loops about COVID. And then I just handed
over the pens and they went wild with it. And they drew, you know, from people playing the guitar
in the back garden to pressure on nurses, to pressure and accountability of the government.
And they just brought everything in. But my daughter, she was jumping up and down with excitement.
And she's like, now I can express what I want to say. You're born systems thinkers. Now we've
given you the tools and language. You can, because you could see these feedback loops in the world.
So it's also an incredibly exciting time to be educated. If you're equipped with some of the
ideas that are going to actually help us go forward. That's why I just, I find it exciting.
Hand over these tools to young people. Now, what are they going to see? What are they going to do?
And what, what will they envision that we can't see? Because we're, you know, I'm 52. I'm, I'm,
there are so many possibilities that I just can't see. So I love that feeling of the generational
handover as well. Let's see what the next generation do with this. I think we, as a culture, massively
underestimate teenagers. And I really loved teaching 18 and 19 year olds, Reality 101.
But I actually think it, it has to start earlier, 12, 13, 14, 15 on these things. Because this is
a huge resource. That's just being taught outdated trivia relative to what the world's going to need.
So, so what do you care, a personal question, what do you care most about in the world, Kate?
So I am deeply inspired by Janine Benius, my memory thinker. She's one of my heroes. And
it's hearing Janine talk about life, life's capacity to create conditions conducive to life.
That fills me with awe. I'm not a religious person. But if I'm filled with awe of a miracle,
of a marvel, it is the regenerative capacities of life on this planet. And the, the systems that
keep reproducing conditions conducive to life. That is what I care about most as a living being
on this planet. And that's why I care about economics, the art of household management,
being in service to planetary household and creating an economy that is in service to
continuing to produce conditions conducive to life.
Other than when we first said hello, the biggest moment of joy in the last three hours for me was
I saw a red fox across the road from me on my bike ride this morning. And yeah, the, the planet
is an amazing thing, even in its depleted state on the biosphere relative to a century ago, it is
still a wonderful, amazing place, the only place in the known universe to harbor life, let alone
complex life. So last couple of questions, what specific issue are you most concerned about in
the coming 10 years or so in the world? I'm going to say, well, two things. One, we know more
crises are coming, we know more ecological impacts, we know more food price crisis will come when
for harvests fail, when there are floods. One of my big concerns is how, coming back to the point
in governance, how will we govern ourselves in those moments? How will we respond? Will we revert
to ration economic man and horde? And will, will powers extract as much as they can? This is a great
moment to make your 15% folks. Will we respond like that? Or will we move towards Eleanor Ostrom's
description of the Commons where we actually recognize that if any of us are going to get
through it, it's because we're all going to aim to get through it and we're going to collaborate.
So to me, it's that concern of what is the groundwork that we put in now so that as those crises hit
nations, will they shut their borders or will they collaborate? What happens over COVID vaccine?
What happens during food price crisis? How do nations respond to one another? That's the concern.
And then the really bigger, longer term question of a deeper understanding. Well, it's for me,
it's finance. I really, I still haven't done this. So I want more conversations with you.
How do we take finance that was designed to endlessly accumulate? That's what financial
capital has got into its current DNA. How do you repurpose that utterly human creative design?
It's a human construct. How do we redesign that? So it's compatible with life on a planet that aims
to continually produce conditions conducive to life. That's my, that's my, so it's not my,
that's not my worry. That's my big curiosity. That's the, that's the next step of this that I
want to much more deeply understand. Because until we redesign finance, not just tweak it,
not just tweak it, but really redesign finance, we are not going to be creating systems,
economic systems that actually belong on this planet.
I agree. And I have ideas to be continued on that. So if you could wave a magic wand and there was
no personal recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and
planetary futures? Magical. I would wave a wand that would help every person on the, I mean,
every person on the planet would realize, feel, recognize that we human beings are an utterly
interdependent and dependent part of the web of life. And if we got that, if we really got that,
and understood our dependence upon the whole earth's living systems, that to me is the deepest
change that would then follow through. I mean, of course, you're going to run into the designer
institutions and that, but if we all deeply got that, and the next generation rising has that,
to me, that's the best implant that we can put into our hearts and minds that would help us
redesign systems so that we actually belong again on planet earth, that one.
You're not the first person to suggest that. We need a change in consciousness with a large
amount of people in order to get to these change in aspirations and the doughnut. And it is happening,
I think, it's happening slowly. But I'm amazed versus two years ago how many people are expressing
these ideas, perhaps in no small part to your work. Awesome. So this was our first public
conversation. I know your work. If you were to come back in the future for round two,
is there one particular topic that you are passionate about that's relevant to our
futures that you would like to take a deep dive on? Any ideas? It's going to be finance.
I'm going to be asking questions. Deep dive into, okay, how does this even begin to look?
What is the structural design of finance? I mean, I always ask, well, I often say,
isn't it weird that a squirrel gathers nuts in the autumn and buries them? When the squirrel
comes back in January, it doesn't expect to find 15% more nuts. So why do we expect to put money
into something and expect to come back and get you 15%? So how could we redesign finance?
What are the lock-ins to the current financial system we have? Is it possible for a new financial
system to emerge alongside the existing one? What would have to change in people's own aspirations
and sobriety and lagom to put their finance in something? What would be the offer? All of that.
I have started a new thing. You might not know of, but once a month, we have a reality roundtable
with three or four former guests on a topic. Maybe to have you and Steve Keane and Josh Farley
or John Erickson to talk about this question would be really good. That'd be great. I'm in.
Thank you so much for your time and all your work and to be continued, my friend.
And thank you, Nate, for this podcast because you're bringing so many voices together in one
place that I know it's a hugely valuable resource for many, many people. So thank you for this
hosting, very generously hosting other people's ideas. I really salute you for that.
