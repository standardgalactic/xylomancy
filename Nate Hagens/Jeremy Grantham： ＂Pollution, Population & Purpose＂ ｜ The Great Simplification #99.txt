One of the main things in life is purpose, and most people born in the history of man
have not had particular purpose other than staying alive.
We have an opportunity to not just stay alive, earn a living, feed yourself, but we have
an opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out for more or less
ever.
Today I'm pleased to welcome Jeremy Grantham to the great simplification.
Jeremy almost 50 years ago founded the investment firm GMO, where the G stands for Grantham,
and by societal metrics he is now a billionaire, though in this conversation he corrects me
on the definition of that.
I got an amazing mind and I long ago followed him because in his GMO research notes back
when I oversaw the oil drum he was writing about phosphorus and about oil and about
climate change and integrating lots of the same topics in the biophysical economics
field where I reside.
It's very encouraging to me to have such a financially successful person, almost fully
dedicated to environmental causes, particularly climate change, endocrine disrupting chemicals,
plastics, population, and I hope this conversation can act as an overton window or a siren song
to more people of means to look at the big picture of how energy, humans, and the environment
fit together.
There is no greater story.
Please welcome Jeremy Grantham.
I have so many questions for you because you are what I might refer to as everything bagel
as far as understanding the human predicament.
Not only are you an expert in finance and stock market and conventional investing, but
you also deeply care about the environment, including but not limited to climate change.
Let me start by asking you this.
We live in a culture that the last generation or so has rewarded reductionist experts like
real estate developers or physicists and we don't really reward generalists who know
something about everything and how things fit together other than maybe librarians and,
in your case, hedge fund managers.
How did you begin your lifelong career interest and how everything fits together in multiple
subjects and when and why did you start to integrate specifically energy, ecology, and
the environment into your worldview?
There are people like us that when confronted with any situation, eventually get around
to saying what are the bigger issues that circle around the outside of what we're doing
and how do they interrelate and then gradually your familiarity expands outwards and if you're
curious enough, you keep on going and whether you like it or not, you're thereby becoming
a generalist because you want to know what causes, what causes, what causes and you work
your way, in my case, quite slowly from the stock market, what drives the stock market,
what drives people, what are the big issues, what are the weaknesses of human beings, what
are the problems, therefore, that come out of our weaknesses and pretty soon you arrive
at nature and then you get into the whole thing about what we owe to nature, what it
contributes to our well-being, to a true benefit GDP, if you will, as opposed to the actual
GDP, which is a list of costs when you get down to it, not benefits and so onwards and
upwards, nature, aspects of nature, limitations, Kenneth Balding, the finiteness of the world,
spaceship earth, hurtling through space with only what it has, there are no space stations to go
and reload with fuel or torpedoes or anything, you've only got what you've got and if you
think about what rules and regulations you would need for a multi-generational space trip in a
rocket, it gives you some ideas of what rules you really should have on planet earth and you
keep on going until you end up with my self-described job at work, which is underrated long-term
problems and that has been a fabulously rewarding era for about 15 years because they are the things
that are really interesting, obviously they're the things that really matter and they are
bottomless pits, so you'll never know too much, you keep trying and you still only know a tiny
fraction of the problem and pretty soon you're on a podcast with you.
Well, since we both have financial backgrounds, let me follow with this question, we don't have prices
or incentives to solve most of those underrated long-term problems, so I've had a lot of financial
people that understand energy on this podcast and I know a lot of them in my circles, but it seems
that the more financially focused people are, the less they're focused on the environment, not so
much in your case, how do you integrate what's going on there because a lot of financial people are
almost to the point of cognitive dissonance dismissing climate change and other environmental risks.
I am absolutely shocked over the last 30 years at how little interest
my fellow financial types have throughout the industry in these issues on which our long-term
well-being absolutely depends. It is cognitive dissonance and it's surprising because some of them
are unbelievably smart and yet missing whatever it is. I don't know if it's wisdom or
if it's peripheral vision being wider, but they're just not interested. It is enough for them to
become expert in fiddling and diddling with finance and making a lot of money.
And I think I have mentioned to you before that I got into finance for a very profound reason and
that was I asked which of my classmates from business school were having the most fun and
back then in 1968 by a very wide margin the guys in the stock market were having the most fun
and so I thought well I don't want to miss out on that and then I was amazed that
I was earning $12,000 in consulting and up from 10 in a year and they hired me into the
financial business in Boston at 18 and that was the going rate just 50% high. 50% higher I might add
and they needed to pay me. I would have gone for 10, forget 12, forget 18 and
so that was very much a secondary discovery. They were not only having more fun but they
were getting paid a hell of a lot more money. What's not to like about that?
Well we're going to get into some of the deeper issues on the environment and
endocrine disrupting chemicals, climate change and other things but let me ask you this. Energy
underpins the natural world and it underpins human systems and I think people are starting to
understand that a little more but finance is a layer on top of that because money is a claim
on energy and debt is a claim on future energy. So if we're really going to change the extractive
growth ecosystem, destructing human enterprise, don't the people at the helm of finance
need to be the ones to change? Doesn't that have to change somehow?
Yeah we're not going to win what I call the race of our lives without huge government backing
and without the governments finding a way to encourage corporations to act more responsibly
and I think we may do that but we may not. It's a hard call.
Yeah so we'll get back to that. I want to focus on climate energy and the environment
in this conversation but you were on record recently in your main vocation regarding
stock market levels saying that we're in a super bubble. I think most people are aware of you and
your acumen in the financial sphere not in the environmental one. What is a super bubble and
why are we in one? A super bubble is typically about two and a half sigma.
All bubbles in my opinion we had to define them arbitrarily so we took the historical data
and we said every two sigma event which is in a random world every 44 years and the stock
market world every 35 close enough for government work, we would call that a bubble and we went
through every asset class in the database, took us months and in the end we had a couple of hundred
two sigma bubbles. There was a handful of interesting paradigm shifts that didn't break
such as the whole Indian economy making a phase change from real peasant economy to a more complicated
industrial economy. Exactly the kind of exceptions you might think. Also oil appeared to go through
a paradigm shift back in the first opaque shock and never regrouped from that level
whereas the rest of commodities continued down for the 20th century. Oil you could say really
was flat slightly up and that was the great exception and a very important exception
and again very plausible you might think that oil would show the first signs of beginning
to run out before other things and I believe it did. I saw a podcast with you a few months ago
that you say we're in a super bubble now in the stock market and that's more based on your
conventional analysis. Okay no everything is critical to what is a bubble a two sigma and
they in the developed world they all went back to the previous trend prior to the bubble starting
and a classic bubble is two or three years up two or three years down and in the stock market
they've been very well behaved. A super bubble is kind of much more interesting because that has
penetrated through the two sigma territory of a badly overpriced market and continues up.
It also has a second criteria it has to have really crazy speculation increase in all sorts of
financial activity people have to start thinking that it will go on forever that it's a new paradigm
that they only worry about missing out they buy stocks because they're going up not because of
anything to do with the fundamentals the classic being the meme stocks probably one of the greatest
examples in modern times of 2020 and 2021 and there aren't many of these 1929 was a Humdinger
1972-74 the nifty 50 was an honorary member right on the cusp you could put it either way
2000 was another Humdinger bigger and better than 1929 full of absolutely crazy behavior
the housing bubble was very much a housing bubble crazy behavior a three sigma event a bigger
remarkable breakout of housing prices even the 1929 and 2000 in stock prices
and then once again in 2021 we had a two and a half sigma and an utterly crazy behavior I believe
if you look at the scale of it the biggest most significant crazy behavior in
in recorded history of the US stock market and when you look at those
they go back to trend like all the other normal ones but they cause a whole lot more pain
because they distort the system on the way up there is a huge income effect and wealth effect
and when they inevitably break they're always a shock because everyone has locked into the
new paradigm and they nearly always take longer than people think because they're so powerful
and they didn't get there by accident they were driven by some underlying important fundamentals
so there was lots to believe in but they they eventually come down to trend and all but one
of them in history go below trend for a while and that creates an enormous negative income effect
and has always caused a recession if you if you miscalculate the recession turns
into something really terrible like the depression of 1929 like the bitter
recession of the nifty 50 72 74 of the near total financial collapse of the housing bust
in in 08 and one should expect something pretty bad this time and we await to see
if this follows the pattern of history or whether it is indeed that lovely creature
a new paradigm but history is not kind to the new paradigm thinking so let me ask you a couple
follow-ups to that your analysis of these super bubbles is based on the concept of mean reversion
that we revert to the trend but the trend of the last century has been one of rising energy access
globally we're now at a 19 terawatt global metabolism and so the your analysis suggests
that we're going to mean revert to the trend but on top of that analysis there's also peak
cheap oil geopolitical competition for a finite pie and growing ecosystem disruptions so
I don't I think they're the entire trend line might start to flatten or or decline what are
your thoughts on that well regrettably you may very well be right our last couple of papers
began to spell out what we thought the fundamental problems were that could go that could to get
worse and I conclude that they are worse and more potentially dangerous than the collection
of fundamental surrounding all the other super bubbles including 1929 we we had we were really
hamfisted in 1929 we persevered in some terrible international trade wars which was unnecessary
and destructive and maybe we will be very clever this time maybe we will be stupid once again
uh who knows but um there is a very dangerous set which you were beginning to describe but
with Russia and China the Ukraine and the resource impact of of Ukraine Russia and so on
and and with the breaking down of the the world in which international trade increased
to one in which international trade may very well slowly decrease going from an increasing
efficiency to increasing inefficiency and with the population profile shifting
fairly violently by any any population standard we have never seen a shift of this magnitude
going from rapid growth to rapid decline in a 30 year window and you know in in in the
as recently as the early 1990s you couldn't find people talking about a population slowing down
we were roaring along and now the baby cohorts are in free fall they are dropping rapidly and and
people don't realize that the global cohort of babies is below 98 now 1998 though we peaked in
about 0506 and we've been declining every year even though African baby cohorts are still going up
on a global basis the total is going down and in the developed world and China we are having in
most countries fewer 20 year olds entering the workforce and that is completely unique
and and could have very bad consequences and then we have the resource component I think
I think my colleague and I are scooped we've only had one scoop and that was 2011
we wrote a paper time to wake up the age of plentiful and cheap resources is gone forever
in which we made the case that of course in a finite world you would eventually expect that to
happen and there were now finally signs that it was happening but the but the final push
over the edge had been the amazing and accelerating growth in China in China's demand
for important resources for for the last four years they accelerated to double digit
they were increasing at over 10% a year in their demand for cement iron ore coal and
and one or two other things but not not not oil so you you have earned deep respect in the
financial community for your long-term success as an investor but I think I suspect many of your
peers still look at money and technology as the driver of of the human experience and may look
at your views on commodities and energy and the environment as somewhat Malthusian what are your
thoughts there well my my thoughts are that Malthus and what he said it's is a nice complicated
topic that we could discuss for a minute or two that for a year or two after our paper
in 2011 as we hit the temporary cyclical setback caused by China slowing and global grain weather
improving everyone thought we were entertainingly wrong and it took a few years before the long
term trend line to clearly be different the long-term trend line for we keep a very interesting
index at GMO 33 important equal weighted commodities to study the the question what is
happening to commodities not what is happening to oil and iron ore and those 33 declined by 70%
in the 20th century and yes there were three spikes world war one world war two and OPEC of
course but in between they dropped back to the trend line which was declining at just over 1%
a year which accumulates pretty darn fast over 100 years so a drop in the average price of important
commodities of 70% enormous help in in getting rich and then in 2002 it shifted and the index that
had gone from 100 to 30 is back over 90 it has tripled since 2022 this is not the trend that
we all grew up on this is this is a new world in which we are going to have to come to terms
with the finiteness of almost everything I think for reasonable purposes there's enough aluminum
and iron ore to get the job done and but everything else most of the metals we think of
on the same level with iron ore are 100 or more often a thousandth as frequent in the
earth's crust as aluminum and iron I think aluminum is about seven and a half eight percent of the
crust iron ore is four and a half and copper cobalt lithium nickel that we use for batteries
and so on they they range from point zero zero two to point zero zero six that's the range and you
can take 30 of those important chemicals like nickel and copper and add them all together
and and they are one percent they aren't a tiny fraction of iron ore or aluminum
and nobody really gets there and there are no reserves anymore China pretty well bled the last
great minds of these important but actually rare metals well in a convoluted way the 70% drop in
that commodity basket in the 20th century was due to an expansion of fossil armies of hydrocarbons
that did the work for us and all those extraction industries the rise of the machines so we had
more access to oil and that oil and the machines that had powered gave us more access to get the
overburden from the mines for copper and nickel and all the things you were mentioning
but you said that that change in 2002 I think 1999 was the all-time inflation adjusted low
for oil and we've been going up since and the extraction costs for oil have tripled since around
that time so we are in a new paradigm there's just maybe a two decade lag before people start
to notice it and puzzle it out I agree so do people in your sphere when you go to hedge fund
conferences or whatever those are nowadays do they start to see the world through an energy
lens or is that is that not yet happening first of all I don't do that I spend more time mixing
with people like you and going to green gatherings and green tech gatherings and I haven't been to
a hedge fund gathering for 15 years but I can pretty well answer for them and most of them
with a few interesting exceptions do not get it at all and it's a pretty good reason and that's
because the economic establishment has never gotten it you know the the classical economists had
their feet on the ground they understood they lived in a real world and and Keynes did but the
establishment since then basically wasted in this efficient market rational expectation
nonsense building models to be neat and mathematical and and and show their physics envy
but totally useless they completely lost the plot as Kenneth Boling who started out as a typical
mainstream economist and then kind of resigned when he was about 50 because he found economics
totally useless as in the direction it was heading and and in my opinion it's totally right so
everything you read from the mainstream economics ignores the role of energy and resources you make
a loaf of bread with capital and labor with the oven and with the worker with the great paddle
to stick it in the oven you do not apparently need any wheat and you don't apparently need any heat
it is absolutely a laughable state of affairs but when you throw in these more difficult things
your equations become too complicated and start to break down and and when you leave them all out
and you assume everything away and you assume perfect knowledge and perfect information flow
and in the stock market equal knowledge on the side of the buyers and the sellers and
all these ludicrous assumptions as if it isn't a kind of wilderness of psychology
the stock market you you get nonsense out of the end of their of their equations and and and and big
corporations and finance pick up on that it it impregnates their their business so the financial
equivalent of wasted 70 years of economics is the efficient market hypothesis which which ran
the university finance system for 50 years again a total waste of worse than a waste it was
damaging punishing and and sending the world in the wrong direction Eugene Fama and Ken French
were my honors advisors at the University of Chicago and in the entire two years I was there
the word energy was never mentioned well you demonstrated commendable restraint by standing
your ground that is a sneaky way of saying is that saying if you'd known what you were doing you
would have left and gone somewhere more sensible I did that three years later after I started to
figure it out one of my I was a high net worth salesman at Salomon Brothers and one of my clients
eventually started to trade oil futures and I was learning about that and I was learning about
how amazingly powerful this stuff is how we don't pay for the cost of the of the externalities the
pollution and how it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime so soon after that I quit and went
and studied with Herman Daley and others so that that's how that happened that was over 20 years
ago Jeremy yeah no it's surprising that you could have something so valuable as as oil and metals
and have them cost nothing except the cost of digging it out of the ground and and and that
is right there the fundamental flaw in economic theory and in our governance and expectations
of our current system is we're only paying for the cost of extraction and the sad part is looking
back all this magical pixie dust uh from uh that earth trickle charged uh from prior photosynthesis
has been wasted especially in the west we don't really have anything to show for it um you know
anything of long-term value um so piggybacking on something you said earlier uh that we were
hamfisted in our response to the great depression in 1929 and you you hope that people could be
more clever uh as opposed to not clever this time around so with an energy lens and an ecological
lens how could we be more clever this time around in theory that is pretty simple you need a carbon
tax now pigs will fly no that's not true eventually we'll all have carbon tax because
we'll get desperate and everybody knows even the idiot economists get get this right that a carbon
tax is far and away the most effective way of dealing with climate change and you can bribe
people into doing the right thing through subsidies but it's very inefficient and expensive in contrast
and it's just politically easier so um a carbon tax would be the first enormous step in the right
direction for two reasons one is going to be politically unacceptable at the moment which
is half the people don't believe that climate and ocean absorption of of our emissions is critical
and urgent and human cost so it will be politically difficult for that reason but the other reason
to have a carbon tax is to make this incredibly i have to interrupt half of americans it is nothing
like a half around the rest of the development good point good point uh yeah i read recently that
if you know nothing at all and you just asked someone what their belief is on climate change
that the single biggest predictor of people's opinion on climate change is their political
affiliation which really is tells you something um it's quite amazing
tells you that we get information from different sources uh among other things
thank you for the clarification here's the other reason that a carbon tax would be helpful
longer term from the perspective of we're wasting this incredibly valuable substance
if there were a carbon tax the prices would be more commensurate with its true cost and and value
and so we would conserve we would send the right signals to innovators and investors like yourself
that this this phone here might cost three thousand dollars uh because it's got a lot of
non-renewable inputs in it so there would be repair and different industries would crop up
around that but the challenge with such a carbon tax is we are in financial overshoot not to
mention ecological overshoot so any any realistic carbon tax today would prick the financial bubble
even even worse than the mean reversion you expect yeah i think uh we shouldn't overlook the benefits
of a carbon tax to government income um it's not only it would not only be a great source of income
but it would be taxing something you want people to use less of like tobacco and instead of taxing
labor that you want people to use more of and it would be a much better way of raising money
but you would have to make sure that you reduced income income tax on particularly the
fora and the spectrum to compensate for the the tax on energy but but the rich people use
20 50 times more energy than the poor people around the world and and maybe even within the
country 10 or 20 times as we get more desperate sooner or later a a political regime will will
find it find its way to do something that is effectively a tax on on carbon there there is a
800 pound gorilla lurking around here that you're not aware of and that is um i don't agree
with only one part one little slice of your of your argument as reflected so well in your 9596
podcast and that is uh the role of debt uh and finance in general the good news is if you take all
the people in this game of overshoot living beyond our means is how i think of it and and you look
at how much they obsess about finance and have done forever for 30 40 years and and you go back
and you take it all out of everything they ever said or ever wrote it doesn't make any difference at
all it it has not changed anything that they in my opinion have gotten it wrong and it probably will
continue not to change anything so as long as they are generally heading in the right direction
everything will work out fine but i i think debt is the most misunderstood thing of all
and the reason is pretty clear at the individual level when you're making a list of what you're
worth you add up your assets and you subtract your debt it is a negative at the societal level
debt is not like gold debt is not like copper or like stock market a claim on real corporations
with real workers and real output debt is a zero entry debt is double entry bookkeeping we might
as well say aren't the japanese incredibly rich that they can lend so much money but we don't say
that we say look at the incredible japanese debt my god they will collapse as we have been saying
for 40 50 years waiting for them to collapse uh unsuccessfully i might add debt is shockingly
misunderstood and exaggerated insignificance you cannot move resources through time
other than a few cans of bully beef in your basement or at least make sure that the infrastructure
is set up in good shape for your children other than that you cannot move assets you cannot move
income the germans at least understood this with their social security they know that it
is a pay as you go they don't pretend as we used to about lockboxes and social security
going bust or accumulating you only have the sum of your goods and services each year to pay your
pensions and if that goes down you will have less either to pay the pensions or less for
everybody else it is not about debt claiming on the future debt does not claim on the future
what debt does is i give you my money today that i could spend and i lend it to you that is not a
claim on the future it does not transfer income through time but it scrambles everybody's thinking
and luckily in this field of overshoot it doesn't make a damn bit of difference well
you're a billionaire and i'm just a podcaster with a few rows of potatoes and a draft horse but
i am going to push back on on that a little bit um yes you're right that so far it has not made a
difference because so far we have lived in a world of rising energy access um every year with the
exception of a couple of of recessions yes you're right that in a financial lens it's a zero sum game
there are assets and liabilities so from that perspective it is a Pareto problem where the
wealth gets more and more concentrated and the the creditors end up having a larger share of
that pie but from a biophysical perspective every time we create money via commercial banks or
recently via central banks there's the same amount of oil and forests and copper and dolphins
and so what ends up happening right now the united states has increased our debt one trillion
dollars in the last three months i mean it's like almost a billion dollars an hour yes that's
allowing us to consume more today and it's papering over uh other problems and it's one of the reasons
stock market and and bitcoin and other things are up but eventually when all this money has to be
called in to be spent that and especially if we're on the downslope of oil and instead of
a hundred million barrels a day we have 90 or 80 or 70 it's a musical chair sort of situation
so i agree with you that so far debt has not been a problem but i think what it's done is it's a
it's an example of risk homeostasis that we've run a red light 10 times and nothing bad ever happened
that doesn't mean that running a red light isn't dangerous i uh understand you have to protect
your opinions um no no no i i want to learn if you disagree please please educate me i was counting
on you you're saying that i um happily i don't think it matters so i don't want us to spend any
more time because i have an eccentric view and um plenty of people would think you're right they
they they share your your view just one point though um i am uh only a billionaire by a strange
and generous uh construction and that is if you count the money i have given away
which is which is a pretty whimsical way of of calculating someone's net worth but in terms
of what i actually have and could go out and and and buy my daughter back from being kidnapped
tomorrow uh i i don't have a a i'm at least an order of magnitude short of of that well i actually
think that is a wonderful way to define being a billionaire in the future isn't it going forward
that you count how much money you have given away towards pro social pro future ends i mean
that's a better definition wouldn't you say it would be uh yeah conducive to better behavior maybe
but um it is important at least to get that out there um and and most of what we have left we
we see as a potential reserve for a rainy day uh and and incidentally we have a rainy day in our
foundation our foundation is about 1.4 billion um and we have invested perhaps an unwisely large
piece in venture capital a large chunk of which is green venture capital and the reason for that
is we think that green venture capital if you only invest in things that seem really important
and you concentrate on those that have a hard time
raising the money uh you'll end up with a risky portfolio but on paper should give you a
in a hundred deals a very high return and traditionally it has but every 15 or 20 years
it it participates in these excuse me in these bubbles and so we get hammered and we become
illiquid and the companies call for the money that we've committed and they stop funding it back
which we you know really count on and that causes a liquidity squeeze so times are tricky
I will say this though that I think a a diversified package of important green venture capital
drives the cause better than anything very hard for a dollar of grant
to keep up with a dollar of green venture capital because the green venture capital
on average comes back with 15 profit and then goes out again and out again and out again
uh so those dollars can be really in the long run very very effective so uh what are some projects
you're particularly excited about in the in the green venture capital area of your work well if
you started at the top end what could be a get out of jail card uh from our conundrum or a potential
get out of jail card you would have infinite cheap green energy right so that would be a huge
help and when solar and storage might make it but we'd probably need an order of magnitude
improvement in storage costs a drop to ten cents on the dollar and we'll probably get it
it might take 10 or 20 years and it might take who knows longer shorter
but the other ones are geothermal I am very optimistic that if we could take our incredible
ingenuity and the experience and the trial and error from having drilled 200 000 fracking wells
uh learning on the job if we could take some of that skill set and move it to geothermal
there is a virtually infinite supply of energy under our feet if we could learn
through ingenious ways of drilling to handle the temperature to frack it to pick up the heat
turn it into either uh into electricity or or even just into heat uh and do it here and there
all over the planet that that would be huge and and next an even more
of a long shot is naturally occurring hydrogen hydrogen is obviously going to be incredibly
useful but but getting it is energy intensive so that really in the current state of affairs
it's more like a battery than than a source of energy but naturally occurring hydrogen of course
is a is is a source of energy and uh we don't know it in in 10 years it will probably be a
done deal we'll know that it that it's not a workable impressive component but it may be
and so that's that's pretty thrilling and and then we have fusion there are maybe now 40
diverse efforts different efforts and it's the it's the difference that makes it interesting
I think one or two of them may well make it uh from an engineering technology point of view
in a few decades and uh that is again infinite source of energy what I worry about
we have a few investments what I worry about for them is that by the time they make it
it may turn out that wind solar and storage has made so much steady progress or that geothermal
and naturally occurring hydrogen has that they will not be necessary that the capital cost will
be too high to compete but but it may be fine and we have to do it we need we need to try everything
so I have a lot of follow-ups to that um if you were just an investor I might leave it uh uh at
what you just said but I know you also are aware of the work of Patrick Ophuls uh and um ecologist
William Reese who are both on my podcast friends of mine and technology itself is necessary but
not sufficient to solve some of the larger issues and climate change from an ecological
perspective isn't the problem it's a symptom of a much larger problem which is overshoot
so in addition to technological green uh investments we're also going to need
something on the cultural and and political side otherwise the productivity from these new
improvements that you're um advocating and hoping for will just be fed back into a global
energy and resource consumptive system if GDP is our goal what are your thoughts about that
nearly infinite cheap green energy is a very helpful but not sufficient condition
I do not think there is any hope of uh creating a degrowth culture
profound enough or quickly enough to save our bacon I do think we can tip it slowly
on the margin in that direction what I think may save the day is population
population particularly in the high resource areas is dropping rapidly and by population
standards it's nose diving and nobody really appreciates the speed at which it's dropping
to take the extreme case the career has a fertility rate south korea of 0.8 last year
and and not much higher the five years before that at 0.8 it means in three generations 100 years
your baby cohort will be six and a half percent of what it is today basically you're out of business
and if I am right in what I see as the reasons for this it is highly likely
that the population of high energy high resource using rich countries and china will be substantially
lower in let us say by 2020 200 I am I think we could drift down to about two billion people
which we could sustain and it's only that piece of incredible you could say good luck if we can
hold the system together under the stress of going to two billion people combined with nudging us
towards a deep growth philosophy and understanding that we have to restructure ourselves to live
within our limits that gives us a decent chance of making it and to have cheap green energy
would make a big improvement in the odds so let me clarify something so the global population
is still increasing the global population growth rate I think peaked in 1965 and has been declining
ever since then but we are still net births over deaths is around plus 80 million humans
per year and that's declining but it's still growing the total population so are you saying
because Elon Musk has a much different perspective he thinks global population decline
is the biggest risk that humans face so population is do we have too many people or not enough
and and how do you marry those two views I'm I'm only interested in births because in the end
accumulating retirees doesn't really matter the long-term well-being of the species depends on
on young people except there are some people in your sphere that that are advocating for longevity
and that we're gonna with AI and other things we're gonna live to be 120 or 130 which would
also have an ecological impact if that comes to pass for 60 70 years I mean the fact is
they die off the the dynamics that matter are the dynamics of young people and how many children
they have you can have an army of old people and and and that long-term significance is is
negligible once you know the flight path of babies you know the flight path of 20 year olds
you know the flight path of the economy yes there is a risk that dropping at this speed will stress
out the the economy and we will in 20 years think that we're poor and and and that we can't afford
to do the necessary things on the environment to to protect our existence that would be that would
be very sad on the other hand if AI is half as good as some people believe it will mesh very well
with a rapid decline in in workforce and we will have a rapid decline in workforce
I I rather hope there is a brilliant development in AI so they can look after the old folk and
and so on and and life will go on holding holding together that's the big trick can we hold together
to 2200 to arrive in a world where there are two billion people including the old fogies
and where we could be a world where at least half of the land is rewilded and we're living
in eventually within our means and it may not be two billion it may be one billion it may be
two and a half but it's going to be something like that I know that the the advocates of AI
who are aware and concerned about climate change do think that AI can solve climate change
and for the same reason I mentioned before jevons paradox artificial intelligence can
make things more efficient and do demand side management for our energy use and all those
things but it can't do at least not AI maybe AGI it can't do wisdom so it's not going to change
our cultural objective or cultural aspirations and I actually think the declining labor force
which you're talking about is from smaller baby cohorts AI is going to do that because
it's going to take people's jobs away and so I think there's a real wealth and income inequality
risk with AI that that gets thrown into this picture as well do you have any thoughts there
yes I'm on this topic rather pleased with myself because 15 years ago I I wrote a little piece
about the the country club on the beach being served by androids and the the last human
supervisor slash helpers has just been talked about in a in a message that one of the androids
has sent to his fellows that that fred a nice guy as he is is really starting to get in the way
and and after that point that there is no productivity per man hour there is only productivity
per robot hour or if you will return on capital and the capital owners sit in the country club
and around the perimeter one might think barbed wire there are hordes of other humans who have
no job and are therefore totally useless and worthless etc etc hoping for some handouts from
the country club and and that the the real job of government in AI is is a income dispersion job
let let us imagine that world in 300 years when we've been really lucky and have survived all
these other existential threats and the robots are doing all the work
do the capital owners get everything do the rest just disappear and starve or long before that do
they revolt and get put down by the robots or vice versa and so on but an enlightened government
will move to head that stuff off pretty quickly by making sure that there is a fairly broad
acceptable income distribution and we are already falling foul of that our income distribution
in the US is no longer passing that test it has resulted in the estrangement almost bitterness
and anger of at least a third of the general public who feels they have been badly treated
and i think you could make a pretty good case that yes they have been royally screwed
since about 1975 that's why i'm less sanguine on some of these electric car um forecasts and
things like that because as of now as the sugar high from the covid stimulus is waning i think
i saw a stat last week that 50 of americans cannot afford a car payment at today's rates
with higher interest rates are built in so you know we're one of the richest nations in the world
but the the wealth is certainly not evenly distributed right and if you think of car payment
much more important really is house payment and buying a house it's such a high unaffordability
index now peak prices as a multiple of family income times 7.8 percent mortgage you're sitting
there down in washington with a mortgage of 2.7 real story uh it's pretty hard to move to boston
at 7.8 or 7.9 that is a brutal increase in your cost so cars houses and and and real life this is
this is not a a super comfortable world for everyone below half halfway on the income scale
and it's not that great in the last 30 years from from the 50th percentile till about the 20th
it's been great for the point one so uh most people think that um all capitalism is the same
thing but you frequently pointed out that american capitalism is unique um what what do you mean by
this and and what are the alternatives and and ultimately i want to get to is there a different
way that we can um allocate capital our scarce capital which is energy resources and our impact
on ecosystems going forward what are your thoughts on that we have fallen in many ways on bad times
from about 1975 from uh from about 1930 to 75 um everybody got richer at about the same rate
there was a very slight tendency for the poorer to outgrow the richer uh and so by about 1965 to
75 we reached a by american standards anyway a rather egalitarian level and uh people frequently
quote the the uh fortune 500 CEOs earning 40 times which turns out to be about what the japanese
CEOs were earning too and and now uh 50 years later the japanese CEOs earned 40 or 50 times
their worker average worker and and we yield um about 250 to 400 depending on who's doing the
calculating but it is you have to say obscene it's unnecessary too most of these people are of very
average uh qualities that you know the people who start their own darn firm like mr musk and and
in a sense they they deserve what they get uh people who start a new enterprise you know when
you paid all the rent and you paid all the salaries what's left is yours i get that that's
capitalism it's the best part of capitalism when when you put a bunch of your buddies on the board
and you decide to give yourself you know 200 million dollars of stock options over three years uh
because they're your friends that that isn't capitalism that is stock option culture um
gone wrong and um it it has been aided and embedded by increasing monopoly every every
industry in america's become more concentrated and in more recent years you have had the fashion
of cutting back on capex you know capex is real life it's it's up and down it's unpredictable
it it makes your earnings volatile who needs who needs capex so let us use that money to buy our
stock back buying stock bags is said to be a dividend it has many dividend like qualities but
it has one incredibly significant difference and that is a dividend goes neutrally to everybody
and and stock buybacks constantly take out the least optimistic of your stockholders and if you
can find a way month in month out of getting rid of your least optimistic stockholders you better
believe you're living in a different world from a bland universally delivered dividend and so you
push the stock price up and and and the evidence is completely compatible with that view a combination
of all these things has has increased the inequality has enabled the excessive payment
of most CEOs who to be friendly bring along a handful of their top management with them
and bear bear down quite hard and and quote efficiently uh or half hard heartedly you could
argue if you were a humanitarian they bear down on on the workers and and in that the government
has helped them along the government has allowed the inequality the giny ratio to worsen in the US
through every administration except bill clinton's where it was flat he did not generate enough
momentum to send the pendulum swinging back a bit but he held it for eight years and and uh
nobody else including obama did they they it continued to become more unequal and in more
recent years of course the whole tax structure has been moved away from capital therefore by default
to labor if you lower the tax on dividends and interest and capital gains tax you must understand
that you are increasing it on everything else which is to say the ordinary people and uh that
that has been a very profound transition we are now as unequal as mexico and brazil and we used
to use them back in the 60s and 70s as kind of the robber barons and now we're with them it's not
that they have improved as we have joined them in a equally unequal society well tying that back to
what you said earlier about 2002 started a tripling in commodity prices that had that acted as a tax
on our society and to stick our fingers in the dyke as it were we went to debt and central banks
started to grow their balance sheet and via i think it's called the cantillon effect that
those that are closest to the monetary spigot gets the most benefits that benefited
asset holders and not the general public um so we're papering over our economic problems with
with central bank reactions but it's not helping the average person it's it's more going to the
people who are ready our our asset holders yeah i i don't see it as papering over but it is undeniable
that if you push up the price of assets through pushing down interest rates you will increase
inequality because the rich own the assets and the poor do not and that is precisely what happened
and i think the federal reserve has played the biggest role in doing that green span and his
it appears almost as acolytes since then they have all followed pretty much his his flight path
so yes that that increases inequality and when you when you lower the rates you also
make debt available to people who can handle borrowing that is to say private equity and
and hedge funds and leverage in general that is a win-fall game you're giving free money
for these marginal economic activities and the only purpose in which really when you look at
the bottom line is the enrichment of the people who run the private equity firms that the value
created for society is negligible according to almost every academic study and and they have
they have pretty good lives but uh and they are some of the main beneficiaries and and they do
change they change reality by making by bidding up the price of corporations and helping increase
the overpricing of the stock market how would the united states as the example of of where we
both reside at the moment how could we shift away from american capitalism and is even possible
or would it have to happen during a crisis or are there policies in ways that that we could change
it ahead of a big financial crisis it used to be considered for example that a a stock buyback
was uh manipulative and it was illegal until the mid-70s or later all the way from the 1930s
you know you have to have a policeman at the corner of broad and wall in order for things to work
pretty well you have to keep an eye on them and other things being even to have companies buy
their stock back whenever they feel like it and and it it's um it's not a great idea i think uh
let them pay a dividend but let them keep their nose out of the stock market it is too easily
manipulated and was banned for a very good reason and was unbanned for also a very comprehensible
reason which was to be nice to corporations and it is nice to corporations and it's a big part
of the inequality uh equation but then you have reform of the fed i think the fed has been given
far too many responsibilities if it was just responsible for making sure there was a
decent amount of money available uh to deal with the economy of that age and and allow
quote the government uh to uh to have to uh worry about other things but to have the fed
worried about inflation about growth about this unemployment and dumb
this to pretty well guarantee it will settle for some simple policy of making rates cheap
rates cheap was terrible for retirees they were not getting paid anything after adjustment for
inflation which people have forgotten all about after 20 years they they they were being charged
for the privilege of putting their money into fixed income and everyone had told them that
as they got older they should have more and more as a percentage in fixed income and suddenly for
the last 15 years they have had little or no return until today suddenly they're now getting paid
they're a wash with money uh these people in compared to where they were two years ago they
you know they're getting five six percent seven percent whereas they were getting nothing uh
a few minutes ago so i think reform of the fed and no stock uh buy bags and i i would be even
careful about stock options uh pay people an honest amount of money on which they pay an honest tax
and if you think they're great pay them a lot of money but stock options stock grants stock buy
bags has created in the real world i think a kind of rather nasty stew that is in favor of the top
hand for i wouldn't mind reforming boards too to make sure they had one or two worker representatives
in the larger corporations and uh and uh one or two outsiders and not not wall to wall friends of
the chairman or or maybe uh one or two stand-ins uh conceptually as members of other species who
have no say in our economic decisions yeah yeah by the way when people say to me what should
america do my semi frivolous answer is we should hand over hand over our government to a consortium
of the scandinavian countries norway finland danmark sweden lord knows they have to get elected
they have on paper all the problems that we have in that respect and yet they have sensible policies
aimed at the well-being of their people on social measures they do better in everything
than we do the life expectancy in sweden 30 years ago was two years longer and now it's eight years
longer when do we when do we blow the whistle and say something is going drastically wrong
but if you look at any measure uh educational achievement uh number of women who die in childbirth
everything you could list they score better i i was just there in stock home and i was really
impressed and there's just a different feeling there jeremy uh in europe more generally as well
but in in scandinavia for for sure um let me let me ask you this i i didn't plan on asking you this
but it's it bothers me a lot um it seems our current uh culture self-selects for candidates for
national political office senators congressmen presidents it almost self-selects for sociopathic
type personalities that care about themselves in a narcissistic profit connection power sort of way
and we've gone very far away from i want to help this country because i i i feel obligated to i
feel a fiduciary to making the future better like a real civic responsibility can the politicians
that we have now understand the type of things that you're saying um you mentioned earlier enlightened
politicians which in our current society seems like an oxymoron to me um what are your thoughts on
that is there hope that we could have a different system that is commensurate with not only the
financial and resource risks that you've pointed out but the ecological and climate ones as an
individual i tend to agree with the tone of what what you're saying but um how we would get there
i haven't a clue can we get there i haven't a clue um it is disturbing and um one one should feel
discouraged and i do but i have no idea what to do about it well i i think politicians uh get to
be politicians because they're elected by people so i think we need a cultural shift but we also
need institutional change so based on what you were earlier uh saying does there need to be a
fundamental change in the way business is done as an alternative to the mega corporations uh
international corporations centered around just sharehold shareholder value in addition to the
reducing stock options and the board restrictions that you mentioned earlier like fundamentally
extraction of finite non-rubber resources turned to concentrated profits is kind of our
homo sapiens 2020s model um does that need to be shifted and how it feels like a huge hill doesn't
it that we've got to push this rock up and um how how do you how do you improve things this basic
that they're rather disturbing fact for me is that the older i've gotten the more aware
i've become of how little processed information the average guy has um he's concerned with or she
with making a living paying the rent bombarded by political views particularly now
in in the in the world of x and so on and and uh i'm extremely sympathetic um
in general from a financial point of view they've been very badly treated but the the the level
of processed information of just what passes for the hardest facts we can get out there
is so little appreciated appreciated it reminds me of the famous quote from Churchill about
you know if you want to be frightened about the future of democracy try five minutes with
the average voter um that will do it and um how how do you address that and it's the work of many
decades and many governments all trying to be modestly sensible and uh what what is the social
contract in a nutshell that's the bottom line how responsible for our neighbor's well-being
do we feel how willing to sacrifice a bit for the well-being of of everybody are we
and the answer is not as much as we used to you know back in the day particularly in world war two
uh everyone pulled together everyone knew they had to give up this that and the other
because it was necessary because it was necessary and everybody did and they were not unhappy
so i grew up as a little kid in world war two and it was people spoke to each other a whole
lot more than they did i am told than they did a bit later and uh it certainly seemed in many ways
like a fairly cheerful era because everyone was uh suffering but everyone was suffering together
everyone was trying hard almost everybody had a job uh etc etc and and and the social contract was
was very strong and the same in the u.s the u.s u.k and and uh it's pretty strong in in
scandinavia it's very strong in japan you know in japan got to tell you this story because
that government was incompetent on in my opinion on covid it went out of its way and only two
respects it said you absolutely do not have to wear a mask if you don't want to you absolutely
do not have to be vaccinated if you don't want to it's your complete civic right to do what you want
and and they and that was their contribution and what did the japanese people do they all
wore masks and then they all got vaccinated and they had the oldest population in the world and
we know that was the main variable for catching covid and they had one in 20 they had five percent
of the death rate that the u.s had amazing demonstration of social cohesion looking after
each other and also being generally fit and and leaner than we are which is also again part of
in a way part of the social contract sensible behavior i have a bunch of more questions uh
for you i i just want to thank you um briefly i i know you're very humble uh on your contributions
but these are the type of conversations our culture needs because you're not humble well
you're you're humble relative to other people like you that i know um we'll say that instead i don't
i don't see i don't see giving money away as as uh philanthropy because i'm not i'm not giving it
to help the poor i'm not giving it to the hospitals not giving it to the schools
right i am saying we have a problem we the people my grandchildren let us do whatever we can to stay
afloat and you know poverty will always be with us and i do care about it but my limited resources
better focus on what i think the most likely thing is to derail the whole society i consider
everything we have spent to be defensive defensive for my family and and in a sense everyone else
gets a free ride so i wouldn't want you to construe this as fabulous philanthropy i consider it
sensible long-term behavior for me and mine and and and uh for everyone i'm interested in
fair enough i i didn't say you were uh generous i said you were humble um you don't call attention
to your own uh accolades but the the reason i wanted to give you that that praise is because
our culture rewards and uh lads financial and economic success and so you are uh very successful
in that realm and yet you're putting most of your investments your your wealth into climate
research climate tech because you've determined that that is our existential risk but beyond
that you also care about bird loss and endocrine disrupting chemicals and and many other
environmental issues so my my reason for calling it out is you're one of the very few financial
icons that is talking deeply about our environmental risks and i i wish more people would integrate that
into their business decisions into their values and into their philanthropy that's the point i was
making there i don't get why so few people with money do not realize the opportunities they have
to improve the situation and how desperate it is that they do that i just don't get it because
they're smart and this is not rocket science this is really obvious i i'm also very big on toxicity
and and we should and i know you've covered it in a few of your yeah so so so shana swan was
one of my first guests and i know you you funded her research on on sperm decline why don't why
don't you talk about that a bit jeremy yeah and and and she talks about it wonderfully well which
is part of the reason we support her but people don't realize that toxicity is i believe moving
faster than climate change and and will be more deadly what we have done is we have created a world
which is hostile to life in almost every form including our own
to take in saves the the biomass is down at least 50 maybe as much as 75 just the weight of all of
those little critters if you talk to an insect expert too late for you to have a podcast with
eo wilson but together with two of my colleagues i i badgered him for about three hours until he
was obviously a week but he couldn't get away because it is exciting always when you're talking
to people who are thrilled by what you've spent your life doing and we were asking him kind of give
us some proof of the damage that will be done as insects implode and they're dropping at almost
two percent a year anyone who knows anything about compounding knows that that is catastrophic
and he believed profoundly he was the ant man he believed that if we lost insects
oh we would probably go out of business ourselves and he couldn't prove it why couldn't he prove it
because there hadn't been many research programs there was no money in insects no funding and and
the interaction of all the insects is one of the most colossally complicated systems out there
and very very hard to study but in almost every environment we we measure a great loss of insects
similarly if you look at human sperm count it's dropping at the same rate of of insects between
one and a half two percent a year and what we did because we can because we're not academics
when the first shana swan report came out with Hagai Levine that's kind of co-co-boss
we rapidly extended it backwards and forwards we extended it backwards to 1945 the age of ddt and
so on hugely damaging for insects hugely damaging for humans and we extended it back at half the
rate that they had proven from 1973 to 2017 and then we extended it forward for six years at just
the same rate despite the fact that Hagai Levine said that if anything it seemed to be accelerating
and then we did fund the program for them to back it up for six years and they found that
indeed it was accelerating so our extension had been conservative and we used half the rate
back to 1945 which is almost certainly conservative and our total which we'd been using for years
before they managed to do the follower showed that there was a 60 percent from 1945 to 2021
when we were talking about it the 60 percent drop in in the sperm count in the developed world
and and you can say and China and what that means is it's real trouble now we were over engineered
I like to say like a Victorian bridge so dropping to fit to almost 50 40 50 didn't matter but beyond
that it suddenly started to matter a lot and we have gone from a rounding era of young couples
having trouble getting pregnant to about 15 and the international health guys come out the other day
and say it's one in seven which is exactly what we agree with what they didn't have the nerve to say
was that 30 years earlier it was pretty well zero that it had gone from nobody having trouble
to one in seven having trouble and it's accelerating at two percent a year which means come back in
20 years and there will be hell to pay for ordinary people around the world having children and this
is all because of the stuff that was covered in China's one episode two I think that there's so
many endocrine disruptors I believe the data suggests that pesticides on fruit and vegetables
are the main culprit pesticides on fruit and vegetables eaten by pregnant women
are probably half of all the damage done by chemicals to to humans and it is it is an
enormous amount there were a couple of studies that looked at men at Harvard and mass general
arguably best hospital or a candidate in America and yes there were only like 800 of them but the
for six months they looked at them whether they were eating more chemicals or less chemicals
based on the kind of fruit self reported and the top quartile had twice the sperm count
of the bottom quartile and then the following year they did women having trouble showing up at the
clinic and the ones who had the best diet had 65 successful births and the ones who had in the
worst quarter had had 38 just shocking amazing with that kind of power in the data yes you should
have huge follow-up studies no money no follow-up studies but it suggests that we're on our way out
of business and that's what high guy Levine says it seems that we're going out of business at this
rate 20 30 40 years and we hit the fan bang and and it scrambles everything else we talk about
Nate everything we're obsessing about it is affected by this by this shocking drop in in
fertility so you you you were probably not surprised to know that I have many follow-up
questions to that so I know you know Shawna and and supported her work her recent paper her latest
paper which was released after the podcast I did with her a showed that the sperm drop
is accelerating and be that it's not just the United States thing it's it's global
right and and does it also extend to non-humans like to animals they covered that a little bit
in the first study that there were some footnotes that suggested that dogs had been tested and that
they were just the same having just the same trouble but we we can deduce from insect problems
that that is a major impact we can also sadly deduce from the insects that we we are in the
cascade effect that ear Wilson and the rest of them have so worried about which is to say
the best study was in Germany where they had thousands of citizen
helpers many of whom had phd's and so on by the way and they were amazingly Germanic and
thorough in their study and they put out these nets in exactly the same part of the forest you
know on the same day of the year sort of thing and they and they gathered them all and they were
just amazed over the passage of decades how quickly they all declined it was like an 85
percent decline yes Germany has not been particularly badly behaved in the last 20 years
what is happening in my opinion is that they are paying the price now for the massive
breakup of the countryside that went on in world war one and world war two where they were kind
of in a sense blockaded and beginning to starve and growing food wherever they possibly could
and breaking down what had been very extensive forests in Germany and and and and growing food
and that that has made Germany just less fitting for insects and then you you tend to pull
the amount of pesticides you're throwing at it bear in mind this study was done in forest preserves
so you you have to have such a mass of chemicals that it's blowing in the wind
running in in the streams and even in the rain to some extent and and and then you have the
temperature and the temperature has very little effect in Germany but at the same time they did
a study in Puerto Rico and we spoke at great lengths very quickly to the per person who did
that study so early that he was very very happy to talk to us and later he became quite trendy
but in in this forest preserve set up by the king of Spain hundreds of years ago in Puerto Rico
what they found was almost certainly that heat is making tropical insects sterile in the tropics
the temperature varies very seldom so they have a spiking heat you know one or two days a year
and suddenly it's 12 days a year and this bright spark at the University of East Anglia
grabbed one of these tropical beetles and started to experiment with heat and he exposed them to a
week of of abnormal heat and and they their fertility rate halved and then after a couple
of weeks to recover they gave them another week and they were sterile and that element is going on
in the tropics where it will be of course deadly because they are having this huge increase in
extreme hot days and it is making the insects sterile and so all over Brazil the insect mass
will be dropping just as fast I know Shauna and many people in her network
um our friends of mine one of them is on my board and many of them tell me that endocrine
disrupting chemical pollution may be a bigger risk to humans in the future than climate change so
wouldn't it be something if the biggest danger of a barrel of oil and natural gas isn't the emissions
but is the plastics uh and related things that that come from it how can this be happening with
so few people in the world everyone's focus on GDP and consumption and Netflix and smorgasbords
and vacations miss the fact that we are undergoing ecocide of the world's insects which are trillions
of tiny robots doing tasks that humans could never replace by ourselves yeah it is
an incredible almost unbelievable description of homo sapiens that we would be so reluctant to face
up to reality which is in a sense freely available the data is there it's very high quality data is
peer reviewed it's done over and over again my conclusion is if we do not end up banning
most chemicals including plastics oh we will go out of business by that you mean human extinction
yeah human the the loss of a reasonably stable global civilization that we may have pockets and
so on here and there but what we know of as a reasonably acceptable life will be will be gone
and uh there there are parts where people are not exposed to chemicals uh and
and and they will do much better but they are exposed to heat and and and some of those very
parts the heat and the humidity will get so bad that that they will not be able to exist
in the open air doing agriculture so they might become hunter-gatherers kind of in the in
in the pockets where they can deal with the humidity keeping the shade and so on and live
off fruit and nuts but life will life will be tough but for the stock market by the way
long before then uh you have a situation where owning chemicals will be more exposed
to lawsuits than even oil companies which is a very high hurdle because they're getting sued
all over the place now because they knew and and they paid money to obfuscate their knowledge
just like the tobacco companies did and they may have cost us 10 or 15 years or more
and for that they should pay a lot to help us get out of the hole that they that they have
helped us dig deeper than we would without of them without them but if i look around my office
pretty much everything that i'm looking at with the exception of maybe a a glass drinking jar has
plastic in it how would we remotely begin to use bamboo and hemp and and other products to replace
the ubiquity of of plastics in our current system it boggles the mind i have an advantage over you
war uh in that i remember being in my bathtub as a about a four-year-old three-year-old and my
mother came in with a little bakelite sailing ship for my bathtub and this was a mottled brown
plastic boat and that was the first plastic that came across my life bakelite was effectively one
of the first one or two plastics ever made uh thermosetting hard not uh flexible soft like
polyethylene and everything around me as in everything everything we fought a damn war with
had no plastics guys it can be done and uh it is amazing how good we are at sucking it up
and replacing and making do when we have to and this is something that most people in our business
underestimate they they think we all kind of lie down and die because we can't have
our luxuries and our two showers a day and our plastics and it just ain't going to be so we're
going to be tough as nails pretty damn quickly and we're going to get by and we're going to replace
we can replace plastics we know that because we lived in a pre-plastic world quite recently
and we're going to have to find a way of of using materials from nature and again you can't grow
and do that it stresses out we don't have the capabilities the resources but if they're combined
with a declining population we very well may so we have to replace petro plastics with bio plastics
and uh like cellulosic fibers and so on and we can do that and have done it and and the potential
for more discoveries are are massive we can have a vats of microbes doing photosynthesis and and
producing a cellulosic sludge or a material sludge and and my semi-joke is you then build
buildings out of cross laminated sludge having stiffened it up a bit with this and that but it
has to be biologic and industrial scale biologic material and food you know it doesn't sound very
appetizing but you can have microbes generate protein sludge and you can have raspberry flavored
protein sludge guaranteed not to have any plastics guaranteed not to have uh any toxins
and we can do this we can combine technology and all the accumulated learning of you know
thousands of years to the task at hand and if we do that we will make it and if we're dopey
and slow we won't make it it it is as i like to say the race of our lives but we do have a chance
of making it you're a hedge fund manager lifelong investor but also a philanthropist
although you you say that that's selfishly for your own family and grandchildren to have a livable
biosphere but but given what we face and the things we've discussed on this call biophysical
limits climate endocrine disrupting chemicals changing geopolitics do you have advice for other
philanthropists or investors who have benefited from living through a unique period of the carbon
pulse but who may just be starting to open their eyes to the broader uh the ecocide that is uh slowly
but picking up speed happening in our world with respect to animals and insects and ocean
and co2 in the atmosphere i mean this is the only habitable planet known in the universe this blue
green earth we all inhabit do you have advice for other people who've been successful on where the
world needs support uh that's being overlooked if you have money and you are getting older i i can
assure you that this is the retirement project of all retirement projects it is capable of absorbing
any unit of energy you can find it is absolutely fascinating it has all the great important issues
and a lot of the people who are suddenly sitting on vast pools of money are very smart
technologically savvy they are ideally suited for playing a role in this area
and and they will enjoy it it it will be part thrilling challenging exhausting discouraging
encouraging all of the above but it will not be boring you will not be reduced to playing too
much golf it is a great project and and it's the only one that it's the issue that matters most
let's put it that way by the way i'm not a fund manager i i i play i play no role in investing
other than the meta level issues of should you invest in climate change should is there a bubble
i i haven't come close to managing a hedge fund really ever i've only done big issue
top down topics most of my life and and some traditional stockpicking long ago
just to get the record straight record is straight thank you for that so i agree with
you there is no other greater ask for society right now than the human predicament as it pertains
to the natural world and and where we've arrived however the financial system which you know well
is optionality on power and resources and as long as we have a fungible reserve currency in
the world currently the dollar that dollar as you maximize it and grow the amount of it
is a claim on everything else that you can quickly turn it into land or a different currency
or uh ownership in a company and so to do the right thing for nature and our children
and the biosphere uh reduces one's optionality i i told you i used to work at salomon brothers
and i had clients that had 300 million dollars and they were going to get to 500 million and
they would quit but when they got to 500 million their buddies had more and it was a compulsion
to grow the amount of assets so how does that dynamic merge with growing recognition of the
unbelievable tragedies that are unfolding when the natural world nat i think i think it's an
unanswerable question from my from my perspective it is too profound and philosophical
for my skill set so i am going to dug that one it's it's the right question but i am not the
right person to answer it okay i will ask a related question i know that you also fund
work at universities especially on climate so i'm going to start asking this question
of all my guests because it's my belief that young humans especially those in grad school
or postdocs are an incredible underutilized human resource to tackle some of the problems that you've
integrated on this call so but they're working within an economic structure within the academy
that is kind of linear and doesn't integrate the things that we've been discussing so in your field
climate oceans endocrine disrupting extinctions how all that fits together can you some can you
suggest some really big questions for postdocs grad students universities around the world that
need research need answers that are happening right now what is really the threat in epigenetic
problems changing the way that genes express themselves after exposure to chemicals we really
have to follow that out we really have to follow up the sperm count studies and what can be done
what is causing the damage they really don't know you know shana thinks it's mainly
the forever chemicals i think it's mainly pesticides on fruit and vegetables and
it it isn't known but we we should have important follow-up studies the same with insects we may
be taking we may be teetering on the edge of our own destruction and we just don't know it
because no one has ever funded insect research and you could take all our money throw it at
any one of these things and and it would kind of still be a drop in the bucket although
it would certainly help we have decided to throw all our money in a sense at
at green tech research because we think it buys us time for governments and new rich people to
get the point and start to change the way they spend their money and the way yeah the government
spends its money by by time through technology to push the window away before we go off the cliff
but as as you kind of implied these are not long-term cures these are just buying time
for for the long-term actions to be taken and and the most impressive one to me is a population
reduction that that i think is pretty well baked in the pie we we didn't cover one thing which is
the shockingly politically incorrect and therefore we should probably do it
and that is the the main reason for population
crash it's not a population crash because of the old fogies living longer but it's a
baby cohort crash the main reason is a choice obviously more educated women are realizing that
that many children just impinge on their the flexibility of their life and the
and their ability to kind of fully realize themselves anyway so we have this huge correlation
between female education and and and fertility and secondly postponement everyone wants quite
correctly to get their career going before they interrupt it and that makes a lot of sense but
when you postpone you're not nearly as fertile and i believe it interacts with toxicity in a
non-linear way so it doesn't really matter if you have some toxic exposure when you're a 16-year-old
a Nigerian just to pick on a place with a very high fertility rate because you you have many
years to make it up but you know you're you're 39 year old Parisian worker you you may find you
simply can't have a have a child so that's reason number two the reason number three is toxicity
reduce sperm count increasing miscarriages and all of the uh lesser problems that come with
chemical exposure which is getting worse rapidly and will soon be overtaking postponement into second
place and then there is the one that no one talks about and that is in addition to the measurable
reduction in sperm count etc there is a hard to measure effect on hormone interference on
your willingness your eagerness to procreate every study i as far as i'm aware and i've tried to
look at them every every study on sexual activity says it's going down in each age group
pregnancies in 16 year olds and younger dropping rapidly that's a lack of willingness to procreate
or a lack of willingness to do the act that results in procreation no a lack of interest
in in procreation you in other words you are not motivated you you're not the 22 year old
of circa 1955 you have less interest and
that was available implication of of of the study from from shana swan and hagi levine
um and and it may be the most powerful force of all you know 40 percent of south korean 40
year olds have not had a child and and the activity in terms of dating and so on has has
really dwindled down so that it's the women's night out and the guys playing competitive
computer games on a saturday night and not going to the bar and and hooking up or whatever
we call it um this is i think potentially very profound and maybe the most important single
consequence of chemical exposure but is that can that be described by chemical exposure or could
it also be described by the subconscious recognition of climate change and limits to growth and other
things that people just don't have that inner freedom and a spree decor of of of discovery
and all that that there's there's just a a paul and that we've become the walking worried i i don't
know well i i can hazard a strong guess i would as a betting man i would put a very large bet on
this in the community in which we move we bump into people who fall into into your description
as a percentage of young people i think they are pretty small and confined to certain countries
and socioeconomic groups in china for example i would expect that to be a very small fraction
of of the opinion but the the proof of the pudding is that in in the career japan china
and and probably when measured correctly india um they're all acting as if um forget the choice
i i'm just not interested and that that component is accelerating and that of course
is a real threat to the species and and i think this is a real threat to the species
but it cuts right across all the other things we're working on doesn't it uh if if our population
is going to turn out to be substantially less than the low estimate of the un by 2100 in just
70 years and then much less by 2200 the main the main things we have to worry about maybe
is holding society together the demand for all the bad things like oil and copper will will
will drop like stone but the stress on society and the economy will be pretty high i don't know
enough about that i'm gonna have to look into that um but you're right it would affect everything
else including the paying back of of debt that is such an important point um about the payback
of debt you know i i started out life studying big american industrial corporations who were in
decline international harvester and the retirees had certain obligations and the workforce supporting
them were declining the company was declining but the retirees was were static and and that is
a very similar echo here but in the following way the thing we haven't talked about
is the cost of doing what we have to do we think it's 50 trillion increment to green the economy
and the reason it's so low is because you have to buy a car anyway you have to build a new factory
anyway you have to build up upgrade the grid anyway and you combine that with greening it
and so it's a relative bargain 50 maybe 75 trillion dollars um you then have the accumulated damage
which between now and 100 years is probably going to be somewhere in the range of
30 to 100 trillion it's a very wide error bar how can we put a price tag on insects or ecosystems
or the i'm just talking i'm just talking about floods okay floods droughts and and food problems
in other words old-fashioned simply measured pain which is going through the roof as we as we sit
but but 10 years ago was really quite marginal and and and the biggest one of all
and and that is we're going to have to end up when we get to a zero carbon industrial system
we're going to end up with we believe about 550 parts per million plus or minus 50
that's if we do better try harder and have a steady stream of innovations we started out
live at 280 we're at 420 if we do a better job we might peak this out at 550 but we've got to go
back from 550 to 300 that's 250 parts per million if we don't the ice caps will melt
we'll have 200 feet rise and so on and a lot of the fires and floods and transference of
the amazon to savannah etc will will keep going so we have to do it and when you green the economy
you have a lot of offsetting virtues you you drive as i do a model 3 is the best car i ever got in
you you go through boston in an electrified world in 20 years it's the cleanest boston will have
ever been since its inception it will have huge health payoffs by the way that no one talks about
so there are lots of offsetting virtues but the taking out 250 parts per million is an
absolute dead weight for which you will not see any direct advantage your survival depends on it
but you will not see any immediate payoff like you will with greening the economy and we think
we'll be ingenious and terrific and we'll get the cost down to 50 a ton every and currently 500
a thousand dollars a ton but we'll get it down to 50 that's what we do well when we scale this up
it will be brilliantly cheaper 50 a ton but it's it's a lot of tons and it the total
turns out to be 125 trillion dollars in other words maybe twice as much as greening the economy
and and we're going to take decades to do it and if the population drops steadily we have this
pension fund problem that you're alluding to and that is if if we take a long time and we
probably will if we peak and and at 550 one day and the population is already in terms of the workers
has already halved they have twice the burden and then as they pay for it over 100 years it halves
again by the end they've quadrupled that burden and it's a pretty damn big burden anyway so there
is a unfortunate intersection between a declining population which is good for most things and the
cost of decarbonizing and extracting the excess carbon which will be borne by fewer and fewer
people so i'm going to i'm going to have to have you back to discuss the greening of the economy
because there's so many rabbit holes on that that i would love your your expertise and wisdom on but
for right now let me ask you this what are the most promising ways that you've come across
for actually subtracting carbon from the atmosphere or things on the come that that haven't really been
proven yet that you're optimistic about uh regenerative agriculture geoengineering
cloud seeding marine cloud brightening uh what do you have any opinion or optimism in that field
i am optimistic on everything you mentioned actually i think we will have to get involved into
cloud brightening sort of relatively low risk relative high payoff certainly
geoengineering everything to do with agriculture uh we're desperate we can't be too
careful we can't be we have to be careful but we can't be ultimately careful because we're running
out of time and it's something that we can really do a good job at changing the characteristics
of the agricultural process and plants in general so that they sequester a little more carbon and
and require less energy to to grow and so on one of my favorite down to earth little projects
is a robot that runs slowly on its own across the field gathering about half the corn stubble
and converting it at very high temperature into biochar the trouble biochar is is wonderful for
microorganisms it wonderful for water retention it really improves the soil and the problem with
it is that you have to truck biomass which is fatal and then when you've converted it into biochar
you truck it to a farm and then you distribute it on the farm it's all horrifically energy intensive
but this little machine is there it takes the stubble right there and converts it to biochar
right there and it does it potentially very cheaply um incrementally something close to ten
dollars a ton or maybe zero because the value of the soil enhancement is enough to justify the
process and the carbon sequestration which is very substantial is a free good think about that so
that's a fits in what we call the too good to be true category that which there are quite a few
I keep coming back to we're going to have to value the natural world more than our current
economic system does and that is going to take money and it's going to take money and resources
away from stock car driving or las vegas junkets or disneyland or other things in the society so
who is going to pay for that is it going to be investors or governments or is it a cultural value
shift that each of us tithe 10 percent of our income above a certain amount towards the natural
world because then I think there's a lot more things that become possible uh among the things
you mentioned but until we get to that point we're just outsourcing our wisdom to the financial
market and the financial market optimizes capital and not the environment yes and we will either
improve starting with the social contract our attitude to we're all in this together
or we will in the end probably fail in the meantime we're saying to ourselves
that is a big ask and one with uncertain outcome we know we can improve these things
through technology we we know we can make it better we know we can knock years off the research
lifespan let us do what we know we can do that fits into a system that that works pretty well
the venture capital world is the pride and joy of the american capitalist system in my opinion
it is unlike so many things where far better to be in in in denmark it's far better to be in the
us for venture capital we suck in all the very best people we have 15 of the 20 great research
universities that are integral to the flow of ideas we take risk better than any other group on
the planet with maybe australia closed behind and this is it this is the one little nook and
cranny of the system that is great people are flocking in from around the world into green
tech the green tech world is unlike any other quadrant of capitalism they are actually thoroughly
concerned with the problem and they it's a big part of their driving force that this is an existential
risk that they're doing something about this is really heartening i i joke that they they may get
drummed out of the capitalism club because they have all these benevolent attitudes could you
imagine what green tech and the demographic you just described could accomplish if we had
not only a carbon tax but a tax on all non-renewable inputs to the economy that would give us the
right signals for the downslope of the carbon pulse and then you can apply all that ingenuity
and creativity towards technological responses and there is also the the idea of the circular economy
and in in france they're moving to make it expensive to design things that cannot be
recycled cannot be repaired and and in that sense the french are ducks as we but they do some things
very very well and i think this is such an enlightened attitude and and a lot of these
problems are quite specific so if you if you're in danmark and you solve the chemical problem
you will simply live a lot longer and be healthier and eventually the other and other people will
follow you the trouble with climate change is it's fungible and there's a free rider effect
but we really depend on these handful of people who will set a good example and prove that it can
be done prove that in fact the economy in france you know 10 years later starts to grow a little
faster than the others because they're insisting on more recycling and and so on a more circular
successful economy last question before i get to the final questions um there was a
science article i think around eight or nine years ago that showed that if the united states
went it alone and did the paris accord and did everything correctly for climate
that by the year 2100 it would make an infinitesimal difference into the global uh temperature in other
words it has to kind of be a global thing or it's not going to matter so do you think there's
possibility of global cooperation on climate endocrine disrupting chemicals and other
environmental risks or does it just happen nation by nation and and patchwork way i fear
that it will be patchwork and in toxicity that works because people can see who is pulling ahead
uh however i think as things get desperate there is a decent chance that we will start to
cooperate people are you know a little stupid but they're not completely stupid and uh if if we
start to go to hell in the hand basket uh will we not start cooperative ventures on the on a global
carbon tax equilibrating policy you know where everything every product is treated the same
way yes i think that will happen in even more enlightened stuff it may or may not we are going
to make it on on 20 of these questions we're going to make it if we are slightly more to the enlightened
side than the unenlightened side where we really exist well within a range of success and failure
i think even with our deficiencies we're inventive taken all together we can make it and we can fail
this is very unusual that this is not a done job this is not certain that we will fail it is not
certain by by any means that we will succeed and we will have hundreds of these little choices
where some people will be more enlightened some people will copy them other people will be a
pain in the earth they will send the country back for 10 years and and the sum of all of these will
decide whether we model through or whether we don't that is very well said and that is the
conclusion that i came to when i started this podcast is we need more people to see the game board
and how things fit together so that we can make better decisions and tilt towards the the more
enlightened so final few questions jeremy you've thought about these issues for a very long time
you're 85 years young and you are uber focused on on the things that that really matter do you
have any personal advice to the viewers of this program who are aware of climate change endocrine
disrupting chemicals the the flatness in our economy for the people in the lower three quintiles
etc do you have any personal advice and before i answer that i just want to say to the average
to the typical viewer uh i i have just spent
30 or 40 hours skimming through and occasionally really listening to
nates 95 podcasts and i by no means covered covered them but i've tried to select the
ones most relevant to me i have a real feeling for the style and what's going on and and and let
me say this is this is the kind of effort that if it takes wing you know by the time you've done
three or four hundred of these becomes the authoritative source that people go to get exposed
to this line of of reasoning this is one of those things that can tip the scale a bit well thank you
for saying that i i don't i can't imagine doing 300 but i'll keep going of course you can imagine
doing 300 what what what sort of thought is that i have about four people um that you should really
talk to uh but um that's only two or three years from now that should that should be a piece of cake
you should be aiming at a thousand there's just about a thousand useful people to talk to i should
thank uh the advice is this this is um one of the main things in life is purpose and most people born
in the history of man has not have not had particular purpose other than staying alive
we we have an opportunity to not just stay alive earn a living feed yourself but we have an
opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out
for more or less ever and uh this is the purpose of all purposes you lucky people
and uh if you do not attach yourself to this problem you are missing the point you are not
paying attention you're not being intelligent you're not showing judgment this is the issue
that you should attach as much as your life to as you can and you know there is something to be said
for make as much money as you can and deploy the money uh to people who know better about other
things that's perfectly acceptable uh or become an expert in any one of the thousands of of jobs
that are required to to make it out of this mess so it is a wonderful time uh to be to be alive in
terms of purpose and for my money uh you know purposes is one of the two or three things that
make life worth living i agree um how would you adjust that advice to a young human 18 to 25 uh
listening to this becoming aware of of these things um sure purpose but do you have any other
advice for young humans yeah i mean it's the same advice really just pick a career that is useful
tilt yourself to science and pick a branch of science that is relevant of which many are to
this field if you're a bit older think about running a startup um
and and make sure the startup has a chance of being really important uh think about getting
into green venture capital uh because you can have some leverage and raise some money and
and and show some scale no there there are plenty of opportunities that you're this is a fortunate time
if you could this is a question i ask all my guests and if you listen to 20 or 30 of my episodes
you know that's if you could wave a magic wand jeremy and there was no personal recourse to your
decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures i suppose that's easy
i would wave a magic wand and have the global population become one billion
i like to say that we live at such a finely tuned part of the race of our lives that if you imagine
a world where we have the population of 1900 and the part and the technology of today we have no
problem we've made it if we had the technology of 1900 and the population of today we're toast
we have no hope the whole of this race has played out in the hundred-year gap between
population growth and technology it's quite remarkable that's well stated i hadn't heard it
put that way before and and therefore finding yourself at one billion tomorrow i think we
have enough time and resources and talent to model our way through this has been quite a
conversation i would like to have you come back maybe as a round table guest or to take
a deeper dive is there a topic that we didn't cover today maybe esoteric but relevant to our
futures that if you were to come back and take a deep dive on that topic uh does something come to
mind well my my topics are toxicity population and and the viability of the animal world insect world
resource limitations particularly metals energy
inequality deficiencies in capitalism and uh we did a pretty good job yeah we did of at least
getting into some of some of that of each topic well uh i hope this podcast is and bubbles
that's my only other thing and bubbles well we're in a we're in a numerous bubbles at the moment
thank you for thinking and caring about these things during your career and thank you for your
time today and to be continued i hope and thanks jeremy and and thank you nat the same way thank
you for your efforts if you enjoyed or learned from this episode of the great simplification
