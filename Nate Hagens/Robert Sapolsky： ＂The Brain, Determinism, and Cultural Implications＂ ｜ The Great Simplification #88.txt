We don't change. We don't choose to change, but we sure are changed. And we have to make use of our
knowledge about how that change comes about, because if we don't think the change happens,
we're totally screwed. It is an honor to introduce my next guest, Professor Robert Sapulski, who at
Stanford University is a professor of biology, neurology and neurosurgery, as well as a research
associated the Institute of Primary Research at the National Museum of Kenya. Over the past
30 years, Professor Sapulski has divided his time between the lab, where he studies how stress
hormones can damage the brain, as well as in East Africa, where he studies the impact of chronic
stress on the health of baboons. Robert is the author of numerous books, of which I have all of
them, including his new book out in October called Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will.
This was a wide-ranging, intense, and challenging conversation, one of my favorite ever. Robert
has had a big influence on my thinking these last 20 years, and it was a real treat to talk to him
in person, even though when I scheduled the interview, I didn't know his next book was on
free will. I'm still making my mind up on what I think on this topic, but this guy has been working
on this for 40 years, and this is an amazing conversation with insight into the constraints
that biology poses for the great simplification. Please welcome Professor Robert Sapulski.
Professor Sapulski, welcome to the program.
Well, thanks for having me here.
I know you well enough to call you Robert, but I've learned so much from you over the last
couple decades that I feel Professor Sapulski is more appropriate.
Well, all that does is make me feel elderly and having a large prostate, so Robert's just fine.
Okay, Robert, it is. So you have a new book coming out called Determined, A Science of Life
Without Free Will, and we're going to get to that, but it is very hard for me as someone who has all
of your books, has watched almost all of your online biology lectures to pass over your decades
of scholarship on the human brain and behavior that's relevant to the subject of this podcast,
which is the great simplification. I know you watched my movie earlier. So let's start with this,
though. How and when did you first realize that you wanted to be a biologist and study animals
and behavior? I was about eight years old when I decided I wanted to be a primatologist,
go study primates in the wild. I've run across a lot of field work people over the years,
not surprisingly, and about two-thirds of them grew up someplace exotic. Their parents were
field researchers or missionaries or some governmental NGO thing in some exotic place,
and then the remaining third would be people who grew up in some god-awful urban,
I'm trying not to use hellhole, but in some ways, yes. And then at some point, they stumbled into
the Natural History Museum and imprinted on something, and that was my version of it,
the American Museum of Natural History. And in retrospect, I probably could just as easily have
like imprinted on geckos or horseshoe crabs if I had taken a left or instead of a right in the
hallway, but I wound up in the primate exhibit and that's it. I decided I wanted to go live with
primates, non-human ones forever after. So you wrote a primate's memoir and why zebras don't
get ulcers, but recently for a long time you've been at Stanford. When's the last time you've
been to Africa and do you miss that type of work? Let's see, the rhythm I maintained was
nine months a year in a laboratory being a neurobiologist with a lab coat, and during the
summer's three months a year back out in a tent with baboons in the Serengeti, I managed to keep
that going for 33 summers until 13, 12 years ago when things just fell apart there on a whole
bunch of fronts and it was time to pack it in and decide 33 was pretty damn lucky. Yeah, I miss it.
Yeah, I've been to Africa four times, including Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Botswana, Zambia, and I
was enthralled every single time and I wish I could have in a different lifetime done something
like you did. So we are getting into the brain and behavior. Humanity and the biosphere are facing
multiple interconnected challenges. In my own writing and speaking, I point out and have for
20 years that we don't so much have an environmental problem or an economic problem,
but rather that most of our challenges emanate from a mismatch of the human brain,
modern human brain from our ancestral environment. What do you think about that broadly?
I love your emphasis on that and your work. I mean, it's a obligatory cliche in my field to
like once every 10 minutes start a sentence by saying well, realizing that for 99% of human history
was spent in small hunter-gatherer bands, it's a total cliche because it's true and it's incredibly
important. Not only are microwaves like a relatively recent invention that don't particularly fit with
our evolutionary past, but agriculture isn't either. Living in sedentary, settled communities
isn't either. All of that is in a blink of an eye. The notion that culture evolves faster than
brains do is at the core exactly of a huge amount of what ails humans.
Historically, culturally, it's been common to think of our emotions, our psyche,
and human personalities as completely separate from the body and physiology.
Back 30, 40 years ago, there was the standard social science model, but a lot of emerging work
in the past decades, including yours, has suggested that that's not true and that these two things
are in fact deeply intertwined. Where did this separation come about in the first place?
Well, everybody has to pull out Descartes at this point who was going on about how animals
are machines and humans have souls. That set up the basic dichotomy that people have run with
ever since between humans and other species or between the brain and the body or between the
brain and the mind. What everybody's very fond of saying now is Descartes was totally wrong,
which is animals have emotions and empathy and all of that also. My take is Descartes was
totally wrong because, yeah, animals are biological machines and so are we. We're just
really much more complicated versions, but we're built out of the same stuff and where the mismatch
has become most interesting is when we're working with the exact same blueprint and the brain and
the hormones, all of that, of any other species out there. We're just like them. We're just like
them and then we go use it in a way that no orangutan could ever dream of. There you have
the mismatch. It's so bizarre having a conversation with you. I just realized something as you were
speaking that in reading your latest book determined when I'm reading, your voice is in my head
reading the words, like your voice and your diction. I didn't realize it till just now,
but it's interesting because I've listened to so many of your lectures. I wonder if that's
true for a lot of people. Building on your point, in our culture, in our polarized social media,
addicted soundbite culture, on the conservative side, a lot of humans don't actually believe
in evolution. On the more liberal side, anything that is explained as having biological origins
or biological explanations can now get you canceled. What do you think about that? Will
it ever be possible for a plurality or a majority of society to have a broad understanding of the
biological origins of human behaviors? Well, just to be pessimistic, I think there's always
going to be a divide and it's often going to be able to be framed in terms of a conservative
versus a progressive orientation or a made excited by novelty versus made anxious by novelty
sort of dichotomy. Amid that though, there's interesting stuff like a standard progressive
stance is to have apoplexy when people start talking about biological roots, genetic roots,
genetic inevitability of something like intelligence. Obviously, all sorts of right-wing
ideologues have run with the pseudoscience of genetic determinism of IQ, things like that.
So that's exactly the dichotomy you've set up there. On the other hand, when it comes to sexual
orientation, the left has been pioneering in the notion that being gay is not a choice,
let alone a choice that soils your extensive soul or whatever. It's a biological trade on a
continuum. While in this case, it's the right that says there's no biology there at all. So
it's a little bit a function of what the topic is, but all of that is within
yes indeed this very narrow edge that one has to walk on these days between
being canceled and going in a left position that places a humane ideology way above
scientific facts now then, and then all the folks who want to burn science textbooks.
So do you find it teaching at one of the premier universities in the world
more difficult today than it was 10 or 15 years ago to discuss the biological origins of many
human behaviors? Yes, maybe a little bit. Every other year, I teach this big class. It's been
getting like five, six hundred students per round in sort of the last decade or so about
the biological roots of human behavior, human social behavior. And I always say for the next
to last lecture, one on the biological roots of religiosity. And like I realized after a while that
I didn't record it because it came back and bit me in the rear in some ways. And inevitably,
you know, my theme and it was, you know, religious belief or the lack of capacity for religious
belief or biological phenomena just like anything else. And they're interesting to analyze and
they've got all sorts of unexpected twists and it's complicated as hell or all that. But
we're biological organisms. And inevitably, there's always some religious students who are offended.
Very nicely inevitably, there's always some religious students who instead have an epiphany.
And usually earlier in the quarter come to me and say, oh my God, I'm like kind of having a crisis
here. And I say, me too, that's what that's what I had as well. At least they're not hostile. No
one's condemning me to Hades. What I've noticed is the pattern instead is a few weeks later when
they graduate, they leave me a little gift, which is always like a little pocket Bible saying,
please, please, please read this. I'm really concerned for you. So if that's my version of
getting in trouble, that's okay by me. It's education at this level is kind of like selling
insurance, you have to make 100 calls to get 10 meetings to have one sale. And changing minds
about the state of the world is difficult. On that note, I also taught for for nine years,
a class called Reality 101. I'm just curious. You've been teaching what 40 years now almost.
Do you have people from your classes 20, 30 years ago that reach out to you and say this was a
foundational epiphany for me and it changed my life and my worldview? I imagine you do.
You know, I'd love to hear that every day, but more than more often than I've had any reasonable
expectation of that sort of but yeah, and it's it's very pleasurable. It's nice. It's nice to see
my ex students who are like chairs of psychiatry or this or that at med school. It's like even more
nice to see someone who's using a biological model now in the social work they've been doing
for the last 25 years. I've got two ex students who are senators now. And one of them I take
complete credit for and the other I run from in a panic. So that that that counts as a net zero
there and I won't use names. But you know, education is kind of a cool thing. My father was a
professor architectural history in New York City and and at his death sort of we we went through
the number crunching to figure out 14% of New York City's licensed architects had been in a class
of his at some point and that felt really damn good to see. So that's cultural evolution?
Yeah. And in a very exciting way, you know, students have learned all sorts of stuff about
stress hormones from me. I've learned all sorts of interesting vocalizations from baboons.
Yeah, culture rolls along and it involves acquiring new behavioral characteristics.
So, so let's get into this. This is a difficult interview for me to have because if we weren't
time or energy constrained, it would probably go on for five or six hours. Because there's
so much to cover in your work that's relevant to the coming decades of humanity. So let's do just
a real quick flash round on three hormones that seem prominent in your research on the brain
and behavior. Dopamine, serotonin, or sorry, while you could include serotonin, dopamine,
testosterone and oxytocin. So could you briefly maybe tell a little story about what are the
common misconceptions of these neurotransmitter slash hormones and what roles do they actually
play in shaping our behavior? Great. And you're absolutely right to say the slash because
it used to be testosterone only belong to the endocrinologists. But then it's due in something
neurotransmitter ish in the brain and dopamine used to only belong to the neurocanus. So
yeah, it's on a continuum, of course. Testosterone, everybody knows exactly what
testosterone is about, which is the hormone that makes you aggressive. It explains why males
the world over in species after species are such pains in the asses because testosterone
causes aggression. Testosterone does not cause aggression. What testosterone does mostly is
it amplifies, it increases the volume on the aggression that's already there,
the aggression that's been socially learned. And that's a very different story. You know,
a perfect example of it, you take five male monkeys, they've formed a dominance hierarchy,
number one, trashes two through five, two trashes, three through five, all of that. So you take
number three in the hierarchy and shoot them up with testosterone, shoot them up with like so
much of it, like he's growing outlers or something. And does he get in more fights? Absolutely. Whoa,
testosterone causes aggression. But what you might speculate at that point is as a result of that
testosterone, number three is suddenly like confronting numbers two and one and maybe toppling
the, nah, you never see that. He still is just as brown-nosing with them as he used to be. All
that happens is he's become a total nightmare to numbers four and five. All the testosterone has done
is amplify the social learning that was there already. One and two, you have to pretend you
like haircuts. Four and five, you can do anything you want to. So let's do it 10 times as much as
normal. Testosterone doesn't cause aggression. Testosterone amplifies what's already been socially
learned. And testosterone even more so is about defending challenges to your status,
but then humans have come up all sorts of circumstances where defending your status
does not involve aggression. Just look at a bunch of rich, half-drunk people at a charity
auction and they're competing for status over who could give away the most money conspicuously.
That one doesn't make a whole lot of sense when testosterone is all about aggression.
And in studies where people get status by being more generous, you give people testosterone
and they become more generous. It's not about making you aggressive. It's a making about
amplifying whatever you've learned is good for holding on to status in your little sliver of
the universe. That's fascinating. I didn't know that. And how we get status in our culture is
probably going to have to change away from conspicuous consumption, etc. So testosterone will
play a role. Exactly. And I mean, what that tells us at the end of the day with like human
aggression, testosterone isn't the problem. The problem is that we hand out so damn much social
status for aggression. That's the thing that needs to be solved. And as you know, that's
immediately intertwined with who's got how many toys and how conspicuously can you display it,
etc. etc. We may not be economically rational, but we are economically competitive and
testosterone just feeds into that in ways no other ape can make sense of.
And what about dopamine?
Dopamine, totally great, exciting neurotransmitter. Another one where everybody knows what dopamine
is about, which is dopamine is about reward. It's about pleasure. Cocaine works on the dopamine
system, various euphorians, you like give somebody cocaine, and they're releasing a thousandfold
more dopamine than like some key parts of the brain ever do. And whoa, it's amazing. Dopamine is
about reward. It's about pleasure. And superficially, it seems that way. You take a person or a monkey
or a rat, and you give them a reward from completely out of nowhere. And they have a
rush of dopamine. Yeah, that's great. Then you look more closely. And what you do is you take a paradigm
and it works this way in a human or a monkey or rat, you like train the individual that, okay,
we put you in a room. And as soon as the little light comes on, it means every time you press this
lever 10 times, you're going to get a little reward. Signal work reward, signal work reward.
So the organism learns that the college freshman in site 101 or the lab or whatever, and they learn
this. So you put them in the situation, the light comes on, they do the work, and they get the reward.
When did dopamine rise? And if dopamine is just about reward, it rises after you get the reward.
That's not what you see. It rises when the little light comes on. What's that about? That's you
sitting there saying, Yeah, I'm all over this. I know about this lever pressing stuff. This is
going to be great. I'm like completely master of the universe at this lever pressing. Dopamine
isn't about reward as much as it's about the anticipation of reward. And we sure know endless
ways in life in which the anticipation turned out to be better than the actual thing. And most
importantly, if you block dopamine from being released at that time, you don't get the lever
pressing. It's about the anticipation. And it's about the motivation and the goal directed behavior
that's generated by that anticipation. And our entire economic system is turning billions of
barrels of ancient sunlight into micro-leaders of dopamine in anticipating what is better than
the actual result of consuming all these non-reduable natural resources. So it really
is at part of the core of our current super-organism energy-hungry dynamic of human society.
Absolutely. And a weird human-specific feature of the dopamine system explains,
you know, if you want to be grandiose, 99% of what's going wrong with this, which is like,
you're a baboon. What are your sources of pleasure in life? You get to hassle somebody lower ranking
than you. You get to have sex. You're hungry and you eat something good. That's about it. Like,
if you're human, all of those things feel good, but also like solving Fermat's Last Theorem feels
good. And like reading about, you know, acts of random kindness and seeing an arousing scene in a
movie involving characters who aren't even real and listening to a symphony and smelling a flower in
early and spring and all of that. We've got a system that has to incorporate responding to
rewarding things that range from like remembering a line of poetry to quadruple orgasms. And the
only way you can get a dopamine system that could handle that large of a range is it's got to reset
quickly. It's got to habituate quickly. It's got to be able to go from, okay, we're now going from
the good to bad poetry range. We're now going to the good or bad outcome of a billion dollar lottery
and my one ticket range. It's got to reset frequently. And there's some totally cool research
showing some weirdo wiring things about the human dopamine system that's very unique that probably
explains the rapid resetting. So that's great. But it sets you up for exactly the problem you've
spent all your time thinking about, which is if the dopamine system quickly resets by definition
whatever was an amazing reward that came out from nowhere yesterday is going to be what you feel
like you're entitled to today and is going to feel insufficient tomorrow. And that's your whole world
of like what has gone wrong. We inevitably habituate to unexpected good stuff. And before you know it
not only is it like the norm, it's not enough anymore. We get hungry again.
Can that can that be trained? I don't know you very well. So I don't know your own
social media and internet habits. But being a professor of neuroscience and being a dopamine
expert, have you created a firewall in your own behaviors so that your dopamine can
you know your superhighway can reset to normal things like flowers in the spring or
playing with your dog or going for a walk in the forest or what do you do about that?
Well, I try a little bit of a Luddite. So I think I'm protected from an awful lot of that
pumbling. And I think I'm sufficiently large and upper generations away from where the culture is at
that like not only don't I know how to access that stuff, but it probably isn't going to do
dopamine things to me that it does for for 18 year olds. But in retrospect in some ways
that's what spending three months a year alone in a tent in the Serengeti would do.
The nearest electric outlet was like 90 miles away. Mail would be dropped off once every two
weeks. We got water from a river. There was no electricity, all of that. And you know you do
that and you know baboons are interesting. But I think what kept me spending now 50% of my life
going there back and forth is like at the end of the day you are so damn tired from the physical
work and from the bright sun and from the cool things that you saw and whatever rice and beans
you're eating for dinner. You cannot believe how good it tastes and it's hot as hell midday,
but there was a breeze and you're like euphoric. That's the resetting. And of course what I
would find is you know back in this world that would have wonderfully protective residual effects
for about six and a half days. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. I'm trying to do this Silent Saturdays
thing now just because as the podcast gets more popular I have so many emails and social media
and stuff and it's becoming becoming a little much so I'm trying to ratchet down my baseline
a little bit and just do mundane things on Saturday with limited success so far because
I don't have free will but we're going to get to that. So and oxytocin, what about oxytocin?
Okay oxytocin, it's the grooviest hormone on earth. Oxytocin is about love and trust and
social intelligence and all of that. Oxytocin is this amazing hormone. Best evidence is it's
about 100 million years old and what it first evolved for was like the most basic thing that
mammals were getting around to doing which was making mothers get attached to their kids and
kids attached to their mothers which is really essential if you're going to do that mammal
dependent on mom stuff. So that's been around for about 100 million years. Best evidence is about
30, 20 million years ago it then got you know refigured and started being used as well for
pair bonding. You know monogamy and it's just a tiny percentage of social mammals that are
monogamous but they make heavy use of oxytocin and whether we are one of those species is a
really interesting top again and of itself because we're not but we're kind of a little
bit and we're very confused and then I don't know maybe in the last five million years oxytocin
then got reconfigured again for things like trust and social cooperation and generosity and game
theory settings and all that. Here's the naughtiest thing we've done with oxytocin. This 100 million
year old hormone and in the last 20,000 years we've reconfigured it again so that we secrete it
and our dogs secrete it when we're looking into each other's eyes. Like whoa we're now using oxytocin
for feeling attached to our ex wolves like 20,000 years a blink of an eye and now we use it for that
and you give a dog oxytocin and it looks at its human longer. Okay so everything about oxytocin
there is great and if we could just dump oxytocin in the water supply this would be a wonderful
planet. Oxytocin promotes prosociality. It doesn't. Oxytocin promotes prosociality with people who you
consider to be an us. People like me and your pet dog who you spend more on for food each year than
your Sudanese gets in a decade counts as an us. What does oxytocin do when you're encountering
thems? It makes you crappier to them. It makes you more preemptively aggressive. It makes you
less trustworthy. Oxytocin doesn't make you nice. It makes you nice to people who already count as a
you and it makes you awful to them. It just takes this us them like fracture line we have in our
heads and it just pushes it apart further and amazing studies showing you give people oxytocin
and they become more cooperative to their team members and they become awful to the people on
the other team. It is not this groovy hormone. It is this hormone that makes parochial
you know provinciality more dramatic and that's not often a good thing.
It's just so obvious to me how critical biology and where these neurotransmitters originated
and why and what they're doing to our behaviors and our culture are so relevant to what we face.
What do you know about how oxytocin or anything else can change
the dynamic or who is us and who is them? How does that change?
Well what it's really ideal for is what a lot of these hormones that expect
affect social behavior are good for. Yeah you get someone who's super aggressive and testosterone
makes them more aggressive. You get someone who's incredibly altruistic and prosocial and oxytocin
probably makes them more so. Who you want to get are the folks in the middle when they're looking at
an ambiguous stimulus. Is this face angry threatening or what and most people would say
looks neutral to me and give someone testosterone and they now perceive it as being threatening.
Take a neutral face and give somebody oxytocin and they're now more likely to look at as friendly
or trustworthy. Where these hormones do their most modulatory things is the gray zone where what
you're perceiving really is much more in the eye of the beholder than the external realities of your
perceptions. It's really good at influencing interpretations in the gray zone and that's
well once again it doesn't really require a hormone to have hated Nazis even more than you
hated them before but depending on which politician is spouting which stuff a hormone
that turns a neutral ambiguous signal into a strongly felt one for good or bad
that's where you really see the interesting consequences. It's so fascinating. So I want to
get to your new book but one of my staff members is a fan of your work and she wanted me to ask
something related to one of your books why zebras don't get ulcers you talked about stress
and for an individual making a decision now the effects of stress in the last few months of their
life will if I understand it correctly shrink the prefrontal cortex and enlarge the amygdala
affecting whatever decision that that individual make. So following the logic of the great
simplification that we're approaching the the peak of the carbon pulse and we're going to have
less energy to power society if individuals who are barely having their basic needs met
stressed out in terms of survival are those individuals less likely then to be pro-social
and more prone towards towards violence in effect in a society with less access to resources and
lower standard of living does that itself change the brains of its citizens immersed in that causing
a negative feedbacks and less trust etc yep absolutely and in all the bad ways you especially
you might imagine it's not just in the previous few months it's already you look at this this is
one of these findings where you should be up and screaming at how the world works this way
you use some totally fancy brain imaging techniques that you could use on a fetus
and by a third trimester fetus their mother's socioeconomic status is already affecting their
brain development by way of the mother's stress hormone so it's not just in the last few months
it's starting from when you were still like mostly being fed by mom's blood in her stress hormones
so in that regard it's an entire lifetime worth of good or bad luck that is sculpting your brain
into a more reactive this or a sluggish that and all of that absolutely plays out
in terms of your your specific question of a world of more and more deprivation
hunger fear stress uncertainty all of that temperature ambient temperature in cities
the ambient temperature on a particular day is a statistically significant predictor of levels
of violence as this planet gets hotter cities are going to be more violent you look at people
not where they live now but where they grew up and you look at people who grew up in cities
versus rural areas and their structural differences in their brain on the average
whoa is this pertinent to our everyday lives absolutely and I think we're three and a half
years into seeing one of the most tragic versions of it which is for about a week or so into covid
everyone said wow we're all in this together and that lasted about a week and all it is done
is polarized people and bring out the worst in an awful lot of people while bringing out the best
in some people um but exaggerating us them contrasts and making empathy totally tunnel
visioned and that's been awful seeing that for the last three and a half years and just to be
really pessimistic oh my god there's this new virus that suddenly is the most important thing in the
world we blew it with our response to that that's a pretty unappealing trial run for what the
equivalent's going to be when our cities are flooding and there's not enough crops being
grown anymore um yeah this was not a good dress rehearsal yeah I hear you on that so if if it were
possible and fundable and and there was political will if we truly cared about the society of the
future and what Palo Alto and San Francisco might look like in in 2050 or any city in the world
wouldn't it make sense to invest in third trimester security and oxytocin with groups of
happy people surrounding pregnant women so that they don't have stress I don't know how
feasible it is but would it pay dividends over decades if such a thing were pursued
um actually multiple lifetimes which brings in this okay so how did your brain construct
genes had something to do with it but environment beginning and fuel life has something to do with
what does that actually mean on a nuts and bolts level environmental stimuli starting from where
you were fetus did what you had for breakfast this morning will change which genes in your
brain are active and which are turned off and in some cases will turn some of them on permanently
and some of them off permanently and then there's these amazing mechanisms something that's called
non-mendeleon inheritance of traits that because of something in the world you developed in um
you have a body with a certain physiological profile such that when you are pregnant you will
pass on some of those traits to your fetus not through genes but because of the hormonal
environment that's been generated things like that where it will affect your parenting style
in a way that will produce a kid who as an adult will be just like you some of these things are
multi-generational now amid that um you've got this like a narrow line to to the sort of tread
there which an awful lot of like social progressives have to do which is wow adversity societal adversity
social adversity all of that is so so bad for you that could actually have multi-generational
consequences wow that's really bad that's really bad but where the temptation then is to say and
these are such strong effects there's nothing we could do about it the other side of it is
there's very little of that biology that winds up being written in stone interventions at every
point in life can undo some of those things it's this whole like trendy sexy field called neuro
plasticity you make the environments of 90 year olds more sensorially stimulating and at post-mortem
they were making new neuronal connections in the park so wow bad stuff leaves long long scar tissue
but it's reversible how do you reconcile these two that seemingly are contradictory yeah
bad stuff leaves consequences for a long time afterward and the longer you wait to try to reverse
it to try to counter it the more of an uphill battle it's going to be you want to fix somebody who
has been mired in the neurodevelopmental consequences of poverty do something about it when they're
four years old not when they're applying to college thank you for all that let's move on to your new
book determined a science of life without free will which is as i look this morning is available
for pre-order on amazon and elsewhere can you give an overview of the main thesis and and maybe
in there please start by defining what you mean by free will okay um i published this book about
five years ago called behave the biology of humans that they're best and worst and it was
like the original draft was a thousand pages and my publisher had a panic attack and it was
eventually merely a impossible 700 it was how do you understand where social behavior comes from
yeah it was caused by neurons one second ago but it was also caused by whatever
environmental stimuli in the previous minute made those neurons do that and it was also caused by
your hormone levels this morning that made this or that part of the brain more or less sensitive to
these stimuli and it has to do with like trauma or stimulation in the last year and it's got to do
with adolescence and child and fetal life and your genes interacting with all of that and what's
most like charming to me it also has something to do with what kind of culture your ancestors
invented 400 years ago because that's going to have affected how your mother was mothering you
within minutes of birth cultural differences with that and thereafter so everything from
like was there a good or bad smell in the room just now affects people's opinions about social
politics to where your ancestors dealing with a high infectious disease load and thus they were
spooked by foreigners coming in and that influences cultural differences and xenophobia today all that
stuff matters so you know i'd stand up in front of like a bunch of people and go on about this for
60 minutes and at the end the ones who were like still standing inevitably someone would say
whoa you know this seems to kind of challenge the notion of free will and like my immediate
response was uh yeah you think you know i haven't believed in free will since i was 13 or so but it
was a little bit of a revelation of okay i gotta like do son of that previous book and make explicit
when you put all these pieces together there is no room for free will whatsoever we are nothing
more or less than the biology which brought us to this moment over which we had no control
and its interactions with environment that brought us to this moment which over which we had no control
so the first half of the book is like trying to in a less screechy way like convince somebody of
that and basically go after all of the contemporary compatibilist arguments where you don't have to
deal with like a media peasant you can deal with someone contemporary who says yeah atoms exist
and molecules exist and neurons are for real but here is somehow how you still pull free will
out of the the rabbit's hat there of like taking on the contemporary arguments for free will
um the second half of the book is the one that's been much more challenging to me since i was 13
which is okay okay you convinced me there's no free will i give up okay um oh my god what if
people actually started believing this how are we supposed to function what's the world supposed
to look like if we all accepted that there's no free will at all and what the second half of the
book is about is like trying to wrestle with that and the themes over and over and there are
number one the roof isn't going to cave in we're not going to have like murderers running throughout
the streets because over and over we've been able to deal with subtracting responsibility
out of our understanding of where behavior comes from and not only doesn't the world run
a muck at that point it's become a more humane place wow witches really don't cause hailstorms
so that is one point another is this sort of knee jerk responsive oh my god if it's deterministic
world and there's no free will does that mean nothing can change no it means this is exactly
how we change here's the biology of how you turn nazis into ex-nazis 40 years later who were remorse
for all of that and i guess the third final theme in there um is if you look at this and this is
depressing at hell as hell oh my god maybe my like corner office and my corporation and my
sense of like self-esteem that i've gotten from that wasn't earned because there's no free will
or whatever what a bummer maybe this leaves a big existential void if that's your response to
there being no free will you're one of the lucky ones from most humans on earth their experience
isn't being given credit for stuff that they really aren't worthy worthy of being credited for for
most humans it's being blamed for stuff that was out of your control and a world in which people
stop believing in free will is going to be a hell of a lot more humane i have a lot of questions
robert um i sent a note around to my inner circle about a week ago in anticipation and
preparation for this interview and the response on this topic was very polarizing there were
some people who thought uh there were three responses in three groups one group was like
it doesn't matter a book is we've been having this discussion of free will for centuries a book
isn't going to change that there was another camp that said this is horribly dangerous because it
could lead to nihilism at a time when we need a pro-social response from more people um and then
another camp which was actually the majority including my girlfriend they felt liberated
by it because it it got them off the hook of things that had been bothering them and they're
content in their own lives um so it made them this is what i'm good at this is what i'm doing
so it was really fascinating three three categories of response and these are largely
intellectual well well-read people that i shared it with but um before i ask you further questions
could you just define what you mean by free will is it a binary thing yes or no or is it a
spectrum or a continuum yeah and this this part of the debate itself um and apropos of that and
your your canvassing people it's interesting that you didn't get in fact the most common response
including people who think about this a lot including people who like make a profession
think about this a lot saying yeah yeah yeah this is how the brain works this is how genes work this
is how poor but somehow i still believe in free will and it's still there which is very
different from your people who said oh my god nihilism the people who say well even if there
isn't free will we probably shouldn't tell people that because things are going to go crazy after
that most people somehow are the term is compatibilists they're able to believe in things like 21st
technology and science and stuff but somehow there's still a way of getting free will out of
there and that's 90 to 95 percent of contemporary philosophers so it's almost like a it's almost
like a religion then like i'm not going to die climate change isn't going to be a disaster
because the truth is so painful that you don't it's like cognitive dissonance of sorts yeah
and of course the most interesting ones are these super smart philosophers who go on and on
in books that i can't understand about how yes yes yes i'm willing to admit i believe this is a
physical universe but here's where we get free will from and when you really really look at what
they're saying and when you look at their like youtube lectures and you look at where their
faces get sort of wincy and pain-looking and stuff most of the time what they're saying is
please let's pretend there's free will because damn this is going to be scary if there isn't
which puts you you know one of those circles of your friends okay so what do i mean by free will
people who get gummed up with free will stuff in the legal realm it's always stuff like
did you know you had options to behave differently where you were aware of what the consequences
would be of the option you did choose all that's all the stuff about intent
and that's completely boring to me then there's a whole school of people neurobiologists you
think about free will and what they say is something that's sort of like the the
cousin of like the legal approach which is when you first become aware that you intend to do
something is it possible to show that your brain already decided to do that is the awareness
is your sense of intent just a total red herring and in fact your brain decided before you think
you're decided whoa there's no free will and this was from some landmark experiments in the 1980s
and people have been fighting about the interpretation of that ever since and you know
it's not clear because and it totally bores me also because both the legal realm and the ooh
when do you become aware of intent and is that different from when you become aware of being
aware of intent and here we're going to fight that for the next 10 years between the neuroscientists
and the philosophers none of those people and none of the legal people ask where did that intent
come from in the first place and that's where things fall apart because the intent came from
what those neurons were doing a second ago and what the hormones were doing this morning and
what your fetal life and genes and culture and all of that and when you look closely at that
there isn't a crack in that edifice of biology interacting environment from what your ancestors
were up to to what happened a millisecond ago there isn't a crack in there in which you can shoe
horn in this non biological notion that there's free will so one of my coaches has been talked to
me about meditation and other things and shares this famous quote from victor frankle between
stimulus and response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response
in our response lies our growth and our freedom and i've always loved this quote
but in light of your recent book what are your thoughts on that quote um it's beautiful um it's
clearly what was needed to sustain people who survived concentration camps and victor frankle
was one of them um but he understood the reality of it people who became depressed and gave up and
concentration camps died people who were able to quote choose to hold on to what mattered to them and
you know there are sense of self worth and whatever and had these amazing abilities to resist during
this hell hole um they only survived if they had all those admirable traits plus a hell of a lot
of luck because if you didn't have that luck if your number came up today it didn't matter how
you know optimistic your basic temperament was so he was taking basically the lesson that
got him through that and it's incredibly powerful nonetheless that's not how the biology of it
works you look at somebody in a concentration camp who sunk into depression and they were dead
two months later even before starvation was enough to explain it and you look at someone
like victor frankle who was able to find meaning in life which plus a hell of a lot of luck got him
at the other end and it's not by chance that those two people differed but but maybe maybe it's the
belief in free will in this case was more important than actual free will absolutely um on the other
hand if you believe you are responsible for the fact that you haven't become rich um just because
you happened to have been born poor that's not a very good recipe for coming out the other end
feeling good about yourself okay here's a great example of this like one of the stupidest ways
in which we could think about ooh biology affects our perceptions of us like the shape of your skull
the shape of your skull how symmetrical it is whether the zygomatic arches underneath your
eyes that make your cheekbones are of a particular shape you know yeah it's got nothing to do with
free will it's got to do we know bone morphobrenic morphogenic proteins and all of that and it just
so happens that in one realm if you look out and you have one of these nice symmetrical faces
that counts as more attractive people like you more they treat you better they unconsciously
are more cooperative with you they're more likely to vote for you so you get somebody who like is
sitting in the corner office and part of it is that they've got magnificent cheekbones and whoa
there's no free will maybe you shouldn't feel quite so proud of all your accomplishments because
your cheekbones are just the first of the zoolian things that you didn't control but then in another
setting if you're sitting in a defendant's seat in a courtroom and you happen to have those cheekbones
that are not of the beautiful type you're more likely to get convicted the attractiveness of a
defendant influences for the same exact circumstances with mock cherries and experiments the likelihood
of getting convicted people who are more attractive african-american men who have less
less afro stereotypical features to their face are less likely to get convicted that's not stop
feeling so good about yourself about your corner office that you were more likely to get sent to
jail because of this like dumbass business about the symmetry of your skull what kind of world is this
what does uh 18 to 20 year old uh listening to this podcast who does not have a symmetrical
face to make of what you just said it sucks it sucks because this is a very deeply ingrained uh
you know primates and other animals like more attractive organisms fruit flies like more
symmetrical ones and symmetrical here is just like the tip of the iceberg of all the versions of
good biological luck it sucks amid that the notion that there is an average that there is a norm
out there this is what a normal person is supposed to look like this is a normal height this is a
normal degree of extroversion this is a normal degree of beauty this is a normal normal is an
emergent artifact there is no normal there is no human who is normal and normal is an artifact
that every one of those traits just to get all like chaos theory stuff is a strange attractor
nobody is normal what we call normal is people whose collections of traits are statistically
closest to what we've decided counts as desirable and healthy there's no normal out there that you're
failing to live up to is is there uh something interesting on on the other side of this that
someone listening to this or even myself um when i hear you don't have free will
i'm like hell yeah i do i'm gonna show you and and it actually becomes a a flipping moment where
they it may not actually be free will but it may become dedication or motivation that was
nascent within them towards some life of purpose or something different that was triggered by someone
telling them they didn't have free will what do you think about that yeah here's here's a scenario
i've experienced like i can almost see it coming and i'm like not trying to sound snarky here but
like it's kind of like this i'm sitting there i have office hours two students are there taking
my class and they're saying yeah i don't know about this free will stuff and but you know what
about i feel like i'm having free will and and i'm saying there's no free will and here's the
biological explanation for what you just brought up and at an incredibly high rate over my like 40
years of doing this at some point one of the students is going to lean forward pick up a pen
and say i just decided to pick up that pen are you telling me i had no free will on this and over
these years asking the question which of those two students are going to do that and i will
bet you i have about 85 90 predictability if i know one of them is male one of them is female
i'm betting it's more likely to be the male one of them is male who's heterosexual and the female
is attractive i'm betting it's more likely to be the male one of them is first generation from an
immigrant group that came here as refugees they're less likely to challenge me one of them hates their
father and i keep reminding them of that they're more likely to challenge me one of them had higher
testosterone levels this morning they're the one who's more likely to challenge one of them has more
self-esteem problems and the one time they stood up to a bully in middle school they got a sense of
self-esteem from that they're more likely give me all tell me how their frontal cortex is wired
tell me what their fetal life was like tell me what culture tell me if their fourth generation
going to my like elite school or if they got into the first generation fourth generation they're much
more likely to want to take on some like dead white males sitting there uh first generation
they're more likely to feel grateful or intimidated about challenging hope like throw all those
variables together and i got like 90 predictability with that and that's because where did that intent
to pick up that pen just come from where did that intent and the other person did not pick up the
pen where it came from it came from one second before in a decade before in a thousand years before
and all of that wow um i was about to tell you uh something that happened to me this morning but
but then you're going to psychoanalyze me but um on the days of our podcast i go for a long bike
ride because it oxygenates me and i came back and i was craving like protein um an omelet
with cheese and i was opening the fridge and i just it wasn't like i'm going to show robert it was
unbidden to me and i said you know what i'm not going to have an omelet i'm going to have an
oatmeal so i didn't want oatmeal but i just approved myself it's a tiny little trivial example
but is is that free will that in the moment i changed what i wanted to do but kind of because
i wanted to prove you wrong a little bit or what's going on there no of course not there was no free
will there at all like if you okay as a as a you know canonical example if you grow up thinking your
parents are the greatest and as an adult you wind up exactly like them you didn't choose to be that
way if you grow up and circumstances has caused you to hate and despise your parents and as an
adult you make sure you do exactly the opposite of them in every single possible domain you're just
a determined you're just as there's no more free will in that case than the other or if you've decided
you love some of these attributes of them and hate others so you're a hybrid of them okay so you
this morning after the bike ride looking in there so first thing uh where'd your self-reflection
come from you didn't choose to be someone capable of like emotionally intelligent self-reflection
and examination of your motives and behaviors next where did your sense of like to the extent that
i represent any sort of like neurobiological authority where do your sense of like occasionally
challenging their bullshit you're higher up on the baboon hierarchy than than me uh well in
in talking about how neurons work i definitely am in navigating the social world my guess is
i'm definitely not but where did where did you become the sort of person who would want to say
some version of i'm going to show him um where did you become somebody who would have critical
thinking and enough respect for critical thinking to think critically and say this may be constitutes
a refutation of this stance where that didn't come from nowhere if you had grown up marinating an
alcohol from your mom when you were a fetus you wouldn't have been capable of that critical
self-reflection if you would grown up in a culture where they said what you were told is true and do
not challenge authority or if you were thrown grown up in a culture where you're like ethos is
anything the man says is bullshit and you should challenge it you didn't choose which of those
cultures you did and every one of those steps along the way nor did you choose the neurochemical
makeup of the part of your brain that does starch craving versus protein craving and
depending on how those two places were wired through no credit to you it would have something to do
with how readily you could think about this intellectual thought experiment of taking on
this stance if there's no free will and showing that it's not really the case here by foregoing
starting instead of protein maybe in some other case you're the reinforcement you would get from
one of those was so powerful that you would do the I'm going to show him in some other setting
you're going to wait for the next elevator instead of cramming in there you see I chose to do that
because you happen to have a brain this wired for really really liking like starch after a bike ride
so that's not where you would have done that experiment every one of those steps
none of that was free so actually that brings up another kind of profound insight while you were
speaking and I don't I don't want to make all these examples about me but when we're talking
about free will I only know my own my own brain so you know I worked on wall street I was a teacher
and then all of a sudden I've got this podcast and it's becoming more popular I'm getting emails
from around the world I'm getting traction with people in government with universities
and it feels like my life is no longer my own and and listening to you speaking
it makes me even more have a fiduciary responsibility to these times and to
help midwife society through to a softer landing than the defaults and you talking about that we
don't free have free will actually makes me feel more of of that drive and and that you know acting
as a golden retriever overton windows sort of a vector in these conversations what's going on
there as I'm feeling that well once again you're proving there's no free will because
lots of other people at your juncture would decide it's hopeless and instead you take this
information and you've turned it into some sort of moral imperative to try to like make the world
whole um that doesn't happen by chance that's not random who's capable of doing that lots of people
who find out about this like collapse into like self-interest or a nihilistic nothingness or
or where did that response come from that's an incredibly healthy response especially for all
the people in the world around you that's a great way as and that didn't come from out of nowhere
nothing comes from nothing but like your dad had 14 percent of the architects had learned from him
cultural evolution can happen that way irrespective of whether there is free will or not
of course but whether culture evolves isn't dependent on whether or not there's free will
I don't think there is free will cultural phenomenon could be explained with the same
biology interacting with environment blah blah blah that I've been spouting cultural evolution
could be explained by the myth of free will as well it's it's in some ways a separate topic
until you start getting into what were the nuts and bolts about how the culture just evolved
so what about free won't uh so about 10 years ago um I like you love dogs and I realized that pigs
were smarter than dogs or as smart and I one of my favorite things to eat was bacon lettuce and
tomato sandwiches and my girlfriend didn't eat meat and I'm like I'm giving up pork but it was
very difficult so I created this image in my head of trucks on the highway that had pigs in them but
instead they were dogs and I had this visceral negative response to any menu with with pork on
it and I haven't had pork in in 10 years so that's not free will um but I call it free won't I decided
something that was ethically important to me and I I created a way for my neocortex to to trump my
limbic system in the moment how do you explain that it's a little bit of a semantic issue as to
what counts as free will versus free won't your experience can be an example of free won't I'm
not going to eat pig anymore or it could be an example of free will I'm going to stick to a moral
stance of mine so it's a little bit semantic and in so far as it's semantic it's the same answer
where'd that free won't come from in you first off where'd your knowledge of like what gets
done to pigs where did your love of dogs come from where did your capacity to generalize empathy
from dogs to pigs where did your knowledge of pig intelligence come from where did your frontal
cortex get the means for you to like look at the bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on the menu
and somehow to suppress the associated cravings and instead pull up an image of terrified dogs and
a transport truck or your your mother did something right by you that you have a frontal cortex that
was capable capable of regulating impulsive cravings to that extent because that got constructed at
you at some point your brain is of a type where whatever rewards bacon gives to your the correct
neurons in there it's not so powerful that it overwhelms your capacity for you know emotional
regulation and it's quite possible that you have lurking in there a craving for something else
that you wouldn't be able to override you have for sure not because you lack self-confidence
self-discipline there but because oh you're wiring you know ben and jerry's ice cream sets off neurons
that will not be said no to um but bacon didn't once you set your conscious frontal cortex to it
sufficiently so if there is free will um would it reside in the frontal cortex um
well again not to sound snarky but that's a hard one for me to answer because that's
in a sense asking me if if the tooth fairy existed which much neurons would let me rephrase the
let me rephrase the question so in the amazon bio for determined they write
that sepalski mounts a full frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there is some
separate self telling our biology what to do but couldn't biology itself in our ancestral
environment created via evolution and adaptation such a separate self from novel historical
circumstances that that is the part of a body that exerts control um in certain situations
in my situation to decide not to eat pork well yes and no um this this puts us into sort of your
area of like thinking about emergence this is totally cool phenomenon one of the like
most interesting things about neuroscience is you take a neuron from a fruit fly and you take a
neuron from us and they're the same thing they're the same cell they use the same neurotransmitters
the same wiring we did not become human because we invented new parts of the brain or new types
of neurotransmitters what happened instead is one of those more is different scenarios of
we've got a hundred million neurons for every neuron that a fly has and you put that many of
them together an unexpected complicated adaptive totally beautiful stuff emerges and the interesting
stuff in our brains are a merchant phenomenon like you give a chimp as many neurons as us
and it would come up with theology it would come up with a totally different theology
and it would come up with aesthetics it would come up with okay so why isn't free will just an
emergent phenomenon the belief in free will the invention of the notion the emotional connectedness
to it and dependence upon the notion is certainly emergent but free will is not because neurons
don't work that way okay what do i mean by that the coolest thing about emergence is you take an ant
and it's making no sense at all and you put 10 ants and they're just doing random incoherent stuff
and you put 10 000 of them and they build a whole society and it's not because when you get 10 000
of them suddenly the ants understand geometry or something they know exactly the same simple
stupid few local neighbor interaction rules that they did when there was just three of them
but when you put enough of them together out pops this and all of the models for how free will
can be an emergent property requires you to break that rule and instead allow that once
you get enough ants together all of the ants can speak french and once you get neurons together
all of them could work in ways that the physical universe doesn't allow the whole the coolest thing
about like emergence is you look at our brains inventing stuff and we're made out of the same
cells as drosophila brains are and they're still doing the same stupid things the amazing this is
what is like totally provincial three or four local neighbor rules and suddenly you throw them
enough of them together and they're still just as simple that's that's the thing that makes me
like almost want to weep at how cool emergence is and it explains so many things out there
but any model in which you have to speculate that the emergent metal level property now
suddenly gets the ability to reach down to the micro level of the constituent parts
and make them work differently in much cooler ways it can't work that way in every version
of free will coming out of an emergence requires that so my work and you you watched my movie recently
looks at the emergent constraints of the macro human economy the eight billion ants eight billion
humans that no one is in control and that society at least for now is this functioning as an energy
hungry superorganism but your recent work suggests the same is happening at the micro level in an
individual brain of sorts so am i correct in saying that biology constrains both our micro and our
macro systems but it doesn't determine it what do you think about that well of course i'm going to
disagree because i don't think it just constrains when you look at all of the biological influences
from the second ago to a million years ago and you look at all the ways the biology interacts
with environment not only isn't it constraining or facilitating that's all there is that is what's
there that is who we are that is how we arrived at being who we are at this moment there's nothing
but that but you bring up in your bringing up the micro level stuff one of the like inevitable things
that people get pulled to at this point which is oh a deterministic universe and deterministic
interactions of deterministic biology and interactive ways with deterministic environment
blah blah blah etc what about quantum indeterminacy and what's that because you that's you get down
to the sufficiently micro subatomic level and events right now were not caused by the events
that just came before that there is complete unpredictable randomness about how subatomic
particles work and people still like are boggled by it and don't fully understand it and there's
still like a counter revolutionary old guard of physicists who say there's got to be actually
a deterministic thing lurking in there someplace but on a very very subatomic level things appear
not to be deterministic and are totally random and thus what do you know there's a whole school
of philosophers who say free will comes out of quantum indeterminism and that doesn't make any
sense either so let me go down a little bit of an academic rabbit hole here my phd advisor who
since passed away trials good night was an evolutionary biologist who focused on multi
level selection the fact that it wasn't just selfishness but it was the individual competitiveness
with group behavior with maybe some bacteria or things in your gut that our selection was
happened at multiple different levels and he called that contextual analysis so with respect
to free will doesn't it depend on multiple scales and dimensions like what's happened
to an organism's life we say organisms have will which might also describe as desire or preference
so an organism feels hunger okay so it seeks food finds it eats is satisfied then other
drivers come kick in after it's satisfied it has a defense or shelter or to go to the bathroom or
to mate so these are all genetic programs with chemical rewards but what about this case the
organism feels hunger but because of the complexity of its emotions its life the society
um it considers whether or not to act on that feeling and especially if it's a human organism
such a complex animal with hundreds of millions of neurons it might weigh or defer or change the
paths because of these other contexts in its life so how does context fit in with free will
especially with human animals um it's beautiful it's incredibly important and I've I have such
respect for multi-level selection people just because they were like out crying of the wilderness
for such a long time people like David Sloan Wilson then he's been on my podcast yeah ah okay he's
great and he was like pariah for like until uh not in an active kin selection but David Sloan
Wilson and EO Wilson decided that they actually agreed on more things than they disagreed about
and it was like totally beautiful and the resolution was context in some settings this is the most
appropriate level of analysis at the level of groups in some settings it's you know genomic
non-expressed DNA and you're looking at selfish DNA at sometimes just the whole genome and sometimes
and yeah it's context dependent and context is like the most interesting thing about us
because like this was my my last book was all about this uh you know the biology of our best
behaviors and our worst behaviors what's most interesting about it is you could have the
exact same behavior the same neurons telling the same muscles do the same exact thing and
depending on the context you could just be ethnically cleansing a village or you could be
Mother Teresa in one setting pulling a trigger is like self-sacrificial and amazing and in another
it's like one of the most heartless things to do like the motoric aspects of the behavior we carry out
yeah that's kind of interesting to learn the biology that there's nowhere in the air is
interesting as what it means in that context and that's exactly what all of this is about
so your dog just shook his head and I heard the chain and the chain reminded me that you have a
golden retriever in your office and that made me happy and it made me more positive and maybe that
changed the framing of my next question so that's also context or is that totally unrelated to free
will okay so that's context that that's that's one of the sets of webs which went all wound together
and in that case context was about five minutes long knowing I had a golden but also 30 years long
since you were growing up with goldens and 40 000 years long since you were of a culture that
like likes dogs instead of eating them all of that but yeah that's exactly where that came from
so how do you define Robert the difference between free will and agency do you feel any
sort of agency in your life and how do you still feel a drive to contribute to good in the world
if you don't see us as as having free will well this is where like there's no such thing as free will
there's no such thing as agency a criminal justice system that uses the notion of responsibility
and blame and punishment makes no sense whatsoever at the same time a meritocracy
that runs on notions of praise and reward makes just as little sense none of it makes any sense
and someone like telling you you did something rotten ultimately if you really really believe
it makes as little sense as saying that earthquake did something rotten and someone telling you just
did something great and what a good job makes as little sense is telling a flower that's a great
like odor that do you release a fragrance or whatever like that's the reality how and
hell do you function that way how do i function that way i function that way about one tenth of one
percent of the time where i truly truly am able to think i don't deserve anything i am not entitled
to anything i have earned nothing where i truly can think hating somebody makes as little sense as
hating an earthquake yeah i could pull that off for about three and a half seconds at a time before
i fall into my lifetime of cultural training um or framed a different way one tenth of one percent
of the time i can actually function in a way that i think is the only morally acceptable way for us
to function in other words it's not easy and like we all got a long way to go with it but at least
start trying to think that way in the domains that really matter uh when you're deciding like
who gets a life sentence without parole or when you're deciding who gets a corporate salary that's
a hundred times higher than the people working in the warehouse and like if you don't want to have
to try to figure out why that explains why you like uh you know bacon constitutively more than
you like ben and jerry's that's fine you know leave the science alone for that just go with
your instincts that there is agency there but when it comes to the big stuff if we can only
pull it off some of the time that's where we have the moral obligation to do that so what are the
societal i mean you've spent years presumably writing this book and you said that you've been
since you were 13 you believe this way so you've obviously thought about the implications of this
could we use the the scientific uh foundations that you outline in determined uh to influence
the behavior or the policies the institutions of our world in a positive way
well i guess at this point am i going to sound like an npr tote bag toting liberal
or am i going to sound like someone who's much more left in my extreme or am i going to sound
someone who's so far out like i'm not even in the same playing field in terms of lunatic fringe
the only it puts you with the lunatic fringe somebody tells you nice cheekbones and that
makes this little sense to feel good afterward as somebody telling you have a good moral philosophy
and you have just used that to make a million lives better and thank you for being that person
that makes this little none of it makes any sense if you really really follow this stuff out
and the cheekbone end it doesn't really matter but getting people to think more correctly about
punishment and reward and who deserves anything and whether hate ever makes sense at all that's
where it has some major societal consequences i mean just you know as one example of that
we understand how epilepsy works to some degree there was a time when people didn't and if somebody
had an epileptic seizure what they did to you in their 15th century village was burn you at the
stake because you were demonically possessed whoa understanding how this stuff works has societal
implications that's thousands of people who were burned at the stake understanding that schizophrenia
isn't caused by crappy psychodynamically hostile mothering and instead a neurogenetic disorder
whoa that makes a big difference in how the world works and in every one of these cases it
makes for a more human world it's like really good that we don't burn people with epilepsy at the
stakes or tell mothers of teenagers who've just been diagnosed with schizophrenia some Freudian
bile that you caused it because unconsciously you hate your child like it's a better world at
each one of these steps so what what is the difference between a deterministic world which
you are describing and a fatalistic or nihilistic mindset or worldview great um the fatalistic one
is the worst place you could arrive from all of this stuff which is to look at all of these
biological threads around our fingers and all of these environmental and all of these biology
environment interaction threads and and collectively they're much more than threads they're a gigantic
cocoon blah blah blah to conclude nothing can change so why bother what you proved is something
can change you don't eat bacon anymore um it's not really because you chose to no longer eat
bacon it's because you were you were changed previously in life in ways that made it possible
for you to learn about pig intelligence and to evoke images of puppies and trucks we don't
change we don't choose to change but we sure are changed and we have to make use of our knowledge
about how that change comes about because if we don't think the change happens we're totally screwed
nihilism is not like a very happy picture for how we should go about looking at what else there is
out there so this is really a huge call to changing our cultural environment but really to education
and many other things because humans can change but only if our two seconds ago one month ago
five years ago 40 years ago and we can't change the 40 years ago or the 400 years ago but we can
change our cultural stimuli at least in theory right so education and and moving in the direction
of some of these pro-social outcomes will be able to change other people and empower them to do the
environmental equivalent of giving up pork or whatever it is absolutely so you get somebody
who because of environmental events learns that something crummy is going on in Ukraine
and they say wow I'm going to educate myself about the history of like Slavic you know tribalism
or whatever and they come out the other end and tell people you know any of this Putin saying
this is about NATO this is about this is nonsense in the 19th century the Russians were saying the
Ukrainians couldn't use their own language this is centuries old what have you just done there
you have been exposed to environmental stimuli telling you that something's going on in Ukraine
and you decide I'm going to learn more about it how do you turn into the sort of person who at
that juncture would say I'm even interested in the news I want to learn more about it I'm going to
use my critical thinking to see maybe one of the stories being spouted here isn't actually all that
accurate who taught you to challenge stuff like that who taught you to read who to blah blah all
the ways in which you could have been a different person in no ways that you can control and once
that brought about a change in you whoa this has nothing to do with NATO this has to do with
different Slavic tribes hating each other for half a millennium then you're capable of telling that
to somebody else and perhaps they're in a position to be changed by that as a result like on the most
basic like concrete are you kidding me you know yeah actually the world needs to work this way
if you've been listening to this podcast and you've decided this is incredibly galvanizing to you
or if you've decided this is totally wrong or if you've decided this is boring or if you've decided
you really want to get like a cookie um your brain is structurally different than it was two
seconds ago because it has to be that's how it works if what you've concluded is this is boring
I'm going to get a cookie your brain has probably changed in a way that's not going to have a whole
lot of long-term consequences but somewhere in there there are three and a half synapses
that are now working differently than they were working 10 minutes ago they may no longer be
working differently 10 minutes from now it's a very transient effect or if this decides makes
you decide you're going to go out and become like a Baptist preacher or something that change
persisted but everything something just changed in your brain in a way that is ultimately only
explainable by the physical universe and thus like you go get a cookie or thus you go devote the rest
of your life to a different cause than you would have 10 minutes ago because that's all there is
there's nothing more than that and anything more you would invoke to explain that you're invoking
magic that defies how the physical universe works and how emergent systems work and whether or not
quantum indeterminacy has anything to do with what you order on the menu it simply doesn't work that
way why did you write this book it wasn't free will you had to have an idea in your mind other
than getting the science right you've been a lifelong scholar of the human and and primate
brain but what was your hope in in writing this book um well everything ranging from
to make this a more humane humane world to showing those asshole bullies when i was 14
year old in junior high and they were bullying me look what i've done to making money to having
people think i'm a kind person to having people think i have nice cheekbones because they're
confusing writing a good book with all sorts of other things that have nothing to do with it and
are not based in reality yeah all this stuff because my parents wanted me to be a doctor and
they went to their graves wanting me to be a doctor and i turned it to this instead yeah look at this
look at you see you because they wanted me to be a critical thinker yeah look at this you see
so it had to come out this book had it was like you had to give birth to this book as a natural
continuum of your life's work yeah but in the exact same way but in a much less interesting
level that i forgot to bring the charger with me when i went from outside back to here so i
i mean i i love all of your books i've read about a third of this one because it's 500 pages
intense and i've been really busy um but i can see uh this book has striking a nerve especially with
what's going on in our social discourse today are you worried at all about the academic
public response to this book could there be a similar drama like there was created by
Richard Dawkins's selfish gene in the 70s which was a naive interpretation of selfishness back
then but could there be a naive interpretation of the science that could rationalize apathy
and nihilism are you are you excited about that do you have some trepidation what are you what can
you share um and by the way characterizing that is naive with Dawkins is exactly one would get
from a card-carrying multi-level selectionist yeah i'm pretty pretty damn naive and uh and dogmatic
but but it but it did become popular and it was grabbed by people to rationalize look humans are
naturally this way which was an incorrect interpretation but are you worried that we might
get the same reaction with your book i don't have any free will that's what made me do it i wasn't my
fault um absolutely and some of that's exciting and some of that's terrifying because i'm just like
this torpy professor sitting someplace and if somebody decides um like maligning their religious
beliefs or at the other end of the spectrum if i'm maligning their social identity and their
validation of it and they're gonna hate me that's gonna suck um i i have a bit of a conundrum in
that intellectually um very very combative and love it and interpersonally i am totally meek
and skittish so there's going to be an interesting interesting balancing of those tendencies
depending on how much somebody hates my ideas versus if they wind up hating me i i get it so
intellectually robert how could you be wrong about this is there an experiment or something that you
could discover that would change your mind that humans have free will absolutely um and conveniently
it's an impossible experiment but what the hell um okay you've just done something with like incredible
consequence you've pulled a trigger it's highly context-dependent like this matters it makes a
difference and it's possible to track down like the one little node of neurons that told your
muscle to do that so let's look at that node of neurons if you could show me they would have done
the exact same thing regardless of what any of the neighboring neurons did in the previous seconds
that's kind of interesting and impressive but then show me that they would have done the exact
same thing regardless of what you had for breakfast whether you were tired scared stressed aroused
whatever and then show me it would have done the same thing no matter what your hormone levels were
and show me they would have done the exact same thing whether you grew up in an individualist
or a collectivist culture and show me that if you changed every gene inside those neurons
into the set of genes that the person sitting next to you had do all of those things and if
those neurons still made you do the exact same thing you've just proven free will
go good luck yeah yeah i see um okay i i as i said i have hours of questions for you
but i want to be respectful of your time i have one more question related to your book
and your work and then and then we'll get to the the closing questions that i ask all my guests
so so what might be some some key components or even key questions
in a new systems informed design of society based on an understanding of neuroscience
physiology and and no free will um writ small a huge challenge for the field is
we know a lot about how like a neuron works or a little a little circuit of neurons and we know
about like the kind of stuff that brains produce like ideology or or love or things like that
it's really tough the scaling up problem the intermediate range is the big challenge
because traditionally you could look at the electrical activity of three neurons at a time
now these days you can canvas activity in 10 000 neurons and look at their gene
expression profiles and you get these massive bioinformatic data sets and nobody is smart
enough to be able to think in 11 dimensions at once so the connecting the two levels okay so
that's uh let's see i hope lots of grad students are able to do that in the centuries to come
um the much bigger to do is how do we get past this sense that uh judgment makes sense
and punishment makes sense and praise makes sense and that somebody really isn't responsible for the
most wondrous things you can imagine or the most damaging and how do you get past that fact that
in the right circumstances it feels really good to punish someone for righteous reasons
how are you going to do this but you know three four hundred years ago people managed to do that
in thinking about the biologically deterministic phenomenon of epilepsy and subtract satan out
of it and we've done it over and over again in all sorts of other realms this kid is having trouble
reading because of a biologically deterministic thing called dyslexia not because they're lazy
we've done it we've done it over and over we got to do it over and over again
i sometimes feel that we're in this like twilight zone movie and often in my lectures i say that
we've arrived at a species level conversation that we're the first generation of homo sapiens
to to be able to not not necessarily that we are but we have the ability to figure out where we
came from how we got here what we're doing to each other to the planet what our biology is
what we actually need what our natural resource balance sheet is or that of the earth and it
feels like your story is a piece of this it's like looking in the mirror at homo sapiens and
looking all around us and are we gonna have enough time to integrate this stuff do you get that feeling
or how do you respond to what i just said absolutely uh as as a way of kind of summarizing everything
you preach about the clocks ticking and we got a lot of stuff to overcome and a lot of it taps
into this sort of frame from my view of the world what is the universe of circumstance
that has made us into a species that's insatiable why was something wonderful yesterday not enough
tomorrow why are there a few exceptions to that why are there some people who didn't turn out that
way how can we you know opportunize knowledge about that to get to save the world in time
whereas your level of solving the same problem is uh hey you know oil reserves are not going to last
forever this is an anomaly you know there's all these different levels of attacking the same problem
uh the clock is ticking we're running out of all sorts of important stuff and it's very much in our
nature to be awful to have knots when times get bad and like go for it there's no shortage of
approaches that are desperately needed to try to fix some of this stuff what what would you like
the viewers and listeners of this podcast to take away from this brief overview um a little bit of
your earlier work but primarily your new book determined um a science of life without free will
well how how would you like people to to take this subject on after hearing this
this isn't scary because oh my god science i hated ninth grade biology this isn't scary
because the concepts are like inaccessible this isn't scary because it means there's no purpose
in life anything but that this isn't scary because it means we're all going to run amuck
the world's going to become more humane um and this isn't scary because if you're one of the
lucky ones it's going to make you feel like you don't deserve all the great things you've gotten
you don't deserve the great things you've gotten but for most people on earth what they're going to
find out is they don't deserve to have not gotten most of the great things they were deprived so
this is a wonderful thing so this is not oh my god this is like the roof isn't going to cave in
it's going to be better afterward inter individually and on a societal level um if we understand
like where we're coming from and where we're coming from is it doesn't make sense to feel like
you are entitled to be treated better than another human and it doesn't make sense to think that
there's something like evil in looking at the damaging things that this collection of atoms we
call humans are doing versus damaging things that other collections of atoms are doing like this
can only be good things and again i could manage to think this way like one percent of the time
so nobody is saying this is going to be easy but like we got to try so broader than that
not on the topic of free will but you've thought about the human condition and and have a career
choice on human behavioral biology do you have any personal advice to the viewers of this show at
this time of global inequality and anxiety and crazy politics and climate change and and other
things what some people would call the the poly crisis do you have any recommendations to people
all i can say is it takes a hell of a lot of work not to sink into
a depression and a sense of helplessness and my basic nature is such that i do that with a second's
notice um you're not alone things can change big potentially revolutionary things could emerge
from a lot of little component parts uh coming together uh empathy goes a hell of a long way
especially when it's empathy for someone where the empathy doesn't come naturally
and if you want to be a primate and decrease your stress hormone levels it's great if people
treat you nicely and groom you but it turns out it's even better if you groom them instead
and you know maybe all these pieces together you know keeps keeps the clouds away for a few
more seconds at a time and you know take advantage of those few seconds and be proactive
so you've been teaching for 40 years or so um what recommendations do you give to your 18 to
20 year old young humans that take your class at at the end after learning about this and after
also living in a time of of environmental damage and social stress etc or do you not give them advice
at all oh i i pontificate out the wazoo i'm i'm insufferable um and most of them appropriately
glaze over at that point um what what would i tell them what do i tell them um
it looks really tough to make a change but by definition because of my privilege in life i've
wound up spending my career interacting with students who are uber privileged um so if anyone's
going to do it it's you guys yeah because not only did you get to go to one of the best universities
on earth you almost certainly don't have horrible gut parasites because you're one of the lucky ones
maybe the next thing is the thing that fascinates me trying to make sense of
in terms of like making the world whole and one of the completely irrational things we're capable
of doing as humans and have to do the more hopeless the process the problem seems the more you have
to decide that you're one of the ones who can solve the problem which is a version of this
impossible religious stance of the less lovable the person the more you have to find the means to
love them uh you're one of the lucky ones go and do it and keep in mind it's not going to come
cheap and you're going to have to make a lot of personal choices as to what you're willing to
give up along the way uh no one said this is going to be easy that's kind of the underlying
feeling that i'm getting from this great conversation
and irrespective of whether i fully buy that there's no free will or not listening to you i feel
that i am one of the lucky ones and i have to do more than i have been doing to pass the baton
or at least you know accelerate this so that's the emotion that i'm feeling listening to you on
this topic but of course i can only understand my own mind i don't understand anyone else's
and to incorporate something i have to tell myself 99 percent of the time
which is when you lapse and you fail to be that wonderful you're no less a biological machine
yeah that's we're we're dealing with some tough things here and so we have to be kind to our
mismatch yeah and it's like a little bit self-serving to do that almost fatuous you have to love
yourself before you can love others but it helps yeah i've i'm told that often what do you care
most about in the world robert um the scientist in me says being able to sit quietly and see how
pieces of things fit together um the 60 something this says being able to sit quietly and see how
pieces of things fit together and there's less pain afterward yeah i hear you um if you could make
i ask this of all my guests if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse
to your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures um
you know knowing that you're a scientist and you don't believe in magic wands but just hypothetically
well i'll take two since this is like imaginary one is that we habituate to good stuff more slowly
we may not invent that many the next big things but that's probably a good thing in the long run
and i guess the other is
to be able to understand all of the circumstances in which we lose empathy and to understand why it
is that it's so much easier to make a neutral somebody into a them than to make them into an us
let alone to make them into an us because we can do it and the circumstances that make it easier to
do um why does adversity bring out the worst in so many of us this has been a fantastic
conversation um another thought that came to my mind is 20 years ago when i started reading
your books and watching your lectures was it predetermined that i would do a podcast with you
in 2023 um i i so value your intellect and your heart um if you were to come back in the future
on this show um the free will book determined coming out soon aside what is one topic that you
were passionate about relevant to human futures that you'd be curious or willing to take a deep dive
with me on well one that is derivative of all of this and maybe it's because i can't think of
anything these days i can't think of which socks i'm putting on without thinking about this damn
book i've been obsessing over since i was 13 um but maybe on the level of
how do we remember that no matter what amid all of these explanations and stuff
uh
we're biological machines who believe they can feel sad
and because of how the world works thus we actually are sad when that's happening
and we actually are feeling less pain when our machinist has led us to that we are biological
machines who could know our machinists but it doesn't take the the emotional implications of
it away in the slightest it doesn't make pleasure any less pleasurable unhappiness and it doesn't
make pain any less painful i'm going to think about that um thank you so much uh professor
sepalski for for your time today and for your your work and we will uh post a link to your book
online and let's you and i stay in touch good let's do that this was totally fun and
meeting a a distant cousin who not only likes multi-level selection but emergence so
well we're also distant cousins from when pro-console came down from the tree 17
million years ago that too all right sir if you enjoyed or learned from this episode of
