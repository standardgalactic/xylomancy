The dawn of everything is trying to undo, just to write about even very remote periods of history
that we have evidence for, as if there were real people in them. Which sounds like a ridiculous
thing to say, but it's very rarely done. Prehistoric people are more likely to be compared to
non-human primates than they are to people like you or I.
What if everything we knew about human history was wrong? Received wisdom is that humans have been
around for two, maybe 300,000 years, but that we only start agriculture in the last 10 to 12,000.
After that, we have cities, astronomy, numbers, civilization, as we know it.
But according to a book by David Wengrow and the recently deceased David Graber,
that's not quite accurate. They say that cities and what we judge as advanced human culture
actually precedes agriculture. The story of prehistory is far more complex and interesting
than we thought, and that this has quite remarkable political implications.
David Wengrow, welcome to Downstream.
Thanks for having me on.
You're an archaeologist. You teach archaeology at University College London.
Is that a job you always wanted to do when you were a child?
No, it isn't. When I left school, I wanted to be in the theatre, and I'd already done a fair bit
of that. I think from the age of about 14, I fell in love with acting in the stage,
and I joined up with the National Youth Theatre, which was a wonderful time because it was the
first time. As a Londoner, it was the first time I actually met people from all over the country,
all over the UK. I did it. I left school and got an agent and did that for a while,
then did various other things, and then I fell into archaeology more or less by accident.
So how was that? Wow, a child actor becomes an archaeologist. That sounds like a great story.
Yeah, I think it was more of a sort of young adult actor. I mean, I've met child actors,
and they're a very specific kind of person, but I was never quite one of those.
What happened basically after trying various other things, including a little
flotation with journalism at the BBC Arabic Service and various other things, I wasn't
really finding a direction. So I had good grades from school, and I decided to apply to Oxford.
That's why I want to go to the best university I can get into. I want to go to Oxford.
And I wrote to all these Oxford colleges saying, can I come and do English literature?
And they all ignored me. And a friend of mine who it was told me it's easier to get into places
like that if you apply for a subject that's a bit off the beaten track. And they had just
started a new program, a new degree called Archaeology and Anthropology, which is actually
the name of the degree that I teach and coordinate now at UCL. So I wrote to one college, St Hughes
College, asking if I could do that. And I got an interview, and I went into this interview with a
very formidable woman called Barbara Kennedy. She was a geographer because they didn't have any
archaeologists at that particular college. And she grilled me for a while, and I sort of spouted
on about how archaeology was my great passion and so on. And then she reached down and produced
from under her chair all these letters that I'd written to other colleges saying, can I come and
do English literature? I thought, well, I'll bolt that out. But then she admitted me. And I was
technically a mature student, although it was probably anything but in terms of everything else,
but I think it was classified as a mature student when I started. And I nearly made a complete mess
of that actually, and nearly got slung out after about six months. But I have one teacher. It was
one of those things where it's just one person actually gets you hooked and gives you the confidence
to think, you know, yes, you know, you have a place in this, you can contribute. And that was a
guy called Andrew Sherritt, who passed away very young, actually, same age as David 59, just had
a massive heart attack one day. But really sort of got me to pull my finger out and got me addicted
to this stuff. And I didn't really look back after that. Because there's something here all
the time, I'm sure that at some point, most people, when their children want to be archaeologists.
Yeah, I did. I mean, there's obviously something that I can remember a school trip to Old Serum,
St Salisbury Plain, one of these great Iron Age hill forts. And I came back from that and went
back. I used to live with my grandparents a lot in North London, I remember going back to their
place after that. And my head was just full of images. You know, I could see all the different
sort of waves of migrations and invasions. And I produced this, this sort of tone. This is all
pre computers. I think I got like a calligraphy pen or something and sort of tried to create a,
I remember my grand helping me with coffee grinds to sort of age the paper. So you know,
there was something there, which is completely irrational, where you just feel an attachment
to some era. And I don't have any family roots in the British Isles. And it's not like a local
attachment. But you just identify for some reason, with a place or an era of history.
And I don't know why that happens. But clearly people who choose to pursue archaeology, they
have, they have that in an unusually high dosage. Let's get into the meat of your book,
The Dawn of Everything. The conventional view is humans have been around for 200, 300,
1000 years. You can give the specific numbers in the answer. But we've only engaged in agriculture
for 12,000 years, 11,000 years, 12,000 years. And that with the advent of agriculture, we then get
all the things that we associate with with modern humans, cities, numbers, numeracy, literacy,
astronomy, civilization. Your book co-written with the recently departed David Graber says
that's completely wrong. Or it's significantly wrong.
Well, we'd have to pick apart what you said there a bit, Aaron. You know, when you say we
started having agriculture 12,000 years ago, only a very tiny number of people on the planet
started doing that in very specific locations, specifically the Middle East, or they sometimes
called the fertile crescent. Most of the world at that time was still hunter-gatherers and fishes.
You know, actually what you've presented as a summary is a classic example of what we would
call a kind of stage theory, where you've got these long periods when sort of nothing happens.
Then everything changes, you get the agricultural revolution, populations expand,
then you get cities, and everything changes again, then you get civilization. And
one of the things we try to show in the book is that actually the process is much more interesting
than that. And you've got people that what are supposed to be different phases or stages of
history, actually living cheek by jowl, sort of feeding off each other, reacting against each
other, and also consciously planning and designing societies according to different sets of values,
which, you know, when we talk about civilization and modernity, there's this deeply ingrained
assumption to think that it's only us moderns, or supposedly moderns, you know, us post-enlightenment
folk, who've been able to do that to actually make a decision about the kinds of societies we
wish to live in, and then consciously try to make that happen. And I think that's a deeply
rooted idea, both in the intellectual, philosophical, and political traditions of the left and of the
right in Europe, in the European tradition, let's say. And we think that's wrong. And as you say,
humans have been around, as far as we know, humans who are cognitively, just like you and I,
same kinds of brains, perfectly capable of having a conversation, just like the one that we're having,
for something in the order of 200 to 300,000 years. And what we know about most of that time
is vanishingly little. But if you think about it, that's extraordinary. I mean, the number of
things that could have happened, the number of different kinds of conversations and experiments
that could have taken place. And yet, the way we tend to write about and characterize those
early periods is the opposite. It's as if people were existing in some sort of strange haze, just
kind of, you know, following patterns or routines until one day, somebody invents agriculture and
everything changes. And that's the kind of, I guess, conceptual damage that we do to our own past.
The dawn of everything is trying to undo, just to write about even very remote periods of history
that we have evidence for, as if there were real people in them, which sounds like a ridiculous
thing to say, but it's very rarely done. You know, prehistoric people are more likely to be compared
to non-human primates than they are to people like you or I. And I love this insight which you have,
which I'd never ever thought of before, maybe we can go into a little bit, about foragers, hunter-gatherers,
being less parochial, basically, than modern humans. I mean, maybe not today in the age of
the internet, but until relatively recently. Can you talk about that? This is one of the great
revelations of modern archaeology is, you know, this whole idea that humans before agriculture
lived in these tiny bands, sort of isolated pockets of humanity, nomadic, roaming around
the landscape, not having much contact is completely wrong. Like, we can trace back now,
in concrete terms, evidence going back tens and tens of thousands of years before agriculture,
to show that human societies, you know, way even beyond the last Ice Age, were already highly
structured over very large areas. Interacting, moving things around the landscape, we've got
scientific techniques these days, which are pretty good. I mean, you can actually trace
people's diets tens of thousands of years ago, you can say whether they moved from a
coastal environment to a terrestrial environment, you can trace movements of plants, animals, raw
materials, we have ancient DNA. So there are many methods by which we can reconstruct a picture of
early human societies. And it turns out that the world was highly connected. And if you think about
it, this shouldn't be surprising, because of course, one of the first things that humans do
is actually move. And actually, the word that's usually used is that we colonize the globe,
which is a strange term to think of in a way, because there's nobody out there
to be colonized, but we move, and we somehow find our way everywhere from Africa down to South
America and eventually Australia. So you actually start off with a highly integrated and connected
social universe, which may not demographically involve that many people, but they're finding ways
to maintain connections and transfer ideas over extraordinary distances.
In a way that in say the Middle Ages in Europe, certainly wasn't the case, the average
yeah, rural peasant wouldn't leave that. That's right. And this is very interesting,
because it means you have to rethink scale, like the whole scalar factor in human history. In a way,
I think the sort of stereotypical picture that most people have is kind of back to front,
where you think you start off with these small isolated groups, and then human populations
expand, and we end up with globalization. It's almost the opposite. Actually, if you look at the
history of the Middle East, for example, you go from having these big kind of regional systems
to a situation where today, if you want to move from Cairo to Damascus, you've either got to work
for the CIA or go through about 50 different border checks. So in a way, actually, the history
of nation states and hard borders, we've become much more enclosed over time.
One thing about megalithic sites, which again, I've only really
discovered in the last several years, your book is a part of that, is the role of astronomy.
Obviously, there's the equinoxes and the solstices, but more besides that too often,
certain constellations of stars being sort of aligned and recognized and whatnot.
So are we looking then at many, many societies which didn't have agriculture,
yet engaged in really advanced astronomy? Because again, that's something people don't really...
And navigation. We're talking about human populations finding their way through
island landscapes to remote places out in the middle of the Pacific. Of course,
they've got to have a superb grasp practically and intellectually of topography and the behavior of
the seas. And yes, I mean, there's no question. And you see it reflected in monumental architecture
from very early periods, which is often laid out in very precise alignments in relation to
other monuments, in relation to the solstices. Here in the UK, obviously, you have famously
Stonehenge. That's right. I mean, people were clearly more than capable of developing very
sophisticated mathematical geometrical understandings in different ways to the way we do it now.
And the most famous, I guess, sort of discussion of this was the book in the 1960s by Claude
Levy-Strauss, where he tried to suggest that there are basically two different forms of science.
There's our notion of science, which begins in the laboratory. So you carve out an artificial
environment, and you have many codes or whatever, trying to generate new ideas and theories, which
are then applied to the world. And he contrasted that with the way that most human discovery
throughout the history of our species has actually taken place, which is a world of discovery in
which there are no laboratories. Discovery is part and parcel of social life. It's out there in
the landscape in people's interactions with plants and animals. It's applied from the beginning.
And that presumably is how all those early systems of navigation, monumental construction,
metallurgy, all of these things were discovered and generated through other systems of knowledge
than the one that we're familiar with, which is kind of intriguing in itself.
Was Stonehenge built by people that engage in agriculture? Do we know that for a fact, for instance?
That was the consensus until very recently. But actually what we found out in just the last
couple of decades is that the picture is more interesting. So Stonehenge, by the time it's
constructed about 5,000 years ago, farming has already been adopted in the British Isles
as an import from the European continent, but then as in many other places of the world. And
again, you know, this goes back to your initial characterization of human history, where you
get agriculture and then everything changes. The British Isles are one of many examples of
where people adopt agriculture and then basically change their minds. So the period when Stonehenge
and many other great monuments constructed is actually one in which the populations of this
island more or less give up the habit of cereal farming and they go back to foraging wild nuts
and acorns and things as their staple plant food. They decide to keep, they hold on to other things,
so they hold on to the farming of animals, pigs and cattle in particular. There's a site close to
Stonehenge called Durrington walls where they've actually found the place
where people congregated for seasonal festivals and feasted on huge amounts of meat. It must have
been a hell of a party and this presumably was at the times when they were also engaging in these
big coordinated construction activities that we see there. So it's a more complex picture.
They're not farmers or hunter-gatherers. They're some hybrid of like farmer forager herders or
something. So you're saying essentially it's a social choice that's being made? It must have been,
I mean I can't imagine any other way in which people from you know one end of the country to the
other turn their backs on a practice like cereal. I mean how could that happen unconsciously? There's
no evidence of any sort of massive climatic rupture or depopulation. It just seems to be
people deciding that that's not actually what they want to do anymore. That's quite an extraordinary
political choice, isn't it? It is. And Stonehenge is quite extraordinary. I mean there must have
been pretty extraordinary things going on for people to even engage in those kind of you know
feats of construction. But for a contemporary audience I mean the equivalent would be us
deciding that the industrial revolution wasn't a good idea or just you know to stop using fossil
fuels. Wouldn't it? I mean in terms of social implications obviously they weren't thinking in
those terms. It's actually yeah and it raises a question right which is if people have been able
to make decisions on that scale in what we are taught to think of as primitive societies
why do we struggle so much with those kinds of structural changes now? Which leads me on to
I suppose the central question in the book for our audience which is a political audience.
There are obviously extraordinary political implications if the generic what you call
stagist view of history is incorrect or inaccurate because this is the bedrock of most modern political
theory from in different ways. Locke, Rousseau, Hobbes we can talk about that in a second but
also more contemporary people you know the Stephen Pinkers the Yuval Harare's because their
essential formulation is the more complex society becomes the more unequal the more unjust
but it creates it creates more abundance therefore there's a kind of utilitarian argument for it you
know it's well you're talking you're talking about authors and books who sometimes explicitly model
what they're doing on those philosophers of two or three hundred years ago and people actually say
I am a neo-Hobbesian nor a kind of neo-Rousseauian take on human history which is interesting and
it's something David and I noticed around the time when we decided to start thinking about
these kinds of issues was pretty much exactly the time of the last big financial crash about
2008-9 and you know there was a slew of literature as you might expect on inequality and the roots
of inequality and suddenly a lot of those very old ideas you know going all the way back to the
17th 18th centuries really coming back in quite a surprisingly aggressive way you know let's think
again about the deep roots of inequality let's go back to Hobbes let's go back to Rousseau which
as you say you know we're talking about the foundational texts of modern political theory
but it's important to remember that they were completely speculative I mean they were conjured
out of the imaginations of those people with no evidence tangibly whatsoever for the nature of
human societies hundreds thousands of years ago so it's these are kind of imaginary worlds of pre-
history which is quite a sobering thought you know the idea that modern political thought
actually comes out of imagination and its imagination rooted in very specific political
contexts you know Leviathan was written what 1651 middle of the English Civil War and it's partly
about what is the nature of society without government and why is government necessary
Rousseau died what 10 years before the French Revolution you know when he's addressing the
question what are the origins of inequality it is the burning question of his time so these are
entirely political you know their exercises in the political imagination which are obviously
radical and generative at their time but why should we be still asking questions that were
pertinent in 1754 in 2022 is I think an interesting question in itself when we've got all this other
information all this other evidence you know why are we still asking the same questions in this
slightly sort of sclerotic manner you are an academic you're at UCL I was at UCL as an
undergraduate oh yeah I did some modules in political theories it goes and what are you taught
you know introduction to political theory Hobbes Locke Plato Robert Notzik
some more contemporary political theorist John Rawls but who these effectively are building
their thinking on the early liberal tradition of Locke and Hobbes and it's basically 101 why
you should obey the state and like you say it's it's it's based on conjecture speculation which is
several hundred years old and this is a modern institution in a very advanced western capitalist
market economy where apparently we believe so deeply and passionately in empiricism and yet
the very basis upon which we say political sort of political status quo is legitimate is nonsense
frankly it's a good example of I think what is wrong with universities quite often because you
know around the corner from where you were doing that would have been the place where I worked so
we're talking about what the 19 I can't place you here and you're very ageless
okay so around the corner from where you were learning about Locke and Rawls and all the rest
of it would have been the place where I work the Institute of Archaeology actually I think I
probably was already just about teaching there around that time no sorry 2003 no god no thank god
no I wasn't and yeah you know just up the road from there you would have had all these people
actually studying human prehistory but you know it's I guess it's unfortunately in the nature
of universities to carve these things up into separate departments which don't actually generate
that kind of learning where knowledge moves in what should be very obvious directions so well
how does this stuff look now in light of what we actually know and what are the implications of that
so I think it's highly unlikely that archaeology students would have been thinking about
those philosophers whereas the students learning about those philosophers almost certainly
wouldn't have been thinking about the evidence of deep human history and I think that is a
that is a that is a problem I mean it's a lost learning opportunity effectively but isn't it
a failure also of the academics yeah totally absolutely 100% I mean it just strikes me as
completely crazy that you know you have talented professionals teaching this frankly nonsense
to young people but a really important subject you could teach you don't have to teach it as
nonsense I mean you could see it as part of a tradition you know it is it is it is it is important
to study it but you know within the confines of what it is and actually you know when you
look closely at these texts they're very openly speculative you know Rousseau I think sort of
spells it out somewhere when he's describing a story very similar to the one you started with
about you know how agriculture trapped us in certain new ways of life and the invention of
private property he says do not take this as history this is effectively a thought experiment
you know it's it's meant to make you reflect on what private property is and its place in the
world and its effects on us as human beings the distinction of mine and buying if you like
it's not meant to be a reconstruction so actually what's happened with some of the other
modern authors you mentioned is also rather strange where you've got what began as sort
of radical speculation is now presented as objective truth or even a sort of laws of history
and that's what I think sort of provoked us you know David as an anthropologist me as an
archaeologist to think hold on this isn't okay you know we should try and do something about this
basically and you know that kind of motivated us to to start trying to liberate some of this
extraordinary body of knowledge from from these rather siloed context you know get it out from
behind the paywall journals and start piecing together a puzzle which is still very incomplete
of human history but there's already enough pieces there to say that it looks nothing like
the stories that we've inherited from the Enlightenment. Let's talk about Indigenous American
society again there's a few more questions particularly around this which I I think are
so impressive just the the source material that you cover in the book and things that I've just
also learned in recent years again let's go back to stereotypes and received wisdom the idea is that
Europeans discover the Western Hemisphere in 1492 will leave leave Ericsson to one side
and just came back from Sweden actually more keen they they haven't forgotten they have no
they haven't that's it's interesting it's interesting how they do really emphasize that
isn't it the Nordics and we discover effectively a backward civilization which we then broadly
exterminate through a combination of guns, germs and and steel that's not quite right though is it
no and I mean I've been very fortunate in the last year to be able once travel became possible
again after the pandemic to spend some time in Canada and in the US including talking with Indigenous
scholars and historians on various campuses about this and it's not there is a lot in the book I
wrote with David about the pre-Columbian Americas and about early colonial contacts between European
colonizers and native peoples and it's not an area that is actually you know particularly within
either of our wheelhouses you know David's field work as an anthropologist was in Madagascar
my PhD and most of my field experiences in North Africa in the Middle East
so this was a steep learning curve for us which I'm still very much on but it was necessary in
order to answer the questions we were asking particularly about the origins of inequality
which is how the the project started if you look at the literature around the middle of the 18th
century take a figure like Rousseau and the intellectual milieu in which they're debating
the ideas they're thinking through you cannot avoid the Americas and particularly that part of
North America that's now split between Canada and upstate New York basically the the Great Lakes
region and what sometimes called the eastern woodlands which is where Europeans encountered
societies that were organized on radically different lines much more democratic lines
with levels of freedom particularly for women which were unheard of in European societies
at the time and which clearly had an enormous impact on the European imagination including on
the political imagination and we found it was impossible really to understand what was going on
you know once we decided that we didn't want to fall into that trap of just recapitulating
these questions and stories from hundreds of years ago we started asking well how did they come about
in the first place and that does lead you down a certain line of questioning which leads to
the Americas and that's why the book ended up with such a strong focus there
let's talk about Candieronk a Candieronk maybe you've got a really good French accent
I've no section some videos I'll watch for this um he is an actually existing figure
it seems I definitely I mean you can if you want to google it you can see an image from 1701
of a treaty called the great piece of Montreal you can see Candieronk's signature his mark on it
so what's Candieronk's importance who is he? Candieronk was a very well known figure person
of the Huron-Wendat nation which is is very much still a thing it has its administrative centre
which I was lucky enough to be invited to on the outskirts of Quebec city where they have a small
street called Candieronk arm célèbre so we were joking that maybe should extend it a bit now because
he is a key sort of individual in in our book because we have various independent accounts
of this person which tell us that in that time so we're talking about the the end of the 17th century
this is someone who's playing a pivotal role in diplomacy warfare and in trying to negotiate a
better future for for his own people in the midst of a highly complex colonial situation
with French English Dutch colonisers and so on in the mix someone who was multi-lingual and who in
addition to all of those qualities was clearly an extraordinary intellect and a brilliant speaker
and we have various independent accounts of this but for reasons which are very contingent
some of those kinds of conversations and ideas that would have been exchanged between Candieronk
and European interlocutors at the time found their way to a much larger audience in Europe
we know that around that time the governor of what Europeans then referred to as part of New
France that part of the colonies would actually invite Candieronk to his table to engage in debates
purely for pleasure he says you know I did it to entertain my officers because this guy was just
so funny and witty and they would debate many of the topics that would later become central to
what we think of as enlightenment thought you know rationality versus revealed religion sexual
habits marriage customs questions of freedom the role of money in society and in the mix of people
who witnessed those conversations was a minor French nobleman who went by the name La Honte
the Baron La Honte who is a person who went over to the colonies in his youth I think at the age of
17 lived there for a decade spoke at least two indigenous languages and was deeply embroiled
in the goings-on of those tumultuous times but also seems to have been a bit of a troublemaker
didn't get on with authority ended up getting kicked out of the colonies and found himself
more or less penniless on the streets of Amsterdam and he writes these books these sort of travel logs
and finds his way back into favor at court and one of those books is the one called Curious Dialogues
with a savage of good sense who has traveled and it features these conversations between La Honte
playing himself and a character called Adario who everyone accepts is based on Kandirong and in
these dialogues Adario slash Kandirong gives the most brilliant sort of scathing withering analysis
of European civilization and this is the book that takes off like wildfire and inspires countless
imitations it's it's a bestseller it's translated into multiple European languages stage plays which
run for years are based on it and it becomes the foundation of a whole genre of such dialogues
that almost every major enlightenment thinker had a go at so they will take the substance of the
dialogues and put them in the mouth of some completely imaginary exotic you know other
person maybe a Tahitian or Chinese or you know there are many different examples but the the
context that it comes out of is is a real one of culture contact and exchange and the effects on
European thought we would argue were explosive so Kandirong in other words ought to be considered
part of the story of what we call the Enlightenment in the same way as Voltaire, Diderot and all the
rest I mean importantly it precedes all of them so and it precedes them all by some decades so you
have what you might call a sort of proto-enlightenment salon before the appearance of the the famous
salons in Europe you call this the indigenous critique which again reading it I was like
it seems obvious in in in retrospect so for instance you know you have engagement between
the Americas and Europe between 1500 and let's say you know the early 18th century 200 years there of
of cultural to and throw and clearly there would have been these kinds of dialogues and there
would have been some transmission back to Europe it may not have been as much as one would have
hoped or have liked but it would have been significant we're talking about 200 years
and yet that barely figures in our in our understanding of the exploitation and the
colonization of the Americas it's seen as purely one way in terms of ideas in terms of capital and
humans but what you say which I think is actually very empowering for for for for peoples and ideas
which aren't in the global north the most powerful countries is actually it went both ways and that
you can actually situate an indigenous american or you know a whole sort of school of thought which
is you know coming out of the Americas within that european enlightenment which is just I think
really powerful well isn't it isn't intellectually earthshatter isn't it isn't it odd that we even
have to make that point I mean you know what what's the other implication that these people were
you know either living in in some utterly different sort of mode of reality
which cannot be entirely true given that we're talking about a period of trade and military
alliances and you know very intense interaction it's not controversial to point to the fact that
Europeans adopted a lot of material habits from the Americas at that time many of which are actually
linked to the habits of sitting around having those kind of intellectual conversations you know
smoking tobacco from pipes drinking caffeinated beverages and yet there is a great resistance
to the idea that along with those substances and material habits came ideas you know then you get
real kickback and that's kind of interesting in itself because all we're trying to argue in a way
is that ideas particularly about democracy and freedom which European Enlightenment philosophers
themselves attributed to the Americas were actually theirs and I think there is something
disempowering about the idea that notions of freedom do not come from the oppressed or do not
come from the colonized but are something to do with ancient Greece or you know somehow sort of
rooted in Europe actually in the soil of the colonizer I think that is disempowering and
there is something for those who haven't already realized this there is something emancipatory
in understanding what perhaps should be obvious that actually ideas about how to free oneself
from oppression come from the oppressed. Let's talk about some particular places in the Americas
there's one place called Cahokia yeah it was there not long ago about eight months ago so around
a thousand years ago this place is the same size as London so about a thousand AD it's got population
in the tens of thousands you know ballpark it's a get larger estimates are something like around
perhaps 40 000 people at its height around the 14th century yeah so maybe Norwich or something
you know it's a largest European city what happens to it? This is very interesting and a little bit
controversial but what is clear is that having grown and extended I say I was walking around
in this place with colleagues of mine including an archaeologist who's worked there all his life
like about 30 years which was great because when you go there there isn't a lot to explain to you
what you're walking around there's this enormous mound called the monks mound there are many different
earthworks and mounds there and this thing is huge and it's in the middle of what is now a kind of
national park that has a road running through the middle of it and you know this unfortunately has
been the fate of many important indigenous heritage sites in North America you may have a
road running through it you get very good Mexican food there's little restaurants and things and
you're actually standing in the middle of the largest pre-Columbian city the largest indigenous
settlement in North America and it has these great monuments archaeologists have worked there over the
years it becomes the center of a whole regional system not probably an empire in the sense that
we think about it but the influence culturally and politically of Cahokia spreads on a really
extraordinary scale throughout the Mississippi base and it's clear that certain things are going on
there which are predicated on various forms of hierarchy or inequality there's a mound which
is is actually full of the bodies of young women who seem to have been ritually killed in in some
kind of horrible ceremony on the monks mound itself there's an incredible ability to have
surveillance over the whole settlement and we know that when the site centralizes the surrounding
countryside sort of empties out you get these housing districts which would have all been visible
from up there you get fortifications forming and it seems to be going in that kind of direction
and then everything changes and the area is abandoned depopulated archaeologists for
generations have referred to the whole region around Cahokia as a sort of vacant quarter
and it appears to have been
almost forgotten I guess to the extent that we don't even know you know the name of this place
the genuine name of this place it doesn't really feature in any clear way in later oral histories
so people in some way or other turn their back on Cahokia and there are various theories about
this to do with environmental collapse which are in my opinion not entirely compelling
and increasingly I think people are looking at this situation in the same way that they're
beginning to look at the the so-called Puebla civilizations of the American southwest where
again you have these you know quite big centralized sites which are subsequently abandoned is that
well why shouldn't we at least consider the possibility that people are genuinely
walking away and deciding to create a different a different kind of social order different kind
of social arrangements and actually when you start looking at it that way it enables you to
join the dots or make a bit more sense of the kinds of societies that Europeans did eventually
encounter a few centuries later in the same regions some of which were still very hierarchical
like little mini Cahokias but others had developed this highly egalitarian way of living which you
know the natural assumption for Europeans to make is that they just always been that way
but of course we're talking about people with fully developed historical consciousness
who do have in their own histories the history of Cahokia and the whole regional system that
are generated which goes almost as far north as the Great Lakes so there is a hierarchical
past there that people have for one reason or another turned their backs on and created a
different form of society and that's something that we we dwell on a bit in the book because it
just you know it enables you to get past this idea that we're talking about people who are
somehow you know frozen in one pattern of culture or sort of have no history there's also this other
great example of I'll get this right Teotihuacan which is I think that's very good but I'm told by
my Mexican colleague that even Mexican scholars don't always pronounce it quite there's Teotihuacan
which she tells me is better but you hear Teotihuacan anyway I think we're okay I think we're fine
yeah it's passable um so this is a city that in terms of its size scale magnificence it rivals Rome
very centralized very authoritarian then then something changes and you sort of imply it's
almost like a you know this is the Paris commune and the sort of western hemisphere but potentially
there's a big sort of political shift well the archaeologist who guy called René Milan who
produced this extraordinary map of Teotihuacan which we were very fortunate to get permission to
reproduce the map so you can see it in the dawn of everything and he directed one of the most
incredible ground surveys ever undertaken in the history of archaeology because we're talking about
absolutely vast settlement which at its height around 300 AD would have had a well conservative
estimate say 100,000 people I've seen estimates that go up to double that big place and Milan
himself and some later scholars argued that there was a turnaround like a complete reversal of
fortunes for that population where it begins on a very hierarchical path you know if you go there
today as a tourist or just google some pictures of the site you'll see the two great pyramids
pyramid of the sun pyramid of the moon this other great structure called the temple of the
feathered serpent these are all later names that the Aztec actually invented for Teotihuacan we
don't know what they were originally called so it begins in this very hierarchical way and again
you've even got evidence for ritual killing and human sacrifice they buried the bodies of captives
under the foundations of the pyramids it's quite disturbing their hands tied behind their backs
and they built these structures on top of them but then something changes around 300 AD 250 300 AD
there is no more monumental construction on that scale and all of the labor and resources that
presumably went into building great temples and pyramids go into something else and that's something
else is housing and they cover the entire settlement on a grid formation with beautiful housing
apartments these are apartments which are low-rise so we're going to talk about apartment compounds
we're not talking high-rise we're talking something more like a villa with a number of a small number
of nuclear families big central courtyard subfloor drainage gorgeous murals on the walls
actually when archaeologists first started investigating those housing complexes they
thought there were palaces then they realized that everybody in the city was living in a palace
now how we to conceptualize this we don't have any detailed written sources from the time
archaeologists have tried in various ingenious ways to sort of reconstruct what was going on
but what you can say is that people in that city from that point onwards had a really good
standard of living and that it was generalized to you know the whole urban population which is
pretty extraordinary and we know you know you talk about guns, germs and steel if we skip ahead
some centuries to the the beginning of the the Spanish conquest when we do have
eyewitness chronicles and accounts of the kind of cities that existed in that region
from say the 16th century onwards there are a whole different range of them you know we
tend to think about Tenochtitlan and Montezuma and sort of Aztec empire and that it's all very
hierarchical actually and we go into this in the book the city where Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors
make alliances that enable them to go and challenge the the might of the Aztec empire
is a city by the name of Tlaxcala which had a relationship to the Aztec capital that was a
bit like Athens and Sparta there's one's very hierarchical the other one's very democratic
Tlaxcala clearly was a republic of some sort with its own parliament and we even have records
in Spanish of the kind of debates that went on there and this just doesn't feature in our world
histories you know we're quite rightly taught that the fall of Tenochtitlan was in a sense you
know the beginning of western global domination what we're not taught is that one of the things
you know one of the steps on that pathway was this extraordinary encounter between
European conquerors and an indigenous urban democracy of sorts and I've got no hesitation
in calling it a democracy at a time when you know cities run on that kind of basis were
extremely unusual in Europe itself and you know none of this is terribly sort of secret you don't
have to delve very deep into the sources we've got the letters that Cortés himself wrote back
to the king of Spain saying I found this place it's it's weird you know there's no king it's
maybe a little bit like some of our Florentine or Venice you know it's run on some other principles
all this stuff is out there but it really isn't given the prominence that you know you think it
probably ought to have I mean that sounds what you're describing in and you know these are obviously
people who have no connection whatsoever to the Mediterranean you know ancient Greece road yeah
nothing to do with it there's an indigenous form of urban government what you're describing in
Teotihuacan sounds like a revolution potentially or a social revolution yeah there are yeah
absolutely and there are experts on that site who have suggested that that may have been the
kind of thing that took place there's no absolute consensus on it in the way that there's generally
very little consensus in archaeology but I think everyone would accept that there is a profound
transformation that takes place there and that's kind of fascinating because you know one of the
things that we're told in the traditional narrative of human history is that once you have very large
dense human populations and once hierarchy sets in in those kind of settings it is irreversible
whereas here we seem to have a situation where there is a reversal yeah like you say in western
political history people say though isn't a successful slave revolt until Haiti for instance
which is you know as far as we know is broadly correct but that may have not been the case in
America's you make this great sort of rhetorical question in the book which is what we talk about
the abolition of slavery and of course we talk about the story of Simonda Bolivar and Toussaint
Leverture and the abolitionists and whatnot but perhaps it was abolished numerous times
many times in history yeah I mean I think this is just sort of classic Eurocentrism you know the
idea that yeah maybe these things were happening elsewhere but they don't really happen until they
happen in a European context I mean it's just a kind of sorting and filtering mechanism which
allows you to say that Europe has some kind of monopoly on progressive politics which you know
even if taken to an extreme length can become a justification for colonialism genocide and all
the rest of it is say well at least we were bringing this kind of you know these sort of
progressive concepts of democracy which were completely lacking in all these other places
so you know despite the fact that we decimated them ruined their landscapes and killed most of
the people at least you know we sort of again you're back to stage theory at least we moved them on
at least we got them out of that that that kind of malaise that they were clearly stuck and will
know you know one of the things we show in the book is that far from it you know there's a huge array
of conscious political experimentation going on outside European contexts and we have evidence
for it. Your area of expertise is West Asia, Northeast Africa, although you're very lucid on
the Americas and elsewhere you had to research it for this ginormous 700 page book. What I want
to talk about is you've got sites like Gobekli Tepe in eastern Turkey, you've got these incredible
megalithic sites in in Malta, this might sound strange questions it's not in the book, is it
possible that if cities precede agriculture that you have homo sapiens living alongside
archaic humans potentially in urban environments because you know Neanderthals are around until
relatively recently in Europe. Is it plausible that there were I mean permanent settlements
that sort of see them featured together or is that just something we can never even speculate on?
I wouldn't personally refer to Gobekli Tepe which is much later I mean there's no Neanderthals around
at that point so we're going back about to about 9000 BC here in in the Middle East and I wouldn't
personally characterize Gobekli Tepe as a city. I think we're dealing with a site which is clearly
permanently settled but where you have periods when people are coming together and aggregating
and coordinating their activities in very large numbers. Okay so I'll rephrase it yeah
it's a built environment which is a permanent built environment. Is it plausible that you had
humans operating alongside archaic humans in those in those kinds of spaces? Well if we go back let's
say a bit further a lot further like 50 000 years ago we know at that point there are at least four
probably five different species of humans around the planet there's us there's the Neanderthals
there's the Denisovans there's Homo Floriansis in Indonesia which are the little people sometimes
playfully called hobbits and there's also some more recent discoveries from Luzon Island in the
Philippines so this is a situation with no modern parallel when you've actually got different varieties
of the human species interacting we know genetically that there was interaction of the
closest possible kind there was reproduction across those species some of them so yeah I mean
and actually when you go back even further to the origins of our species the picture now
looks rather like that so we're going back now to Africa to the African continent where you know
there used to be this idea of sort of mitochondrial eve and that there was one ancestral savannah
environment where suddenly we became humans actually the modern fossil evidence and genetic
evidence suggests that that's wrong and that actually we evolved on the African continent
but in multiple different environments between about five hundred thousand two hundred thousand
years ago coastal environments forest environments and savannah environments and there were periods
of isolation and periods of contact between ancestral human populations which could be very long
so you actually get a huge amount of physical variation you see it in the fossil evidence
and if you think about physical variation imagine what was going on with language
or child rearing habits or social customs so again you know it flies in the face of this
very entrenched philosophical habit of trying to reconstruct the original form of human society
there wasn't one and just the panoply of experimentation and social forms which is
kind of inconceivable to us but actually that's where we that's where we come from yeah we're
a product of this um this kind of composite uh composite of different subspecies and different
traditions and let's talk about pseudo archaeology if that's the right word there is such a word
pseudo archaeology pseudo archaeology um and i i feel like particularly with the rise of the
internet youtube it's probably increasingly something of an entry point for people who
eventually end up in sort more formal archaeology is not the right word archaeology proper i suppose
there might that might be the gateway that then sends them to somebody like yourself maybe yeah
it could well be why do you think pseudo archaeology is increasingly popular why isn't there
there's clearly a there's clearly a desire for it in the cultural zeitgeist well let's be clear
what we're talking about because i don't think it's immediately obvious to a lot of people
what the difference would be between what you're calling pseudo archaeology and what people like
me do and teach for a profession um pseudo archaeology i guess or at least my mental picture
of what you're talking about is probably largely written by people who've never actually taken
part in an archaeological field project or you know aren't actually engaged in producing any of
the evidence that you and i have been talking about today but who for other reasons choose to
present a reconstruction of the past which is often presented as rather mysterious or even
conspiratorial as the people like me you know the reason we devote our adult lives to learning
all these skills and teaching archaeology is because we want to cover up the truth okay
um and that the truth is actually available to people who don't do that right who may have had
entirely different career paths and you know i don't want to come off snobbish you know there's
nothing wrong with people speculating and reaching their own conclusions but actually
what is often presented as some great new revelation is actually just a very old rehashed
obsolete theory that comes out of what was probably mainstream archaeology you know
sometime in the early 19th century like you know lost city of atlantis and that kind of thing
there's nothing new about those ideas and you know as i hope comes across in our book and in our
conversation the real evidence is fascinating and it's puzzling and it's challenging on its own
terms you don't need to you know come up with confections and elaborations to make it interesting
just try and get to grips with it is already challenging stimulating enough without
you know it's trying to surround it with some fabricated area of mystery it's always the way
with conspiracy theories because you talk to somebody and they'll say oh this person is
controlling this and it's this secret cabal of these people and look that there's a great
deal of exploitation um in the world and yes the powerful regular system and in extraordinary
ways which actually we can discern and understand you don't need to you don't need to be talking
about the bilderberg group or i god knows what no but you know it's really important and i do get
a little bit irritated sometimes with colleagues of mine and the way that they respond to what
you've called pseudo archaeology um which is to say um you know we're the scientists we know best
and um if you believe any of that stuff you're just a lunatic well i think i think that's um
it's obviously true in a sense but you have to look also at the history of our own disciplines
which again as we've been talking about are very strange in the way that they will deny
humanity and consciousness to whole populations and whole groups of people you know when when
europeans first saw those monuments at places like kahokia they couldn't fathom you know the
idea that native people would have constructed these things they came up with all kinds of wacky
theories about lathe erics or you know vikings coming over or you know whatever it may be lost
tribes of the israelites and those sort of ideas were coming out of what was then mainstream
european scholarship you know in egypt where i've done a lot of work on the the origins of
ancient egyptian civilization the period before all of that you know the pyramids and
mummification all the famous stuff is what archaeologists call the pre-dynastic i mean
it's almost if you don't want people to be interested if you go to a conference on the
pre-dynastic they'll be talking about like you know we measure this kind of pottery and it's
slightly different from that kind of pottery and you know it's all a huge turnoff for anyone who's
trying to figure out what's actually going on um and if you go even deeper you know where i work at
ucl where you studied you have the petri petri museum if you ever stuck your head in there
wonderful place um which is now very openly engaged in looking at its own history and flinders
petri the archaeologist who it's named after was a eugenicist he believed that non-europeans
were intellectually inferior and he was very into this whole business of uh phrenology and
measuring people's skulls and that sort of thing and he actually had a theory in the late 19th century
that ancient egyptian civilization could not have been created by africans and that there had been
an an invasion of what he called the new race okay so we're talking about theories which are at
least as wacky as the kind of stuff that you'll see on netflix now but they're coming from within
our disciplines and it's easy frankly to you know empirically refute those kinds of theories about
some lost race of people from atlantis or whatever but i think that's only half the battle we also
have to introspect a bit and ask the more difficult questions about how did those spaces open up in the
first place in which that kind of theory is able to gain traction and i i do think a lot of that
does have to do basically with racism and the idea that people long ago on different continents
could possibly have been as intelligent and creative as us albeit in different ways you
know if you have a mental block with that i think you have to ask yourself but there are
more ambiguous examples of this aren't there so you know there's there's people out there who say
that the sphinx is significantly older than the pyramids it's still constructed by people in egypt
you know not by a sort of race of aliens and that actually we're really wrong and it's thousands of
years older than we presently think would you call that a conspiracy theory no it's a completely
legitimate line of questioning it just happens i think not to really lead anywhere terribly
interesting i mean there are ways of investigating that sort of thing and you would also have to
put it in the context of what we do know about what was going on before the pyramids and the
construction of the sphinx in the fourth dynasty which is fascinating in its own right you know
i mean i've been to a place called umel kab which is in the south of egypt which is where you have
the earliest royal cemetery what's sometimes called egypt's first dynasty and it is fascinating
and you've actually got a very disturbing phenomenon there that we talk about in the
dawn of everything which is the burials of the earliest egyptian kings and queens
there's these great sort of holes in the ground with all these elaborate
staircases and furnishings completely surrounded by smaller sort of cubicles where other people
were buried and i'm talking about hundreds maybe even thousands of other people who it is generally
thought by archaeologists were ritually killed in order to be buried around the tombs and it's
not just people actually one of the earliest egyptian kings goes by the name which we can
read in early hieroglyphs amusingly his name is aha aha and it's transcribed into english as aha
and aha's tomb actually has not only human beings in pits there's also like three lions
buried in it nothing to do with the england football team and you know that isn't that
fascinating enough you know let's try and get our heads around what's going on there
which we do in chapter 10 or something of the dawn of everything let's talk about that that's
kind of intriguing you know why does the beginning of what we call the ancient state involve this
extraordinary carefully orchestrated violence against people and you know the sphinx has no
place in that context let's but we can reconstruct something of what was going on and it's perfectly
interesting in its own right but i suppose a pseudo archaeologist respond to you they'd say well
this civilization is older than the first dynasty perhaps they could say that it's a
lost civilization well again we know actually quite a lot about what's going on it's actually one
of the things i wrote my phd about is it's the fourth millennium bc so that long period that's
referred to as pre-dynastic because if all they were trying to do was build dynasties
um we actually know quite a lot about what was going on in those periods and um you can go and
see it i mean go to a museum go to the the british museum go to the ashmolean museum in oxford
it's fascinating stuff you know they had these beautiful artistic styles there's one of the
things i wrote about in my phd actually you know we all get obsessed with the monuments the sphinx
the pyramids um what you see if you focus on ordinary people and particularly their burials
because we have a lot of evidence for how people were treated in funerary rituals egypt is incredible
in that sense that you can trace the evolution of a ritual it's a funerary ritual you can trace its
evolution over thousands of years we know how people were buried and what you see is kind of
fascinating in the build-up to the time of the the first dynasties and the first pharaohs and
pyramids people lose a lot of the capacity to conduct their own rituals so you start off with a
situation where almost anyone can be buried like a prince or a princess with sort of gorgeous
elaborate ornamentation and very individualized pottery and beautiful cosmetic articles and
with the rise of the kingship and the pharaonic state people seem to lose a lot of that kind of
aesthetic control over their own lives and no longer able to conduct their own rituals which
is kind of fascinating you see something similar with the rise of the inca empire where we do
again have you know spanish colonial accounts and descriptions of what's going on where in order to
perform an important ritual like a marriage or a funeral to honor your ancestors you need certain
resources you need bread and beer what's called chicha in order to just perform the ritual and do
the right thing but of course not everyone can get their hands on those resources in the same way
that in egyptian funerary rituals at a certain point you have to have bread and beer but to have
bread and beer you know you have to have access to estates where cereals are farmed and you have
plough agriculture so people who can't actually look after their families in a cultural sense
i'm not talking about biological survival but you know who can't actually complete their
their necessary social rituals begin falling into debt relations of debt or will go and will
have to go to extraordinary lengths and make sacrifices just to be able to do that and that
seems to be a big part of what creates hierarchies and systems of dependencies is people either
abdicating or somehow losing control over their own yeah their own sort of basic basic kind of
life rituals or life cycles what future projects do you have lined up i'm involved with various
sort of side projects at the moment i don't find the time right now to do much research in depth
i'm actually involved with projects which are not strictly writing projects but just trying to keep
myself you know moving on a bit so i'm involved with a new collaboration with a group that you
might have heard of called forensic architecture based at goldsmith's college that's an interesting
one because they do mostly human rights work and they use architectural theory and principles of
modeling to go to court over a whole range of different issues from a deforestation in the
amazon they did the mark dug in case and top them extrajudicial killings those archaeologists
architect architect sorry architecture forensic architect now i have that forensic architecture
al-vitesman his amazing team so he came to an event a big event in germany in berlin about the
dawn of everything which was called the civilization question this big three-day event and the curator
of that invited al who gave a presentation that just sort of blew me away and when we got back to
london he's based here you know we just sort of went out for coffee and we had the most incredible
conversation of you know his take on the book it's all very much through the lens of what they do
and at first i couldn't really see the connection because the scales are obviously radical different
but he read our book as a kind of extended case study in forensic architecture in the sense that
it's an anti-state narrative where as in some of the cases i've mentioned you know you can't always
prove definitively the other version of events like the non-police version or the non-official
version but you can just poke enough holes and cast enough doubts on the official narrative
so that it starts to wobble doesn't stand up in court in the court of judgment in our case
and in the process of making it wobble you open up other possibilities for speculation
and i thought well this is intriguing you know it's right i mean what it's describing is a very
similar kind of logic to our book so we decided to collaborate on something so we're trying an
experiment i can't say too much about it right now but i'll be able to say more about it early in
the new year and it's going to focus on these incredible archaeological sites in Ukraine
in Ukraine you have cities going back as early as the earliest ones that we know of in Mesopotamia
in what's now Iraq and parts of Syria so we're going back around 6000 years ago you have these huge
cities that present no evidence of centralization not in political or economic terms and there is
a big debate about whether they should or should not be referred to as cities or rather as something
else like overgrown villages or mega sites you know you get lots of sort of euphemistic terms
being used and essentially what it makes you do is reflect on what we mean by a city and what are
the assumptions that are baked into that so we're going to produce a kind of installation
which models these rival accounts and debates doesn't necessarily try to prove one version
but which visually kind of immerses you in the questions if that makes sense so that's one project
i'm doing i've also been talking i mean one of the things that's really just been kind of overwhelming
about the the response to the dawn of everything is the creative response and i'm not talking
particularly about people writing or you know academic writing or even essays but musicians
artists filmmakers i was just the other week with a fantastic singer and artist she's based
in Paris Yasmine Dubois her stage name is La Fonda and she wrote a song called the dawn of
everything and she came here to London and performed it you know a few weeks back at the
the festival hall they had the women life freedom event for human rights in Iran
and she performed it there and i was very upset actually i was just getting back from Chicago
and couldn't quite get through my jet lag to actually physically make it but we met up afterwards
and you know that kind of thing is
it's incredible you know to me and i think it's a huge tribute to David you know to my late co-author
i think he had that incredible capacity to take some of these rather obscure topics and concepts
and write about them in a way that touched people and made it personal and made them want to engage
and and create and in a way i see it all as a kind of extended tribute to him
which i've just been a lucky sort of passenger final question just on David if that's possible
David Graber was your co-author on this book he tweeted in 2020 i believe how he'd finished the
manuscript that's right yeah he put out a sort of faux jim marson quote yeah my brain is bruised
with numb surprise we finished or something like that yeah and then he passed away a month later
yeah about three weeks three weeks after we finished the manuscript so what's it been like to
publish a globally best-selling book i mean it's been it's been translated into multiple languages
you've worked on it for a decade alongside somebody yeah and then they're not there to
share in the success yeah um well you know you have to kind of i have to sort of pinch myself in
two senses there's there's the kind of good pinching yourself that the reception is so
extraordinary and you know suggested to me recently by someone who's apparently got some
figures that we you know getting up to a million copies worldwide which is just can't really get
your head around it but then there's also the other kind of pinching yourself which is very
painful which is you know just constantly having to accept that david's not around to witness any of
it and he was really looking forward to it i mean this book he couldn't wait to get out there and
have these kinds of conversations should have been the two of us really sitting here having fun with
with you shooting the breeze above all this stuff so it's very painful and very paradoxical
and the only thing that i can really hold on to in the middle of it all is that he would
definitely want me to be out there working hard talking about the book telling people about the
book and just trying to get the work across as well as i'm capable of so you're doing it partly
for him as well when you go that extra mile yeah yeah 100 yeah david wengrow thanks for joining us
my pleasure thank you
