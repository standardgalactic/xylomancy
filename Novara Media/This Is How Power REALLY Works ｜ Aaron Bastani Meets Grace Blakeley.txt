The conservative view is just that like the winners are the winners and the losers are the losers.
And that's fair because that's based on competition and competition is its own
process of fairness. For those on the left, it's like, well, we should make sure that if people
do lose, they're protected in some way and that actually they have more opportunities to become
winners and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that society works a little bit
better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be there shouldn't be winners and losers
and people that make the rules. It should be we all make the rules together. It's a completely
different way of organising society. The game is rigged. That's something that people on the
left have been saying for a decade, obviously a lot longer, but that particular phrase really goes
back to the mid 2010s. And for a long time it felt like if you said it you were shouting into a void,
nobody was listening. Fast forward to 2023 and virtually everyone in politics on the left or
the right accepts that the game is rigged, that a tiny elite benefits while the rest of us lose
from the status quo. The establishment does so well at the cost of everyone else, if you will.
But even though there's agreement about the game being rigged, that doesn't mean there's
agreement on what to do next. Clearly people on the left and on the right have very different
proposals going forward. And I think the reason why there is a gap between those two sides
is basically because there's a different reading on what power is, who has it and how things change.
Now for people on the left, financial and economic power is directly translated into
political, social and cultural power. It might be comforting to think we live in a meritocracy or
that political representatives are there on merit and they represent the will of the people,
but fundamentally they're there to reflect vested, powerful economic interests. And that is exactly
why we've got Grace Blakely on for today's show. Grace is an economist, she's a writer,
she also does loads of media stuff from talk TV to the BBC and Jeremy Vine. She's a fantastic
young economist and her interests have always focused on finance and the kinds of power which
emerges from it. Grace, welcome to Downstream. Thank you so much for having me. I have been
waiting for this conversation for so long. I have missed you very, very much too. It's been a while.
It's been a really long time. It's been a really long time. I feel like I haven't really seen
that much since COVID. Yeah, well, I mean, I went away. You went away? You've been writing a book?
Yeah, I wrote a book. I went away to write a book partly, although I didn't spend that much time
writing my book. I spent a lot of time just wandering around Central America, surfing,
making trouble. And yeah, I got back like two months ago and now here I am, back in the Malay.
And you were obviously my first priority. Yeah. Number one call. Of course.
Navarro Media first. Exactly. The Today program. Second. You're obviously very left-wing.
Obviously. So I've been told. Yeah, you're obviously very left-wing. In terms of your economic
commitments, but you're a well-spoken Oxford graduate from Basingstoke, from home counties.
What happened between you being a fresh-faced Oxford graduate who went on to work at KPMG
and then having the kinds of political economic commitments you have now? Was it something you
had as a young person? Yeah. Did then tensify when you entered the labour market? Was there a moment
of intellectual revelation? How does this trajectory look? I think it's a combination of a lot of
different things. So it does kind of go back to when, it definitely goes back to when I was growing
up, because I'm obviously from like a posh, well-off background. But my mum was, you know,
grew up on the council estate in Basingstoke and her dad was a hardcore communist trade union
organiser for the TGW. He was like, you know, going over to Russia. We had little busts of
Lenin in the house. My uncles are called Karl and Keir, both with a K, like, you know, properly into
the whole, you know, interleftism from a very young age. And my mum kind of took those values
definitely along with her. She had also like, she was the first in her family to go to university,
went to Cambridge, had a terrible experience of Cambridge because everyone was like, you know,
treated her terribly because they were all, she was like, I arrived and everyone was like, oh,
what school did you go to? And she was like, I went to a comprehensive in Winklebury. And they
were like, what? So kind of that, I think, consolidated her left wing values. And my dad
ended up just kind of falling into that sort of, sort of field as well. They ended up doing things
like, you know, they traveled around the world and the Nicaragua Solidarity campaign and eventually
ended up doing very boring kind of professional things, no offence mum and dad, I love you,
doing kind of boring professional executive coaching and that sort of stuff, but retained
those like left wing values and always raised me along those lines. I mean, if they hadn't,
my granddad was still there all the time and he would have been like, what are you doing? Like,
what are you talking about? So I was always like really into politics. We had a very
political household. I did things like, you know, I wrote for the new statesman, right?
That was something that I did like three or four years ago, maybe a bit more than that five years
ago. And when I was like 14, I had a letter published in the new statesman talking about like,
I can't remember something to do with, you know, the transition from brown to Blair and like what
needed to be done. And that was like, my granddad had that framed and put on the wall. So there
are all these like political values that there were in our household. But I think the second thing
was that I was always in trouble. So like, I was like, you know, I went to all these fancy schools,
but I was expelled from two of them, suspended like constantly, just was constantly in trouble,
like with everyone. And I mean, it was relatively easy to get into trouble if you go to private
school. I'm not saying that I was like, you know, there's tear away, but like, I did some pretty
crazy stuff. And like, I never really, never really kind of understood the boundaries of what I
shouldn't shouldn't do always kind of felt like, you know, rules are stupid. And that gave me that
kind of rebellious spirit, I think that went with like the left wing values. But I was never like,
I was always like, Oh, I'm gonna, I don't know, go and like work for the UN or like, I don't know,
maybe like be a politician or something that was barely like middle of the road.
It was only after I think, you know, I so I did this PPE degree at Oxford, and it was very like,
you know, I think I learned more in my African studies masters about like the way the world
actually works. And I did my PPE degrees, the PPE degree was very liberal, very down the line.
Just for people watching, PP is the is the degree that all the sort of opinion makers and politicians
in the UK do from David Cameron to pretty much every major broadcast journalist, Nick Robinson
and whatnot. Politics, philosophy and economics, it was created to educate the kind of the people
who would be going on to govern the British Empire, basically, it's supposed to have
everything that you need to be inculcated into the values of like the elite, basically, and all of
the kind of reference points that you would need to be able to kind of converse with with those
people. So it's, you know, not particularly, it's obviously not radical at all. It's like
very mainstream middle of the road education. And as I said, I wanted to kind of go work for the
UN or doing something in the kind of international sphere, liberal do goodery stuff. So I went to
do an African studies degree. So you were a lip? Yeah, basically. Yeah, I would have said I was
like a left lip. I was like, you know, like I want to like do things to change the system and make
things work slightly better for, you know, those who don't come out. Did you have like a make poverty
history? Oh, 100%. I was totally into all that sort of stuff. Yeah, that was like totally my
identity. Yeah, did my African studies masters realized how utterly screwed up that entire world
is. So like I did a bunch of research and like, you know, traveled quite a lot and met lots of
people in the UN and in NGOs and whatever and realized how dark things really are there and
quite how, you know, how when you are in a job that is working to kind of pick up the pieces
from a system that is fundamentally messed up at like the very highest levels,
it can only create kind of disillusionment. So then I was like, right, okay, well,
we need to change the system. I started thinking about politics. I initially was like, I'm going to
go organize for the greens. And I did a little bit of that when I was in my masters, then the
2015 election came around. And I think that was when a lot of stuff started changing for me. I
remember like sitting in an Oxford college, when Ed Miliband lost, I hadn't even voted for Ed
Miliband, I voted green. And just being like, what is going on? Like, how can we be, how can
this happen? Like, how can we be going down this road of just like more and more austerity when it's
just so obviously wrong? And, you know, the whole ideology that it's built on is so obviously kind
of corrupt. And then Corbinism happened. It was actually my boyfriend at the time who was like,
Oh, have you heard about this Corbin guy? He'd be he seems quite cool. Wow. So this guy is actually
a pivotal figure in your career, personal, political trajectory. Amazing.
Who knows? Maybe it would have happened anyway, but he was like, you should look into this. I
looked into it and then was like, this is amazing. Started going on to all the events
and like getting much more involved in the Labour Party. And then that was kind of when I was like,
right, okay, this is what I want to do. Like, I want to get involved in this world, see,
you know, how I can be useful. And that started by doing policy. So after I left university,
I had this stint at KPMG. And yeah, that was working in their like management consulting
arm doing kind of public sector work. And what was that? What was that like?
It was interesting, right? Because like the projects I was working on at the time,
it was in Greater Manchester. And they were kind of doing like loss leading work. So the idea was
that you would, you know, not make huge amount of profit, you would work with these new
combined authorities and try and like develop to product, develop product that you would sell
elsewhere. So at the time, it felt quite interesting. I was like learning a lot about it was all to do
with service delivery. So it was, you know, like everything, you know, there was a lot of work
on like people with complex needs and combined dependency and how people who interact with
lots of different services, like, you know, children's services, social care, the criminal
justice system, all these different sorts of things, like how you needed early intervention to
kind of deal with those, those sorts of issues. And obviously, it was all couched in the language
of like how you could save money. But me coming into this is like completely green. I was like,
wow, this is fascinating. Like this is how things actually work. Eventually, I kind of realized,
oh no, we are literally developing a product that we are going to be selling to, to other
combined authorities as a way of making money. And it just kind of started feeling more and more
alienating. Also, I wasn't very good at it. I was good at the research, like all the kind of
looking into like what works and how we should be designing these things. But I wasn't very good at
selling. And I wasn't very good at client interactions, or any of that sort of stuff.
I don't really know why, probably for the same reasons I kept getting expelled. But anyway,
I then left, decided I wanted to go, do you think tanky work? So I could go into policy,
maybe from their politics. Started, I had a great time. That was when, you know, I met you guys
and started, yeah, like doing more media, doing more writing, like getting much more involved in
actual organizing. And it was just kind of like, you know, all uphill with a lot of downs as well,
from there. Did you ever subscribe to Tatler? I never subscribed to Tatler, no.
Never? Have you ever read an issue of Tatler? I don't think so. I'm not saying that I've never
read like a fancy magazine. I'm pretty sure I've read like Vogue or whatever, but I was never really
that into it. Cosmo. Horse and hound? No. I'm not that posh. I'm like middle class.
Are there any people in your sort of, you know, your ambit, like your parents' friends?
Oh, I mean, at Oxford, yeah. I met some of the like poshest people that you could imagine at Oxford,
like just unimaginable amounts of not just like wealth, but also privilege. And, you know,
when I went to Oxford, I was like, because, you know, I went to these private schools,
but ended up going to city form college, like, you know, obviously had friends who
went to state school, that sort of stuff. I was like, oh, yeah, I'm really posh.
And then I went to Oxford and I was like, oh my God, I am like a commoner to these people.
They're all being like, where did you, like, where did you go to school?
Eaton, Cheltenham ladies, Dullich, like all, they all knew each other. There was like this
massive group of people that all knew each other. Even some of the people that go to those schools
have used common because they didn't know. Family was the first in their family or whatever.
It is amazing.
It's crazy. I remember once I was reading something in the FT, this was,
it was just, no, it was the Telegraph, in fact. And it was like a, it was like an etiquette guide
for Christmas. And you shouldn't cheers and tap glasses. And the author of the article said that
was LBC, little bit common. So you shouldn't like, especially with champagne glass, you
shouldn't tap, right? What you should do is when you say cheers, you just lift the glass and say
cheers. And then the idea of like touching is just like very vulgar.
That's hilarious.
And I'm like, these people live in a different world.
So true. I once heard someone say at Oxford, I think they were discussing like,
someone got a new boyfriend and they were asking lots of questions.
And one of the responses was, oh, don't worry, darling, he's PLU, which was people like us.
Very, very concerning. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's weird. Like, it was funny because I spoke to
my mom about this, about the same experience that she'd had. She actually came overtly from
like a really working class background going to Cambridge and just found the whole experience
so utterly alienating that it was like outside of her comprehension. Whereas for me, I was kind
of like, oh no, I see where I fit in, in this hierarchy. And I'm like here. And then there's
all these people who know each other who are like here. And there's this like, I mean,
I remember at the time reading all of these like novels, like, you know, like Fitzgerald
and Evelyn Moore and stuff about like class systems in the US and the UK. And being like,
oh my God, I suddenly understand this, this like from the outside looking in at this world of like
glitz and glamour and everyone seems so like put together and very aware about how to pay with power,
like in friendship groups and like, you know, in the world more generally. And it's really like,
it really hooks you. It's really interesting to notice that happen. So yeah, I definitely kind of,
you know, experienced that when I was Oxford, but never kind of never really fully inside,
never really fully outside, I guess. Do you think the left struggles to explain that?
Like, I feel for much of the public, you know, I say I'm middle class because I like John Lewis
and drink M&S gold brand tea. And I think most of the public was, you know, I joke with my wife
and I say, you know, if the waitrose near us closes, we're moving. Right. And I say it mockingly.
And I, but I view those as like benchmarks of middle class, like the nice things. But I think
for most of the public, that's the case. They, they, they, they can't comprehend there is this
quite big layer of people who culturally, economically, socially, just in every single
aspect of their lives, they inhabit a different thought world. Do you think the leftist fails
communicate that a bit? I, the way I think about this, and this is actually potentially going to
be something I'm going to be writing about in the future, is that, you know, we, we think of ourselves
as living in this society, right, that is characterized by, you know, winners and losers.
And we debate the boundaries of that game and how, you know, the winners should be taxed and how
the losers should be supported. And everyone has a sense of where they sit in that game, you know,
whether or not they're like doing well, whether or not successful, attractive, whatever. And we're
all kind of competing on with one another to, to succeed. And we have a view as to who's above
us and who's below us. But there's actually a set of people who are outside of the game all
together because they're basically the ones that make the rules. And they are neither winners nor
losers. They are in a very real sense, kind of much more in control of actually the game itself
and how it works. And a lot of our educational and cultural systems, a lot of the educational
and cultural systems that these people come through are designed to make them comfortable
with the idea that they are the ones that are in control and that set the rules. So you'll often
hear, and I have heard this from, from these people, this idea that they are the kind of,
you know, by default, the benevolent rulers of society, whether that is just because they are
genetically better, or it's just because they happen to have been, you know, inculturated into
this, this particular way of being that allows them to be the kind of guardians of society.
They do see society as divided into between people who kind of make the rules and those who just
play the game. And I think that's probably something that maybe most people have an,
like some sort of intuitive sense of, you know, the idea that we can, you know, vote different
people into power, but nothing's ever going to change. But I don't really think it's something
that we talk about overtly. And I don't want it to sound kind of conspiratorial, because I'm not
saying that, like, you know, we live in a world that's kind of governed by a few people sitting in
a room deciding who gets what. But obviously, the institutions in which we, that kind of govern
most of the interactions that structure our lives, whether that's kind of corporations or
political institutions, public services, educational institutions, there are people in
positions of power and authority. And as our society has become more concentrated, as larger
institutions have come to govern much greater areas of social life, the people in positions
of authority within those powerful institutions have gained more control over what happens for
everyone else. So it's all about power. Let's get into the nuts and bolts. Sure. And this is a
talking point which the left hasn't really focused on. I feel like we've left a lot of it to the
right. And often, you know, there's this thing which is, or if something's right coded, then the
left has to think and say and do the opposite. I love that because it's always really fun,
like going on TV and people will be like, right, we've brought you on to have this perspective
on this subject. And you come in and you're like, well, actually, the entire way that you've
structured this dichotomy is completely wrong. They're short circuit, don't they? Yeah. So
I want to talk about ESG. ESG, for those who don't know, stands for environmental, social,
and governance. It's meant to represent the standard for investors to monitor how socially
conscious a business is. For some that has made it a kind of awoken of scorecard for investors.
You know, ESG is like woke top Trumps for various companies. What's your read on ESG?
Maybe we should actually, maybe it'd be helpful to kind of go back to that kind of trichotomy
I set up a second ago, which was like winners and losers and people who make the rules. I think
left and right often divide themselves based on different ideas about how we should treat
winners and losers, right? So, you know, the right wing view would be like, we live in a free market
society and the only thing that should matter is which company makes the most profits. So we
shouldn't be forcing them to consider things like environmental, social, governance, objectives,
whatever the market decides who wins. Whereas on the left would say, well, that's fine. But
actually the market kind of doesn't account for all the different factors that we do want to
account for. We need to change the rules a bit to make sure that, you know, if you win, you don't
do it at the expense of other people, or if you lose, then you're not kind of just left to starve
or die or whatever. And so we need to make the game, you know, played a slightly different way.
And, you know, that's basically the difference, I suppose, between kind of neoliberalism
and more progressive liberalism. The thing I think that socialists should come in and say,
or maybe we don't often, we always do this, is actually to point out that the entire game
is being played based on rules that have been, you know, developed by someone else and in which,
you know, working people are always going to be designed to lose. So ESG, the right will say,
no, you want competitive markets, this makes markets as competitive. The left would say,
it helps us to deal with, you know, negative externalities that actually make society more
progressive. And Marxists would come in and look at this and say, well, this is a way of shoring
up the legitimacy of a capitalist system that is fundamentally not based on free markets,
is actually based on the governance of society and control over society by huge corporations
that are able to exploit their workers and wreck the planet without any, really, any kind of push
back from the state whatsoever, because the state itself is also largely influenced by those
corporate interests. So ESG comes in as this kind of auto critique by the people who govern
the system as a way of saying, look, we know what we're doing, and we're responsible, and you can
trust us to be able to look after this system in your interests. But there is absolutely no way
that we will cede any of that control to you. We will look after the system maybe in a more
enlightened way. We will consider some of the things you're talking about, but you're not ever
going to be able to actually be in the rooms where we make the rules. And I think that's,
what should differentiate a Marxist and a socialist from a progressive liberal or whatever,
is actually saying, we don't just want to make the system a bit fairer, we want to give people power.
Just on ESG as well, it's a huge money making opportunity. So BlackRock's ESG Aware Fund charges
fees five times higher than its core S&P 500 fund. And ESG Investment Funds have 43% higher fees
than conventional investment funds. So they make more money, we'll talk about the kinds of
companies involved in this. They make more money around these products. And like you say, it also
fulfills a really important political role. But it also means there's tremendous power that's now
being concentrated amongst the financial elite. And like you say, before that was a concentration
of economic and political power based upon the idea that greed is good. Gordon Gekko is the kind
of main character archetype of the 1980s. That was what our society was. It does feel like in
the last, well, to listen to the global financial crisis, as Anglophone elites are trying to resurrect
political legitimacy, consent, they're having to change that archetype a bit more to caring,
enlightened characters. Now, do you think they've been compelled to do that? Is it just them trying
to exploit an opportunity from, you know, do good in liberals who would like them to be like that?
Where's it coming from? Because it does get that criticism from the right as well. And they would
say, I don't agree with it. I don't agree with the point behind it, but it's coherent, which is, well,
look, private enterprise is designed to first look after customers, secondly, look after shareholders,
thirdly, look after workers, forget the rest of this crap. So where has it come from? And why
has it become so prominent in the last, say, 10 years? So to understand where it comes from,
you know, I think we need to look, we've been talking kind of, or I've been talking kind of
quite abstractly in terms of structures and like, you know, and classes and that sort of thing.
We need to think about how the people in positions of power, you know, who have the capacity to kind
of make decisions that will affect everyone else, what they're thinking about when, you know,
developing and implementing things like ESG. Now, it is obviously very clear to anyone with
eyes that capitalism has at least since the global financial crisis, if not really since 1980s,
been suffering from both a crisis of kind of legitimacy and really kind of a crisis which
is pitting capitalism against democracy on the one hand, and also a crisis of kind of
reproduction of accumulation, basically, in which it is becoming harder and harder to produce the
stuff that we rely on to survive and that, you know, capitalism relies on for constant growth,
either because of, you know, climate imperatives or because of collapse in productivity or because of,
you know, escalating inequality, all these sorts of reasons that play into the kind of long term
productivity crisis that we've had and the associated financial breakdowns that have come
alongside that. So there's this kind of legitimacy crisis and a kind of, you know, a crisis of the
reproduction of capitalist, productive relations and social relations. And if you are a member of,
you know, the ruling class, let's say you are, I don't know, Larry Fink and you're the head of
BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset managers. And you, as, you know, the head of one of the
world's largest asset managers have a portfolio, well, you don't have a portfolio, you will have
a portfolio yourself, but you govern a company that has lots of portfolios that invests in asset
classes across the whole economy that has a stake in pretty much every, you know, large firm in,
say, the S&P 500, just by virtue of the fact that you're so big, you have to be that diversified.
And it is almost all of them, right? Yeah, yeah, totally, yeah. You're thinking, right, well,
if my business is going to continue to grow, I need not just, not the kind of, you know, the
dynamics that you might want if you're a hedge fund, which is lots of, you know, massive up and down,
ups and downs, lots of crises that can be exploited to, you know, make use of arbitrage
strategies and make clever quick trades that are going to make you money in the short term.
You want really kind of long-term stable growth, you want corporations to grow, you want corporate
profits to grow, and you want people to be able to accumulate savings that they can invest in your,
your assets. And more generally speaking, you know, you want a society that is characterized by
relative stability. And that is true across a whole range of industries. It's true across,
you know, the political class in general, who, if you were to look at it from a kind of Marxist
perspective, would see their role as not just like maintaining individual capitalist enterprises,
but actually maintaining the broad conditions that allow capitalist social relations, capitalist
reproductive relations to reproduce themselves. Then, yeah, you know, you are going to be worried
about things like climate breakdown, because that threatens, you know, on all of those levels,
it threatens the legitimacy of the system, because people are going to get scared,
people are going to die. It threatens the relations of production, it threatens, you know,
the relationships between different social classes. I mean, if you look at the global economy and the
way in which climate breakdown is like to affect different parts of it, we're going to see breakdowns
in global supply chains of the kind that we saw during the pandemic much more frequently.
And it threatens the kind of very foundations of accumulation, just because like it's going
to be harder to get things out of the ground and like create the crops that people need to
survive and all those different sorts of things. So that's one argument, which is that ESG is about
like a long-term rational self-interest on the behalf of the capitalist class, but the companies
with the best ESG scores in America, and I find this fascinating, and it's right now,
it's a right-wing talking point, but on this, they're correct. The companies with the best
ESG scores in America are Google, Microsoft and the Bank of America. Meanwhile, Tesla,
which produces literally, you know, electric vehicles, and you might agree, I disagree
obviously with their labor standards, and we need to have a conversation about using recycled
lithium for EVs, but whatever, EVs are clearly better. We want more public transport. EVs are
clearly better than the cars that people were producing, you know, 20 years ago and for the
century preceding that. And the idea that the Bank of America has a much better ESG score than
Tesla, and that's a right-wing talking point, and I'm just like, yeah, but they're kind of right.
Even if you don't like Tesla, Tesla has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles
by 10, 15, maybe 20 years, and it's really, it's really accelerated the process for
for Detroit, car manufacturers all around the world, China. So like the idea that that somehow
gets like middling ESG scores, I think it's quite fair to say something's not quite right here.
It's not just about the rational self-interest thing, you know?
Well, I think there's two things again going on, which is the rationale behind it, and the
rationale behind any climate policy that a government will implement will come from this,
we need to protect capitalism. Basically, you know, it's kind of the Keynesian idea.
Jeff Mann wrote that book that was like, you know, the Keynesian philosophy is basically like
protecting capitalism means protecting civilization. And there is an argument, you know,
that these people will view themselves as these enlightened, you know, platonic rulers whose
job it is to basically make sure that they have this view over society as a whole and can put in
place the conditions that give rise to the continuation of capitalism itself. But, and this
is the interesting thing, this is where things actually get interesting. If you're looking at,
say, the state as a set of institutions or, you know, a mechanism of organizing power,
it is not staffed by enlightened technocrats or platonic rulers who can just make policy
based on what they consider to be the interests of society as a whole. They say it is,
you know, you ask a politician why they're doing what they're doing, they say they govern in the
general interest. This was Ralph Miliband's famous critique of the capitalist state and the way that
the Labour Party got sucked into it, it was because there's this idea of state elites as
governing the general interest, which is very hypnotic. It's like, yes, of course, we'll give
these people power because they're doing what's good for the rest of us. But actually, the state
isn't that. It's, you know, broadly speaking, as we think of capital as a social relation,
in the sense that what goes on within the state and the way that state power is exercised
reflects social struggles that take place within society as a whole. That's kind of abstract, but,
you know, you can broadly think of it as like battles that are taking place within state
institutions, whether that's within, you know, the Treasury or any government department.
The players in that battle will be linked to wider groups that will have support from
different, you know, corporate institutions, historically unions, think tanks, basically
different groups that make up constellations of class interests that structure all capitalist
societies. And they will influence state policy, not just in a way that is meant to kind of
protect the interests of their class as a whole, but in a way that is meant to protect and promote
specific interests. So like look at like Biden's climate policies, for example, he comes in and
says, we need to save the planet for all these very good reasons. He's backed by capitalists
like Larry Fink who say, yes, actually, we do need to save the planet for the sake of capital.
And yet, because of the power of these different groups, these different specific interests,
as opposed to the general interests of capital as a whole, you end up getting this hodgepodge of
climate policies, which actively undermine each other in some senses, even though the narrative
is we're doing something about climate change, everyone can see that ExxonMobil still has a
huge amount of power, can still see that all these banks that are funding climate change
still have a huge amount of power. And so you have this weird, not only the weird fact of policies
that go against each other, but the weird show of politicians saying, we're doing something in
your interest when it's very clear that they're actually acting on behalf of a very specific
interest. And it leads to really messy policy, which neither the left nor the right can really
understand. So a really good recent example is this recent House Building announcement by Michael
Gove. What does it look like? Well, they're saying that legislative changes, which result
really from an EU dictate, of course, in 2017 have led to fewer housing starts and completions.
First of all, that's not true. We completed more houses in 2018 and 2016, but park that for a moment.
The solution, therefore, is to basically allow people building homes to have those homes put
more crap into local waterways. That's fine. It's called sediment, but they basically mean effluent
and garbage and rubbish that we flushed down our toilets. Now, okay, you would think that's bad if
you care about clean waterways. You might think it's good if you think we're actually, you know,
building houses are more important. But here's where it gets really interesting, because it isn't
just a regulatory change. They like to say, we're not going to step back and we're cutting right
tape. No, 700 million pounds of taxpayer money is being spent. How hundreds of millions of pounds
are being given to house builders by the taxpayer, by the state, hundreds of millions of pounds are
being given to private water companies. Apparently they're private. They pay dividends to their shareholders,
and yet the taxpayers having to pay for stuff here. So what we're doing is we're paying 700 million
pounds to allow some people to stop polluting, some people to start polluting, and apparently it's
so we can build more homes. And you think, hold on, couldn't we just use the 700 million pounds
to build the homes? Do you know what I mean? But it's just like, and it's really messy, chaotic,
and like screwed up. And I think that's a big part of the political debate right now. It's
why the left and the right struggle to get a handle on anything. And it's why everybody says,
look, nobody could minister anything. And I think like you say, it's because you have these competing
interests and also competing ideas, which because they're not governed in a coherent, structured
way, which they were, let's say until 2008, or if you're being really, you know, skeptical, you
know, maybe the 1990s, it's just a mess. Well, I mean, I think this is the point, right? Because
we've been stuck in politics for such a long time in this sterile debate between left progressives
or liberal progressives and neoliberals or right wingers. And the debate is basically like, the
state needs to do stuff on the left, you know, state needs to do stuff, we need to protect people
from the market. The free market is fine, but it needs to have some regulation over it. And the
right saying the free market is good, state intervention leads to corruption. You know,
we need to get rid of like, you know, nanny state and bureaucrats and all these different
sorts of things. And we have the same debate we've been having for 100 years. And no one's any
the wiser. And of course, that's because we've lost what should be the socialist or Marxist critique
of all this, which is that we don't live in free markets. Not only are the markets that, you know,
do exist under capitalism, not free, but most of our lives are structured by decisions that are
made by big corporations, financial institutions, states, politicians who are insulated from democratic
accountability precisely because they're in the pockets of big businesses. And what is really
missing there is just an understanding of the way that power actually works. We have these big
ideological debates and the people who do PP like to have about freedom versus competition versus,
you know, protection. And actually, none of that matters when it's just the brute fact of power
that is being exercised by people who are in positions of authority over everyone else who
basically like live in a game that has been designed so that they lose. No wonder you get people,
you know, going for these kinds of conspiracy theories, which are like, you know, the world
is being run in this one room by like the World Economic Forum. It's like, that isn't true. You
can understand why they think that because there is this like fairly coherent network of institutions
and actors that govern those institutions that whenever a crisis happens, do seem to get together
in a room and say, right, this bank gets bailed out, that one gets to collapse. In the pandemic,
this company gets a bailout, that one gets to gets to collapse. And at the same time,
you're being told, oh, we live in a free market. And if you go out and work really hard and compete
in that market and do really well, then you'll come out on top. But also if the company that has
been exploiting you for 10 years gets, you know, extremely over indebted and needs a bailout,
we'll give them one. But if you get extremely over indebted and need a bailout, then you're out on
the street. Like, of course, it sounds like the system is rigged. You're told you live in a free
market system. And actually, you live in this, you know, it's like the iron fist of the powerful
versus like the invisible hand of Adam Smith. Yeah, this was really brought home to me the other day.
I was watching GB News with Darren Grimes, my regular Saturday viewing. And I was watching
because I was about to go on, actually. And I was preceded by a guy called John Rental,
who's this sort of new labor, you know, the Russian Soviets had a great word for this,
ideologist. Yeah, not an ideologue, an ideologist. And PPE, PPE, the job of PPE, by the way,
is to train ideologists of market capital. And he was on there. And Darren Grimes,
and this is what worries me, because Darren Grimes is talking more sense than John Rental.
Darren Grimes says, well, there's this massive difference right now between savings rates and
things like mortgage rates or credit card debt. So the base rate of interest 5.25% of the moment,
we all know it's been going up for 18 months. What's the base rate of interest? It's
the rate of interest at which the bank of in and gives money to private banks.
Obviously, they have to make profits because they're private enterprises. So they have
rates slightly higher. Right now, their savings rates, I think the average is about 2.62.7%.
The average mortgage is almost 6%, 5.75.8%. So there's this huge difference, right? So they're
basically skimming profits. They're charging far more than they should be with regards to, you know,
if you want to take out debt from them, but if you're depositing savings, they're not really
giving you enough. So it's clearly unfair. Darren Grimes said that in his own way and John Rental
goes, no, no. And he said, should politicians be doing anything about this? And by the way,
Jeremy Hunt called this a problem. Jeremy Hunt and John Rental, this Blair ideologist says,
oh, there's no problem with this. It's the free market. We shouldn't be getting involved.
Oh, bless him. It is the free market. That's so stupid. It's so stupid. Like the UK financial
system is so far from a free market. It's been like accused of oligopolistic behavior in like
loads of reports going back like years. It's the free market. So first of all,
first of all, we're talking about monetary policy. Is that set by the Bank of England?
Is it set by like a bunch of people in a room? There's no invisible hand. They arbitrarily
determine what it is. They would say, this is the interesting, because historically,
they would say, oh, they are just setting the current interest rate to align with the long-term
natural rate of interest, which is set by the market. And actually QE and the policies surrounding
that have kind of done away even with that idea. So it's now become obvious that actually central
banks just set interest rates. There's no natural long-term rate of interest.
But then Darren Graham says something really interesting. He says, but hold on. You're saying
it's the free market. We bailed out the banks in 2009. That wasn't the free market. And I'm
thinking, oh, God, he's got it. And John Rensen goes, no, no, no, no. We made money from that.
It wasn't a bailout. Of course it was a bailout. It wouldn't fucking exist anymore if we hadn't
used taxpayer money to guarantee their liabilities. They were insolvent. And that's where I get,
and we're talking, and it's really important to disaggregate. Let's say progressive liberalism
from the left. What John Rensen was presenting there is progressive liberalism. And it makes no
fucking sense. And the right take from Darren Graham makes him measureably more sense. And
that's where, as you say, people like yourself come in with something a little bit different.
Well, I mean, this is the point, right? Because there's two ways of responding to that. Once you
peek past the veil of capitalist ideology, once you take, what is it, the red pill or the blue
pill? Are you supposed to take? I can't remember. What is it they say they've been red pill?
I just know black pill is the really bad one. Okay, whatever. Once you take the pill that
lets you see how everything works, there's two ways of dealing with that, right? The way that I
think most people learn to deal with that is by just being forced to deal with this deep sense
of powerlessness, right? You peek past the curtain, you see that there are basically structures in
place that mean that even though you're told from when you are very, very young, if you just work
hard and do well, your life will be good. Actually, you are playing in a game that has been designed
so that you lose. And you come back, come out of that with, with disillusionment, with anger,
with a sense of, you know, righteous indignation, basically, which lends itself to the right and
it lends itself to that kind of fascist ideology, that kind of, you know, this is a bit nerdy,
but like the Nietzschean raison-tement that feeds fascist movement. Google that.
Yeah, pause, Google that. Which basically says like, okay, well, I'm in this system,
the powerful control it, I can't touch the powerful, I'm just an individual. So all I can do is elbow
all these people around me out the way with this knowledge that I have about how the system works
in order to get myself on top. And a step further than that, actually, which you're seeing in some
really right-wing movements in Europe, particularly, is just burn the whole thing down.
It's like climate change is coming, immigrants are coming, the end of the world is coming,
basically, like, let the whole thing burn, let the elites burn, let the system come crashing down,
and let's just build this little island for the worthy for, you know, the way we consider our group
to be able to stay alive on. And that is where we're going, because that's the way that individualism
responds to that realization of powerlessness, basically. The other way is the way that we
would have historically is that you would organize as part of a movement of other people who share
your interests to change the system, and actually not even just to change the system, but to bring
down the system as it is. And in the process of bringing down that system, not just allowing
everything to crash to the ground, but constructing new institutions in the process of revolution,
really, that are based on different values, that are based on community, that are based on, you
know, collective struggle, that are based on social solidarity and support, and that allow you to
survive whilst challenging the interests of the powerful. Now, because we live in such a brainwashed
individualistic society, it's basically impossible for people to imagine what that would look like.
Like, if you ask someone, how are you going to, you know, like react against injustice, they'll
say, Oh, I'll buy a tote bag, or like, I'll tweet something. Like, there's no sense of how you might
get involved in a collective project to actually challenge the structures of the system as a whole.
And that's the legacy of neoliberalism and individualism. That was the very aim of,
like, thatcherism, was to destroy our sense of social solidarity. So I think for the left,
the biggest challenge is, yes, firstly, exposing the fact that the system is rigged. But I think
most people know that the system is rigged, right? Like, this is basically what my forthcoming book
is about. It's about all the ways in which the system is rigged. What's it called? It's called
Vulture Capitalism. Vulture Capitalism, corporate crimes, backdoor bailouts, and the death of freedom.
The death of freedom? Yes. Well, that's going to really go down my nose.
I can see Tucker Carlson saying, the death of freedom? By a Marxist.
And yeah, so that's kind of what that book is about. It's basically about all the ways the
system is rigged and the beginnings of kind of how we could think about building something new.
But I think the real challenge is actually speaking to this nihilistic, individualistic,
conspiratorial, like, resentful response to that realization with a politics of hope,
rather than basically like a politics of death. So true. Like, I think one of the, I thought
in the second half of the 2010s, it was a huge win for the left that, you know, we would, you know,
we'd go on the radio waves and on TV, 2017 election. And we'd say, the system is rigged.
And, you know, we were like, wow, so powerful, Bernie kind of vibes. It was working, you know,
labor increased their vote by 10%. You think there is momentum here towards a different
kind of politics. And I remember talking to Jake Berry, who's a Tory MP, and he talked about, you
know, what was the line they had for Theresa May? Strong and steady. Strong and stable.
Strong and stable. And then I said, she's not a strong woman. I said she's strong against the
weak and she's weak against the strong. You exploit the weak and you get on your knees in
front of the path. So that ain't strength, my friend. And he was like, you know, inverting that
little thing. Anyway, so we thought that was like a moment where we were really counting through
with it. And like you say, that's now the common sense of everyone. Everyone says the system is
rigged. It's only like these 5% of like, libs, but like, who are all in the media. And like,
they're the only ones who don't say the system's rigged. Everybody, everybody says the system
is absolute. They might not be, you know, angry, but they might be saying like, look, for now,
I'm doing okay. You know, I'm managing, which is many people, right? I'm not saying they're all
ready for revolution. This is for like, everything was fine before Brexit or everything was fine
before whatever. Like if we could just go back to normal, sensible politics, I don't want to
have to think about politics anymore. I'm politically homeless, that sort of thing.
Yeah, the sort of, you know, your new balance, the rest is politics, listen to the kind of person.
But what I mean, what I want to say is here that you're right. We thought in the latter half of
the 2010s that like, wow, there's this huge political progress for the left to say the system's
rigged. People are buying it. There's an elite, an avaricious elite who are screwing the rest of
society. That is now the music coming from everywhere. That was also what Trump said,
right? Frankly, in many ways. And you're seeing it a lot, a lot with the right, who have obviously
a very different political message. And like you say, for me, you've got like two archetypes here,
which is like mid 20th century, Nibevan. Okay, you, your, your, your loved one or your sibling,
they have tuberculosis or they have some, you know, horrendous disease. That's why we need
national health service, right? Okay, well, something similar in the, in the 2020s in the
United States. Oh, you know, a family member can't afford insulin in the US. Who are they watching?
Andrew Tate. And he's saying it's the matrix out to get you the establishments out to get you.
But what's he saying is the answer. He's saying, get rich, you know, screw lots of women,
work out, you know, get good at fighting. And that's, and in the absence of alternatives,
that's really alluring for lots of young men. Yeah. No, I totally see that because you're
basically, you know, again, and this is the massive ideological success of neoliberalism,
more so than anything to do with convincing us that, you know, we live in free markets,
is to convince us that we are individual competitors in this big old game. And that
everyone has, broadly speaking, the same chances to win the game, or if they don't,
then they at least have the chance to better their lot in life if they just, you know,
work hard and get to know the rules of the game and exploit their competitive advantage against
the people around them. And that is the natural result of putting market ideology onto every
area of social life, because you come to look at yourself as like a commodity. So you're like,
well, how can I win the game better? I need to, you know, understand the rules and the rules are
hidden. So someone like Andrew, take and show me what the rules are. And then I need to get strong
and powerful so I can beat everyone around me. And then I'll be at the top. And maybe, you know,
half the people are thinking, well, when I'm at the top, then I can do nice things for my family,
or like make the system better. Maybe they're thinking, then I can take control, maybe they're
thinking that I can burn the whole thing down. But everything is structured around the idea that
you need to get to the top, you need to win, you need to beat everyone around you. And only then
can you start to think about social change, which is actually the absolute opposite of how any
social change will happen. It is how you make yourself easy to control, basically, is by buying
this ideology that you can be a winner in this system, where there are other people who will set
the rules and always shift the goalposts. And where there will always be losers. And where
those losers will largely speaking always be the same people. And probably you are part of that
group that will always be trapped in this constant struggle and that will never really escape.
The only way out of that is to recognize that you are part of a group and that your interests are
not in beating everyone else around you, which is ultimately impossible and you're never going to
be able to do anyway. Your interests lie in kind of creating communities that can work together
to firstly protect each other and support each other, and then actually start to rebel
against the people who are actually in charge. We're going to clip that, put it on TikTok,
like Sigma, Sigma male music, the real Grace Blakely on the real matrix. It does sound like
on the real matrix. Our liberals, our people, are they part of our movement? And I mentioned,
you know, John Rental earlier on saying that, you know, you leave the free market alone, and of
course the banks are doing nothing wrong and we bailed them out. It wasn't a bailout. And the
sort of the formulaic political strategy that you hear time after time after time is that the left
needs him to do anything, right? He's one of our people, you know, the left and people, I don't
even think he's a liberal, but whatever, you know, the center, which is very few people numerically,
but obviously has tremendous agenda setting power, inserting more generally. Are they part of our
movement? Are they part of our coalition? Or does the inclusion of establishment liberals
within our coalition actually foreclose the possibility of broader class-based politics?
You know, I've got this question here. Do you know, do you think it's weird that the Ford
Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation have viewed as somehow advancing progressive courses?
You know, I saw that think tank recently. What's it called? More in common.
Oh, yeah. More in common. We've got more in common. And they wrote this piece, they had this poll
rather, and it showed that if Jeremy Corbyn was leader of the Labour Party, he would only be
Labour would be one point ahead of the Tories. And obviously this was being race-shown.
This is a poll brought to you by like the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation.
Why do you think people funded by people like that would ask that question?
Ask yourself. And it's precisely those kinds of groups, the sort of liberal NGOs
that we have been told. I believed it for a long time. I mean, you said earlier, you wanted to work
in that kind of world. They were part of our coalition. Do you think that's true or not?
I think that there are two questions, one of which relates to do we need to build a coalition
in which the average person who is maybe not that politically engaged but probably falls
somewhere around the inadvertent commerce centre of the political spectrum needs to be involved?
Yes. And then what we do with the hangover of Blairism and neoliberalism and, you know,
years of this kind of warped style of public debate that we have had, which is all of these
people who think they're very important and in some ways are very important and don't like us.
And there are a number of different answers to that. And I think it varies from person to person.
Broadly speaking, I think these people are rudderless. And that's why they are coming out and
saying all of these wild things. You know, they were thrust to power on the back of a movement
that didn't threaten the status quo, which still was kind of covered in this image of
progressiveness and change and hope. And they still see themselves in that sense,
they see themselves as kind of, you know, vanguards of sensible, compassionate politics
who are protecting the centre ground against extremes on all sides, of course, without
realising that the very reason that the extremes have grown more powerful is precisely because
they are in control. But that's, you know, besides the point. The question then is, I suppose,
you know, how can they either be engaged or neutralised? And that rudderlessness is in
some ways an asset, because if we are able to kind of basically build our own movement,
which we're still very much in the process of doing, that can provide the fulcrum around
which political debate is organised, then they have to pick a side. We don't have that power at
the moment. We don't have that agenda setting power at the moment. We are, as the left, as
socialists, still in this kind of confused position with regards to, like, mainstream
political debates, like sometimes people like me are on TV, but most of the time the issues that
we're talking about aren't the issues that we'd like to be talking about. We have a limited amount
of power to actually shape the way that that process continues. And it is actually those
centrists who are in these positions of authority who are able to kind of set the terms of the
debate. If we're going to be thinking about neutralising or engaging those people in a positive
way, basically, we would need to have more power ourselves, right? And that is the challenge. I think
if we're able to kind of build this project back out, fight back against the narratives that
are being pushed by the far right, build institutions like Navarra that gain some level of agenda
setting power, those people then have to start talking about the things that we want them to
talk about. And as soon as they're starting to talk about the things that we want them to talk about,
they then have to pick a side and the sides are defined by us, right? Whereas at the moment,
we're going into their institutions and we are put into one of these two sides which are defined
by them. This is what I was saying at the beginning about how they'll bring me in and say,
you're taking this side of the debate and then be shocked when I don't argue the line that they
want me to argue. So yeah, I think, as I say, co-opt or neutralise them. There has to be a
position from which we can exert authority. And at the moment, we don't massively have that,
although it is changing slightly. I think actually, the slow implosion of mainstream media and the
growth of online platforms and problems like Navarra, they are paying attention to that.
Whenever I go into mainstream media studios, there's all panic about like, how are they going to
adapt to the digital age? And the BBC, I don't know if you saw that BBC feedback thing where it's
like Radio 4 is losing listeners. What do we do? That's crazy. Yeah. So I think there is a sense
of like, they know that they're kind of rudderless. They know that the questions they're asking don't
really attach to conversations that are taking place in society more generally. But they're still
in control of the way that those debates happen. And that's not going to change until they aren't.
So I don't really know if that answers the question. Grace just mentioned organisations
like Navarra Media. Yes. And I want to take this opportunity to say that you can help us grow and
you can help us change the political debate in this country and change politics by supporting our
work. So if you go to navarramedia.com forward slash support, you can make a one-off payment,
you can become a supporter. I think we have 12, 13,000 supporters these days. I'm from Bournemouth.
You could fill the Vitality Stadium and more with the people that support Navarra Media.
That's great. Why don't you join them and go to navarramedia.com forward slash support and make
ideally a monthly payment or whatever you can. You know, our catchphrase back in the day used
to be new media for different politics. And I was thinking about this recently. I didn't come up
with it so I can say this. It's brilliant, right? Because it's showing a problem and it's showing
a solution and it's showing how to get there in one simple sentence. What's the problem? Politics.
What's the instrument to improving it? Media. How do we get better media to inflect politics?
Us. Yes. And obviously not just Navarra Media, Tribune,
Jacobin, innumerable outlets out there, but I think you're right to say it's probably the lowest
hanging fruit in terms of pushing politics this country left is taking on MSM. And like it's
happening whether we like it or not, that crumbling, it's about, you know, how's it going to fall,
how the piece is going to land. So like I said, if you want it to land in a good way,
go to navarra.com forward slash support. I endorse this message.
I'm very, I'm very glad you do. You know, you said earlier on your IPPR. Yeah.
No, I was doing some work with them. I remember. Good times. I remember. And I remember, we did,
I made a video with you. So some people might not know this, but I don't just write stuff. I'm
also a very bad videographer. No. I used to sort of dabble in it. And I made a video with you.
And I remember at the time you had like 5,000 followers on Twitter. And I was like,
what is going on, Grace? And now how many do you have?
Like 180,000 or something. Yeah, still not good enough. But still, I just, I hate, I hate it.
No, but you're such an eloquent voice and you're so informative on finance stuff, which obviously is,
you know, it's quite hard to penetrate for most people. I think it's obscured intentionally.
Of course. You know, they don't want it to be easy to understand for most people. And I think,
you know, it's great you're finding an audience. Why quickly? Why do you hate Twitter? You said,
don't you hate it? Really, like, you know, all of what I've been talking about so far has been to
do with these ideologies that keep us subjected to control and that we reproduce inside our heads
all the time, right? And so being on social media and having lots of followers and being on TV and
being like successful in publishing books, it like, we are supposed to be, we are talking often
to people who are losing out as a result of the systems that, which they have no control. And
you are speaking from the perspective of someone who's winning as part of all of those systems.
And I see this now, you see yourself as winning. Yeah, I think so. And I see this now, you know,
like the most kind of aggressively neoliberal, marketized way that you can look at this,
you can look at like the value you have as a human being is to do online dating, right?
Because that is a market in a sense, you know, historically, you wouldn't have a market for
partners, you'd have a community, you'd meet X amount of people over the course of your life,
you pick one, you, you know, you go with them. Now we have this hugely liquid market,
which's got loads and loads of people in it. And the more liquid a market, the better the price
mechanism works. So the better you're able to see, you know, based on the force of supply and
demand, what your price, what your value is in the market. And even though they don't tell you
where exactly you sit in that hierarchy, you can tell by the number of matches you get, or like,
you know, the way people respond to you in that game. And if you are attractive, if you have a
lot of social media followers, people are obsessed with social media followers and fame and influence.
And if you like have a good job and you're successful, then you have a high price in that
market for human beings, for partners. And I find myself in that position, whilst also,
and you know, benefiting from that position, whilst also really disliking the idea that it is
possible to assign a price value to a person based on these metrics of success over which we have no
control. And also having to accept that like, according to all of those metrics of success
of which we have no control, I'm winning because like I was born into a relatively well off family
in a rich country and a rich part of the world and went to Oxford and like played this game well.
And it just is, I think basically it poisons you if you identify with it. It poisons you because
you start thinking, I'm a winner. I've come out on top. I'm better in one way or another. And
it's not even conscious half the time, it's kind of unavoidable. It's like the adoption of an
attitude that you take towards what you're doing and the people who are around you. And if you
can't take off that identity and like leave it at the door and be like, that's something that has
happened because of the screwed up way that our society exists and I have it and that's great
and I'm going to try and use it the best way I can. But then say, I am just a person. I don't have
a value that you can correlate with the number of social media followers I have or the number of
matches I get on Ninja. I have, you know, friends that see me who I am. I have like hobbies and
things that I do that have absolutely nothing to do with that stuff. I am not playing this game
most of the time. I'm just being myself. Unless you can do that, you become your brain melts.
Quickly, what hobbies do you have? I really like surfing.
Okay, so I want to say something more like Warhammer or something.
No, I think, weightlifting.
I think there's, you know, you were saying about how producers expect you to have formula X sort
of because you're on the left liberal values. I actually have a major critique of dating apps.
Like I genuinely think there's a huge downside to how we're socializing young people who've never
known anything else. So maybe people a bit younger. And I think we need a proper conversation about
it. And I'm considering doing an article about this.
You should. And I've had this conversation many, many times I've gone on TV and they
expect you as the lefty, you know, oh, should we have our phones be banned in schools? And I go,
of course I should. We should have limits on social media for young people. What are you
talking about? We're literally incentivizing addiction to fund the world's largest wealthiest
companies. Of course we should. But like they don't view that as a left wing position because
they think the left wing position on everything is let everybody do everything that they want.
Well, some government too. So like maybe, yeah, we should have, you know, the government should
oversee like there should be like an inquirer. Like, no, I think that there shouldn't really be,
I fundamentally think kids below 11, 12 shouldn't have a smartphone. And they certainly shouldn't
be allowed in schools. You know, it's interesting that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs didn't let their
children have smartphones precisely these reasons. But I think dating apps is a really
similar thing where, you know, maybe it's my sort of, there's an authoritarian impulse there.
I am really, and look, we'll find out in 2030 years time, right? It's like smoking.
It's like smoking in the 1950s. What are the long term impacts of this stuff? And I think
there might be some really big ones. Oh yeah, totally. I think, yeah, unless you can actually,
you know, learn to disaggregate yourself from these, all of these systems that surround our
lives. And it's so prevalent now with the way that we use social media, and with the way that
the labor market is constructed based on, you know, the gig economy and like mini entrepreneurs
and stuff. If you cannot like, learn to take your identity out of these settings where you are being
told that you as a person have a value based on the things that you do, then you will make yourself
miserable and mentally ill. And even if you win, even if you're at the top, you're going to make
yourself miserable. And especially if you lose. This is why I love having an Iranian dad.
Why? Because he, well, maybe the same with your parents. He has no idea what I do.
No, my parents know what I do. So he goes, why do you go on TV like what you have on YouTube?
How the hell does that work? Don't you have to like, don't you have to work in TV to go on TV?
And I'm like, no, it's like, Christ, he has no idea. He doesn't, he doesn't bless him. He has no idea
what Navarra is. He's like, you're employed. I was like, yeah, there's about 25 of us. We have like
a place in Leeds. I love that. No way. No, but it's really grounding. It's great. Yeah. Because
sometimes my wife got, oh, it's so impressive. We don't write myself. You know what? My dad
literally hasn't got the first fucking. Yeah. It's really useful, like you say, like, so you don't
get like, you don't believe the smoke that, you know, might be blown up around us on the,
on the liberal thing. Are they part of our coalition? So this was a, this was an issue which I,
I thought was really key within that, which was the Faraj debanking saga. Oh, yeah. So this was
really fun actually, because I got to have the, the only kind of different line, which was,
so obviously it was like, he should have access to a bank account or, you know, he shouldn't,
because he's a bad person, liberals versus progressives, whatever. I was like, Faraj says
that we live in a free market capitalist economy. And in a free market capitalist economy, a private
bank has every right to make decisions based on what it considers to be its interests and its
profits. And therefore he should have no problem with a bank deciding whether or not to give him
a bank account. I personally believe that firstly, we do not largely live in a free market economy.
We live in an economy in which the heads of private institutions have an immense amount of power to
make decisions without any democratic accountability whatsoever. That isn't very good. And that we
should be moving towards an economy in which we have collective democratic public control
over all of our institutions, including banks, so that everyone gets a bank account. And we
all collectively get to make the rules as to how those bank accounts are administered. And
everyone was just like, that doesn't make any sense. Oh, they just ignored me and kind of carried
on talking around the issue. Well, he, I mean, it was interesting with him was he was saying,
because for people watching this, oh, it's fake news, he didn't get, he didn't have,
he wasn't given a business account where he was, which was Coots, which is a subsidiary of Nat West,
and he wasn't offered a business account, a bunch of other banks. He was offered a regular, you know,
current account, but presumably Nigel Frye, Big Shot Nigel, you know, he probably wants to use it in
the US when he goes support Trump later this year and whatnot. And that wouldn't have been,
wouldn't have been sufficient. And he himself said, you know, until quite recently, we had
post office and everybody had a right to get a post office bank bank account. I'm thinking,
what, you support, you support a nationally owned bank, which is going to be the banker of last resort
for people in this country who can't get bank accounts anywhere else. But what I mean, I suppose
what they would say is, it's an issue of, it's a matter of law. So whether or not somebody should
be able to access banking should be, should be a matter of civil rights and law rather than policy.
And it's, this is a big difference now, I think between like some parts of the left and others.
I think as a civil right that should be enshrined in law, lots of people liberals think, no, well,
it's, you know, these should be very flexible and one policy can apply here and another policy
can apply there. So what Farage would say is, well, it should be illegal to debank people
below a certain threshold, right? That's what he would say. But like you say, once you get into
that terrain, well, okay, if we're going to talk about the law as a constraint on the free market,
okay, let's have capital control. You can argue for anything, frankly. Do you think that,
do you think they've always lived with those inconsistencies? I mean, the right, the sort of
thatch right, right? Or is it sort of becoming more pronounced because now they've got more
exposure? You know, their inconsistencies are perhaps in the spotlight more or was it always there?
There are two sets of inconsistencies that I think are important here, one of which is inherent to
the neoliberal movement and the other of which stems from the necessary alliance between neoliberals
and kind of far right, like extremists basically. And the first inconsistency is the inconsistency
with a neoliberal thought, which says that this is an ideology based on kind of the need to promote
human freedom, the accepts that we are all kind of equal individuals playing this free market game.
And the job of a kind of good politician is to set up the rules of that game so that they are fair,
so that, you know, as a society, we think basically that they're fair and such that they
prop up the kind of norms and rules of economics. So we have to have a legal system basically that
kind of supports the functioning of the economy and make sure that everyone knows how to play
the free market game fairly, right? So that's the kind of neoliberal idea about what the state
should do. Their critique of the way that the state is is that it's taken over by vested interests,
by bureaucrats who just make policy in the interests of, you know, their little kingdom
building or fiefdom building. And the problem with the neoliberal theory is that they never say,
how do we get from here to there? How do we get from a state that's governed by vested interest to
one that's governed by neutral technocratic enlightened bureaucrats? And of course, we don't.
We just end up with the neoliberal agenda basically being used to push into power people who
veil their naked desire for power with a spiel about the need for free markets and competition,
whereas actually the free market game that they are going to construct and set up will be rigged
in their favor. It's just that the only impetus, the only kind of, the only power that they end
up having is the power to crush people who interfere with the game from a particular
perspective. So you see anti-competition law, for example, in the US being used to break up unions,
but not being used to break up kind of big firms and big banks and stuff. So there's this like,
this inherent problem at the heart of neoliberal ideology, which is its orientation
towards the state basically. It's like the state should be used, state policy and the legal system
and law should all be used to construct this fair good free market economic game. And the fact of
life under capitalism, which has never been a pure free market system, it's always been a system of
kind of private government by capital. And that private government is exercised both within the
firm and over the state as a whole. And there's this kind of what, you know, some theorists have
called this like double truth, what Hayek called actually the double truth at the heart of neoliberal
philosophy, which is tell everyone that we want less state intervention and kind of, you know,
a cutting of red tape and a removal of the state to make space for the free market and the actual
neoliberal goal, which is creating this apparatus from within the state that supports the functioning
of the free market under the influence of capitalists who are actually rigging that game in their
favor. So this whole like big state small state thing again, is that that's the massive biggest
lie at the heart of neoliberalism. And then there's the other thing that even if you didn't have all
of that, even if you just accepted the fact that neoliberals do think there should be this big
state small state free markets versus state intervention dichotomy, there's this problem
that's come with that from their alliance with the far right, which is as I've said, basically
composed of people who consider themselves to be losers or on the verge of losing from the free
market economic game and want protections put in place against people who they consider to be
outsiders to preserve what remains of the spoils of that game for their group. So you have basically
the answer between neoliberals who set up an economy in which people were permanently divided
into winners and losers with people who have ended up losing and now think that we basically
need to kind of shit on immigrants and like, you know, put women in their place in order
to preserve their special status within a game where they feel like losers. And that creates
obvious sources of conflict, which we saw most clearly with, you know, the divide between
Johnson's Brexiteers and the kind of extreme neoliberal libertarian wing of the conservative
party that descends from kind of thatcher. I think David Graber called it the iron law of
liberalism, which is like when government tries to reduce need for government in this hamfisted
way of just like salami slicing public budgets and so on, they increase the need for government.
That's not to say that you come, you know, some things maybe couldn't be done by the government.
Of course, of course you can have that conversation and you focus on the things that are really
important. So for instance, a pacifist would say we could spend less on arm spending, for instance.
But I think his insight is really interesting. And it's fascinating what you say about that
being a fundamental inconsistency and contradiction within neoliberalism about here what you think,
here are your values, here's where you want to get an A can never lead to B. It's like that meme,
there's a video of like Sean Dyson, Pep Guardiola, have you seen this? No. And you got Sean Dyson,
she's going, keep the ball out of there and that end, put it in the goal and that end. And then
you've got Pep Guardiola saying we have the inverted right back, we play the false nine,
we bring him in. So you've got two reeds on football, right? One is like very basic Brexit
football. And then there's like, you know, sexy total football, Pep style. And like,
neoliberals love to say cut the steak, free markets, free people, free government, blah,
and it's like, no, like you end up in the most arcane, we'll do this subsidy here and we'll cut
this here and we'll create this new Quangun's agency, we'll have this and we'll lose money here,
but we'll tax those guys. Like going back to what I said earlier on with this housing policy from
Michael Gove, they'll be allowed to pollute more, but we'll have this change here and we'll give
more money here and taxpayer money can go to this private company here. And even though it's
probably only they still have shareholder dividends, if they don't pay the dividends, we'll give them
money to pay the dividends. Yeah, just just bring water into public ownership and bring and build
some social housing. This whole system and the most ingenious thing about this, right,
is that every new piece of regulation creates opportunities for profit making. Because there's
regulatory arbitrage, you can like, you know, use the gaps in existing regulation to make sure that
you're winning against your competitors, because I don't know you're like using profit shifting or
like other forms of regulatory arbitrage, which basically just means exploiting differences
between laws or gaps in regulation to like create opportunities for profit. You saw this with the
financial crisis, right? Like there was this explosion in regulation of the finance sector
in some ways, especially the international level going up to the crisis of 2008. And we're talking
about how assets were classified and categorized and how banks were supposed to value those assets
and the way that they were supposed to kind of assess risk. And actually, that ended up creating
opportunities for profit making. It, for example, incentivized the the pasting up of all these
different mortgages into these mortgage backed securities that looked really safe, because
they were supposedly diversified, but which actually obviously had, you know, within that
process, there was this constant risk of kind of massive catastrophic meltdown. So that process
of setting regulation ended up creating opportunities for profit making, that also caused the financial
crisis. And this is always the case, like whenever you get a new law, there are ways of exploiting
the existence of that law to make money. And private interest will always do that. It's the
same with as well with like, you know, carbon, carbon credits, the ways that those were set
actually ended up making money at the European level for some companies when they were able to
sell those. So regulation creates opportunities for profit making.
So Labour keeps saying that they'll smash the class ceiling when they're in government,
they'll smash the class ceiling. What does that mean?
Well, it depends on whether or not you are a Marxist or a Liberal. To me, smashing the class
ceiling means dissolving the distinction between the people who own the means of production and
those who are forced to work for a living on pain of destitution by socializing the ownership of
and control and governance of all of the assets that we need to produce the things that we need
to survive. It means dissolving the very existence of class as mediated by ownership, basically.
To a Liberal, it means making sure that the people who start life as losers maybe get to be
winners for a few minutes at some point in their lives. So, you know, the whole Liberal imaginary
is about making sure that rather than actually dissolving the divide between, you know,
workers and the owners of the means of production between capital and Labour,
it means making sure that there's more sortition amongst Labour and maybe the capacity every now
and again for some people within Labour to get into the position of being capitalists.
But again, very rarely. So, it's about, you know, social mobility or whatever. It's not about
changing the structure of the system. There's always going to be winners. There's always going
to be losers. And largely speaking, those winners and losers will be the same people
generally pretty consistently throughout history, although there will be periods of change and
of shift. And the Liberal viewers just say that change should happen a little bit more frequently.
People like us should be in charge. Exactly. Let's have social mobility. So,
comprehensive kids like me, you know, the first of my family to go to university,
I'll not stop tweeting about it. Let's have more people like me in charge. You know,
we did a great interview with Dan Evans, and he has a brilliant critique of social mobility,
as really a sort of justifying veneer for a dysfunctional economic, social and political
system, which also, by the way, increasingly can't even produce any growth or improvements
to living standards. And like the veneer on that is, sure, we've had zero growth 15 years,
living standards are falling, but I'm the first person in my family to go to university.
What the hell are you talking about? I think this actually comes back to the point that I made
at the very start of this interview, right, about the difference between winners and losers and
people who make the rules, right? Like the conservative view is just that, like, the winners
are the winners and the losers are the losers. And that's fair because that's based on competition
and competition is its own process of fairness. For those on the left, it's like, well, we should
make sure that if people do lose, they're protected in some way, and that actually they have more
opportunities to become winners, and that the winners pay a little bit more to make sure that
society works a little bit better. Whereas the Marxist or the socialist view should be,
there shouldn't be winners and losers and people that make the rules. It should be,
we all make the rules together. It's a completely different way of organizing society.
Grace, on that note, we'll leave it there. When's your book out for people who perhaps
come into you for the first time though? I find it very hard to believe.
No, I mean, I'm sure I've been away for quite a while. I hope that there'll be people who
are coming for me for the first time.
That's the point of coming on the road, I guess. When is it coming out?
The 7th of March, I think, next year. Yeah, so early March next year.
And if people want to follow your work, where can they find you?
They can find me at Grace Blakely. Blakely has two Es, E-L-E-Y, on Twitter, on Instagram,
even on TikTok. Oh, wow, TikTok. And you're right for Tribune.
And I'm right for Tribune, yes. Great. Well, thank you so much.
Thank you.
