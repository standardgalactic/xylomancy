Neoliberalism has devastated so many people's ways of living and ways of working, forced them
from their homes and their jobs, or made life increasingly precarious. So people are made
nervous. They're made nervous by climate change, by war escalating as we speak.
If you, as a right-wing political operator, if you reach into that fear and say,
guess what? The reason you're so afraid, the reason you're so anxious, the reason that the future is
unclear, is gender or race or migration, you produce, you're able to reorganize and stoke
those fears and anxieties in a direction that moves against those minorities or against those
populations in favor of a really strong state.
Hello and welcome to this very special edition of Downstream IRL, very kindly hosted by Reference
Point. If you're watching this on YouTube, you've got no idea that 100 people have dragged their
carcasses early in the morning to be with us today, and that's for a very special reason.
I'm delighted to say that we are joined by Judith Butler, philosopher,
philosopher, author, and as I found out this morning, fan of hard-boiled eggs.
They need no introduction, but I'm going to do it anyway. They are the author of seminal works such
as gender trouble, bodies that matter, frames of war, and their new book, Who's Afraid of Gender,
which examines how a transphobic backlash morphed into an all-out war against so-called gender
ideology. It takes us from the Vatican to the conservative right, and it best of all dissects
how Britain became Turf Island. I'm so sorry that you have to be with us today, but I'm glad
to be here, glad to be here. Very honored actually. So I guess my first question is,
when someone pops up and says, what is a woman, what are they really asking?
That's such a good question. Well, it depends who's asking and to whom the question is addressed,
but if Rishi Sunak asks that question of the Labour Party more generally, or its current
representative, he's trying to ridicule them or catch them out, because you look kind of
foolish if you don't know, or you say, well, I'm not sure, or actually the category is open.
It's like, oh, come on. It's common sense. Everybody knows. You're like in some
airy, obscurantist, woke ether, and you're having a problem with a very
commonsensical question. So the person who asks it in that way is trying to
ally with common sense or with the common people who share a common sense, but the so-called
common people who share a common sense also might have a trans kid or a cousin, or have a gender
non-conforming uncle, right? Didn't we all have a gender non-conforming uncle? I'm going to ask him.
Yeah. No, I mean, it's a way of re-consolidating this idea of common sense, of natural difference,
and debunking those who open up the question as either detached intellectuals out of touch
with common sense or with some kind of wokeism understood as a set of
principles that are being imposed on common sense reality from a doctrinaire position.
Is there a way to answer that question in good faith, in a way which is inclusive and acknowledges
the variety of the human species, but also is able to grapple with that when someone says
woman, it doesn't mean something to most people? Well, I think if we were even to try to answer
the question, we would need a multilingual framework, right? What's that? Well, how are
women referred to or understood in various languages, in various ways of speaking? How are
women thought about in history? How has the idea of what a woman is changed in different histories,
in different parts of the globe? So we would need a global framework. We would need a multilingual
framework looking at different ways that women are defined. We would then need to understand why
it was always so important to feminism to keep the question open. Why would feminists do that?
Well, because they didn't like received ideas of what a woman is or is supposed to be, right?
She stays at home, involved in reproductive labor alone, supposed to be sentimental, not supposed
to be rational, not capable of certain kinds of labor, uniquely capable for other kinds of labor.
We opened the question, what is a woman? We even opened the question,
what does a woman want in psychoanalysis? We opened those questions because we were not happy
with the ways in which those definitions were operating. And people did, of course,
have some pretty intense ways of thinking about this. So if you live in a society in which women
aren't supposed to do certain labor or aren't supposed to look a certain way, are you still a
woman if you do that labor or you look a certain way? As feminists, I thought we're saying, yeah,
you are. Of course you are. You want to be a woman? Come on in. Of course you are. Let's expand that
category. Let's make it more inclusive. So it's been important to an emancipatory project to keep
the question of what a woman is open. So why would we, at a certain point in our illustrious
history as feminists, ever decide, no, we're closing the door. We're not going to extend the
category. You can't claim it. Well, why not? We've been expanding that category, accepting
its internal diversification for a really long time. We've gone on the streets for that purpose.
Why would we suddenly decide, oh, this is the limit case?
I mean, you're referring a lot to feminism there, and I suppose that leads me onto the question of
why is it that in the UK, transphobia has come in the guise of feminism, so-called gender critical
feminism, as opposed to the much more explicitly right wing, family-oriented, religiously inflected
iterations of other countries? That's such a good question. Well, first of all, let me just say
I don't, I think we need to reclaim feminism, transfeminism, intersectional feminism,
post-MD, colonial feminism. There are all kinds of feminisms out there that are really important,
abolitionist, black feminism. We do not give feminism away. We do not. We reclaim it. We
make sure that we know how to keep it open, keep it thoughtful, keep it self-critical.
When we talk about critical gender critical, I never understand what's being said.
Because critical means, what does it mean if you're a feminist and you're critical? That means
you call into question the presuppositions that you have received unthinkingly. It's like you become
more thoughtful. You ask, well, why have I proceeded with that category in that way? What's, you know,
you allow yourself to be changed by the history of emancipatory movements to rethink the fundamental
categories and you have humility and you change and you become more inclusive and more, you offer
more recognition and you accept that the categories that we often consider to be so fundamental are
historically changing and it's a good thing because we want to be part of that historical change.
I think that I can't give you the so-called account diagnosis of UK
turfism. I think we're undiagnosable as a country and they take great pride in that.
But, you know, I do think it's against the background of a shattered left
that these kinds of intensely sectarian fights start happening. The only way to have a political
position is to identify perhaps as a woman or perhaps as a lesbian and to guard that territory
and to make it into a kind of vault or a gated community that controls who can enter and
who belongs. And I think that kind of territoriality happens when people are very unsure about their
alliances or where they belong and what their broader political aims are.
Right? So, I don't exactly know how to account for it, but I do think that there are great fears
that I hear trans-exclusionary feminists speaking about. They're afraid of being replaced. They're
being violated. They're afraid of having the definition of womanhood appropriated.
And I think it's worth thinking about, well, what are the conditions under which those become
primary fears? And what are the ways of addressing that fear without seeking recourse to an
exclusionary politics? It would be great if that could be opened as a debate, as a really serious
question. I think we should take other people's fears seriously, especially when they turn quickly
to either to hatred or to discriminatory or exclusionary politics. But maybe there's a way
to go back to the fear and say, well, let's talk about that first and see whether another path is
possible. I mean, I'm using the word transphobia quite broadly. And of course, a lot of the time,
what we're talking about is the demonization of trans women in particular. We're not talking
about the demonization of trans men, of course, that does happen. Trans men are called self-hating
lesbians or whatever happened to the butch. The butch is being effaced from the earth and the
trans, you know... How are the butches getting along? Still there? Still all right? I mean...
Well, you can affirm a history as a butch and be a trans man. And Jack Halberstam has taught us
a little bit about how trans asterisks works in that way to be a more inclusive category.
But why is it trans women in particular? Because when I try and sort of extract what the big story
is from a lot of the things that I'm reading, whether it's in The Times, The Guardian, it's
sort of this idea of, you know, here's someone who's assigned male at birth and they've got this
power and they can only be using it for ill. They're becoming like a wolf in sheep's clothing
or something like that. Is that a genuine fear or is it a convenient way of appropriating the
position of the victim when wanting to oppress others? You know, I think the fear
does rest on a misunderstanding or perhaps a willful ignorance about what trans masculinity
is and how it operates or what trans femininity is and how it operates. And I think we need to
go back to some fundamentals here. If you're assigned male at birth that doesn't immediately
give you power. It's once you enter into the social world that you see what that assignment can mean.
A lot of people assigned male at birth are really unhappy with that assignment.
And it doesn't serve them. And in fact, they suffer under it. And they may well not like
the expectations of sexuality or the expectations of gender that go along with that assignment
and contest it. Those folks have to go through some real social challenges to secure the sex
assignment that they do want and need to live in the way that they want. So that history of
suffering, of aspiration, of desire, that deep sense of self that needs and ought to have
social recognition is not properly honored by those who would reduce somebody to their sex
assignment or even the fact that they may well have a penis. Having a penis does not
immediately give you social power, especially if you don't want it. It's just kind of complicated.
Or you want it out of play or some other things are more erotic for you. We don't even have that
discussion openly. It's just assumed like, oh, you're a signed male, you have a penis, therefore
you are a potential rapist. Is that the way we feel about our sons? No. Our fathers, our friends,
our lovers? No. We know that men negotiate social violence in different ways that a lot of men can
be ethical. And that masculinity is in the process of being reproduced in some interesting ways by
trans men, by younger men who've been brought up by feminist parents or who've entered culture
and learned a lot about what it is ethically to be a man, how to comport yourself ethically as a
man in this world. We want that. We hope for that. We support that. So like I was saying about
the category of woman, the category of man is also historical. And we need to be interested in
the social reproduction of masculinity and make sure it's being reproduced in some good ways.
So not that the devil needs an advocate, but someone like J.K. Rowling or Julie Bindle,
they would say that they're speaking up for the most disadvantaged women in society. So
women in prison, survivors of domestic violence. And sure, debating who goes in what prison might
be an edge case, but it certainly does matter if you're a woman in that prison. So what would you
say to those people who would say that actually they're coming at it from a perspective of risk
management? Yes. I wonder whether we could easily in the U.K., in the U.S. and elsewhere
find statistics that support the notion that prison guards are actually more dangerous to
women in prison. I mean, by whom are women in prison violated? Sometimes by other women,
sometimes by prison guards, both men and women. I think the way gender operates, the way power
operates in prison, the way sexual violation operates is a larger picture. I'd like to see
the larger picture first, and then we can ask that question about this trans woman who happens to be
in a women's prison rather than a men's, because what's going to happen to that trans woman in a
men's prison? That trans woman is going to be the object of sexual violation. So if you say that
person should, out of concern for the sexual violation of women, and we'll just leave that
open category, that a trans woman should be in a men's prison, what you're doing is recommending
sexual violation over there in order to protect yourself against the prospect, the fantasy of a
sexual violation over here. Maybe we need the broader picture of how is sexual violation actually
happening in prisons, and then we can make a more grounded judgment. I mean, what we know is that
trans women in prisons in England or Wales are much more likely to be victims of sexual violation
than perpetrators of sexual violation, and that, yeah, the broader picture of statistics bears that
out, but someone might say, okay, drawing back to that bigger picture isn't telling me what to do
with this immediate situation as and when it arises. You know, there's a question of rights
here and how you balance them, and I suppose I'm interested in, do you buy that there are conflicts
of rights here, or are there ways to sort of integrate them? I think the question for anybody
who is at risk of being sexually violated in prison is what is the recourse within prison to
protect oneself against it? So the group that we would want women to be protected against are all
those who might violate them. So the same procedure that would be used against a male guard or a woman
guard or the exceptional trans woman would hold. We wouldn't single out a particular group,
especially if statistically that group is not primarily responsible for sexual violation
in prison. So it's not on the basis of identity or classification that we make that decision. We
say anybody who violates another person sexually needs to be held accountable, and we need procedures
for that, but we don't discriminate against kinds of violators. They're all bad. But look,
there's an obvious point here that probably needs to be restated, and I always forget.
You can find your example of a trans woman who did in fact threaten or violate another
woman in prison. You can find your example. But if you make that example into then the general truth
of the category all trans women are this way or all trans women represent this risk, then you
are actually engaging in what's technically transphobia, right? Because we wouldn't say, oh,
you know, I went into this store and I bought something from a Jewish store owner and I think
I was overcharged. If somebody said to you, oh yeah, all the Jews do that, you would say,
fuck you. Excuse my language, sorry. You would say that's anti-Semitism.
Don't worry, I've heard that before. No, no, no, no. But seriously, or one black person does
want that, well, that's what black people, and that's what happens in right wing propaganda,
right? That is exactly how presidential elections are run in the US. You find one migrant who did
this one thing and then that stands for all migrants. So that's a right wing strategy. It's
racist. It's a transphobic. It's an anti-Semitic strategy. We know how that works. You take the
instance, you inflate it into the general category. So that needs to be stopped.
Before we move on from this discussion about gender critical feminism, I'm going to do something
really annoying and quote your own partner back to you. But as I was reading your book,
I was wondering about whether this narrative that you get from gender critical feminists that
trans and non-binary people are taking something from them. Yeah, what are they taking? Taking
language, taking attention, taking social capital status from them. I wonder if that could be linked
to Wendy Brown's idea of wounded attachment, that you have a wounded attachment to a position of
marginality and there is a certain amount of social capital that comes with it and you don't
want to let it go. Well, if I understand Wendy Brown correctly.
This is the scariest moment of my life, by the way. She's actually up the road. We could probably
call her. We do suffer wounds. Many of us, gay, lesbian, trans, women, people of color,
workers, a lot of us have been wounded, exploited, violated. We come with histories of wounds.
There's no question about it. The question is, do we then stay attached to that wound and does that
wound become the source of our identity and we just stay as a wounded identity in the political
sphere and that's our operation to assert that wounded identity and stay attached to it. Or do
we look around and say, well, who else got wounded and what did they do to overcome those wounds and
what kind of alliances are necessary to make sure other people don't get wounded in this way and that
we can affirm life, not just from a wounded position, but from a place of what she's now
calling reparation or a place indeed of emancipation or social struggle. There are different
trajectories that you can go through, but the question is, what is the wound to feminism?
What's the wound to lesbianism really if the category of women is expanded to include trans
women? How do any of the people who live in that category, how are they actually suffering?
It seems to me that what they're suffering from is a kind of hatred or phobia that is overwhelming
to them and that that's a corrosive set of emotions to live with, but I do understand that as
unfortunately self-inflicted. I do think some of the debates here in the UK, especially online
where people are free to be as mean as they possibly can, some of the debates on all sides in the UK
have been very disturbing to me. I don't think hideous insults and condemnations and accusations
and vile ways of referring to other people are okay. I'd rather see kind of meaningful open debate
on these issues, so I don't think social media has helped this so-called conflict because it does
escalate and foreground the cruelest and the meanest kinds of utterances and maybe it's important
to stay away from those. It's hard when you're fighting, you want to be cruel, you want to be
snide, you want to ridicule people, you want to show that their position is preposterous.
It's not going to persuade anybody. I think it might be better to figure out what are people
really fearing and do they need to and is there another way to talk about that?
I want to move the conversation on a little bit. When somebody says I'm a man, I'm a woman,
I'm non-binary, it's not just about their right to perceive themselves in a certain way. It's also
about the right to be perceived and affirmed and addressed in a certain way and so I'm interested
in the bit which is socially negotiated. It's not just about what I say about myself, it's also about
how other people address me, perceive me. Are there limits to the powers of self-definition?
Tell me what you have in mind. For instance, if I was to continue presenting in the way that I am
now exactly the same and I was to say actually my preference would be for he, him pronouns,
I'd like to be addressed as a man, there are lots of people who would say I find this very
challenging, what I'm seeing in front of me and what you're asking me to do. There's a
challenge here. I've got the right to say live with it, live with the challenge.
I do think your question raises something interesting, the term gender.
Back in the day, we would talk about the gender division of labor and some socialist feminists
still do and it's important to do that especially as we think about care work and social reproduction
and their gender is not about identity, it's actually about how the society is organized
according to this exceedingly important power differential. Gender is a framework,
it's a structure. Then there's gender identity and some people think oh,
gender is just gender identity, it's become synonymous with or shorthand for.
And then once we go into the question of gender identity, we see that there's gender presentation,
how we appear to ourselves perhaps or to others and that can be very divergent,
but that's divergent anyway even among like so-called cis people. It's like I think I look a
certain way and you think I don't. It's like well, why? Well, because the way we perceive
ourselves in the ways others perceive us can differ and they can differ actually rather radically.
Let's hold that in mind that there's no bridging of that gap once and for all in my mind. Even if
you say I'm a woman and I say yeah, I think you probably are, do we mean the same thing
at that moment? Maybe not. Maybe I'm thinking one thing and you're thinking another, okay.
And there are different ways of being and presenting as a woman and then it gets controversial. It's
like well, I don't think that presentation is okay. In any case, my point is simply that
very often of a felt sense of who one is and how one identifies is not always matched by
a socially perceived gender presentation. And so if somebody tells you this is actually
how I understand myself, this is my lived reality, you do have a challenge, but you have
a challenge because you are, if you're having trouble reconciling a certain gender presentation
with that person's self definition, you're assuming that gender identification can be
read off of gender presentation and it is not always the case. I understand that and I understand
that it's not always the case. But if I was talking to someone who was outside of this room,
not super duper political, they'd say it is quite often the case though. And as a society,
we live by rules of thumb. We can change those rules of thumb when we come across an exception,
but I make judgments in a generalized way. That's how I get through my day.
We do and it's actually one of the reasons why queer and gender non-conforming and trans kids
have had such a hard time because they're coming to school, they're looking the way they're supposed
to look, more or less, where they're challenging that and people are just saying you're in this
category, you're in this one, we need to order society in a certain way. And what is the internal
sense of suffering happens when you're put into a category that actually effaces who you are because
look a certain way to somebody who's imposing a set of social expectations on you at school
in religious institutions, on the street, in the family. It's like, but that's who you are,
but that's how you look, but that's how I understand you. It's like how to live with that deep sense
of disjunction and you're effaced by the very category by which you are generally recognized.
So it seems to me that a lot of the time when I'm talking to people are very,
very much involved with trans rights, there's sort of two ways of understanding it. There's one way
you sort of say, okay, what we're asking for isn't very much at all. It is the right to be affirmed
in our chosen gender and that is not an imposition on anyone else at all. Changing how you speak and
it's coming from a respect for my humanity. And then there's another way of looking at it which is
saying, well actually, people choosing to live in a gender which is not the one they were assigned
at birth and straining against these categories and challenging these categories and the connections
between gender identification, gender presentation, socially recognized gender, that that is actually
a really big deal. So I suppose my question is how much of a big deal is it? Is it a small
alteration of social norms or is it actually something which is a lot more fundamental
that's being posed here? Inherently we're talking about blowing up some of these categories of gender.
Well, if you're a biological essentialist, it's a revolution. If you are a member of a right-wing
partisan of the Catholic Church and you believe in the natural family and creationism and that
God created male and female, it's revolutionary. Okay, so for all those folks, it's really rough.
And I'm sorry that they're having a hard time but I think they need to go through it and come out
the other end and join the rest of us in a better world. So it's okay, you know. I mean, I accept
it's hard. Sure, it's like deeply sentimented kind of beliefs and habits and ways of seeing.
But it is true that a lot of people just want to be left alone and live without being pathologized
and discriminated against or the object of violence or disdain. And that seems right to be able to
like natal women. They want to walk down the street without being harassed. Like
natal women, they want to get a job without being discriminated against. They want to love
who they want to love. They want their lives and their loves to be recognized minimally or
maximally by society and to live in freedom and without fear. It seems pretty reasonable.
One of the things that you object to in the book is an idea of self-definition as being simply a
form of radical liberty. The idea of well anyone can do anything now. That's right. So what is
self-definition if not a form of radical liberty and not a simply a voluntary decision of I'm
I think it's really important to understand that there's a wide range of positions about
about gender identification or what some would insist is sex. Identification identifies the
sex. So I don't want to anymore at least make a distinction between sex as somehow natural and
gender as somehow cultural and social. I think sex assignment is already political. It's already
the act of social institutions. It's a way of organizing our bodies at the very beginning of
time. So sex assignment is already the work of gender in my framework. You don't have to accept
my framework. But I think for many people the sex assignment they receive is deeply right and true
and absolutely incontrovertible and they would never change it and they kind of like it or they
really like it and they're living it out and it's all good. Okay but that's a relationship to a sex
assignment. Happens to be a very harmonious one. It's like yeah I was called a girl and now I'm a
girl and then the girl is great and I'm working with this category and I love it. Okay good.
Go live. Enjoy. I feel like you are channeling every member of the Spice Girls at once for that.
We really really were. Well but it's also kind of it's always been amazing to me how people like do
their girl thing. It's like wow. You know and I'm still kind of a child. I think I was and I was a
child ethnographer. It's like wow. Look at these people. They're like doing their gender in this
way. It's like so amazing. It's like wow. It's like a boy. It's like boy. It's like doing this boy
thing. It's like wow. And I was like you know I was I was in this ethnographic you know interval
like like not sure not sure can do either one very well you know so it's but it's interesting.
But then look for some people it's very fundamental like this was never right
and for some it's like well this was right for a while then it really wasn't right
or this was okay for a while and then it was not right or I'm able to change this category and the
expectations that it makes of me and still stay within it and others are like I can't stay within
this category. It's unlivable to me so I think what we're asking about is what is the threshold of
livability for people and why wouldn't we respect that. If somebody says this this is not livable
and this is and this is my chance for a livable life why would we say oh no no sorry you stay
in the unlivable category and deprive you and we will deprive you of a livable life no we
I think if we're not cruel people we accept that somebody is telling us what's livable and what's
unlivable but do we call that a choice it's like well it may be that the the deepest sense of
who one is as a sexed being or as a gender if we're using that language is not fully formed by us
right we find ourselves feeling a certain way we find ourselves understanding ourselves in a certain
way we come to grips with our sense of reality and it's we're formed you know we're formed by
many different social familial institutional powers but we also form ourselves or we come to
understand ourselves and it's at that point that we do make a choice but it doesn't mean it's a
choice from the very beginning. I mean thinking about you know something that you said in your
book is that no one individual or class owns a gender category so you can't say what Beyonce does.
I'm so glad you said that. That was such an easy derailment it really threw me because I just wanted
to be like she's doing country music now guys and I really feel we need to discuss it.
Taken over she's taken over. It's so easy to distract me so easy but like you know no one
individual class owns gender categories apart from Beyonce with the exception to every philosophical
rule. We are very very clear. Does the same apply to race because when I saw Rachel Dolezal I had
this instinctive sense that there's something wrong here but I don't own the category of race
right no individual black person or class right socially constructed class of black people own
the category of race. Rachel Dolezal saying well look I'm identifying as a black woman I live my
life as a black woman my appearance is such that people are treating me as a black woman.
Is it logically coherent to have different rules for gender as opposed to race was it coherent
for me to feel very differently about Rachel Dolezal than I intuitively think about gender
identity. Well first of all I agree with you that what Rachel Dolezal did and what people white
people do who want to capitalize on cross-racial definition identification is is completely
objectionable but they're not exactly parallel as I was just saying you know gender is formed
it's very complicated. Race as a category race as a classification has a different history
and anybody who works in intersectional feminism would know that you don't tell the history of
gender in the exact same way you tell the history of race you actually look to see
how these categories are intersecting in specific sites and through historical practices.
But I don't think that they are parallel because I don't even accept the idea that you just arbitrarily
announce what your gender is there's a formation process there but racial identification is so
intensely a matter of interpolation like how you have been born into the world in and through a set
of racial categories and formed as part of a community or part of a demographic classification
and how you've been treated how your self-understanding emerges so we need to tell the specific history
of that in order to understand why what Dolezal did was so inappropriate and wrong and she wasn't
I think when this question gets posed in this way it assumes like oh I'm just going to choose
a new sex because I'm going to get some kind of publicity for this like a fully
volunteeristic notion so I neither think of trans reassignment or self definition as
radically arbitrary and nor do I think it is possible or right for that to happen that for
that particular kind of volunteeristic self self-interested claim on blackness
I don't think that's ever justified she didn't have that history she didn't come into the world
that way she has not been interpolated she has not lived through the history of that
interpolation in the way that black people actually have and that's a violation of that
history but when we're talking about the history of a trans person well they have been violated
by categories the wrong ones and they're trying to emerge from violation so let's think about
where and how do we locate violation in both of those scenes I mean to take it away from Rachel
perhaps locate it in someone who is racialized in a way which marginalizes them
you talk about the threshold of livability for lots of people of color they'd say well this
racial category is a violation of my humanity how it's been made and how I'm made to live in it
the way society treats me it is a violation but the only thing there is to do is to sort of strain
at what it might mean to be South Asian to be Muslim to be black to be indigenous and again
it's sort of saying you know is it okay to have just different rules for it like different rules
different pathways to go down when you are at that threshold of livability that is just different
for race and for gender well it is although you know
it's very funny that we're involved we're involved in a a discussion about analogy
because race and gender are lived together like gender is never unmarked by race race is never
unmarked by gender and we know this and yet analytically we set up this kind of hypothesis
which forces us into a kind of separation that's problematic but just to stay with your example I
mean isn't the lived historical reality that there are people who are like don't racialize me I'm just
a human treat me like a human those are others is like don't racialize me in this way this is the
way I am participating in and living out my my racial affinity identity community
I may be straining against an interpolation that I feel like is falsifying or discriminatory but I
am also reproducing it in a way that I find to be affirmative and actually making connections and
coalitions among people of color or across even larger alliances so we see that this is all lived
out differently I don't know if that answers your question but I mean that's the norm that's the
descriptive fact I mean moving on a little bit in the book you distinguish between the demonization
of so-called gender ideology and legitimate fears like forced migration climate change economic
inequality so on and so forth and an imaginary thoughtful right winger might say well look
actually fearing the breakdown of social reproduction is a legitimate fear you know you
look at what happens in countries which are richer which have got you know more rights for women in
terms of reproduction and the labor market you get falling birth rates and so without the sort of
coercive stick of gender roles you don't get babies I mean how would you respond to this
well that is that is Victor Orban's argument right but he's also really worried not just that
he won't get babies but that they won't be reproducing the nation in its purity which is why he's
he's opposed to miscegenation so I think we actually have to think about how the emphasis on
birth rates is linked to nationalism and also the the the the war against migration right so
the same people were born as one Maloney is another who want to reproduce the nation and want to
have control over social reproduction in that way are tend to be both racist and homophobic and
trans both I'm sorry not both but all of these things are working together there's an anti-migrant
pro-heteronormative family anti-gay lesbian family in most cases not Israel because if you're
reproducing the demographic advantage for Jewish people you they will give you technology
so you know I think we have to put it in that context I'm I'm not worried about falling birth
rates I think the earth could probably handle that I mean is there a way to talk about demographic
aging without falling into as you say these very homophobic very transphobic and often very
nationalist and racist discourses yes well give me an example okay so for instance if I'm looking
at the UK and I go okay we have an aging population my friends yes we have a economy which is then
going to require much more taxation of a working age population to support people who are aging
so a way to talk about that and talk about the I mean to put it really crudely the sort of needs
of the labor market and how it relates to social reproduction without falling into something which
is inherently yeah like a patriarch or forcing people into these categories well might not fit
with yeah I think I think opening the door to further migration would be a great idea
emptying your indefinite detention camps yeah I think that would be good you'd have labor
more people seems like a great idea I'm with you
um you you in the book you you connect this war on so-called gender ideology to fascism to
climate catastrophe and saying these are not things that you can separate off from one another these
are all working to support one another and then when it comes to what is to be done about it you
talk about developing a counter-imaginary and I suppose I'm wondering what is a counter-imaginary
yeah what's what we're doing right now we're developing one together
I don't think it can defeat victor or ban though we're just getting started
but I mean to talk about you know what we're doing now and to be to be harsh on it like
it's okay not sort of this is a self-selecting group of people yes but we are interested in this
we all go out in the world it's a it's the sort of um the ambition of political activity
to sort of get self-selecting groups of people to change how they talk and think and the hope that
it will change how other people talk and think because the other side they've got newspapers
I know a ton of money think tanks I know are we bringing vibes to a gunfight
I hear what you're saying well let me take a couple of steps back and um
um quit my my vocation as a as a as a comedian although it was always an alternative path for
me I do I do regret not having taken it sometimes especially last week when the media was so rough
on me okay um here's here this is what I think um uh first of all I just think it needs to be
known that the anti-gender ideology movement as it works throughout Eastern Europe Latin America
parts of Africa East Asia certainly um uh um uh Russia as well as we know that it is not just
focused on trans it's focused on gay and lesbian rights gay and lesbian parenting and families
it's focused on women women's reproductive rights it's focused on gender-based violence wanting to
undermine um international protections against gender-based violence um uh as for instance encoded
in the Istanbul convention okay many countries have have now under the influence of the anti-gender
ideology movement withdrawn from that um uh from that convention including Turkey
okay um so um so this this movement is not just focused on trans it certainly is but
it's actually sex education books books for children um activism lesbian gay trans feminist
activism in Russia elsewhere in Hungary very rough going Poland's opening a little bit more now
we should ask about their mobilizations and why that's happening in the way that it is it's really
exciting um but I I think we have to remember um that this right wing um move it's a movement but
it's also a trend within several right wing movements which is a distinction that this
is targeting all these people who are arguing with each other here okay we think we're on different
sides of the debate but we're being targeted by the exact same people and we would be very foolish
to let them target us and unify us as a target um better than we unify ourselves as a movement of
resistance and social transformation so I this book is trying to produce a more global
framework for some of these local debates so that we might remind ourselves what the stakes are
and if you look at in Latin America for instance in Chile or Argentina the feminist movements are
saying we're against violence and femicide we're so against um the killing of trans people or
against the abandonment and and um and injury of indigenous people uh and the killing of indigenous
people we we actually are seeing that the same powers um or an interlocking set of powers are
hurting a wide range of people in very similar ways and we need to bond together right and that's
what an expansive coalition is so if you ask me about a counter-imaginary I want to say let's
look at the expansive coalitions and see how they're operating how they represent themselves how they
persuade broader publics and neo-nomenos I mean you know they went into churches they went into
factories they they helped unionize the the women janitors they you know they went into
um a wide number of communities where it was not clear that they would be welcome both to listen
and to also revise their analysis on the basis of what they heard oh great idea and um and to and to
make broader alliances which is why they could have a million people on the street just I think 10
days ago so I think um the counter-imaginary is with us but it has to do with being willing to
be part of alliances where we don't love each other we don't want to have dinner together
you know we we're not going to be reading the same books maybe some of the same books that'll
be good if we could have a reading list for for a potential future alliance um you know alliance
is not love alliance can be really rough but right now it seems to me given how I do think that there
fascist passions being stoked like migrants are going to come take your job the great replacement
theory trans people are going to come take your status as a woman away trans people are going to
de-sex you you're not going to be able to be a male or a female anymore they're going to destroy your
family um they're going to they're going to insert the devil into your children's curriculum rather
than god's word um you know we actually need to get smarter about how this is working because all
those people who are now afraid oh race gender ethnic studies uh migrants trans people those fears
help support increasingly authoritarian regimes that promise order authority or return to a
time past when everything was ordered and you knew who you were and what your life was and your
livelihood was secured now when I say your livelihood was secured we see
a lot of people are afraid that their livelihood is no longer secured most young people I know
don't believe their livelihood is secured neoliberalism has devastated um so many uh
peoples ways of living and ways of working forced them from their homes and their jobs or
made life increasingly precarious so people are made nervous they're made nervous by climate
change by war escalating as we speak if you as a right-wing political operator if you reach into
that fear and say guess what the reason you're so afraid the reason you're so anxious the reason
that the future is unclear is gender or race or migration you produce you you're able to
reorganize and stoke those fears and anxieties in in a direction that moves against those minorities
or against those populations in favor of a really strong state and that promises you a reactionary
and impossible dream of return so I think we have to get wise that this is happening and
for my friends on the left I would also say I would not dismiss gender as some distraction or
problem or mere identity politics that's getting in the way of a broader left coalition no no
there is no broader left coalition without having this at its center because the attack on gender
is an attack on democracy it's also an attack on education so we should not be letting them
you know assign us a tertiary place in the hierarchy of oppression I'm just not willing to do that
but that's all we have time for and I want to say thank you all for coming this morning and
thank you so much Judith for joining us it's been a delight
