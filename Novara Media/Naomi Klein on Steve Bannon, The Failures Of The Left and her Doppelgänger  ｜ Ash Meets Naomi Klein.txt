We will need each other and we, you know,
I do believe that every, you know,
victory for the fascist right is also a story
of division, sectarianism,
failure to make a strategic alliances
on the anti-fascist left.
And we're on the, we are on the knife edge.
We are just on the knife edge.
We can't afford to destroy each other.
When we were all locked down and isolating,
conspiracy theorists went on the march.
The emergence of anti-vaccine scaremongering
coupled with virulent antisemitism
was disconcerting for all of us.
But it was even more nuts for Naomi Klein,
journalist and author of The Shock Doctrine,
who found herself constantly getting mixed up
with Naomi Wolfe, another author and academic.
Klein found herself being drawn into a strange mirror world
as she tracked her doppelganger's journey
from feminist academic and liberal darling
to gun-toting anti-vaxxer
palling around with Steve Bannon.
What was it about COVID that strengthened the far right
and how did all of us create doppelgangers
of ourselves online?
Stay tuned to find out as I talk to Naomi Klein
for Downstream.
So when did it stop being funny
that you were being confused for Naomi Wolfe?
I mean, I still find it funny sometimes to be honest,
especially because it still happens.
In fact, I was doing a TV interview in the States last week
and the host had to do a retake.
No.
And he didn't realize that he'd done it.
And I was like, you have to stop now and redo that
because you just called me Naomi Wolfe.
Oh, my God, you should have kept it in.
I'm not going to name him, but he knows who he is.
Yeah.
I think, I mean, to be honest, it's always been a little cringy.
Starting from the very beginning,
I start the book with this story about being at Occupy Wall
Street and being in a public loo and hearing
a couple of demonstrators talking
about an article that Naomi Klein had written.
And oh, my God, she doesn't understand our demands
or our movement.
And obviously, that was lower stakes.
I mean, they were talking about an article by Naomi Wolfe.
Did you call from inside the store like, sorry,
you've got the wrong?
No, I mean, I froze flashbacks to high school,
mean girls like, what have I written?
And then as I listened more, I recognized the articles
that they were discussing and knew that I had not written it.
And so I just very casually came out and made eye contact
in the mirror and said, I think you're talking about Naomi
Wolfe.
Words I have had to say many times since then.
So that was 2011.
But even then, I mean, it was funny.
And I would entertain my friends over drinks
with these sorts of stories.
They couldn't get enough of it.
But I mean, I would also get, I'm
going to be talking to Andrew Marr later today.
And I'm going to remind him that the last time he interviewed me,
it was on the BBC, and he referred to me as Naomi Campbell.
Naomi Campbell?
I was like, I'm sorry to disappoint you.
You broke so many barriers in fashion.
Exactly.
That one is harder because then I feel like the audience is really
quite disappointed when I come out.
How do you feel about your feud with tower banks?
Yeah, the whole blood diamond thing.
You really, I mean, in hindsight, except for most blood diamonds,
is really poor form for the author of No Logo.
So there's something about the name Naomi
that people do have trouble with.
But no.
So I mean, even back to Occupy Wall Street,
it was the stakes were lower.
But it still bothered me just for sort of niche reasons
because in that particular context,
she had written an article where if you're,
I'm sure you remember from Occupy Wall Street,
there was a very, you know, there was a decision
not to have a list of demands that politicians could just meet
and everyone would go home.
It was much, you know, it had a deeper critique
of the system than that.
And what Wolf had done in the article
that they were upset about was claim
that she had divined the demands of Occupy Wall Street.
And she came up with a list based on, yes,
based on a random assortment of online communications
that she'd had.
So even though that was like pretty low stakes,
for me, it was quite a cringe
because I do try to be pretty careful
not to do that sort of thing.
I mean, it was one of the things
that really struck me about the book,
which is that in one of the early chapters,
when you're talking about being mixed up for Naomi Wolf,
you sort of really strive to talk about
the rigor of your journalistic work
and the depth of the research and the scrutiny
that you apply to your own writing.
Do you feel a bit defensive about this mix up
and that you feel that you've got to put all this distance
between the two of you?
Well, I mean, if anything, I think I've put less distance
between the two of us.
Like I probably cemented the connection forever.
I'll never be able to escape it.
But I do think that it is important
to make a distinction between
what investigative journalism does,
what rigorous research is,
how we make sure that we don't go to press
with speculation.
Because honestly, I think a lot of people
are confused about that.
And part of what she does,
and she's just a case study of a broader movement,
which is this conspiracy culture.
And I don't call it conspiracy theory
because there really isn't a coherent theory.
It's just jumping around more of,
she's more of a conspiracy influencer than she is a theorist.
I don't think it's really fair to theory to call it,
theorists, because the theories are constantly
contradicting each other, right?
One minute, COVID is a bio weapon,
cooked up by the Chinese to depopulate the West.
And the next minute, it's nothing, don't worry about it.
Don't even put on a mask.
So like, you presumably would have to choose,
yeah, between the two.
So, but there is something about the fact
that there are people who consume
these things interchangeably, right?
And I describe this as a doppelganger of journalism
because it uses a bunch of the conventions,
breaking scoop, like, I've got the papers,
smoking gun, all of this.
But because it's within the attention economy
and the need to be first out of the gate
to get the clicks, to get the clout,
you leap over all the guardrails.
So yeah, I spent some time in the book
just sort of explaining what we try to do.
And I, whether it's investigative journalism
or academic research to check our facts
based on the idea that facts still matter.
But it isn't so much about me putting distance between her
because it's a doppelganger book.
And doppelganger books are, you know,
you have to see yourself in the mirror of your doppelganger
or you have failed.
Do you ever wonder who the mad woman in the attic is?
Like, is it her or is it me?
Absolutely, yes.
There's been uncomfortable winces of recognition
throughout this journey.
I mean, the moment when Naomi Wolfe is on BBC Radio
and her book Outrages just gets a tractor driven through it.
So it turns out that she made this reading error
and it meant that what was supposed to be
a spectacular revelation was exactly wrong.
I felt such a pang of empathy when that happened
because I thought, oh my God, that could be me one day.
And it was this horrible fear of seeing something
that you've always had nightmares
about happening to someone else.
And then you want to put distance between them and you
by going, ha, ha, ha, how could you be so stupid?
How could this happen to you?
I mean, did you ever have those moments
of like empathetic recognition with her where you go,
oh God, that could have been me?
I mean, it's every writer's worst nightmare.
And I, I mean, it's a little hard for me
to just feel straight empathy
because a lot of people thought it was me
who made that mistake.
So like, you know, I only found out that it happened
because my feed was filled with people going,
thoughts and prayers to Naomi.
I was like, oh no, what has she done now?
And I'm always having to kind of reverse engineer
whatever the scandal is based on people
either literally thinking it's me
or sort of sending mock sympathy.
But, you know, I, like, as you know,
in the book I have a little, maybe a little sort
of half-jokey equation about not only her,
but many figures who, who, you know, we've,
many of us have had conversations
like whatever happened to that person.
I thought, I thought I knew who they were.
I thought I could trust them.
And now suddenly they're palling around with Tucker Carlson
or Elon Musk or, you know,
whatever happened to Phil in the blanks.
And so I, I had this equation
that might not be perfect for every person,
but it is narcissism, bracket grandiosity,
times social media addiction,
which you and I have discussed.
I don't want that mirror being held up to me.
I don't want to see the faces in this.
Plus midlife crisis,
which you don't have to worry about for a while.
I got 10 years.
Divided by public shaming equals right wing meltdown.
So I think that that, you know,
I think that she should have been held accountable
for those, for those major errors and outrages.
And in general, book publishing, you know,
doesn't fact check as much as they should.
I always, you know, I'm lucky to be one of the few writers
who can afford to pay my own fact checkers,
but I pay my fact checkers out of, out of my book advance,
you know, I pay my research assistants
and then a whole separate process
of going back over every single fact
because my first book made me a target, right?
I couldn't afford it for my first book,
but after that book, I, you know,
I've had the fear of God to not be in that situation
where a reporter discovers that you have a huge error
in the middle of your book
and the whole thing gets discredited.
So, but, so I think accountability is good,
but what happened after that was just a disgusting pile
on online where people were, I mean, I think as you say,
like putting that distance between them and her,
because everybody, it's everybody's worst nightmare
and just having a lot of fun shaming her
and turning her into a spectacle.
And I think that that probably nudged her a little bit
in the direction, I mean,
and I think she should be held accountable
for these terrible decisions she's made
to align herself with some of the most dangerous men
on the planet, but, you know, I don't think it's great
that people, you know, are so cruel to each other online.
That's my radical position today.
I mean, you're talking about the word accountability.
In some ways, it's easier to talk about accountability
for Naomi Wolfe because she's this individual
and we've seen this descent into fact-free conspiracism,
but the responsibility for cruelty online
is a lot more diffuse and we can more easily dodge it.
Yeah, and, you know, the reason why I thought
this might be a fun idea for a book and it got less fun.
You know, there's, I have a quote early on in the book
from Philip Roth about, from his really quite wonderful
doppelganger novel, Operation Shylock,
which is about Philip Roth, a character called Philip Roth
who has a doppelganger called Philip Roth,
creating all kinds of mayhem.
And he says, it's too ridiculous to take seriously
and too serious to be ridiculous.
And when I started this, it was more on the ridiculous side
of the ledger and then as things went on
and she got closer and closer to Steve Bannon,
started engaging in election denial,
started taking pictures of herself with her gun,
started taking posting pictures of her new,
not so new anymore, but her husband is a private detective
slash mercenary who likes to post pictures of himself
doing target practice and so on.
So it's gotten more serious than ridiculous
just because it is part of a broader fascist surge globally.
So, yeah.
So you talked about that seriousness
and that kind of quite scary descent into fascism.
How can you stop people laughing?
When does the comedy stop
and the sense of urgency kick in?
Well, this is why I think that that sentence
is really resonant because I feel like people have
that same feeling about Trump a lot of the time,
or at least they did before where it was just like
unclear and Boris Johnson and Duterte,
I mean, these sort of buffoonish figures.
Berlusconi, I think, was the original, you know.
Bolsonaro's the only one who's not at all funny?
I know.
I mean, he is funny in that he just kept getting COVID.
It was like sideshow Bob stuffing on the rakes.
Like it wasn't comedy of his making,
it was kind of God's comedy.
Exactly.
But he didn't seem to be playing up the character.
But yeah, I think, yeah, at what point do we stop?
I think we're still trying to figure out how to respond
to the weight of our historical moment
and frankly failing most days, right?
I think there are flashes, I don't know about you,
where I feel like, okay, we're getting close to touching
just how consequential the decisions we're making are
in these years of climate breakdown, surging, fascism,
border violence, just oligarchic concentration of,
I mean, wealth, it's a lot, it's a lot.
And so, I mean, this, I think the through line of the book
and the reason why I thought that doppelganger doubles,
like the through line of the book is less her
than it is the way in which we create doubles of ourselves.
And our groups respond to each other
in these sorts of mirror world ways.
We react to one another rather than behave
based on legible principles a lot of the time.
And my analysis is that all of it is about not looking
at what we need to look at, right?
That the third section of the book is called The Shadowlands.
And I think that whether we're staring into our phones
looking at our digital doubles, the way we create
these little doppelgangers of ourselves to represent us,
which is why I thought it was interesting
that I lost control over my digital identity during COVID.
And I thought, well, this is an interesting way in,
or the way we sort of project all that we want to distance
ourselves from onto the other as if we are the ones
who are really married to truth and facts
and facing the weight of our moment when we all know
that we are distracting ourselves endlessly
and looking away endlessly.
And there's more than one way to look away.
Conspiracy culture plays that role for a lot of people.
It's just a decision to divorce from any recognizable,
shared reality and just make up your own facts,
make up your own reality.
But one of the things that I was reflecting on
as I was reading this book was my own career in the media
because when I started out, I was always paired up
against really old white guys.
And that allowed me to have a sort of brand identity
as young, female, brown, left-wing, disrupter.
Oh my God, what is she going to do next?
And then over time, I started getting partnered
with young right-wing women of color.
Oh, interesting.
So it was like they'll put me up against my own wario.
And I then suddenly felt the sense of nausea
where I was like, have I contributed
to creating this category of right-wing talking head
where they want the right-wing to play against type?
And I've participated in the commodification of identity
to the extent that it becomes very powerful for the right.
I mean, I felt quite kind of disoriented by it.
And I guess I was wondering,
when you're looking at your conspiratorial doppelganger,
do you ever feel this little sense of responsibility going,
did I make this in some way?
Like it's not just a mirror.
Did I create this mirror somehow?
You know, I think it is always worth interrogating, right?
And sometimes those winces can be really productive
because it pushes you to think about what is it that you're doing
and what parts of it are most important to you, right?
And if it's an easy to doppelganger part of you,
then you might want to lean into some of the other parts
because you aren't just playing an identity game.
You know, that's not the way I perceive your role in the media.
You're making arguments and you're representing a set of values and beliefs
and they can doppelgang your identity.
But I think it's a lot harder to do that when you're making arguments
that are genuine, challenged power.
And so I did interrogate, you know, it wasn't only Wolf
who was describing the book as a kind of fact-free remix
of the shock doctrine specifically.
And here I'm not saying it was deliberate,
but there was a way in which, I mean, I still,
every tour stop, every time I log on,
I hear people who are furious that I wrote the shock doctrine
and have failed to recognize that the vaccines
are the biggest shock doctrine in world history,
not for the reasons that I believe they are
because there should never have been patents.
And this was an opportunity for massive illegitimate enrichment.
And we should have, you know,
they should have never been patented in the first place,
but because they were violating bodily sovereignty
and, you know, they believe that there has been a genocide
that has been covered up by the quote-unquote elites.
There's some graffiti near my house, whereas there's anti-vaxxer
and then next to it, I love my sperm
and then like a big picture of sperm.
And I was like...
Yeah, so that's the shock doctrine I missed.
You're really low on sperm, you really...
But no, I think I did feel that when I started to hear people
using the shock doctrine to sell, you know,
what I considered to be largely made up theories
about how public health measures were an attempt by the CCP
and Fauci and Gates to bring in Chinese social credit
or whatever it was.
I mean, the great reset, all of that.
Like to be clear, I think there have been real examples
of what I would call the shock doctrine
and disaster capitalism under cover of COVID.
I'm very concerned about them.
The NHS has been attacked under cover of COVID.
I live in Canada, the same thing has happened
to our public health care system.
A lot of the attacks on the schools about COVID measures
are really just attacks on public schools
by the same people who always attack public schools
under cover of emergency.
But there is this kind of doppelganger
of the shock doctrine out there.
And I think for a while it made me less willing
to talk about that because I couldn't figure out
how to talk about the shock doctrine,
how to talk about my concerns about Bill Gates,
which were not fantastical but very provable
about what he was doing, providing cover for the drug companies
to keep their patents in place and so on.
Because it was just getting all, it was just a swirl of Bill Gates
tracking implants and I was just getting,
like the algorithms were starting to confuse me with Wolf
and I was just like, we're just a mess of Naomi
is talking about Bill Gates.
So, but I think the worst thing you can do
is let that doppelganger experience silence you.
I regret not talking more about the patents during this period.
I regret any way in which the left has ceded territory
to the fake populist right by not going after corporate power
and not making the connections with the logics of capitalism
because that's just such a gift to the Steve Bannons of the world
who just suck it all up or Georgia Malone and then twisted
and turned it into transphobia and xenophobia
and an incredibly malevolent agenda.
I mean, is there a way to sort of reclaim the integrity
of left-wing ideas without it being about
insisting on your intellectual property rights?
Because the strength of the left has always come
from the dissemination of ideas in a very open way.
The communist manifesto was meant to be passed
hand-to-hand from worker to worker.
And then, in some ways, shock doctrine being appropriated
by a conspiracy theorist is testament to its success
and its meaning and its power as an idea.
So, how do you navigate that as someone who's on the left?
I mean, I agree.
I mean, I think the left should be taking popular education
as seriously as it originally was with the original pamphleteers
and the idea of doing this kind of popular education,
in part because the alternative was conspiracy theory.
I mean, I have a section in the book
that looks at antisemitism as the socialism of fools
and in part looks at the history of Marxist thought
as in part being a history of a whole bunch of Jews
banging their head against the brick wall of history saying,
it's not the Jews that are the result of your pain
or causing your pain, but it's actually this system.
So, I don't think we should, any of us,
should embrace our ideas being distorted
and turned into like a warped mirror of themselves.
But is there a way to do that without going, it's mine?
Like, this is my idea.
I don't think it's about intellectual property.
I think it's about having a robust left
that is doing system analysis.
And I think that when that doesn't happen,
conspiracy culture swirls because the center isn't holding,
because there's so much suffering
and because all of the promises that capitalism has made
about the meritocracy and if you work hard,
you're going to succeed and you'll be able to climb this ladder,
it's falling apart and people know that.
And our education system doesn't explain what capitalism is.
It says it's all about sunshine and big max and freedom
and getting the rewards that you deserve.
And so, when the system fails,
people are really, really vulnerable
to somebody pulling them aside and going,
it's actually the Jews or it's actually the CCP
or it's this meeting once a year.
And so, the need for that robust system analysis
is urgent because I think it's the only force
that can drain power from this surging authoritarianism.
If they were just taking the ideas
and putting them to good use, then-
You mean like fine.
Fine, yes, always.
It doesn't matter if you get credit or not,
you want them to disseminate.
The problem is, I listened to hundreds of hours of Steve Bannon
to write this book, unfortunately.
And the most chilling moments was when I would hear him
sounding like what the left used to sound like
and doesn't really sound like anymore
because there is not as much of a anti-corporate left
as there used to be, let alone an anti-capitalist left.
It's much more partisan and reactive.
It's part of the appeal of the likes of Steve Bannon
and the very reactionary authoritarian right
is that they're saying, here's how to live
and it will make you a better person,
a stronger person, a smarter person, a more worthy person.
Whereas the left, we've retreated a lot into like,
you do what you want to do,
except there is no you do what you want to do
because if you are perceived in the wrong way,
particularly online, people will jump down your throat.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you know, Bannon is different than some of the other people
who are more like, this is how to live.
Like he's less of a lifestyle guy,
like he's not Jordan Peterson or-
I don't think anyone goes,
how do I get the Steve Bannon look?
Exactly, no.
He is more of an organizer.
I mean, he is the guy who is organizing,
the takeover of your local Republican party,
your local school board, get those books banned.
He's very deliberately building a political coalition
that he calls MAGA Plus, which is,
the plus is women who they haven't been able
to really lock down enough to win the last couple of elections.
And so in the same way that he peeled away
some Democratic voting working class guys
who were pissed off about having voted for, you know,
Democrats three, four times who promised
that they were going to renegotiate trade deals
and then voted for Trump because he said he was going to do it.
And it wasn't the only reason why people voted for Trump,
but it doesn't need to be that many people
who you peel away with these messages.
He now sees that opportunity with who he calls the warrior moms.
So it's interesting because I definitely think
that there is an appeal around,
I'm going to help you learn how to live
that certain people are offering on the right.
But I think with Bannon, what he's offering is a political program.
He's offering a plan.
It's an activist space.
His slogan is action, action, action.
And he doesn't, he refers to his listeners as the war room posse.
And he makes them feel like they're not just listening or watching.
They are part of his army.
But it's that thing, which is, I want David from accounts
to feel like Ajax, the conqueror.
And maybe it is difficult to draw the line
between political organizing,
lapping, and entertainment.
Andrew Tate, there's a Andrew Tate group chat called the war room,
which is, again, very similar.
Trying to say, like, we're going to build you up
and empower you if you just do these things.
Yeah. And I think that this is where the left is at something of a disadvantage,
because it takes more time and it's more complicated
to build the kind of mass power that has any kind of chance
of standing up to the sort of consolidated wealth
that we're talking about, whereas Bannon is perfectly happy
to just have a plan to get back into the White House.
And so there is a plan, and it is take over politics at every level,
peel off part of your opposition by using all of this COVID residual anger
and pivoting it in the way that we've been talking about.
So what is the left plan?
Like, I mean, we can diagnose, we can do systems analysis,
but that's just going to make people feel helpless for the most part,
because then they're going to better understand that as an individual,
there's nothing that they can do.
They can only stand up to these systems in mass collective action.
If there is a conspiracy and there's just five guys
who are responsible for all of the suffering in the world,
then like the bumper sticker says, make the Nuremberg code great again.
Let's bring them up on war crimes trials.
That's part of their plan is a sort of a fantasy of justice.
That's also at the heart of QAnon is like there's going to be a great storm
and all of the bad people are going to get arrested
and they're going to be brought up on charges and there will be justice
because we will replace them with the good people.
Well, the observation that January 6th was people dressing up and storming the Capitol.
It was like a sort of Comic-Con element of it as well.
You get to live this fantasy for a day, except it's real.
Yeah, and this is the Bannon playbook.
He wants people to inhabit their avatars.
And so many of these figures are very, very skilled from the world
of entertainment and reality television.
So Bannon has worked in Hollywood, he's worked in video games.
Trump obviously, reality television, Tate as well, former reality show star.
The only one who doesn't really have this history is Peterson.
Joe Rogan also, former reality show.
Didn't he voice come at the frog?
What?
Didn't he voice come at the frog?
He's the only one who's just a natural at this.
I always feel as a Canadian, I need to apologize when I'm abroad.
If I had to stop politics for every breath out of it, we'd be here all day.
But so the left proposition is not just we're out here making a better argument
about what is really driving mass misery.
We also have to connect that analysis with a credible organizing strategy
that shatters the sense that there's nothing you can do about these huge systems,
because it's a hell of a lot easier to take on a cabal than it is to take on a system.
And that's why, if anything has made me feel a little bit optimistic in recent days,
it's been the UAW going out on strike, the United Auto Workers in the States,
and the fact that there's a great new leader of that union, Sean Fane,
who was an insurgent candidate.
And he's on the news because he's taken on the big three auto makers,
and he's doing real left populism.
And he is saying these companies have recorded record profits,
and they've given themselves massive wages, and our workers haven't been able to keep up
with the cost of living increases, and we're going to get them.
That just having somebody out there who has a clear left analysis and a plan about what to
do about it, we are going to disrupt your assembly lines, I feel like it makes the
bannons of the world sort of shrivel up and die, because they are not die, but
they can only sell the counterfeit if the real thing isn't on offer or even in the public sphere.
So when words and action momentarily are married in these moments of mass worker action,
or the debt collective, or tenant organizing, or any of the ways that people are finding collective
power, that's going to do more to drain the power of right-wing conspiracy culture than an
army of fact checkers and content moderators. I mean, I was thinking about one of the advantages
that The Right has, which is they've got this screen-based ecosystem, whether it's YouTube or
accounts on Twitter, where they're bringing together a community and making it lonelier
all the time. So I was reminded of that bit where Anthony says of Cleopatra,
she makes hungry where most she satisfies. So it's satisfying this need for social connection,
because it's not the real thing, you're getting hungry and hungry all the time.
How does the left draw a balance between contesting these spaces in a legacy media or
social media ecology, but also just being in the flesh space where we can touch each other
and make eye contact and engage with each other as human beings and not digital avatars?
Yeah, I mean, that quote is so interesting because I feel like back to my first book,
No Logo, which I wrote before the explosion of personal branding and some of the things that
I revisit here, a lot of what I did in that book was track the way in which the first mega
lifestyle brands like Nike and Apple and Starbucks were co-opting revolutionary rhetoric,
putting Martin Luther King on Apple ads. And yes, this is before your time, but it was weird.
And there was all of this unease, all of the iconography of the 1960s,
the anti-Vietnam War movement was suddenly in Nike ad. And Gandhi was from the grave shilling
for Apple. And on the one hand, you could say, oh, nothing means anything anymore,
but that wasn't my feeling. My feeling was like in the 90s where we had been told that nobody
liked left ideas. I thought it was really exciting that these companies with all of their market
research had found that what people actually wanted was revolution. And obviously, they weren't
going to get it from their running shoes or their laptops. So there would be that constant hunger
cycle that you're using much more literary references for. So for capitalism, that's great
because you'll just have to keep shopping. You'll get like a little hit and then you'll
crash again and you'll have to shop again in order to get that feeling.
I hate myself for the way in which I instinctively scroll through clothing when I feel sad.
And it makes me feel worse and like, why am I doing this? It's just like my classic
depression activities. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Horrible.
Well, and it's helpful to just be aware that you're doing it because you're sad or you're
doing it because you're insecure and people shop. The times when you have the highest spike
in consumption is when people are becoming parents for the first time because they're
panicked and they don't have people who will help them figure out how to be parents anymore
because if we don't live in communities, we tend to be isolated. And so you just think,
if I were to just get this $1,000 bouncy chair, everything would be fine. But I remember that
from when I just, I mean, never have I been more of a consumer drone than in those days.
I mean, was it a fear that like bypassed your own critical awareness of the thing you were
doing? It was just... Well, it was really useful to me to see that statistic, like that this is the
time when consumption is higher than at any point in our lives and not just because you
need a whole bunch of new things. It's because it's well beyond what you need and it's just fear.
Yeah, it's just fear. No, it keeps it in check a little bit. It doesn't keep it completely in
check obviously, but it's still helpful to know. I mean, you were talking about the
symbols of revolution, language of revolution being co-optized in the 90s capitalism.
I didn't know that Nike had used Martin Luther King, but the thing is...
Apple used Martin Luther King and Nike used a whole bunch of Vietnam War anthems.
Oh my God. Because then the thing that it made me think of was in this very direct way,
Nike revealing that it partnered with Colin Kaepernick all that time when he was being
blacklisted by the NFL. Because I remember the conversations going on at that time, which
for lots of people on the anti-racist level, lots of black people was a feeling of like,
well, at least someone's standing with us during this time. But there was also this
queasiness of going, but you're doing it to sell your shoes. I mean, how did you make
sense of moments like that? Yeah, I mean, I was teaching a course at the time, so it was helpful.
I was teaching a course called The Corporate Self, an undergraduate course, so we were sort of
processing all of that Nike ads in real time. I mean, it's interesting because it's not unlike
the people's reaction to the Barbie movie, right? I don't know, have you? Where it's like, oh wow,
all these feminist critiques are in here and they keep talking about patriarchy. But like,
ultimately, I thought it, I really fucking hated the self-consciously woke dialogue. Like,
there's this one moment where the teenage girl was like, white savior Barbie, and I was like,
it's like they took Tumblr from 2015 and shook it upside down all over the script. Like, it was just
so focus-grouped and calculated to get everybody turned me off. It really turned me off. Yeah.
And ultimately, just to be a boring lefty eco-feminist, it is an advertisement. It's an
extraordinarily historically good advertisement for a plastic doll. And even if you love the movie,
maybe especially if you love the movie, you should know that that will lead to materially this
selling of many, many, many more plastic dolls. And so its success is a huge failure for the earth.
But at any rate, we were talking about them doing their market research for us.
And the co-optation. Well, so yeah, I think you can get really down about the ways that these ideas
are being co-opted by the right, or you can be like, wow, these really are popular ideas.
We should be making more of them. And one of the things that's been, I think, nice for me
about the last few weeks of touring, I've been in the US touring with the book and just got here to
the UK, there haven't been that many posts, well, we're not post-pandemic, but since the beginning
of the pandemic, there haven't been that many spaces for people to gather as leftists collectively.
And one of the things that's been helpful to name is the particular experience
that a lot of us had of going from the highs of the Bernie Sanders campaign
to lockdown, Biden, Democratic Party rallying, and just the combination of that extreme political
disappointment and being isolated from each other, so not being able to process it,
re-strategize, think about what we want to do next. And instead, in that isolation and in our
disappointment, a lot of what we did was just attack each other. And sort of, I write in the
book, we went from this surfing this wave of not me, us and this kind of real joy of kind of a
release from individualism and ego. I mean, that was what was so powerful about being on the road
with Bernie was the slogan, not me, us. Originally, I think a lot of people just thought it was
Bernie saying, this is not about me, this is about us. But when you were out on the campaign,
it took on this whole other life and meaning, which was much more about,
you know, what Astro Taylor talks about with the debt collective, where with something like
medical debt or student debt, it's this private shame that people are carrying. And it's just all
me in the sense of my fault and my burden. But when you meet lots of other people who have that
same burden, you find it us. And that us has power, like you organize into a debtor's union,
then you're a problem for the creditors. And in the same way that when workers organize,
they're a problem for their bosses. So to go from those highs of being in Las Vegas when Bernie
won the strip, which was like, I mean, it was the happiest moment of my political life just
because it's Vegas, right? And it's shiny and gold and Trumpy.
I mean, was it one of the moments of politics where you feel like the boundaries of the self
dissolve a bit? And it's like, well, just absolutely yes, because you've got the nurses and you've
got teachers and you have just so many different movements coming together and just reaching
towards each other. And then the coinciding of lockdown, I mean, I so vividly remember being
on my couch, I was still living in the States at the time, and watching the whole Democratic
party just coalesce around Biden. And and then almost instantly, the Bernie movement just fractured
and everybody started starting their own podcasts and attacking each other. And
Hey, not too much about podcasts. Listen, I mean, I got a cat to feed, right?
But it was, you know, we were, we were suddenly, we went from not me us to just being dropped in
this ocean of me, me, me, me, me. And that's all we knew how to do. And it was just heartbreaking.
I really, I really want to talk about this, because I think it's something where I feel,
again, really personally conflicted about my own work, because Navarro came out of the student
movement, we all met through occupying our university, which was UCL, or, you know, the
plate glass windows of Millbank, which was the Tory party HQ being smashed. That was cool.
That was my first year of university. And I just remember it's me and my friend,
who are like in Millbank. And she's, she looks like me. She's like my doppelganger, but
blonde and Irish, like we're just like same height, same face, but like two different colorways.
Like that was how we all met. And that was where the organization came from.
And we've always felt like we're part of a movement movement, but journalism is different
from being a propagandist for the movement. And there are all kinds of tensions that come
with it. And I think that I often bulk at the constraints of what I feel are unfair expectations
from parasocial relationships, where I'm like, why is someone on Twitter yelling at me like they
know me or like they own me? But the fact is, is that it's not unreasonable to have
political expectations or editorial expectations of someone whose public career is the result of
coming from this movement. So I was wondering like, how do you navigate that the sort of,
you know, the rigors and the demands of journalism that you've got to go where the
facts are leading you, the fact you've got political aims, the fact that you want to think
critically and independently, but you also want to be accountable to people.
How do you square all of these circles? Yeah, yeah. Well, I think there's a lot going on there.
You know, I think left media should not be propaganda. And we, you know, I like coming
back to what we were talking about earlier about facts do matter, research does matter.
It's part of the reason why I always hated the idea that you have are supposed to be a brand,
because what I know about being a brand is that you repeat yourself endlessly. And if you're a
good brand, you've identified your core, your core, your core meaning, and you're just repeating
and reinforcing. And you have message discipline, which is pretty much the opposite of being a good
journalist, a good investigator, which requires that you follow your research wherever it leads.
You have to be able to be changed by what you're learning. And so I think these projects are really
antithetical. That doesn't mean that you don't have like an image in the world. But branding is a
very particular thing. Branding is chasing your own tail at infinitum. And that might be okay to
sell running shoes, but it really is not a good model for being a public intellectual or a journalist.
And I think we should push back on it. And I think also part of the cruelty that we've been
talking about online is that there's a cost to performing a thing version of yourself,
which is what it means to be a brand. You're out there saying, this is thing of me, you know,
this is commodity version of me. People will believe you. And they will think that they
can throw very hard things at you and that you won't bleed because things don't bleed.
And so I don't think we quite believe each other are real online.
And that's a problem. It's not the only reason why people are cruel. They're also racist. They're
also misogynist. But I think there is also this factor that is driving it. So we should try to
de-thing ourselves if we can. I mean, just to play devil's advocate on the difference between
journalists and a propagandist. I was talking about this with my partner. And one of the things
that he was saying is, well, doesn't this keep you locked into very bourgeois norms? So if you say,
well, this is what a journalist does. And there are certain things that journalists does,
which cannot be subordinated to your political aims. Doesn't that make you a worse communist?
Doesn't this make you a worse socialist? Doesn't this make you worse at
bringing the world you want to see into existence?
I think you need to be transparent about what values you're holding yourself to,
what standards you're holding yourself to. I've never... And I don't think you do subscribe to
the idea that you're objective, that you don't have politics. No, you wear your politics on your
sleeve. You're in it because you want to change the world. But you're still accountable for what
you say, and you're still going to hold yourself to standards of accuracy and truth and probing.
And why? Why does that matter? You also have to say why that matters and why it makes for
stronger movements and why movements always have... Strong movements always have powerful art,
powerful journalism, like it's an ecosystem. And this is a piece of the ecosystem. I think
where we get into trouble is when the rest of the ecosystem is not healthy. So the way I'm
interested in the history of what Navarra came out of, of the movements Navarra came out of,
I probably became aware of you around the Corbyn movement and saw you as the media arm
of the Corbyn project. Maybe that's wrong, but that's the way I saw you. Not that you were
propagandist, I know it's always a little tinge, but you also have to be able to do critique.
Because if movements can't do critique and that it's going to be through the media,
that's how we're going to hear each other, then you're just going to keep making the same mistakes
over and over again. But what I'm describing around the burning moment, all of those podcasts were
relatively healthy when there was a political project that was healthy. It was when the political
project collapsed that it just seemed like the left was a bunch of podcasts. And I don't think
that that is a left. And I think that if people are, they're always going to be cruel online.
But I think these parasocial relationships take on an overinflated and unhealthy role
when they're subbing in for collective organizing that isn't in a healthy state.
And is that happening here? Well, I think that since the demise of the Corbyn movement,
and again, it was straight from Corbyn into lockdown, and that was a grim six months,
it was really like a bereavement because not only was this central force of your life gone,
you're also being piled on with humiliation by everyone crowing and saying they were right
about you all along. Right. And then you were separate from your comrades because you couldn't
see each other and you could only communicate online. Like it was a very grim time.
And I think that kind of just anecdotally, there are lots of people trying different things and
there's kind of like embryonic experimentation going on. But certainly, I think with Navarra,
is this ongoing discussion about what does it mean to be a socialist media outlet which takes
journalistic standards very seriously and take socialism very seriously. And there are conflicts
there. There are tensions there. It's not. But the more robust the socialist project is outside
of Navarra, I think the clear your role is going to be. It's just it's when it isn't clear that
there is laughter. You said it. I mean, I kind of want to talk a little bit about
this thing of turning oneself into a brand because we all do it. We all do it now that
social media exists. Anyone who has Instagram or TikTok or Twitter is doing brand them to some
extent. What does it mean for the left to be contesting so much of its politics
through these digital avatars? I mean, one is that it stops people seeing each other as human
beings. But what does it do to the politics? Yeah, I don't think it's been great. I mean,
understatement of the century. And I do want to say that these these political campaigns that we've
both referenced, I think that one, we should we should strive for more in terms of I think we should
expect from these political campaigns that when there are losses, they're not just abruptly
end and they're not be a process for trying to hold on to all of that organizing energy and
to think strategically about what the next stage was. I mean, I was a Bernie surrogate and
you know, I think there was like one email that we all got that was just like
I mean, I love the guy. I'm not blaming him. But you know, social relations have never been his
strengths. But you know, I think we you know, if we are going to ask people to go all in for these
campaigns and these moments when we sent some opening, you know, they're not all going to win.
Most of them are going to fail. And there should be a strategy for holding that space so that we
don't all turn on each other afterwards. But the the branding piece of it, and this is, you know,
a big part of the reason why I wanted to come back to these themes. And it's something that I talk
about with a lot of my comrades in the movement about the way the logic of personal branding
and even collective branding, because it isn't just the individual brands. It's also the movement
as brand that I think is part of why we've had these like peaks, peak peaks and big valleys where
it seems like everybody is talking about whatever the thing is. And and we have, you know, historic
numbers of people on the streets, you know, whether we're talking about climate strikes,
Black Lives Matter, me too, you know, it just seems like everybody is with the program. And then
and then and then the crash and then the internal divisions. And part of it, you know,
Keyanga Amada Taylor, who I quote in the book of Fairbitt, is a, you know, wonderful colleague
and friend. She's written a fair bit about how why movements need more democracy so that it isn't
just, you know, I think it's important that we have ways of talking about this that deep
personalize it. I think people are trying to build movements with really inadequate tools.
And so we're on these corporate platforms and people get, you know, lifted up to leadership
positions because they are persuasive, because they're, you know, they're, they're, they're
great at messaging. There's whatever it is. Sometimes it's a little bit random,
but they aren't elected and there aren't mechanisms in place to hold them accountable.
So, you know, in the book, I talk about how that, you know, that happened to me with no logo. Like
there was a move that, that, that book predicted that there was going to be a
large anti-corporate uprising. There wasn't yet. There were just like, you know, you were talking
about these sort of embryonic like little things that was like reclaim the streets. And there was
like an anti-switch shot movement, but there wasn't a big movement. And then when that book
was at the press, these huge protests started popping off all over the place in Seattle and
then Genoa and so on. And because I had written a book, I suddenly was, according to the media,
the face of this movement. And it was bullshit because I had just written a book. Nobody elected
me. Nobody could hold me accountable. And suddenly, because this is what corporate media wants,
they want like two or three people who are going to be the face of this thing. And, you know, I
suddenly was like, no logo was a brand. And the whole thing got completely out of my control.
And Vogue asked you to do shopping with the enemy.
Yes, I didn't do it. They asked me, there were all kinds of like, there was a, there was
advertising that got offers to do designer ad campaigns. And people did go create no
logo products. I think there's still a no logo craft beer. People send me pictures of it.
I don't know if it's any good. But, you know, I wanted to write about this from the inside and
not have it be like a call out, like, oh, that person, you know, wasn't accountable. I really
just think we need to have democratic movements. And in the absence of democratic movements,
people are still trying to build movements. And it's not work. These tools are failing us.
So we should try some new ones. And I think we are trying new ones. This is part of why
we're seeing a wave of union organizing. I mean, isn't it also about shifting
the kinds of political relationships we have with one another? Because if all of us are brands,
brands are always competing, and they're always competing for attention, and they're competing
for money. And if we turn ourselves into things, and we're having relationships as things, you
can't, you can't build a movement based on solidarity with that. But the relationship
between comrades, which is a word that you just used, is so different. And it's so rich and
layered. And you want, as you were saying before, you want your ideas to spread. Whereas the,
whereas the logic of capitalism and branding is, I want the credit. This is mine. It's an ownership
model, which is exactly the opposite of what you want. If you want to change the world.
This is my most cancelable opinion. Oh, dear. This is my most cancelable opinion.
You're going to get me canceled. Yeah, you're going to get canceled by proxy.
I'm so sorry. It's time somebody brought down Naomi Klein, and there's going to be this podcast.
My most cancelable opinion is that the anti-racist movement has become so concerned with
intellectual property. Whether that's, you know, having beef with POC, because, oh, that lumps
us all in together. Or whether that's saying, okay, well, we use the slogan, you can't use the slogan,
and how different that was to the ethos of the Black Panther movement. Black Panther movement
is like, you want to call yourself the Yellow Panthers? Amazing. Like, you want to call yourself
the White Panthers? Amazing. Whereas we're so concerned with drawing these lines of separation
in between, it's fundamentally liberal. It's liberal in the sense that liberalism perceives
other people always as a threat and an incursion rather than what are the generative, creative
relationships that occur between people. And obviously, it comes from real injustices, right?
I mean, it comes from real examples of intellectual theft of Black women not being credited for
intellectual contributions to movements for many, many decades. So I don't think it's just
liberalism. I think it's also a needed corrective. It has been a needed corrective,
and I think it is also a needed corrective to talk about how we want ideas to spread.
But I think even this idea of credit is a tricky one, because credit matters when you
have a commodity, and it's either about your place within an attention economy or a literal
economy where people make money from doing these things. And of course, the appropriation of this
stuff is wrong and it's bad. But to simply receive credit is not the same as what is the basis of
a movement which can really build. And I'm not just talking about Black Lives Matter. I've also
very much seen it with the relentless focus on cultural appropriation from
South Asian radicals in this country. And I go, yes, I get it. I do get it. But
okay, everyone recognizes that Hena comes from us. What next? Why is recognition the
thing we're striving for? Well, I think it comes down to people just trying to make a really
screwed up system work for them. And I think that if there is a genuine revolutionary project
that has any prospect of transforming this system to a more egalitarian one, there might be more
openness to challenging these ideas around intellectual credit and so on. But within
capitalism, someone's going to make money off of it. Somebody's going to get the credit. Somebody
is going to be on the cover of the magazine. And I think a lot of people feel like if they're not
fighting for it to be them, it's going to be somebody else. And they're right. They're absolutely
right. So I guess it all comes down to building that revolutionary project because without it,
I think we're just going to be fighting for our scraps. And I know this is a really big
gear shift. But so Jewishness is really central to this book. It's one of the threads which connects
you and the other Naomi. It's central to the anti-Semitic conspiracism of the globalists
are doing this, that and the other. But then you also talk about this doubleness of being
both victim and perpetrator within the context of Israel. So I guess can you talk me through how
doubleness and the motif of the doppelganger brought you into this sort of analysis of Jewishness,
Zionism and Israel? I came across a paper by Carolyn Rooney who's here in the UK
who talked about Israel as a country with doppelganger politics by which she meant that it was
a nation that had a fundamental split where the Israeli Jews projected everything that they could
not bear about themselves onto the Palestinian other. And then there's also like this sort of
doppelganger at the heart of the Zionist project, which is that of the new Jew versus the old Jew.
So this is something I quote Philip Roth as I mentioned with all apologies to my 20-year-old
self who hurled a Philip Roth book across my dorm room and vowed never ever to read another book
by Philip Roth. We will say things at least. But you know, I was reading so much doppelganger
literature and I just kept seeing references to Operation Shylock because 1993 doppelganger
masterpiece and I ended up finding it to be really, really useful because in part because of that
ridiculous seriousness thread but also the ways in which it really engages with this sort of the
unshakable ethnic double, which is the double that is projected onto people who are not white
and Christian around the world, which isn't the brand that you create that you think you have
in the world. It's the one that other people create and project onto you. So for Roth it's
Shylock who is the doppelganger of all Jews projected onto them. But then it becomes a book
about Zionism limited in its critique but still interesting and he's very fascinated with the
figure of the new Jew as a doppelganger of the old Jew of the diasporic Jew.
So what's the new Jew and the old Jew? Well, the new, yes. This is a project of Zionism is to
create a new Jew who is the muscle-bound, gun-toting, strong Jew.
Nice Krav Maga. I think the critique from somebody like Roth who is an anti-literary,
you with your books who couldn't save yourselves from the Holocaust, we new Jews will protect you.
And so it's this, there's that doppelganger in Israeli culture, old Jew, new Jew.
And there's a way that it blames the victims of the Holocaust for the Holocaust,
mostly unspoken, sometimes spoken. And then there, and this is what Rooney was writing about,
the way Israel settler colonialism becomes a doppelganger of the ways Jews were treated in Europe.
She's not talking about the Nazis and neither am I, but she is talking about the pogroms,
the ghettoization, all the enclosures, the second-class citizenship, the apartheid system
that is in Israel. This has been some of the more controversial parts of the book.
It's a little bit of a twist for people who thought that the book was just going to be about
feeling superior to Naomi Wolfe and Steve Bannon.
So what happened when you were in Gaza?
Oh, that's a story. Yeah, so that's what I mean. So I was in Gaza, Shock Doctrine had come out,
and my previous books had been published in Hebrew, and I'd been approached by some Israeli
publishers to publish the Shock Doctrine. The Shock Doctrine has a chapter on Israel and its
role in what I call the disaster capitalism complex, and it looks at the export of all of these
Israeli spy and surveillance and military tools. So I wanted the book to come out in Hebrew, but
I also had written in support of BDS and was in contact with the BDS committee, and so
we tried to figure out a way for Shock Doctrine to come out in Hebrew and Arabic at the same time
with an activist publisher called Andalus that doesn't exist anymore, that up to that point
had only published Arabic writing and translation. So I launched the book in the West Bank. We did
a lot of things to as much as possible have a book come out in Hebrew that did not support
the Israeli state. It's complicated because most arts organizations get money and so on,
but anyway, we did our best. It was blessed by the BDS committee. But before I went on the book
tour, I wanted to go to Gaza to do some reporting. And yeah, so there's a scene in the book about
coming back from Gaza through the era's checkpoint. We had no trouble getting into Gaza because at
that point they didn't know who I was at the checkpoint going in. But coming back because I
had done a press conference in Gaza and talked about BDS and talked about, I mean, there had just
been a huge assault on Gaza a few months earlier. When we came back through the checkpoint, they
were waiting for us. And there was this really bizarre experience that we had where first they
kept us waiting for about three hours. It's very strange because there's no way to communicate.
There's just the wall. You're on the other side of the wall and there's surveillance cameras everywhere.
They see us. We're the only ones there and they won't open the gate to let us through. But if you
are there past curfew, then you can't get through and you're in this sort of weird zone where there's
nothing there. So finally the door opens. We get through. We go through the security check and then
they take my husband, Avi, and there's a guy who introduces himself as Ares from Ares.
So you've got another doppelganger. Another doppelganger. They just follow me everywhere.
So Ares from Ares takes Avi upstairs and he meets General in his corner office.
And he gets this huge speech where they tell him that, look out the window, and there's a bunch
of tanks doing a security exercise. And they say, do you know how close we were to sending in
ground troops to Gaza? Which at that point, there had never been ground troops sent into Gaza
since the blockade. And we were going to send them in to rescue you. You have no idea how much
danger you were in. We were in no danger. I mean, we were hosted by Palestinians, like we were
invited. And they said, we see everything. We hear everything. And we were going to reinvade
Gaza to rescue you and get your woman under control. Literally, they said that to Avi,
about me. We know what she's been saying. And we don't care what you say, because you're Jewish
and we will rescue you. So they were saying, you have a doppelganger. Just as the rest of the world
only sees you as Shylock, we only see you as Jews. We don't care about your politics or what you say.
We will rescue you from the Palestinian enemy, even though you think that they're your friends.
It was just the biggest mindfuck you could possibly imagine.
And it's also deeply manipulative. It's like there'll be a ground invasion of Gaza.
For you. Because of you and your supposed solidarity with these people,
we're going to invade them even more than we ordinarily do.
Yeah. I never told that story. I mean, I wrote about what we saw in Gaza and reported on the
aftermath of that invasion. It had been so many since. But I never told the story of that particular
gaslighting mission that they did with eras from eras. But to me, it's so... I shared the story
in the book and thanks for asking, nobody's asked about it. Because we've got... I call it
Zionism Derangement Syndrome in the UK, where if you try and make any arguments critical of
Zionism, it gets pulled into Corbin and Semitism, the left, and it's just...
Well, there's something about the offer that they were saying. It's not just Israel that's making
that offer. I think the UK is making that offer with its militarized borders. It's take the guns,
take the walls, take the prisons. We will keep you safe from the hordes. And when I look at my
doppelganger, she seems to have thrown in with that ideology. She's got the guns and she's talking
about the wars on the border. And I think as the climate crisis accelerates and the wars never end
and poverty deepens, this is going to be the offer to all of us. We have to decide if we want to take
the offer. Yeah. I mean, I've got one last question, which is when so many different
aspects of your identity are attached to fucked up things. And in your case, it was your Jewishness
being invoked by this general to commit an appalling act of violence. But in my case, it might be
my womanhood being invoked to stomp on trans people or being a Westerner and what that means for
all of the extractive, exploitative activities of Western corporations and the things which fuel
my own consumption. When we're so tied to all of these things, is it possible to have a stable
identity? And is it even desirable to have one? I think we are in a moment that we simply cannot
bear as individuals. It's just too hard. I mean, we are in this simultaneous unearthing,
unveiling of just unbearable networks of suffering that sustain the lives of the
privileged outside of the Shadowlands. And I think COVID acted as a unearthing and as a
revealer of all the people who hold up our world and allowed those of us who were able to be locked
down to be locked down and bore all of the risk. And I think that generated a certain kind of
derangement that is part of what I'm tracking in the book of a lot of privileged people claiming
that they were victims of genocide and apartheid and Jim Crow and slavery and all the crimes
of the last 500 years were projected onto a vaccine app or being made to wear masks.
But I don't think any of us are really able to look at just the unbearability of our complicity
in these past, future, and present networks of suffering, extinction,
dispossession. We can only bear it together. We can only bear it in the sturdiest,
widest possible coalitions. Like I quote Ariel Angel, the editor of Jewish Currents at the end
of the book saying, you know, we're going to need each other. And part of recognizing that we will
need each other in the face of surging fascism and climate breakdown means that we are going to have
to get over ourselves a little bit, you know, whether it's our individual brands or our individual
identity groups, which does not mean erasure, which does not mean annihilate the ego or dissolve
into some mush of no difference that pretends that we are all coming into coalition with the same
risks, debts, and needs. No, but we will need each other. And we, you know, I do believe that every
you know, victory for the fascist right is also a story of division, sectarianism, failure to
make a strategic alliances on the anti-fascist left. And we are on the knife edge. We are just on

Thank you, Ash. This was really, really deep. Thanks. Well, have fun at the BBC. Oh, my God.
This is a good way to start. I'm Naomi Klein, and I am at Navar Media right now,
having just done a wonderful in-depth interview. And this is why I love Navar Media. And I listen
regularly and watch to find out what the hell is going on in the UK. It is so critical to have
independent media that we can trust that goes deep on the issues and also lets people stay up on the
day-to-day twists and turns. It's going to be especially important for your next election.
So I'm incredibly grateful that Navar Media exists, and it exists because people support
it. So make sure to support Navar Media. We need left institutions, and that means that we have
to support them when they're doing such great work as Navar Media is. Thanks.
