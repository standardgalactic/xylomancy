Yet another Nobel Prize winner has been caught with some dodgy looking stuff in his papers.
The person I'm talking about is called Thomas Suddhoff, a German American neuroscientist
at Stanford.
Now we'll get to the suspect looking stuff in his papers in a second, but first I want
to give you a bit of background to Suddhoff himself, talk about his Nobel Prize because
I think his research, at least as a psychologist, is pretty interesting.
So in 2013, Thomas Suddhoff won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, along with
his colleagues Rothman and Schechman for their work on something called vesicle trafficking.
What the heck does that mean?
So basically, imagine these are two different neurons in your body.
Between each neuron in your body, there is a little gap.
So when this neuron wants to send a message to this neuron, it needs to find a way to
send a signal across that little gap, we call that gap a synapse.
So when this neuron wants to send a signal to this neuron across the synapse, it uses
these little balloons of fat that it has inside its body, which are filled with various different
chemicals, which we call neurotransmitters.
And so when it needs to send a signal, those balloons of fat fuse with the surface of this
neuron, releasing the neurotransmitters, stuff like dopamine or endorphins, which you've
probably heard of before, which then tells this neuron to fire.
And essentially Suddhoff and his colleagues discovered that this process is controlled
by calcium and also something which they discovered, which they call snare proteins.
And the discovery of these mechanisms come with a lot of different implications for various
different psychiatric disorders like depression disorder, anxiety disorder, potentially autism.
So that's a bit of background on Suddhoff's Nobel Prize.
And as you can imagine, being a prominent scientist like this, winning a Nobel Prize
comes with a lot of perks.
Suddhoff currently is a professor at Stanford, a place where the average salary for professors
is 200,000 a year.
And I imagine Suddhoff is earning a healthier amount more than that, given he's a Nobel Prize
winner.
He's also on a bunch of other companies who do work related to his research, including
one called Cenofi, which according to this website, earns him another healthy $150,000
a year.
Now, so Suddhoff is very successful and I've absolutely no problem with that.
I think that scientists who do great work should be paid well and should be successful
because of course we want to incentivize scientists to make cool discoveries and do impactful
work.
However, what we don't want are scientists cheating in order to have that success.
Now I'm not directly accusing Suddhoff of cheating here, but as of the time of filming,
there are 35 of Suddhoff's papers that have been flagged on a website called PubPir, which
if you're unfamiliar, is a website where fellow scientists can critique other scientists'
work and point out things that they think need to be addressed.
Unsurprisingly, the person who has found the most anomalies in Suddhoff's work is friend
of the channel, Elizabeth Bick.
Bick has found multiple instances of duplications of images and just images that don't look
right in her opinion.
So I'm going to go through a couple of different examples.
This first one is a 2012 paper from Suddhoff and his colleagues.
This image seems to be the result of some kind of fluorescence microscopy.
It's showing aggregations of a protein called alpha synuclein, which I believe is a protein
that is associated with Parkinson's.
I think I'm not an expert by any means, but I think the way this works is that the clumpier
your alpha synuclein, the more neurons die and the worse your Parkinson's is.
So I believe each box in this figure is supposed to represent a different mutation of alpha
synuclein, so each box should be unique and completely different to each other.
But as you can see from the two areas highlighted in yellow, these sections of the boxes are
identical but rotated 90 degrees, and also the two areas in purple are identical as well
but rotated 180 degrees.
So that looks pretty dodgy, right?
How did that happen?
Are the authors trying to make their results look different through how they actually are?
Well, according to the authors of the paper, it was an honest copy and pasting error.
Jacqueline Burr, who's the first-name author on this paper, said that, yeah, it was some
kind of copy and pasting error.
Something about the images were on a PowerPoint and they had to crop them and paste them and
they cropped the wrong one or something, and then she posted a corrected file.
Okay, so that looked pretty dodgy, but the interaction was at least, you know, pretty
cordial between Elizabeth Bick and Jacqueline, nothing too heated going on there.
However, when it comes to Pseudof himself, his responses to Elizabeth Bick have been
less than cordial, should we say?
If we take a look at this latest pub peer post by Elizabeth Bick, this was just posted
a week before the time of filming.
This paper came out in 2010 in one of Nature's journals, specifically Nature, Structural
and Molecular Biology, which is a pretty prestigious journal.
And as you can see, there's again examples of image duplication.
The rectangles in the same colors are identical.
So as you can see, there are three orange rectangles, three red rectangles, etc., etc.
You can see there's lots of duplicated areas within this image.
Now that is something which is concerning in a Western blot image like this.
And Pseudof's reply was a little defensive.
He goes, thanks, I'm trying to understand the accusation here that within digitally reproduced
images of immuno blot stripes that are clearly not stitched and were reproduced from non-digital
data at low resolution contain tiny areas that are unexpectedly similar, i.e. intentionally
manipulated, whereas the bands themselves are not manipulated.
I'm just trying to figure out what Dr. Bick's AI-powered software mining our old papers may
have found.
This is such a bizarre accusation.
So essentially, Pseudof is blaming these visual artifacts on the fact that the image is low
resolution, which is complete nonsense in my opinion.
And that is also the opinion of another pubpia poster who said, figure S6B contains rectangular
regions that are perfect clones of each other.
This cannot have happened by chance, as in much, much less than 10 to the power of 986,
and blaming this on a reproduction artifact of a digitized image is as believable as saying
the dog ate my homework.
In a much cooler tone, Elizabeth Bick also replied to Thomas Pseudof's comment by saying,
Dr. Pseudof, I am not accusing anyone of anything, but I am trying to find a reasonable explanation
for these unexpected areas.
As I am sure you will know, in Western blots, the bands are the only type of results.
Negative lanes are of equal importance since they show a lack of expression of the protein
of interest, as is the case here.
If you don't understand what that means, maybe this is the first Pete Judo video that
you're watching.
The way that Western blots work is that they show bigger blots if that protein is more
present in your sample.
So the bigger, darker and thicker the blot, the more present that protein is.
And if there's no blot, that means that that protein isn't present in your sample.
So Elizabeth Bick is pointing out here that just because the blot itself was not duplicated
doesn't mean that this isn't important.
The fact that this negative space has these clear duplications indicates that perhaps
there was something there before that has now been covered up, or perhaps this image
was manufactured artificially, and therefore these visual artifacts are being discovered.
And then at the end of the comment, Elizabeth Bick kind of drops the mic on Pseudof and
says, also, I found these regions by eye.
And actually it's quite ironic that Pseudof is making fun of AI algorithms in this case,
because if anyone has used a dodgy AI to produce their work here, it's Pseudof's colleagues
most likely.
This looks like something that might happen as a result of some kind of Western blot image-generating
AI, or it could just be somebody messing around with Photoshop, either the author themselves
or somebody that they paid.
Either way, these kind of visual artifacts should never be found in legitimate Western
blots, and so this looks really dodgy.
And in my opinion, I don't think that Pseudof's reply is particularly convincing, or that
he's handled the situation very well at all.
So those are just two examples of the anomalies that are coming out about Pseudof's work,
and there seems to be a couple of new ones every week recently.
Like I said, there are now 35 papers being looked at as having suspicious stuff in them,
and actually one of Pseudof's papers has already been retracted.
This is the paper, it's a 2023 paper that was published in PNAS, that's PNAS, no jokes
in the comments please.
So the reason why this PNAS paper was retracted is because there's a bunch of fake data in
it.
Here are some examples of the data that was called out by people on POP here.
As you can see, the two areas in green show exactly the same numbers, the exact same measurements
for two different experimental conditions.
The chance of that happening in reality is basically impossible, especially not in exactly
the same order.
Same here with the numbers in blue, same here with the numbers in cyan, and ones in pink
as well.
This didn't just happen once in the paper, but happened multiple times.
As you can see, there's another set of numbers here in the experimental condition on the
left.
These numbers are all grouped together on the ones on the right, there seems to be
a few random numbers.
I don't know if the author was trying to throw people off and trying to make it look like
they weren't cheating when they obviously were.
So there's clearly some dodgy stuff going on here, why do the numbers look like this?
This kind of exact duplication of numbers in the same sequence is impossible, it's clearly
being manipulated by somebody.
So because this paper looks so dodgy, the raw data was independently analysed by another
scientist at Stanford, a guy called Dr. Daniel Martis, and as a result the paper has now
been retracted from PNAS.
Fake data, it's back again.
So with one retraction under his belt and over 30 papers now under investigation, it
is not looking good for Dr. Sudov.
But establishing intent and who in each of these cases actually did the cheating or honest
mistaking is a lot harder to establish.
In my opinion, it seems highly unlikely that Dr. Sudov himself was the one who was doing
any of this stuff.
As the final author on the paper and as a scientist of his calibre, he's likely just
there at an advisory role meeting with the students and postdocs who are working with
him who actually do all the legwork for each of these papers.
But nevertheless, it still doesn't look good to have so many papers with your name on it
that have these kind of anomalies coming up.
So let me know what you think of this Sudov situation in the comments below, thank you
guys so much for watching and I will see you in the next one, bye bye.
