All right, so welcome to the first episode of killing the caveman so in this episode
I'm going to be talking about why cobalt is needed now and why it should have died 20 20 years ago
It's 2020 right now and why governments suddenly need programmers for it
All right recently due to the pandemic
There has been a really big need for some governments and businesses
To have an old software be worked on that was built in cobalt because I think there's like
Millions of lines of code that are currently still written in cobalt
So if you don't know what cobalt is it is an old language used for business in fact the acronym is
common business
oriented language or that's a
Yeah, that's common is the CO and then business is the be of course and then
Oriented oh and language common oriented business language
You know what I mean
This is probably the most boring acronym. I have ever heard by the way like business has the word business and common in it
Those are like very boring words and never mind
Let me know in the comments if you think there's a more boring acronym that you can think of
So the language should have gotten been gotten rid of like many many years ago
but governments refuse to get rid of it in favor of new modern languages and technologies because these new modern languages and technologies cost money and
Now these governments are faced with
The consequences of not replacing them
So because most of these people who know cobalt are of course retired now and
Because nobody wants to learn it of course and we'll get to reasons why and
So no one can fix it or maintain it if there's an issue
So let's get to the history of what cobalt is and why was it used so cobalt was made in 1960
so if
You started to learn or started to use cobalt like right out of college when you like turn 20 or something like that you would be
80 years old because that's 60 years ago 1960
Ridiculous, so you can
Kind of guess why people who developed with this language are retired now because of course most people retire around 65 years old
So if most people started or started using this language in like 1975 then they're probably retired by now
So you might be wondering why are these places still using this language?
Why why haven't they replaced it like what what purpose does it have other than that?
It's too expensive to replace for the local government or businesses and
Of course the main reason is main there are three words mainframe processing speed
MPS and
It's also the cost associated with replacing it with these new newer technologies because then you would have to hire developers and
Developers don't cost a lot nowadays or they do cost a lot
They're very expensive compared to other engineers or software engineers are more expensive generally than other kinds of engineers
So and oftentimes people don't want to spend all their money just developing like software that not many people are going to use
All right, so I want to show you an article on ours. Technica about how
Or why IBM is scrambling to find or train more cobalt programmers to help states
so
This is kind of look at these old computers here
There's so I don't even know what to like think about them
They look like washroom machines or like something to do my laundry with or something like that
It's like looks like a kitchen countertop, too
And I don't know what these things on the side are but seem interesting
But anyways, New Jersey is one of the states that needs cobalt programmers
To help with the state's unemployment insurance system, so that's this is kind of one of the the uses of
Cobalt because this unemployment system probably hasn't seen much use for a long long time
Because if you didn't know the unemployment rate prior to
Recent
Happenings
Has been very low. It's been record lows for the last couple years
I think I mean of course since like 2008. It's been low so
Since that time though, they probably had a lot of people to work on current or not like a lot of people
But some people to work on cobalt back during that time
but now that everything is modernized and the unemployment rate is like skyrocketed recently they need
More people or more people were going through
file for unemployment, of course
so
IBM is trying to like train people to work in cobalt, but
Like I said, most cobalt most experienced cobalt programmers aren't getting any younger
I mean no one's getting any younger, but they're not gonna have time to train people with
To meet all their demands in the amount of time because cobalt is not an easy language and I'll show you some examples
So I do want to show you another example of how cobalt was used and why people needed cobalt developers
So in Kansas government Laura Kelly, so the state's Department of Labor was in the process of modernizing cobalt, but
the virus came in and
They couldn't do it. Of course or at least
They're not able to do it in time for this pandemic
So the operating on really old stuff currently and of course that's going to slow down things
So I mentioned that it was made in like 1960-1959. Well is programming language used or
Very significant percentage of business systems over the period of 60s 70s and even the 80s
So what about the 90s the zeroes and the teens? Why haven't people replaced it since then?
That's 30 years even
During like high usage maybe 20 years
So that's kind of ridiculous how they haven't replaced this
I see now that the 220 billion lines of cobalt code and use today
I don't know about you, but that's a lot of lines of code and
The lines of code and for cobalt are very verbose
But even still that's kind of crazy 43% of banking systems
90% of ATMs
What that's ridiculous 95% of ATMs like
Might be thinking what can you replace that with and that's a good question. All right, so
Cobalt was kind of like the enterprise
Programming language for this old-time era
So it of course can be replaced with anything enterprise nowadays
Which it can be a variety of languages Python Java JavaScript C plus plus really it can even do be done on assembly
It doesn't really matter what you replace it with as long as it is
At least efficient
So let me show you some cool things about cobalt. So it's the first high-level
Very widely used high-level programming language and it's English like and structure. That's probably the unique thing about cobalt
So it has self-documentating
So what that means is you don't have to like make your own documents elsewhere because it's so verbose and it can handle huge data
processing which of course isn't huge enough at this
during times of need like this and
Of course, mirror messaging is useful
So I want to show you now a
Hello world program in cobalt and see what it's like. All right, of course
I'm not an expert in cobalt because I'm not from the dinosaur area
But I can probably see them the basics of it. So display use it's kind of like use real world real words
So display things so display you can say hello world you can move
tutorial point I
Don't know where is that defined to WS team? I guess
And then you okay. This is another display. So hello. My name is
Then my idea my ideas
So you can execute it and then they'll say hello world. My name is oh
Okay
So they kind of declared
Tutorial point to be their name and then their ID was
That's really cool. All right, I mean it's it's really like interesting how they did it
But this seems like this could be done in like a line of code
And like almost any other language or maybe like three lines of code. So it's kind of crazy
So this is just like how many lines three six
It's like at least 10 15 kinds of code just for something simple as this that's kind of ridiculous
All right, so what makes cobalt so bad and as you can see a little bit there is it is verbose
It requires a lot of words to do very simple things
And I didn't show you much cobalt code, but it is difficult to read cobalt code like that was
Pretty difficult to read because there was so many lines of code and you had to figure out what was going on and
the verbose part was wasn't too
useful in the self-documentating part because usually a good code
doesn't need documentation
So programs written in cobalt were also difficult to read and
Hard to modularize into different little pieces which made to them
Made them have kind of a lack of structure, which is not a good for a programming language
so
If you have ever heard of them a famous famous computer scientist Eds
Edsger Dijkstra Dijkstra is like he's he made Dijkstra's algorithm
So if you don't know what that is it is an algorithm that almost everyone who takes a computer science
Class called like data structure an algorithm needs to know Dijkstra's algorithms to be
somewhat good at
Data structure of the algorithms, so he Dijkstra criticized cobalt because this is back in the day when he was
Algorithm that's a word
So he said the use of cobalt cripples the mind and I can kind of understand why
So that's the end of this cobalt video. Thanks for watching
