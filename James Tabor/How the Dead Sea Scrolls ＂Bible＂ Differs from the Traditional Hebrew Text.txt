to get started here. Hope everybody can see in here okay. So today I'm going to
talk to you about the Dead Sea Scrolls Bible and I'm using Bible in scare
quotes because obviously nobody was carrying around the Dead Sea, you know,
a printed Bible or even a handwritten Bible. But the books that are part of the
Hebrew Bible they are represented in the Dead Sea Scroll library to some extent
and that's what I want to talk about. Just as I start I want to introduce you
to some resources because I'm teaching a course this semester on the Dead Sea
Scrolls so I have everything right here and I know many of you are very
interested. I would say the number one book that I would recommend, I got to
figure out how to show this at the right angle without the glare, but it's
Vander Cam and Flint. I think you all can see that. The meaning of the Dead Sea
Scrolls, you can get it in paperback. Highly recommended that this is the book
on the scrolls. You really need it to be able to talk much about the scrolls or
all of their background and to know the history and what they contain and who
wrote them and how to date them and all the theories, all the interpretations.
That book is a book that I always use and with all of my students. And as far as
reading the scrolls, which is also important, I always tell the story in the
90s when I was lecturing here in Charlotte, North Carolina, when the
scrolls were on exhibit here in Charlotte and there was this huge exhibit and we
had a lecture at the Jewish Community Center. It was standing room only. It was
unbelievable. They had to get chairs and open up the side. Everybody's interested
in the scrolls and they had just been released through Robert Eisenman's
efforts and Herschel's shanks at Bar Magazine and others. I was somewhat
involved in that. And after my lecture, a woman came up and she said, oh, Dr.
Taber, I'm so glad we have the scrolls finally because about probably a third of
the scrolls had not been released until the 90s. So there was a big campaign.
Some of you will remember Herschel's shanks really spearheaded it in Bar
Magazine, but Robert Eisenman, I think, was really behind the scenes. And he's the
one who actually got the photographs and then had them published. And then they
were all public finally. So this is the complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English. It's
a penguin paperback. The editor is Geza Vermish, V-E-R-M-E-S. I guess his name is
not even on the front, but it's on the side, I think. Not even the side. So he
didn't write them. He doesn't want his name on, but he's the translator and it's
a great addition. It has over 100 pages of introductory material. And then it
also has lots of commentary and helps as you read the scrolls. But the main thing
is it has the scrolls in English. So I really want to recommend this. So this
woman was saying, oh, I love the scrolls. And I had an earlier version of this.
And I said, oh, have you read them yet? And she goes, oh, no, I haven't read them,
but I just love that we have them. So I think a lot of people are in that
situation where we talk about, oh, finally we got the scrolls, but then you
don't even read them. Maybe kind of like the Bible with people who love that we
have the Bible, but they've never read it. Then I want to mention this is the year
of the scrolls, because here's a life magazine, the Dead Sea Scrolls, after 75
years. The Race to Solve an Ancient Mystery. You can get this at newsstands,
grocery stores, and so forth. I also, I ordered it from Amazon. And then this,
what is very nice, this is the Dead Sea Scrolls. The subtitle is 75 years since
their historic discovery. Both of these are worth having, but I would want the
VanderKam and Flint the book. Most of the people listening to me in this audience,
I think, are really good students, and they like to study. Now, that's in English.
If you study Hebrew, which I know some of you do, you want to get it. It'll have a
different cover. This is an edition I've had for several years. I think it's
red now. Anyway, it's called the Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition. Be careful if you
order it, because there's a study edition that is just English, but as you see
when I open this up, get a nice page of Hebrew here to show you. You can see, you
got the English on one side and the Hebrew on the other. This is Martinez, the
editor. Florentino Martinez. He's a good friend of mine. I see him at conferences.
He works in Spain, in Madrid, I think, or maybe Barcelona. Yeah, I think Barcelona.
But he's provided this wonderful study edition for students who want to read
the Dead Sea Scrolls with Hebrew as well. Let me also mention that's
introductory that I've recently put on my YouTube channel, which is, let's see,
James Tabor videos. You can find it on YouTube. I've been putting up a lot of
things. I put up some things even this morning, but I've got three recent
lectures that I did at the Biblical Archaeology Seminar over the years. One
is called, let's see, I wrote this down, the exact names. Who wrote the Scrolls? So
you can look at that. Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return. And I didn't tend that
title to be kind of shocking or provocative. But at the end, I say, you know,
one thing about all Messiahs, they've all died and they haven't come back yet.
And I was mainly talking about the Teacher of Righteousness, who's the
leader of the Dead Sea Scroll community. And then a third video, the Dead Sea Scroll
calendar. You know, there are several Jewish calendars that are being used in
the time of the Second Temple period for Christians the time of Jesus. There are
three different main calendars, a lunar calendar, a solar lunar calendar, a solar
calendar, and then it has to do with how you calculate the months and so forth.
And I've got those up. And if you go to my blog, JamesTabor.com, I upload some
documents. Here's a sample. These are printed documents that you can look at
that go with the videos. So that's enough for education. The only other thing I
would mention is the Wikipedia article. I know professors are not supposed to
recommend Wikipedia to their students, but you know what? Some of the Wikipedia
articles are just excellent. If you want to go into some controversial thing or
political thing, they can be tough. And I know religion can be controversial,
but something like the Dead Sea Scrolls, the articles in Wikipedia are
fabulous. They really are. Very, very complete article. So that would be a good
thing to read too. You can print it out and study it if you don't know much
about the Dead Sea Scrolls. So I hope this lecture or lesson or class, I
guess I could call it, would encourage you to delve into the Dead Sea Scrolls
themselves. They certainly are the greatest archaeological discovery in our
time. And I want to mention one other book. I think I have it here somewhere.
Let's see. I thought I laid it down. I was going to show Ross's book. Yeah, I
got it. Because this is about a Dead Sea Scroll as well. The question is, was
it a forgery or was it authentic or a genuine scroll? And then when would it
date? So if you haven't heard about this, it was featured the other night on
coast to coast. It's really getting out there and Ross has got a whole slate of
interviews set up as a result of this book. So you should, most of you, I
think many of you in this audience have heard of this, but in the back, there's
a translation of what might be maybe the oldest and most important of all the
Dead Sea Scrolls. We haven't been able to find it because it's disappeared, but
Ross does a good transcription and translation of it. And I want to include
that as well as part of the Dead Sea Scrolls. To read more about that, just
go to themosiscroll.com, which is Ross's website. You can order the book
through several means, including Amazon. Amazon, I think, is the publisher of it
or not the publisher, but the vehicle through which it was published. And
also a blog where Nichols has put up a whole lot of entries about the scroll
and everything about it. And in the last issue of Bar magazine, I wrote an
article with Edan Dershowitz, who's also working with us on the Moses Scroll,
arguing that it is very likely authentic, that it's an authentic Dead Sea Scroll.
But that's not what I'm talking about today. So all of that is preliminary. So
what are the Dead Sea Scrolls? We've got 15,000 manuscripts or fragments of
manuscripts. That's huge, representing probably 600 different works or books.
And yet, some of the books that are represented might just have a teeny
piece or two that you could fit on just one page and just a fragment. And some
of the fragments are the size of like a matchbook cover, even a thumbnail, with
only a couple of letters. So when we say 15,000 fragments, don't get too
excited like you're going to have complete copies of things. However, there
are some complete copies of some of the scrolls. They were mostly found in
Cave 1 and then Cave 11 and then the Copper Scroll in Cave 3. And Cave 1 was
just a treasure because you had something called the Community Rule, which is the
charter of the group that wrote the scrolls or wrote the sectarian scrolls.
I'll explain that in a minute as to what these 600 books are. Books that they wrote
about their own group and their own movement, kind of like the Christians
have the New Testament as their writings. So the Dead Sea Scroll group had
their own writings. And another one is the Thanksgiving hymns, some of which
were written by the teacher, their leader, we think. Like he uses the first
person, we think he actually wrote these. So we've got that from Cave 1. You've
got as well the War Scroll from Cave 1 and a number of other scrolls that are
very complete. So if you break down the scrolls, about 30% of them are written
by the group. We call them the sectarian scrolls. These are the scrolls where the
group is talking about how they were formed and what they're all about and
what their vision of things is and what their history is and so forth. So that's
like almost a third are written by the group. And those are the ones I
specialize in. And then there's another 30% that are copies of texts that they
didn't write, but texts that are not the Hebrew Bible, but books that you would
recognize the names of, even if you haven't read them, like Jubilees, the
Book of Jubilees. They love the Book of Jubilees. It fits their solar calendar
that they used. And Enoch, not all of Enoch, because Enoch is an Ethiopic, the
complete thing that we now have, but they had of the five parts of Enoch, they
had four of them and they did use them. And in fact, some of the Aramaic Enoch
texts are the oldest copies of Enoch that we have. And Enoch is quoted in
the New Testament in the Book of Jude. And there are a lot of other references
in the New Testament, just allusions to some of the language of the Book of
Enoch. So people in the Second Temple period from, let's say, about the Maccabees
down through Bar Kokba, or down through the destruction of Jerusalem and on to
Bar Kokba, 1st century CE, they're making use of these books and using them
all during that period. And then what we want to do today, 40% of the Dead Sea
Scrolls are copies of books of the Hebrew Bible. So I want to introduce you to a
book if you don't know it. I highly, highly recommend this book. I'm going to
read you the blurb on it in just a minute, but I want you to be able to see it
or get a screenshot of it. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible, the oldest known Bible
translated for the first time into English. And the authors are Abeg, Flint, and
Ulrich. And it's really an amazing production. So what is this? Of those 40% of
the Dead Sea Scrolls of the 1500 fragments, 600 volumes, the ones that
are copies of the Bible are in this book. So you actually have the Dead Sea Scroll
Bible. What it says at the top, over a thousand years older than any previously
discovered biblical manuscripts with material never before published or
translated, including hundreds of new and different readings and several lost
Psalms that actually could conceivably go into the book of Psalms. There's a Psalm
151, for example, that the Oxford Annotated RSV actually includes as well as
the new Oxford RSV. So highly recommend this book, because this is what I'm
going to talk from today. So who wrote the scrolls just before we start? Who is
this group so that we know something about them? I could give a complete
lecture on that, and I did. I mentioned that I have a lecture on YouTube and you
can find it on YouTube and listen to it with a lot of supplementary material on
my blog that goes with it. But usually people say, oh, the S-scenes wrote the
scrolls. The Dead Sea Scroll group are the S-scenes. Well, obviously they didn't
write all the scrolls, because you've got books like Jubilee's and Enoch that they
didn't write, and you've got the Hebrew Bible, which they didn't write. But that
30% is written by the group, and some of those even by the teacher himself. And so
we could talk about scrolls that they wrote and who they were. I don't think
the word S-scene is very helpful. I think the group that wrote the scrolls is
described by Josephus as the S-scenes. So if you go to book two of the Jewish
war, you can read his long description of the S-scenes. And he's very positive
about them. But remember, he's writing for the impervest patient. He's living in
Rome. It's around 75 CE after the destruction of Jerusalem. And he wants
to talk about the traditions of the Jewish people and the schools, philosophical
schools, as the way he describes them. Pharisees, Sadducees, and S-scenes. And so
he presents them in Hellenistic garb. And also he presents them in ways that the
emperor would not find objectionable. Now that we have the scrolls, you can call
them S-scenes if you want, but don't go to Josephus for your definition of S-scenes,
because he makes them kind of quietists and pacifists and they're a secluded group. They
sound a lot like the Pythagoreans. And then of course he makes the Pharisees sound
like Epicureans. And he makes, I'm sorry, the Sadducees. And then the Pharisees he
would make, he would describe in ways that would remind you of the Platonists or
particularly the Stoics probably. So you see what he's doing. So to understand the
Dead Sea Scroll group, again, it's better to read their own self-description. And
what they, what we come up with, if you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, the books that
they wrote, I would describe them like this. You ready? An apocalyptic, messianic,
new covenant group, baptizing, you have to be baptized, and I'm using, it's a mikvah,
it's Jewish mikvah, but probably in a running stream like the Jordan River, or the Dead Sea.
You could presumably be baptized in the Dead Sea because you probably want to hold your eyes really
tight when you go under, but you could do that and maybe they did baptize in the Dead Sea.
So apocalyptic, messianic, new covenant, they claim that they were the people of the new covenant,
they were, God has established the new covenant, they were the ones separatists, communal living,
and preparing the way in the desert, the Aravah, Isaiah 40 verse 3. Just as the New Testament
opens in the Gospel of Mark with John the baptizer out in the desert along the Jordan Valley, preaching
and baptizing and people and people say, who are you? And he says, I'm the voice of one calling in
the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord. So when I say they're people of the way, that might
remind you of something in the book of Acts, the New Testament book of Acts, because they also pick
up this same language. So people of the way means people of the desert way, people that are following
the Torah according to the interpretations of this group, and what we call Halakha or Halakha,
interpretations of Torah. So whether you call them messians or not, basically go to the scrolls
for a definition. Now none of those terms would describe the Pharisees, none of those terms would
describe the Sadducees. And yet those terms do describe this group. And I would say every one
of those terms also describes the Jesus movement. So when the scrolls were discovered, people were
very, very excited and keen, but also a little nervous, because it's like we found an apocalyptic
messianic group thinking they're preparing the way in the wilderness, saying they're people of the
New Covenant, communal living, separatists, baptizing into the group, and so forth. They're doing all of
these things. And basically my screen went out, I'm going to put it back. It doesn't matter,
but I'd rather not talk to a blank screen. So give me just a second. I need to probably, sorry about
that. This is probably going to happen over and over. So anyway, where was I? I was talking about
how people were maybe a bit nervous, because they would think, well,
is this like a precursor of the Jesus movement? Or did the Jesus movement kind of copy, or did
they come from this group or whatever? But we're not going to talk about that today. But it is a
good topic to talk about the relationship of the Jesus movement, the John the Baptist movement,
followers of James, the brother of Jesus, how they might have related to the Dead Sea Scroll Group.
I've written a lot about that in my books, such as The Jesus Dynasty. Now, as far as the 40% of
the scrolls that do have copies of the Hebrew Bible, there's one book supposedly missing, and it
just so happens that it's not missing anymore. Some of you who want to look this up, you could
paste the URL maybe in one of the chats on YouTube or Facebook. But recently, just recently,
the book of Esther has been identified as a fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. So if you've
ever heard, and you still read this, if you look it up, that they had copies of all the books of
the Hebrew Bible, except for Esther in Nehemiah. Well, Esther has now been located. And it's an
article at the website, thetora.com. So if you go to thetora.com, it's called Newly
Deciphered Comron Scroll Revealed to be Esther. So it's really easy to find. It's by,
let's see, Rabbi Asher Tovlev. And it's a really exciting story, because you know why they hadn't
identified Esther? Because somebody spilled some wine on it. And it was stained, and you couldn't
make it out. But now through photographic means, they've been able to make it out, which is really
amazing. So what we want to do today, I'm going to switch on my reading light here, where I can
see better what I want to do, is I want to take this Dead Sea Scroll Bible, and I want to pick
five different, let's see, is it five or six? One, two, three. Actually, it's
four different references, but some of them have more than one. I'm going to pick
four or five places. Within here, you see, I've got a mark here, where the Hebrew Bible that we
have, the Masoretic text differs from the readings that are in the scrolls. And that's what I want
to talk about. Now, here's the problem with that. Many people talk about the Hebrew Bible. I've got
a Hebrew Bible right here. This is the standard scholarly edition of the Hebrew Bible. It's called
the BHS, Biblia Hebraica Stuttgart, Densia Stuttgart, the German. That's where it was put out. It's
put in Latin. It's referred to as the BHS. And you can see here on the page, if I put it really
close at the bottom, that you've got all of these variant readings. So even though people talk about
I want to go by the Masoretic text, you have to realize even the Masoretic text, the traditional
Hebrew texts, like some of you use the Koran Bible, K-O-R-E-N. It's a standardized text that's
been standardized by the rabbis hundreds of years ago. But there are variants. And many of you probably
remember or know Bart Ehrman, who is the New Testament scholar. And he was trained at Princeton.
And when he learned as a student that there are all these variants in the New Testament,
it really disturbed him because he was raised as a very conservative Christian and whatever the
traditional Byzantine texts of the Greek New Testament said, he just felt it had to be
perfect without any kind of mistakes or variants. And then when he began going to graduate school
and finding out that there are literally hundreds of variants. Now, what you'll often hear is,
well, the Masoretic text, it doesn't have any variants. You know how people count the letters
and they do these Bible code things. But all you need is one variant and the whole Bible code is
thrown off, right? Because all the letters would then shift even by one letter. And so I'm not too
fond of the Bible code concept because I happen to know that the text you're searching is just one
of several copies of the Masoretic text. The one that is used by in the BHS is the Leningrad codex.
It's the oldest copy of the Hebrew Bible Masoretic text, as we call it. The traditional text is
maybe another way to refer to it. That's complete. There's the Aleppo codex that's a little bit older,
but part of it was destroyed by actually anti-Semites who raided the place and tried to burn the scroll.
But fortunately, most of it did survive and it's on display in Jerusalem. If you've been there and
seen that, it's in the shrine of the book there in Jerusalem. So anyway, when you talk about the
Hebrew Bible, here's what we've got. We've got the Masoretic text, but it does have variations.
At the bottom of every page, you can see these other readings of other copies of it because
copyists make mistakes and variations creep in over the centuries. We've also got what's called the
Septuagint LXX. You'll see it abbreviated. That's a translation of the Hebrew Bible that we think was
made in the 2nd century BCE. And we do have manuscripts of the Septuagint, quite a few that
have survived. And it doesn't always read the same as the Hebrew Bible either. So you've got other versions.
And then the Samaritan Pentateuch. Now that's only the five books of Moses, but the Samaritan
Pentateuch does differ in places with the Masoretic texts. So that would be three different versions
of the Torah, at least. And of the Hebrew Bible in general, you would have two versions, the Masoretic
text with its variants, as well as the Septuagint. And of course, the Septuagint would have variants
also. And then you add the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is not complete because we don't have
absolute copies of every single book of the Hebrew Bible. But it is, in fact, another tradition.
And sometimes the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls agree with this Septuagint. The first or second
example we're going to have today, we're going to consider today, actually agrees with the Greek,
not the Masoretic texts. And so scholars have been busy now for 75 years doing all of these
comparisons and trying to figure it out. This bothers some people. I hope it doesn't bother you
who are listening. I don't want it to bother you. Tell my students I don't want it to bother them
either. Because what you don't want to do is trade one fundamentalism for another. Many of
I was raised in a fairly conservative Christian tradition. And the tradition I came out of,
the Campbellite or Churches of Christ, they would have said by and large, although they're
probably liberalized a little here and there over the years. But they would have said, you know,
the Bible is inspired and it's perfect and it has no mistakes. And they just don't like variations.
And yet there are variations. When I first took Greek, I've got my Greek New Testament here.
This is the Greek New Testament. And you can see it's very, very similar. It's got all of those
variations at the bottom of the Greek text. So we shouldn't wish for something that we don't have.
We have different versions of the Hebrew Bible, different versions of the New Testament, actually
different versions of every single book from antiquity. This is actually a treasure of riches.
We want that sort of thing because we want all the possible information we can.
Now, when the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered, cave one, there were 10 jars and only one head
scrolls. And cave one in the jar with the seven scrolls that were in that jar was a complete
copy of the Book of Isaiah. I've got a picture, I've got a book over here with the original
colored pictures that Trevor did, the scholar Trevor living in Jerusalem at the Albright.
Beautiful pictures that are still used today in color. So everybody wondered, well, if you
compared the Isaiah of the Masoretic text, the traditional Hebrew text, with the Dead Sea Scroll
copy, because the Leningrad Codex, the oldest copy of the Masoretic text, is about 1000 AD CE.
And the Dead Sea Scroll Isaiah is probably 150-200 BCE. So you've jumped back over a thousand years,
probably 1200 years. It's hard to date exactly. But isn't that amazing? So you want to kind of
compare it. It is our Book of Isaiah. It has the same number of sections and chapters, and it
essentially has the same contents. But there are thousands of variations where it reads differently,
and sometimes those variations agree with the Septuagint or the Samaritan Penitude. Now, usually
people will say, well, it was essentially the same, and that's true. And it's also false. But it
probably, it probably depends on what you mean essentially. It is essentially the same. But
essentially the same doesn't mean you shouldn't notice the differences, as I'm going to show you
today, because the differences could be significant. And get ready for this. Some of the readings in
the Dead Sea Scrolls parallel the Moses Scroll. And Ross Nichols is currently working on a project
to compare all the readings of the Dead Sea Scrolls of Deuteronomy. And did you know some of those
are Paleo-Ebru, actually written in the ancient script, with the Moses Scroll transcript that we
have. And that's going to be a pretty long project, but he has begun that project. So that's going to
be pretty interesting. And I'm going to show you one of those today, one of the parallels,
where the Moses Scroll reads the same as one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is very, very interesting.
It sounds like maybe it's not a forgery, because I don't think Moses Shapiro had copies of the
Comron Scrolls, at least, that were found in 1947. I would encourage you all to,
when you think about fundamentalism and the Hebrew faith and what it is to follow the
God of Israel and so forth, to have an open view that there are pillars of the faith,
the call of Abraham, the Torah given at Sinai, the prophets, and so forth, that seem to be bedrock
for all forms of Judaism and Hebrew faith, even Gentiles that adhere to the Hebrew faith.
But essentially, you don't have to have a set view of what the text has to be, if it doesn't
conform to what we're discovering or what the facts are. And I think most of the people in
these particular audiences of the United Israel World Union, which is sponsoring this talk,
that I'm presenting here, this class, I think most of the people who follow
Ross Nichols' teaching week by week, he teaches on this channel every week at the same time.
And you're used to this, like you want all the scholarly information possible. And I'm
glad that that's the case. It's not a threat, it's a treasure trove of riches to delve into
these things. So let's start with Deuteronomy chapter 5 verse 12. If you have a Hebrew Bible,
whatever translation doesn't matter, because it'll probably be the Maseridic text,
go ahead and turn to Deuteronomy 5, and you will then have the standard version of the
traditional Hebrew text. So it's on page 154 in this Dead Sea Scrolls Bible. If you have the book,
you can follow along with the book. And it has to do with the 10 words. You know, one of the ways
of describing people say, what is United Israel World Union? It was formed in 1944 by a Jewish
correspondent and Bible student. His name was David Horowitz. And David Horowitz
coined the idea of decalogue faith for all nations. And we like that very much. The idea would be the
essential faith around the 10 words, the 10 commandments, should be for the whole world,
not simply for Jews. And so the decalogue faith. And as you know, one command of the decalogue faith
is in fact the Sabbath, to keep the Sabbath. Today is the Sabbath. So either remember or
observe the Sabbath day. So verse 12 does in fact say, observe the Sabbath day, keep it holy,
as the Lord commanded you. And it's actually the divine name, Y-H-V-H, which they write in
Paleo Hebrew, by the way. Six days you will labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a
Sabbath to the Lord, your God, and so forth. You should do no work. Now in Deuteronomy,
you have this idea that the reason you do this is because God brought the people of Israel out of
Egypt. And that's also in Exodus 31 as the reason. But as you know, there's also the idea that God
has commanded you to keep the Sabbath. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea
and all that is in them and rested the seventh day so that the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed
it. Now that's not in the Masoretic text at this spot of Deuteronomy. It is in the Moses scroll.
So there's the example. Now there's one, this, the Dead Sea Scroll copy, it's actually 4Q Deuteronomy,
it's called, from Cave 4. It's a fragment of Deuteronomy. It has the idea that the Sabbath
goes back to the creation. So it's connecting to Genesis 1 and 2 in the same way that the
Moses scroll does. And if you compare Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, you can see the two versions.
So this could be seen as an attempt to harmonize, like let's give both reasons. But on the other
hand, it could also be seen as maybe a tradition that the Dead Sea Scroll group is preserving that
would be older than the later tradition that we know as the Masoretic text. So that's the first
example I want to give. The second one is a couple of verses. It's in what's called the Song of Moses
and it's Deuteronomy 32. So if you go to Deuteronomy chapter 32, and you can see
down at verse 8, a very well-known verse that says, when the Most High
separated or gave to the nations their inheritance, he separated humankind and he set the bounds of
the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel. That's the Masoretic text. That's
probably what the translation says that most of you are reading, depending on which one you're
reading. However, in the Dead Sea Scroll portion, it says according to the sons of Elohim, the children
of God, and it uses Elohim. Isn't that interesting? Because Elohim is also used in the Moses scroll,
as you know. Many of you know who've read about it or read the book. So the sons of Elohim.
Now, the sons of Elohim could be considered the children of Israel, I suppose, but because of
another verse in this same chapter or in the same song, if you go down to verse 43, it's pretty clear
that it's talking about the sons of God or the Bene Elohim, as it is in Hebrew, that are the hosts
that surround God. Did I say Psalm 82? Remember, it talks about how God sits and is surrounded
by all of these gods or Elohim. So here's what verse 43 says in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and this would
be a 4-Q Deuteronomy also, K-4, the copy of Deuteronomy. It reads like this. This is going to be
different from what you have if you have the Messeridic text. Rejoice, O heavens, together with
him, and bow down to him all you gods, for he will avenge the blood of his sons, his children, his
banim, and will render vengeance to his enemies, and will recompense those who hate him, and will
atone for the land of his people. And so it's actually talking about bow down to him you gods,
this reference to you gods. Or in the, Sattuagen even has sons of God, which seems again to be these
ruling powers that are spoken of a number of times in the Hebrew Bible. I think I have this book handy.
Let's see if I do have it handy. I recommend. This includes the New Testament too, but the part on
the Hebrew Bible is really good. Michael Heiser's book, The Unseen Realm. Michael has an article
online. You can look it up called The Bene Elohim, The Sons of God. It's really good. He did his
dissertation on that subject, and he's a real expert on it. It's something to really study.
So here you have a text in the Dead Sea Scrolls that is talking about the Bene Elohim as seemingly
parallel to Psalm 82, meaning these heavenly beings, not simply talking about the flesh and
blood Israelites. So I think that's pretty interesting as we go along. Now Isaiah 53.
Isaiah 53 is really, really interesting. It was in Cave 1 in that jar that had the seven scrolls,
and it's a complete copy of Isaiah. I actually am going to pull up my copy here to show you.
Because it's so beautiful, I want you to see, and I think this is the color one. Yep,
this is the color one. So you can buy this. These are the photographs that Trevor originally made.
You've got the black and white and the color. Absolutely gorgeous photographs. If you've been
to Israel and been to the shrine of the book, there's a replica of this scroll wrapped around
the central scroll display area where you can see it almost like it's wrapped around
like a Torah scroll. And Israelis have fun taking their kids to see the Dead Sea Scrolls because
any kid in Israel can just read Isaiah right off the page even though it's in this Herodian script.
So it's pretty amazing how things have not changed. However, does Isaiah have changes?
Often, I remember when I first studied this, I was in a more conservative
school, Abilene Christian University, and there was more an emphasis on, you know, it's basically
the same as the Masoretic text. And it is. It's basically the same as the Masoretic text, and
it's quite remarkable that Isaiah is preserved to that degree. However, it does have interesting
readings that are different. A few of them are pretty minor, but I'm going to mention a few of
them, but some of them are quite strikingly different. So Isaiah 53, which is the famous
suffering servant hymn of Isaiah, one of the four suffering servant hymns, as they're traditionally
known by scholars, he revival scholars. And I'm going to read verse three. He was despised and
rejected by others, and I'm reading the Dead Sea version, and a man of sorrows and familiar with
suffering, and like one from whom people hide their faces, and we despised him and did not value him.
So the footnote explains that he was despised is the Masoretic text. Remember,
he was despised and rejected. Many people have that memorized. Notice this says we despised him,
and so in the Dead Sea scroll version of Isaiah, it's in the first person that we, and that would
go with verse four, surely he has borne our sufferings and so forth. If you go on down to,
let's see, verse eight, in the middle of just the last part of verse eight, for he was cut off from
the land of the living, he was stricken for the transgression of my people, and it's actually
his people. Instead of Ami, it's Amo, his people in the Dead Sea version. Does that make a difference?
Does that make a difference? Well, you can write it down and study it and think about it. You have
to read the whole chapter and think about it, but this is a version that has some parallels. And
remember, some of these are also, these readings that we're going over today, are also paralleled
in the Septuagint, the Greek translation, meaning that the Greek translators were also using a copy
of the Hebrew Bible that would be closer to what we have in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Verse nine says,
And they made his grave with the wicked. I believe the Masoretic text has he made,
doesn't it? Let's see, he made maybe? Yeah, they made, so it's plural. They made his grave with the
wicked and with rich people his tomb. And if you remember, the Masoretic text has this strange
plural with a rich man in his death's plural. And some people have really gotten off on that and
talked to try to apply it to Jesus and say, well, maybe he survived the cross and then died later.
So he has deaths, not death and all kinds of ideas people have come up with. But this just says,
with rich people was his tomb. As he was buried in a tomb, or this person's buried in a tomb,
I'm not talking about Jesus here, although he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth.
Yet the Lord, and this is Yod He Vav He Hashem, but the Lord was willing to crush him
and he made him suffer. So I think, let's see, he made him suffer, MT. Right, that's, I'm not sure
that, I don't have the MT open, so I'm not sure that that's not so significant for us right now.
Now here's the one I think is most interesting, verse 11. You ready? Verse 11. When I first
studied the Dead Sea Scrolls, I did a number of interviews. I remember Zola Levitt. Any of you
remember Zola Levitt? Had that very popular TV program. He was very excited about this reading
of the scroll. Because in the Dead Sea copy of the scrolls, it says, out of his suffering,
his soul will see light. Out of his suffering, his soul will see light and find satisfaction.
The idea of his soul seeing light is not in the Masoretic text. There's nothing like that.
It just says he will see the suffering of his soul. But to see light or is very, very
different. It's very clear in the scrolls. What that would mean, it was interpreted probably by
second temple groups that might have used a text like this to maybe mean resurrection.
Because toward the end, it talks about him
seeing his offspring and rejoicing and so forth and dividing the spoil.
And so you could see how the Dead Sea Scroll group would think that their teacher,
who they felt fulfilled this, the teacher of righteousness, they called him. He was their
leader and they saw him as a kind of a new Moses. But they would feel that basically that this
person maybe is going to suffer and be buried but also see light. And I cover that in my
lecture, Dead Messiahs Who Don't Return, because they expected him to return and he simply didn't.
There's some other things. This book is nice because whenever there's a difference,
it puts it in italics. And otherwise, it's the Masoretic text. So it's really easy to use. And
then you look down in the footnote and you see what the Masoretic text had, what the Septuagint
had, and what the Samaritan Pentateuch had. So Isaiah 53 is interesting. There's some differences
that might be significant. Finally, and I think this one is really, really interesting, Malachi,
the last of the Hebrew prophets, the famous passage in chapter 3 that is quoted in the New
Testament and applied to John the Baptizer, I call him the Baptizer, Yocanon Hamat Ville, John the
Dipper. I'll read it to you in the scroll version. You ready? Therefore, behold, I send my messenger
and he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his temple, the Lord whom you
seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Behold, he himself comes, says Hashem of
hosts, the Lord of hosts, the Eternal of hosts, but who can endure them? They come, meaning when
they come is the idea. Now, did you notice any difference in what you probably have, the Masoretic
text? It looks like it's two figures, two messiahs. The Lord here is not the divine name
when the Lord comes to his temple. That's Adon, L-O-R-D, the Lord, the Master, the Adon of the
earth, so to speak, could be a messiah figure. So let me read it again. Therefore, I will send my
messenger, that's one figure, he will prepare the way before me and they will suddenly come to his
temple, the Lord whom you seek and the messenger of the covenant. This group believed in two messiahs.
They believed in a priestly messiah, this Dead Sea Scroll group, and a Davidic messiah. So they
believe that both messiahs were coming and here you see two are talked about in the Dead Sea Scroll
version of Malachi. And then, excuse me, let me get a little drink of water.
Who can endure them when they come? Who can endure them when they come?
Which is original. I'm just tempted to think that the plural is the more original because we have
texts like Zachariah 6, it talks about the two messiahs. Earlier in Zachariah, with the two olive
branches and the lamp stand, they're the two sons of fresh oil, one on the right and one on the left.
And in Zachariah 6, you talk about the Davidic figure, the branch sitting on his throne and
then a priest standing by his side. So when you read the Dead Sea Scrolls, they believe in the
coming of two messiahs. They talk about the coming of the messiahs of Israel and Aaron. Israel
would be the messiah of Israel, the Davidic ruler, the king, and the messiah of Aaron would be the
priest. So the Dead Sea Scroll group had three figures. I've written a lot about this. I've
got articles about it. I've got an article on my blog called, One, Two, Three Messiahs,
question mark. So you can look that up, JamesTaver.com, if you want to read more about that.
But I'm thinking during the Second Temple period, there were expectations for three figures.
If you go by the scrolls, here are the figures. A prophet like Moses, a kind of second Moses who
would come, sort of middle figure. That would be the lamp stand figure, who's the adon of the whole
earth, the Lord of the whole earth. And he's able to inaugurate the new covenant. That was their view.
And they believe that he had come, the teacher of righteousness. They say things about him that
are quite extravagant. For the example, they say to him, God has made known all the mysteries of
the prophets, all the mysteries of the prophets. Amazing. And we have books like The Habakkuk
Pescher. That was also cave one. And that one jar, one of the seven scrolls that was found.
It's in the translation. You can read it. And it takes the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible
book of Habakkuk and then interprets it verse by verse. But it sees it in the light of the history
of the group, the Dead Sea Scroll Group, so that they actually apply it to their teacher. So
the lecture I gave or the YouTube video I gave was a bar lecture, biblical archaeology society
lecture. Dead messiahs who don't return goes into that in great detail. So you can listen to that
to get more details. But I'm thinking that essentially they're waiting, they have him,
and then they're waiting for the two messiahs. But I don't see any evidence in any of the scrolls
that the two messiahs ever showed up. And what happens is the teacher's killed. And on Yom Kippur,
the priest, the wicked, he's called the wicked priest because he's the priest they think is
illegitimate, the priest in Jerusalem, probably one of the high priests that we know about.
Depending on when you date the scrolls, it could go anywhere from the Maccabean period down to even
into the first century. I tend to think the teacher thrived in the first century BC,
but we have priests all the way through that period that are serving in the temple, and
Josephus preserves their names. We have all the names of these priests during this period.
Well, this group considers one of them a wicked priest, and he comes down on Yom Kippur. Now,
here's a question. How could he travel on Yom Kippur to the desert community at Comron? I mean,
I'm assuming for now that Comron is where the group was and where the teacher was, and some people
would say there's no absolute evidence for that, but I think it's a good possibility. How would he
come on Yom Kippur? Isn't the high priest in Jerusalem supposed to go into the temple on Yom
Kippur? So he couldn't be traveling down and persecuting this teacher of Comron unless they're
using a different calendar, and they are. Constantly on the scrolls, it says over and over again
that, I'm looking at my text messages, okay, sorry, getting buzz, but it's not, it's just
this, that, and the other. Constantly you read about the idea of
the calendar being different in the days, months, seasons, and years being different because they're
using a solar calendar, and it's a beautiful calendar. It's a very interesting calendar.
If you take a look at my YouTube lecture on my YouTube channel, it's called the
Essene Calendar Made Simple. Believe it or not, you can make it simple, and you can even put it
on a single page. I've got somewhere, a page, I don't know if I have it right here, but I'm going
to put it up on my blog with that lecture where you can see what kind of calendar they had. As far as I
know, these two messiahs, though, didn't come. So the wicked priest, as his call came down and
persecuted the teacher, it's possible the teacher was killed. Maybe we're not absolutely sure about
that. And then the group decides that the end will come because, remember, it's an apocalyptic group.
They think they're going to live to see the end, just like the followers of Jesus. And it didn't
come, and they say it's going to come in about 40 years. And then when 40 years pass, instead of
losing their faith, they talk about God has prolonged the seasons, has prolonged the time,
very similar to the kind of thing you find, say, in Peter, I think, isn't it? Second Peter,
God's long suffering. You know, he doesn't always do things according to what people thought.
And they also conclude that all the times predicted by the book of Daniel have been
fulfilled, but the end didn't come. Therefore, not that we're wrong, but, you know, that our
interpretation is wrong, that they weren't fulfilled, because they haven't been fulfilled.
They believe that God is giving more grace, more time, and it's going to be longer. And even though
the date was right, God decided not to send the wrath and the judgment and the end of the age
on time, which would have been 40 years after the death of the teacher. How did they come up with
that 40 years? They believe there's a final cycle of 10 jubilees, 49-year jubilees, 490 years.
They interpret Daniel 9, the so-called 70 weeks prophecy, and they've placed their teacher
in the 10th week. And then they begin to talk about in the final 49-year period,
everything will come, and then it didn't come. It didn't happen. And so they're basically disappointed.
And they decide that God has decided to prolong the days. How long did the movement last? It's
hard to know, but given this flexibility with the text of Habakkuk, I think we could presume
that they went into the first century. I would think some of the followers of John the Baptist
and Jesus might have had grandparents and parents that had known the teacher and maybe were kind of
part of that general Messianic movement. Eisman calls it the Messianic movement of Palestine.
He uses the term Palestine, which the scholars used to describe the Holy Land, but the Messianic
movement of the land of Israel. And I would say that there are probably remnants of that,
because if you look at the Jesus movement, there's so, just as I mentioned, a lot of parallels.
Not only the apocalyptic wilderness, new covenant kind of thing, but also the idea of sacred meals,
a bread and wine that you couldn't per take of. It's called the pure meal of the saints,
the specified ones. They're very separationist in terms of their piety and their idea.
They have a council of 12 and an inner council of three. Does that remind you of anything?
And yet the Jesus movement is very, very different from what you read in the scrolls in terms of
interpreting the Torah. The best example in this lecture is not on that, but I want to kind of close
with this where you get a feeling of what they're all about. In the scrolls, it says that if a beast
or animal falls into a pit on the Sabbath, you must not help the animal out, because it's the Sabbath.
And there's a command in the Sabbath that you stay in your dwelling. And they took that very
literally. Literally, you don't leave the camp. By the way, latrines, they don't even go outside the
camp on the Sabbath to go to the toilet. Josephus mentions that about the Essenes. He presents it
as something admirable. Like, wow, they're so dedicated. They go for 24 hours without going to
the toilet. And some of you know that Josiahs and I, a few years ago, we think we discovered the
latrines that come run exactly as the scrolls describe northwest of the camp, 1,000 cubits to
2,000 cubits away from the camp, hidden from view, is the area where we did soil samples and we think
we located their latrines. There's a cemetery nearby with over 1,100 graves, mostly male,
and there's some dispute about the female because there are a few women, and they haven't all been
excavated just to sample. But Zias thinks that the women are later burials of Badawan women.
They just took advantage of a local cemetery. They're not ancient. But by far, most of them are
men and therefore possibly come around as a celibate community. So you do get these parallels,
but you also get differences. Jesus says, I think it's in Luke, which of you would not take a beast
out of a pit on the Sabbath, as if to say, anybody would do that. And believe me, you know, this
picking grain on the Sabbath story that's in Mark chapter 2 and Matthew chapter 12, where the disciples
pick grain, the scrolls specifically say that you must prepare your meals before the Sabbath.
That's in the Torah, all right? So you can, that's considered, you didn't prepare that before the
Sabbath. Also, it's threshing or harvesting, which is forbidden on the Sabbath. So they, the scroll
people back in the days of the teacher, in the time when these things were written, the sectarian
scrolls, they would just be appalled that the disciples of Jesus are harvesting barley and
popping the grain in their mouth when they're famished. And if you remember the response of
Jesus was not like, oh, well, sorry, we broke the law, but it was basically like, well, you know,
the Sabbath's made for people, not people for the Sabbath. So the idea of being humane to an animal
or taking care of human need on the Sabbath, which the Pharisees also taught, and they made
certain allowances to allow you to keep the Sabbath in less of a strict way. Whereas the
carites later did not. And I'd have to check with Nehemia Gordon to see today how they're defining
the dwelling. Because if you can't go out of your house during the Sabbath, your dwelling, does that
mean your literal house you live in, like the rooms you inhabit or apartment? Or does it mean your town?
Or does it mean your city? If you're in a large city, all these things are interpreted differently
by Judaism over the years. Some of you might know there is around the city of Jerusalem today a wire
or thread like element up on poles all the way around the city. And that the rabbis define
Jerusalem as the dwelling of the people in Jerusalem. So you don't go out of your dwelling,
meaning you don't go out of the city of Jerusalem, but you can go anywhere in the city of Jerusalem.
This group would have been horrified at any of those kinds of interpretations. I think they would
have been very upset with Jesus for any number of things that he did. So I don't think Jesus is
part of this. Some people think John the Baptist is and they try to make him really rigid and
conservative. But you know, the only traditions we have of John the Baptist, he's actually pretty
accommodating. He talks to Roman soldiers. He talks to tax collectors and blesses them and says,
you're fine. You can come in the movement. Of course, everybody has to repent. But I mean,
he seems like he's more accepting. I would put John the Baptist, Jesus and James sort of on a plane,
even though they might have had some differences. So this is an lecture on the Jesus movement.
But because it's another parallel Second Temple apocalyptic movement of the time, I want to mention
it. So they take both movements, the Jesus movement and the Dead Sea Scroll movement.
They're reading these texts and we have to wonder what version. We know the Qumran group was reading
the version that we just studied. But is there evidence that in the New Testament that some of
the texts that were being quoted were actually they're quoting more the Septuagint or the Dead Sea
Scrolls? And the answer is yes. That's why some of the readings differ quite a bit, because they're
quoting a different version. They're not just changing the Bible they're using. I guess you
could say a different text of that particular book of the Bible. So I hope that has been interesting
to you. You'll get the Dead Sea Scroll Bible, delve into it. I'm particularly excited about
what Ross will be able to uncover in looking at all the Scrolls of Deuteronomy from the Dead Sea
Collection and comparing them to the Shapira Scroll. And as I said earlier, that could be
quite telling, because Shapira would not have known these versions of Deuteronomy in Hebrew if
there are parallels. And we've already seen a couple. Then how would he have forged the document
and made up readings that are later going to be discovered in 1947 in caves? But remember he found
the Moses Scroll in a cave wrapped in linen with a sticky residue around it. It sounds kind of like
the discovery of the Qumran Scrolls. So some of you are going on the trip with us in October.
And we'll do other trips as well in the future if you can't make this one. But one of the things
we're going to do is stay in the desert for, what is it, three nights, I think, and we're going to
visit Qumran and we're going to visit Masada and we're going to walk around these caves and it's
going to be very exciting. Dead Sea Scroll News breaks all the time like that Esther Scroll
discovery that I just told you about. During the time I've been teaching my Dead Sea Scroll class
this semester, we've had several major news stories on the Dead Sea Scrolls break. So
it's really an exciting field to be in. I'm really, really interested and fascinated with the Dead Sea
Scrolls. I've studied them for years and I hope this will encourage all of you to study them too.
So Shabbat Shalom and wish you all well.
