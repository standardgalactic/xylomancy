Did you know Earth, the ground we walk on and grow our crops in, is the most abundantly used
building material on the planet? With over 3 billion people living, working, learning, playing,
and socializing in buildings constructed from materials such as soil, clay, mud, and cob.
Earth material technology has also been studied, improved upon, and refined for thousands of years.
However, building with Earth is often associated with being poor,
backward, and primitive. All over the world, industrialization has led to an abandonment
of Earth building traditions, replaced by heavy investments into expensive and fossil fuel dependent
materials such as steel and concrete. Earth, on the other hand, is a material with excellent
thermal mass properties and low embodied energy.
In West Africa, building with clay or adobe can be traced back thousands of years.
The doggone people of what is today Mali and Northwestern Burkina Faso had developed a highly
sophisticated Earth building technique that is now at risk of disappearing due to the ongoing
military conflicts. In Vitruvius's 10 books on architecture, a seminal architectural treatise
from classical antiquity, there is an entire chapter dedicated to mud brick masonry. Vitruvius
saw it as a material that exemplifies what he believed to be the primary qualities of architecture,
Formitas, Utilitas, and Venustas. The Egyptian architect Hassan Fathi, known for reviving and
improving the techniques of traditional mud construction in Egypt, utilized the thermodynamic
properties of Earth to create passively cooled structures on a large urban scale. His highly
influential book, Architecture for the Poor, demonstrated how mud brick is a low-cost, sustainable,
and beautiful material available to essentially everyone on Earth. The reason Earth building
materials are excellent thermal masses is because they act as natural thermal batteries that absorb
heat during the day and slowly release heat at night, which can maintain comfortable interior
temperatures without the need for mechanical heating and cooling during all seasons. Earth
assemblies generally have a high R value, which means it's a very insulating material that can
lead to lower energy consumption even when mechanical heating and cooling are used. Earth
also requires very little energy to extract and manufacture, and is made of highly recyclable content.
At the end of an Earth-constructed building's life, they simply melt back into the ground,
which can be reused to grow vegetation or harnessed in the future for building materials again.
So why has the industrial world largely rejected Earth construction? It may be due to the fact that
soil composition differs from region to region, making it difficult to standardize on a large
industrial scale. It is, in fact, illegal to build with mud brick in some regions due to
building code regulations. Are these decisions made entirely for safety reasons, or were they
results of lobbying by industrial material manufacturers not wanting their businesses
to be threatened by such a low-cost, abundantly available, and versatile material?
While mud bricks are not permitted by certain building codes, the use of compressed Earth blocks
CEBs is often welcomed. CEB was first invented by French architect François Quentinot in 1803,
when he developed a mechanical press to compact Earth into dense blocks. In 1952,
Colombian engineer Raúl Ramirez made a critical advancement to CEB technology by inventing a
manually operated machine that is small, portable, and capable of mass production.
A critical ingredient of CEB is mixing a small percentage of cement to stabilize it,
resulting in higher material strength and weather resistance. CEB also requires very little moisture
to produce, does not require firing or curing, can be used straight out of the machine,
do not shrink or crack, has a smooth surface which can be left exposed without a finishing overcoat,
and is considered aesthetically pleasing due to its natural appearance appealing to human's
affinity to biofuelic materials. An innovative example of CEB construction is by the architect
Diabeto Francis Carey, who employs the use of locally available resources, traditional material
techniques in concert with modern solutions, and local community participation in the design
and building process. Carey is from Gando, a small remote village in Bikina Faso, which is a
landlocked, low-income West African nation with limited natural resources. The nation has also
been experiencing frequent extreme climate events and tremendous political instability in recent
years. There is little to no access to education in Gando. In 1985, Carey received a scholarship to
study carpentry in Germany, and in 1995 he decided to enroll into the architecture program at Berlin's
Tachniche Universitat. While he was studying at TU, villagers back in Gando asked him for help with
repairing the village's only school built after he left, which was at risk of collapse. In 1998,
he established a charity, School Building Blocks for Gando, to raise money for building a new school,
and began working closely with the community on the design. The new primary school building,
completed in 2001, is comprised of three detached rectangular classrooms under a single inclined
roof. The walls are built from compressed earth blocks connected by earth mortar. Giving people
a good education is very important to Francis Carey. So before I tell you more about his school
design, I want to tell you a bit about today's highly educational sponsor. Architects, engineers,
construction and design professionals know that continuing education isn't just a requirement
of maintaining professional credentials or licensing. It also helps them to stay on top of
industry information and ahead of design trends to keep their skills in demand. AEC Daily offers
over a thousand free accredited courses to keep you up to date and your careers moving ahead. They
offer relevant training in construction risk evaluation, safety, international building codes
and regulations, project management, LEED and more. I have actually personally used AEC Daily for
years to keep up with my continuing education credits, so I can personally vouch for their
fantastic library of interesting and beneficial courses. So head over to aecdaily.com for your
source of free accredited courses. Link in the description below. Now back to talking about dirt.
Industrial materials like concrete and steel are hard to come by in Gando and wood is minimally
available due to deforestation. Thus clay is a material widely used for buildings in the region
for the past several hundred years. However, it's often considered a temporary material as it tends
to wash away under heavy rains. Kerry believed in the use of clay because it's free and locally
available. The reddish earth color fits organically into the surroundings and it has a historical
connection with the people. To improve performance, the clay compound was mixed with about six percent
cement to achieve stable and uniform bricks that are more weather resistant. He also introduced
the portable manually operated press, making it possible to easily produce CEBs on site.
To address the sweltering hot conditions where temperatures can often get as hot as 45 degrees
Celsius, Kerry pulled the building's roof away from the top of the classroom. This results
in a stack effect that creates a continuous air circulation by drawing in cool air from the windows
which rises through the porphyrated clay ceilings and vents out the perimeter gap below the roof
canopy. This design feature alleviates the need for costly and energy intensive air conditioning.
Thus, a passively cooled building with a low ecological footprint was created out of necessity.
Francis Kerry's designs are able to achieve durability, usefulness, and beauty through
paying close attention to the simplest building block of architecture, the material. He also
demonstrates why a deep connection to material culture may be the key to achieving economic
independence for developing African nations as well as creating a more sustainable future for the
rest of the world. So is earth this building material of the past actually the material of
the future? Maybe I personally think we should be building with mud and clay a lot more than we
currently do, but it obviously isn't a solution in every scenario. I think the more important lesson
we should take away from earth construction is a careful consideration of limited resources,
passive building techniques, human factors, and local cultures. Let me know what you guys think
in the comments below. As always, thank you guys so much for watching. I recently decided to go back
to school for a master's degree, and this video is actually an adaptation of one of my assignments.
If you enjoyed this video, feel free to check out more like it right here, and I'll see you guys next
time. Are these decisions made entirely for safety reasons? I don't know. I don't know the answer to
that.
