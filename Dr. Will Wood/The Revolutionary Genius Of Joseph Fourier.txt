Joseph Fourier changed mathematics forever. He was the first person to really understand how
heat works and he needed some radical maths to be able to deal with it. That's how Fourier series
were first discovered. But this was still a long way away in 1795 when 27-year-old Fourier had
spent the last month in prison. This video was sponsored by Brilliant.
You see, for the past few years, this mathematics teacher turned revolutionary
at being involved in the reign of terror, a movement which had seen thousands sent to the
guillotine. But as political tensions eased for a short while, Fourier got a second chance and for
the next few years his life was pretty calm. He got back into teaching and it seems like Fourier
was a great teacher. In two years he became chair of analysis and mechanics at the Ecole Polytechnique,
replacing the eminent Joseph Louis Lagrange. This ended abruptly in 1798 when a letter said
his talents were needed for the sake of public service and he should prepare to leave immediately.
This public service, it turns out, was the invasion of Egypt led by Napoleon Bonaparte.
Here Fourier was put in charge of the Corrie de l'Egypt, a newspaper basically promoting
propaganda for Napoleon. He was also made secretary for the Institute of Egypt which
was founded by Napoleon to carry out scientific and historical research. It's said that at one
point Fourier was the unofficial governor of large parts of Egypt while Napoleon was way fighting.
When he finally got back to France about three years later Fourier was given another powerful
political position as prefect of his heir, handed to him by Napoleon. But more importantly for us,
this is where he started work on what would become some of the biggest ideas in mathematics history.
In the early 1800s, heat was a mystery. What it was, and more crucially a mathematical description
of how it works, was at the top of the agenda for all the top scientists and mathematicians.
When Fourier turned his attention to the problem of heat, there were two well-established
principles. First there was Newton's law of cooling where heat flux from an object is a constant,
the heat transfer rate, times the surface area, times the difference in temperature.
And secondly, pioneering experiments by Lavoisier and Laplace, in which they built the first
calorimeters, showed that different materials had different capacities for heat storage.
They worked out that an increment of heat, dq, it takes to raise the temperature of a mass m
by an increment dt, is equal to a constant c called the specific heat capacity of the material
times m. A material with a high specific heat capacity therefore takes more heat to raise its
temperature. Since an object's mass is its density rho multiplied by its volume v, we can also write
this as equal to c times rho times v, which will turn out to be more useful later.
Fourier wanted to calculate the flow of heat through solid objects. You see, every point in
space has its own temperature, so temperature is a function of space, but heat will flow from
hotter regions to colder regions and so it changes over time. This means temperature is also a function
of time. His brilliant insight was that if these two laws are true on the objects as a whole,
it should also be true within small pieces of the object. So he could use Newton, Laplace,
and Lavoisier's laws to calculate heat flow within an object by breaking it up into infinitesimally
small pieces. Take Newton's law for instance, which tells us how heat flows across a surface area.
Well, if we imagine some tiny piece of surface area, ds, and suppose it's perpendicular to the x-axis,
and is at x equals a, heat flow through it, dq, is Newton's law with the area replaced by ds,
and the temperature difference is the derivative of the temperature with respect to x evaluated at
x equals a. This is now called Fourier's law. Now let's take a volume dv, which is a tiny cube
of material with sides of length dx, and each face has an area ds. The heat flux into it per
unit time will be the amount going in from one side, dq1, minus the amount leaving from the other side,
dq2. Although I should say that we're not actually making assumptions about which way heat is going,
this is about the amount of flow in the x direction. dq1 and dq2 can be positive or negative.
Fourier's law applied to this volume gives us heat flux in and out, but we can make things easier
with some work on this dt by dx at a plus dx term. Rather than dt by dx at a plus dx, we want something
involving dt by dx at x equals a. Since dx is small, we can assume that dt by dx is approximately
a straight line over this range. We know that the dt by dx term at x equals a plus dx will be
whatever it was at x equals a, plus however much it's increased over the range dx, which we'll call
dt. From basic calculus, we can get dt as the second derivative of t with respect to x evaluated at
a multiplied by dx. So finally, we have dt by dx at x equals a plus dx is the derivative of t at a
plus the second derivative of t at a multiplied by dx. If you know Taylor series, you might recognize
this as the first order Taylor expansion. This is an important step because if we put that back
into the equation for dq, we find that the dt by dx terms cancel. And so we're left with k times
d squared t by dx squared times ds times dx times dt. This is where the specific heat capacity comes
in. One thing to notice is that we have ds dx on the left hand side and dv on the right. But these
are the same thing. And so they also cancel. If we divide both sides by dt, we're left with d
temperature by dt is a constant alpha and I've simplified things by combining the previous
constants times the second derivative of temperature with respect to x. This is now what we call the
heat equation. Actually, this is the one dimensional heat equation because we're only considering heat
along the x axis. But if we want to add extra dimensions, all we need to do is add the second
derivative terms for each axis because we can think of heat flow happening independently in x,
y and z. What it does is given the current temperature as a function of x, it says where
the second derivative that's the curvature is negative, temperature will decrease as heat
flows away from this region. And where the second derivative is positive, so the function is
curving upwards, the temperature will increase as heat flows in. This makes intuitive sense because
the negatively curved regions represent local hot spots and positively curved regions represent local
cold spots. This was a huge breakthrough for Fourier. Not only is it still the best model of
heat we have today, but it's also been applied in many other scenarios including the diffusion of
molecules in liquids and the movement of stock market prices. But the problem was now that Fourier
had discovered the heat equation, how do you actually solve it? Solving the heat equation means
finding a function t of the spatial variables x, y and z if we're working in 3d and time t
that you can plug into both sides and the equality holds. But this is a partial differential equation
meaning it has derivatives in more than one variable and these are notoriously hard to solve.
Laplace had been studying a simpler partial differential equation and had found a solution
that was useful to Fourier. For some function u, we have the sum of its second derivatives is equal
to zero. You might notice that it's like the heat equation but it's got no time component.
Some of you who've studied vector calculus might also know there's a shorthand for this
equation. The Laplacian of u equals zero. Trying to solve the two-dimensional version,
Laplace found a useful approach was to look for solutions of the form of sum function f of x only
times some function g of y only. For example, if we have u of x and y is equal to e to the
minus kx times cosine of ky, we can plug this into Laplace's equation and show that it is a solution.
Laplace also found that if you have more than one solution, you can combine them in a series with
arbitrary constants that I've written here as a, b and c etc. This is called a linear combination
of solutions. So for example, taking the earlier general solution, we can form a new one by taking
a linear combination of a set of them with different coefficients k1, k2, k3 etc.
Now back to Fourier. He realized that Laplace's equation was useful for the 2d heat equation.
He imagined a metal sheet which was infinitely long in the x direction and went from minus pi
over 2 to plus pi over 2 in the y direction. It sounds very arbitrary but he did have a good reason.
If we imagine fixing the temperature at 1 at x equals 0 like it's being heated at this end
and on the other edges, y equals plus or minus pi over 2, the temperature is fixed at 0.
These are the boundary conditions. Now the sheet would heat up for a period of time
and then settle at a steady state, that is the temperature would stop changing.
What Fourier realized is that in the steady state, the temperature stops changing with time,
the derivative of the temperature with respect to time goes to 0 and the heat equation becomes
Laplace's equation. That means we already have a solution for the steady state. We can use Laplace's
general solution. This is why Fourier made the sheet with these particular dimensions.
He thought he might be able to find the right values for the coefficients to make the solution
fit the boundary conditions. Firstly, since cosine of y is 0, only when y is an odd number
multiplied by plus or minus pi over 2, we can say that the values k1, k2 etc are just the odd numbers.
This gives us the right values along the t equals 0 edges but we need to make sure that t is always
equal to 1 when x is 0. At x equals 0, all the exponential components become 1 which means
Fourier was left with finding the coefficients such that this infinite series is equal to 1.
Remember that y varies between minus pi over 2 to pi over 2, so this is the same of finding an
infinite series of cosines such that they always add up to 1. But how do you go about finding these
coefficients? Fourier's approach was genius. Realising that integrating cosine of mx times
cosine of nx is 0 if m is not equal to n and pi over 2 if n equals n. If you want to have a go about
proving this, try using the product identity for cosines. This gave Fourier a way to calculate
any coefficient he wanted. Suppose you want to calculate c, the coefficient of cosine of 5y.
You can multiply both sides by cosine 5y and integrate from minus pi over 2 to plus pi over 2.
Using the laws of integration, we can distribute the integral. Now all of the integrals with
different cosines we know will be 0. This leaves only the one we're interested in and we know the
right hand side integral is pi over 2 from our product rule already.
The left hand integral we can work out to give 2 over 5 and this means that c is equal to 4 over 5pi.
Working out the other coefficients gives an expression for 1 in the form of an infinite
trigonometric series. Now Fourier knew this idea went way beyond just solving the heat equation.
In fact, when he published his book The Analytical Theory of Heat in 1822, Fourier
dedicated large sections just to the study of these trigonometric series. What he recognised
was the generality of the method. He said using this approach we can find a trigonometric series
expansion for all possible functions including discontinuous ones and he gives us the method
of finding the coefficients. This method is of course what we now know as Fourier series.
That is, given a function defined on some range, usually minus pi to plus pi, any range is acceptable
but there has to be some scaling, we can write f of x as a series of sines and cotines with the
coefficients a sub n equal to 1 over pi times the integral of f of x times cosine of nx and b sub
n as 1 over pi times the integral of f of x times sine nx. If you want to explore more applications
