Well thank you very much Peter for that introduction and let me say what a huge pleasure it is
to come back to the Karolinska Institute. The last time I was here I think was about
three years ago for a meeting on systems biology and cancer. You know I'm always asked to talk
about subjects about which I have no right to claim any knowledge whatsoever. Interestingly
enough at that meeting I think quite a lot of other people thought exactly the same. We
had a very interesting meeting. What I'm going to do today is to address Schrodinger's question
which of course it was the question what is life. Those lectures were given in 1943 at
the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies and they were of course the lectures in which
Schrodinger first made his famous prediction that the genetic material would be what he
called a non-periodic crystal. I still and I think many others do too, still think that's
an extremely good description of course of what was eventually found in the DNA. He also
though drew a comparison between on the one hand physics and on the other hand biology and his
idea in that book was that they were really very different because physics deals with order
emerging from disorder. You have the disorder of the random movements of the molecules of a gas
but you also have the order of the gas laws and of thermodynamics. By contrast he argued
biology is about order from order because where is the order down at the low level it is in that a
periodic crystal and I think his idea gave rise of course later on or helped to give rise to the
interpretations that were made of the early results in molecular biology of DNA when the
double helix was discovered and when people began to work out what the coding was between DNA
and proteins which was to lead to the idea that there was in a sense in the DNA a determinant
program. So unlike physics you would go from particular events in molecules to particular
events in the global property of the organism that is the phenotype. Now of course it's a hard
thing to say that perhaps Herdinger was wrong but I think he was and I would like to substitute that
the view that I and many others now express about biology and it's certainly expressed in the book
The Music of Life which is that indeed physics deals with order from disorder but biology also must
most of the time do the same because what do we find down at the level of the individual gene
expressions we find stochasticity. If I take the gene expression levels in the ventricular cells of
one region of the heart and compare them to the expression levels of those genes in an adjacent
region of the heart I will find that they vary. Now of course they vary to some extent according
to the anatomy of the heart and that is both well known and is also important in the functioning
of the heart but they also vary stochastically even between neighboring cells. Stochasticity
therefore has to be a feature of biology as well as order. Of course we have a little bit of a
dilemma which I'll refer to a little bit later on which is that we know well that there are certain
changes that occur down at the molecular level particularly mutations which will produce or be
the cause of a major change in function at the level of the phenotype but what has emerged in the
research has been done over the last decades is that those cases are actually quite rare. I find
that in my work on the heart there are certain modifications certain mutations of particular
ion channels that can produce a catastrophic situation predisposing towards arrhythmia but
most of the time the heart works perfectly well just as the pancreas does just the brain does
despite all the variations that occur at the lower levels. So why should a physiologist be
concerned about the question what is life? First of all to be concerned with that you have got to be
concerned with the central theory of biology or the central story of biology because I think that
what we call evolutionary theory is actually a story it's a history which of course is the central
idea without which any form of discussion of the question what is life can't make sense.
Moreover the dominant theory of evolution over most of the 20th century and into this century was
of course the modern synthesis sometimes called neodialwinism and that of course was a gene-centered
theory of evolution with its determinant idea of there being a program that leads to the development
of the organism but in fact organisms are extremely good at immunizing themselves from
variations in their genomes. We're going to look at a few examples of that in just a moment and some
of the examples are discussed in that article in the Royal Society's new journal Interface Focus.
Let's just give a little bit of background from my own work as the introducer said I was responsible
for working on some of the early discoveries of iron channels in the heart and that led me to put
this model of rhythm in the heart together in 1960 here's the electrical potential showing rhythm
that emerges as a cell property not a molecular property from the interactions between the various
iron channels. In those days we actually thought there weren't many more channels than there are
in nerve a sodium channel two potassium channels and a background leak we now know there are many more
and in fact later on if we go now through to about 25 years later in work that I did with
Adari Di Francesco we found there were many many more potassium channels than we thought initially
and of course by that time Harold Reuter had made his great discoveries of calcium channels
and of sodium calcium exchange. We were also responsible in the work with Adari Di Francesco
at discovering a new non-specific cation channel which is responsible for this phase
of the rhythm and also for clarifying the role of the sodium calcium exchange. Now that's all
technical detail and I don't want to dwell on that what I want to do is to use that model to
perform a very interesting experiment so what we're going to do is to use a version of that model
that was developed for the rhythm generator of the natural rhythm generator of the heart
which is the sinus node and I'm just plotting two of the channel properties a background sodium
channel and the non-specific cation channel I referred to earlier this one normally contributes
about 80 percent of the depolarizing current it is therefore the rhythm generator if you like
and as you knock it down you can notice 20 percent 40 percent all the way to complete knock out you
might expect a very large change in frequency in fact the change in frequency is very modest
only about 10 percent and what is happening of course is the system is allowing this other
mechanism to kick in and to keep the rhythm buffered as it were from the change at the
lower level and you can even use the physiological interpretation of what is going on to work out
what is happening because if you draw a line along those voltage traces you can see that the
traces at this end are moving into a more negative range of electrical potential it's
precisely that that activates the other channel to kick in and to keep the rhythm fairly constant
and that is a general property of cardiac rhythm it's a general property of other rhythm generators
too for example of circadian rhythm there are backup mechanisms many more examples of what you
might call knockout that don't actually succeed in producing a very large phenotypic effect
this is from some work again fairly technical detail but i won't dwell on the technical detail
other than to say that a targeted knockout done in experiments first and then by simulation
reproducing the experiments of ken phillipson targeted knockout of the sodium calcium exchange
produces almost no change in overall electrical function now is this a specific property of
some of denny's nobles work on the heart or is it general i was delighted therefore when i saw
this systematic study by hillan mayer and his colleagues in yeast working through the six
thousand genes and producing what they called a chemical genomic portrait of yeast what did they
find genetic buffering is general 80 percent of the knockouts are silent under normal physiological
conditions that doesn't mean to say that those genes don't have a function far from it they
do code for a protein that protein is produced of course what you have to do if you want to reveal
that function is to stress the organism for example with metabolic stress and then you
can begin to reveal the function there are many more examples i won't dwell on that other than to
say that if you want to understand regulators in biological systems which is part of an answer
to the question what is life life is a regulated process then you don't get that most of the time
from knockout experiments as i said earlier on sometimes you do biology therefore is a mix
occasionally it is order from order but often it is also order from disorder in a sense just like
physics though i think there are some important differences as well for those who want to follow
up on that question this lovely article in bio essays is worth reading so what is going on
and here i want to also digress a little bit on the concept of a gene because i think two things
are going on here first of all extensive buffering of organisms against genomic change
that's now documented i think sufficiently well to say that it's a fairly general phenomenon
but there's another major concept that i want to introduce which is that the concept of a gene has
changed and changed in a very significant way indeed and it's central to understanding what is
wrong with current evolutionary biology theory that is the near Darwinist theory
the way i explain this is to say that we have DNA obviously we have a phenotype of course it's a bit
artificial to draw complete distinctions between the two as i will quote with Barbara McClintock
later on the DNA is also after all the part of the phenotype but i think we all know what we're
saying here here's the genetic material in the sense that the molecular biologists would
use that term today here's the interaction with the environment here is if you like the complete
phenotype and what we know is of course that all of these interact in bi-directional ways
that's also important with the biological networks the signaling pathways the filters
the conditioners and so on which actually generate the function if we want an answer to the question
therefore what is life it's inside here if i take the DNA out of a cell if i could do just that
and put it into a petri dish i could keep it for 10 000 years and it would do nothing
it's the rest of the system of course that tells the genome when it wants to make particular
proteins it's the rest of the system that gives the dynamism now i come to the point about the
definition of genes when Johansson in 1909 first introduced the word gene of course following
in the footsteps of Mendel who didn't use that word but he had exactly the concept what he actually
meant was a discrete inheritable phenotype what we now mean of course by a gene is a particular
stretch of DNA now the important point i want to make is that not only are those two definitions
not the same that's obvious from the fact that this only includes this part of the diagram
whereas this includes the whole diagram they are conceptually different too
because Johansson's definition is all inclusive he actually says that in his article he says
it's a something it doesn't all it doesn't really matter whether it was DNA or not of course they
did not know about DNA at that time and incidentally Richard Dawkins uses exactly the same definition
most of the time as Johansson he also says it is as it were a general concept it is if you like
a catch all concept but of course the problem with catch all concepts that say and include
everything is that they can't be tested it is a necessary truth a conceptually necessary truth
that a gene defined in this way as the cause of a particular phenotype characteristic
is just that it is the cause you don't ask the question is it a cause it is so by definition
now the situation of course with the definition of a gene that is done in terms of a DNA sequence
is that precisely that question can be asked there is an empirical question to be settled which is
does that particular piece of DNA have a big effect on the phenotype you can perform that
experiment with the kinds of knockout experiments I've already described so the difference is
fundamental now where is the deep problem in the neo Darwinist thesis particularly as expressed by
people like Richard Dawkins in popularizing it the problem lies here that if you want to distinguish
clearly and unambiguously between the replicator which is of course the DNA and the vehicle which
of course is the organism that carries the DNA then you must use this definition of the gene
if you use this one the one that Johannson first introduced then it doesn't make sense
to draw a distinction between the replicator and the vehicle because this definition includes
much more than the DNA and I don't think that point has been properly appreciated
in relation to knockout experiments of course to represent the fact that most knockouts and
mutations are buffered but knocking out just one gene may not get through to the phenotype
because it gets absorbed as I showed in those computations but also in the experiments in
which they're based a bit earlier but two of course may be enough to get through or you may
need to do three who knows that's a matter open to empirical investigation so I want to turn now
to a few other aspects in which the answer to the question what is life taking particularly
evolutionary biology as absolutely central to that question to answering it properly
poses today some very big problems but what we need to do is to first go through a very brief
history of evolutionary biology and I start by going back just over 200 years to Jean Baptiste
Le Marc who published the zoology philosophique his great work in 1809 exactly 50 years incidentally
before Darwin's origin of species Jean Baptiste Le Marc actually invented the term biology
he was one of those the first as it were therefore defined our subject as a separate subject from other
natural science subjects but he also did something else which is very famous he certainly espoused
and popularized and used the theory that there was inheritance of acquired characteristics and
many of you will know that of course it is a clear feature of the modern synthesis or of
neo Darwinism that that process is excluded for reasons I'll come on to a little bit later
Darwin of course published his origin of species in 1859 proposed of course the theory of natural
selection of course neither he nor Le Marc or anybody else that time had a theory of genetics
and heredity in that sense they didn't know of Mendel's work until it was rediscovered later
now an important point to make Darwin also assumed the presence and function of the inheritance
of acquired characteristics it's present in the origin of species in 12 different places
unambiguous all documented incidentally by Ernst Mayer many years ago in his great book
biological thought in 1982 further Charles Darwin in I think it's the fourth edition of the origin
of species specifically praises Le Marc as this great biologist who championed the idea that there
was transformation of species originating from a common ancestor Darwin was not a neo Darwinist
that's a very important message we'll come on to the significance of that a bit later on
so what gave rise to neo Darwinism what gave rise to neo Darwinism was of course the work of
Weissman who introduced the idea which we now call the Weissman barrier that is the specific
exclusion of the inheritance of acquired characteristics and the idea was of course that
the inherited material wherever it was and of course he didn't know where it was at that time
is immune from the rest of the system the rest of the system however it develops in the lifetime
of an individual cannot influence the genome as we would now call it and of course that later
became encapsulated in Francis Crick's idea of the central dogma of molecular biology
let me just also make a brief explanation at this point in the paper in which he defines
the central dogma in 1970 Crick was actually very careful he referred to the fact that of course
DNA sequences code for protein amino acid sequences but amino acid sequences do not code
for DNA sequences in that sense there is a unidirectional flow of information
but he did not make the mistake which was made later by Dawkins and many others
of assuming that that meant that no information passes in the other direction
and of course if you ask the question what makes your heart cell different from your
pancreatic cell different from your liver cell it is precisely the passage of information
from the system on to the genome to tell the genome to make a completely different pattern
of gene expression in a heart cell a pancreatic cell a liver cell a bone cell and so on
so we know already even just from that observation alone that there must be information passing the
other way we'll come on to the significance of that also a little bit later all of this was put
together by Julian Huxley Fisher Haldane Sewell Wright and others to form what was called the
modern synthesis and it's the it's the modern synthesis that is often also called neo Darwinism
now let's look at the popularization of it in the selfish gene I should say that I've interacted
with Richard Dawkins on these issues now ever since he published the selfish gene in fact I've
interacted with Richard Dawkins from even before he published the selfish gene what is it it is
of course a gene centered view of natural selection that is what the modern synthesis is accumulation
of random mutations by random here is meant not related to function random compared to function
then followed by selection that means incidentally that physiological science has nothing to say
about the variation in genetic material very important because we'll see that that view is
actually wrong then the impossibility of the inheritance of acquired characteristics a view
of course inherited initially from a viceman and the viceman barrier and then later on
buttressed and supported by the more popular interpretations of the central dogma of molecular
biology now I say that's miscalled Lamarchism because actually if you look at the history of the
idea of the acquisition of characteristics that can be inherited that idea was not Lamarck's invention
many others before Lamarck had said the same thing Lamarck like Darwin himself just simply
assumed it they didn't invent it neither of them did the other point that I've emphasized earlier on
is the distinction between the replicator the genes and the vehicle the phenotype and notice
what I said earlier on I just repeat it now the only way in which that distinction can be clear
is if the gene is defined as DNA as what we would now today call the replicator so the vehicle is
separate from the replicator if as Richard also does you see you define gene to be the original
definition by Johansson and implied of course by Mendel though he didn't use that word then you
cannot make that distinction there's no way of having it both ways you either define genes in terms
of the DNA replicator and then you have a clear distinction between replicator and vehicle
or you define genes in the way that Johansson originally did in terms of phenotype and then
you can't have such a clear distinction and as I said earlier these ideas were buttressed by
what I would call misinterpretations because I don't think they were intended by Francis Crick
misinterpretations the central dogma of molecular biology now the main point of my talk today on
the question what is life is that to answer that question we have to realize that all of these
rules have now been broken in ways that I'll just go through first of all our mutations random
the answer is no and by a very long way in his book recently published the book by Jim Shapiro
in Chicago evolution of you from the 21st century writes it's difficult if not impossible to find
a genome change operator that is truly random in its action within the DNA of the cell where it
works but I want to go a bit further than Jim does Jim documents with very very many
examples from the empirical literature scientific literature the non-random nature in the sense
that there are hotspots in the genome there are great big reorganizations of the genome
whole domains as we will see in a moment that have shifted around in the course of evolution
but I think he fails to make an important distinction which has to be added to this
which is the big question the big question that should worry the near Darwinist is is
some of that non-randomness functional in other words can the functional state of the organism
influence and influence the DNA and we'll see in a moment that he can he also makes the point
which I want to emphasize that if you look at what emerged from the first sequencing of the
human genome you find a very interesting fact that for two major classes of proteins transcription
factors and chromatin binding proteins the evidence is that they could not have evolved
one mutation at a time we're in a gradual way as the is the is in accord with the spirit at least
of the modern synthesis or near Darwinism this diagram is a little bit technical
so I'll just go through it very very quickly all you need to know is that these are representations
of particular proteins in different organisms all the way from yeast through worm through to the
human and the stars that I'm going to put up now are whole domains that is long stretches of DNA
that have clearly moved around in the course of evolution as whole domains not gradual accumulation
of mutations point mutations or small mutations and you as you can see there are many of them
and the same is true for the other class of proteins that they started so proteins not all
of them anyway did not evolve just via gradual mutation something is enabling the system to
reorganize the genome so the question I'm going to ask now is what happens in this view to selfish
genes and again I come now to a deep conceptual error the problem with the selfish gene is very
simple the book is written beautifully anybody who's read Richard Dawkins books must admire
the skill that he has in expressing the view that he expresses and the way in which he uses
language they're brilliant books but when he was asked the question is selfish in the title
of the selfish gene metaphor by the philosopher Mary Mitchell he wrote back that was no metaphor
I believe it is the literal truth
but then he went on to write this very significant qualification provided certain key words are
defined in the particular ways favored by biologists and if you've been thinking about the question
what is a metaphor a metaphor is precisely taking a word from one context and changing it
and making it perform a new function it is a way if you like of redefining a word
clearly in writing this he didn't understand the question that Mary Mitchell was putting to him
was it a metaphor it clearly is and he didn't think it was I wrote about this more more recently
in an article published in the journal of physiology just three years ago and a quote from
it is that a metaphor does not cease to be a metaphor simply because one defines a word
to mean something other than its normal meaning it indeed is the function of metaphor to do precisely
this and so at the heart of the neo Darwinist synthesis at the heart of its popularization
there are a number of major conceptual mistakes first of all a mistake about what is the real
definition of a gene and it slips between the two according to what the question is and you can't
do that you can't do that and be logical and second because as I show in that article but I
don't have the time to go through all of that in the lecture it's actually impossible to demonstrate
any biological experiment that would distinguish the selfish gene theory from any alternative
and incidentally curiously enough Richard Dawkins agrees with that in extended phenotype he writes
specifically I doubt whether there is any experiment to prove my case so that aspect at least of the
neo Darwinist approach to the question what is life is simply not falsifiable
now we come to the big question and the difficult one can acquired characteristics be inherited
I discussed this a number of years ago with john maynard smith we were both at a nevartist
foundation symposium he published a lovely book called evolutionary genetics in 1998 and he made
a very interesting statement he said john maynard smith although he was working totally within the
neo Darwinist view he was I think a great thinker and he said in that book specifically you know
lamocism is not so obviously false as it's sometimes made out let's have a look he was
absolutely right although he didn't know that at the time there are many examples now and
those who want to go to my music of life website will find a page devoted to what are called answers
answers to very common questions on this central issue of the theory of evolution and the question
what is life and although i'm just going to give a few examples in this slide there are many more
on that page weaver's work looking at the way in which you can mark the genome by behavior in each
generation and that can work even if nothing goes down through the germline and when his colleagues
looking at endocrine disruptors where the process does go down through the germline and we think
probably through inherited RNAs this paper also showing male transgenerational responses in the
human beautiful paper by Yonghua Sun and his colleagues at the Fish Institute in Wuhan in
China doing cross pieces cloning i'll show that in a moment in another slide and an extraordinary
study by Rechavi and his colleagues in cell published around three years ago showing not
any transgenerational inheritance of an acquired RNA based response but also that it persists
for a hundred generations they followed it in C. elegans for a whole year and the usual reply
of neo Darwinists to these examples to say the effects die out well they don't always die out
and then they will say well it's rare indeed it is as far as we know at the moment but remember
also that speciation is rare doesn't have to happen very often it hasn't happened in our lifetimes
it hasn't happened in the lifetime of humans in fact we've tried very hard with artificial
selection of dogs cats fish and so on we produce new varieties but never new species so environmentally
induced changes can be inherited i think the evidence for that is said is now growing very
rapidly go to the answers page on the music of life website if you want more details i said i'd
say what happens in cross species clones and then we come towards the end of the lecture
what Yong Ha Sun and his colleagues did in Wuhan was to take um a carp which is this one
goldfish and proceeded to take the nucleus from a carp and insert it into the fertilized but then
enucleated egg cell of the goldfish you should get unambiguously a carp if the neo Darwinist view
is correct what you get is intermediate this is the result it's one of the few examples where
cross speed works in the sense that you produce an adult and what it produces is an adult whose
anatomy is intermediate between the two um you can even quantify that if you look at the total
number of vertebrae in the goldfish it's about 26 there is up or down one or two and the carp is
about 33 in the cross species clone you get a figure in between um but it's closer marginally to
that of the goldfish there are other respects also in which what they call the inheritance of
cytoplasmic information is clearly occurring and I won't come now to one of the greatest thinkers
about genetics and their relation to the phenotype I have a lovely picture in my office in Oxford
of Barbara McClintock at the age of about 81 I think receiving the Nobel Prize here in precisely
this lecture theatre standing exactly where I'm standing at the moment and she was giving of course
her Nobel Prize lecture which she received in 1983 she was of course the person who discovered
what we sometimes call jumping genes or mobile genetic elements but she went much much further
than that until she was I'm sorry to say prevented from publishing from 1953 onwards she no longer
published on this issue until as far as I can recall um she was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1983
she wrote in that lecture in the future attention will undoubtedly be centered on the genome and
with greater appreciation of its significance as a highly sensitive organ of the cell
the result of her work on maize was to show her just how labile the material is the genetic
material is in response to environmental events and she wrote responding to those often by
restructuring the genome here we come back to what Jim Shapiro was drawing attention to
that clearly during evolution there have been major restructurings of genomes movements of
whole domains corresponding to various proteins so cytoplasmic changes can be inherited and I'll
deal I think I'll jump straight to the next slide just to give one example of how strong that
inheritance can be this is the article I would recommend reading if you want the what I would
regard now as the best example of that published by Joe Nadeau's lab at that time in Seattle
in PNAS at the end of 2012 they write I won't go through the full details the the heritable
epigenetic changes persisted for multiple generations and were fully reversed after
consecutive crosses through the alternative germline image so my main conclusion environmentally
induced changes can be inherited to the question are they fairly rare I would give the response I
gave earlier on so is speciation so when we ask the question do we know what the precise
mechanisms of speciation were I think the honest answer is that we don't know
not yet anyway now I come to my final conclusion if functional changes in the adult can be
inherited and therefore a target for natural selection then the analysis of function is highly
relevant to evolution and of course highly relevant to defining the question or an answer
to the question what is life because as I said earlier on this area of biology is central to
understanding the answer to that question I think what I want to do is to leave time for
discussion I'll just jump the remaining slides they just simply summarize what I've already just
said and the synthesis that I would propose is shown here that we have to recognize that selection
is multi-level that acquired characteristics can be inherited to quote Barbara McClintock the genome
is an organ of the cell not its dictator and that genomes are not isolated from the organism
and environment those who want to listen to another version of this lecture it's on the
music of life website and on youtube and the article there published just last year
in experimental physiology also gives chapter and verse on almost everything that I've presented
today and I finish with this lovely picture that I use right at the beginning some of you
will recognize the left hand picture as Conrad Waddington's beautiful picture from the strategy
of the genes in which he tried to explain the way in which there is plasticity at the developmental
level in the phenotype which is representing by a landscape here as the consequence of various gene
products interacting in networks that as it were a situated between the genome level and the
phenotype level now I know that's a bit artificial we can argue about exact definition of a phenotype
and so on but he's got the message he's got exactly the system's approach to it what happened to
Conrad Waddington he was largely ignored pushed to one side just as Barbara McClintock was until
she received the Nobel Prize so my final question is who pulls strings in any multi-level set of
interactions in any biological organism the answer is everything can if you take a three-dimensional
network just put together some knitting and make a three-dimensional knitting structure you pull
in any bit of it the whole network changes all networks do that so it doesn't make sense to
isolate one part and say that is the cause if you have networks as part of the definition and
processes in those networks in those networks as part of the definition of an organism then the
answer to the question what is life is it lies in those processes in the networks there is no
privileged level of causation and with that thank you very much at the end of the lecture thank you
