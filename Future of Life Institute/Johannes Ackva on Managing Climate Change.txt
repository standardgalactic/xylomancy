Welcome to the Future of Life Institute podcast.
My name is Gus Docker, and I'm here with Johannes Aquar.
Johannes is a researcher at Founders Pledge,
where he leads the Climate Change Fund.
Johannes, welcome to the podcast.
Thanks so much for having me, Gus.
Great to be here.
I'm a big fan of the Future of Life Institute.
And yeah, happy to talk all things climate today.
Perhaps we could start with your role at Founders Pledge.
What is it that you do there?
How do you see your role?
Yeah, so I think the way I usually describe it
is like my goal and the goal of my team
is kind of to like find and fund kind of the highest impact
opportunities in climate.
And those are like philanthropic opportunities, right?
So like things where we can, where a million dollars
or something in the quarter of magnitude
can kind of make a difference by supporting initiatives that
are like extremely promising.
And yeah, as you mentioned kind of in the beginning, right?
So there's kind of the climate fund,
which kind of puts this to life, the Founders Pledge Climate
Fund, but also we're advising kind
of high net profit individuals kind of beyond that
and kind of trying to, yeah, trying
to identify using research and using privatization
research kind of to identify where
are the biggest blind spot, whether the blind spot
generating mechanisms, if you will,
and kind of what does that mean for what
you should fund on a margin as an philanthropist.
Yeah, and I think that word is the key.
So thinking on the margin here, I see your job
I think that your job is about thinking
about the marginal dollar, where is that dollar best spent?
Would that be the correct frame?
Yes, the next dollar or the next million dollar.
And I think that's like really, really crucial frame
because I think a lot of the things that I am going to be
saying is going to be like controversial and might be wrong.
If like, if one would interpret them as like,
this is all we should be doing and I'm not really talking
about this is all we should be doing.
I'm talking about like, at the margin,
this is what we should be doing relatively, relatively more
off. Yeah, we're going to get into a broad overview
of the whole climate change issue.
We're going to look at all the potential technologies
or government options that might help us alleviate this problem.
But I think we should start with your personal journey
as an environmentalist.
So how did you end up in this role?
Where did you start?
When did you first become interested in the climate?
So, I mean, I grew up in the 90s in Germany.
So it was very easy to kind of become an environmentalist,
I think.
So kind of in my, I remember like some of my first childhood
memories kind of being very interested in saving the tigers.
So it's like inventing a board game,
save the Siberian tiger kind of like,
I like, yeah, there was an animal documentary on like three
times a week and like the last five or 10 minutes
of the documentary would always be like,
okay, and now humans are destroying this beautiful
nature, right?
So that was kind of, I think very big part of kind of,
yeah, of this, I think initial education
or becoming an environmentalist.
And I guess I got more serious about this kind of,
yeah, in my teenage years when I was like an environmental
activist for the German chapter of Friends of the Earth
and kind of like protesting President Bush to sign
the Kyoto Protocol when he was visiting this kind of stuff.
So that's kind of where it started.
And then I kind of, when it came to the university,
I think the idea for me was, okay,
let's kind of study social sciences with a focus
on like understanding what's kind of,
what kind of makes climate policies successful.
So that's kind of what I spent kind of my studies on.
And then I was working afterwards for a think tank
in Germany for five years kind of working on carbon pricing.
And that's kind of ultimately after this kind of joint
Founders pledge kind of went into philanthropy.
So that's kind of the story.
Yeah. And what's something you've changed your mind about
where have you gotten new ideas or learned new facts
that kind of changed your priorities?
I mean, lots and lots and lots over the years, right?
So that was kind of like a very short introduction
to like a 20 year journey.
I think the first big change probably in college kind of,
so at that point I was kind of, yeah, very strongly kind of,
yeah, as I said, like influenced by the environmental
movement kind of was kind of card carrying environmentalist,
if you will.
And essentially at that point kind of, yeah, as I said,
I was kind of studying social science
or kind of focusing on political culture
and understanding in a way that like the things
that I believed or the kind of people like me would believe
about how to solve the climate change, right?
So like heavily focused on renewables,
heavily focused on energy efficiency,
heavily focused on lifestyle change,
being anti nuclear, being somewhat skeptical
of technological innovation, right?
That essentially all of those beliefs kind of fit together
kind of in a very systematic fashion, right?
And what unites them is not that they're kind of
an adequate response to the climate challenge.
What unites them is that they're kind of part
of a specific ideology in this case kind of like a kind
of egalitarian green ideology, which kind of is framing
a large part of the climate conversation.
So I think that was kind of the first really important
realization that like all of the responses to the climate
and to other problems are kind of heavily ideological shaped,
right?
And like if you have a situation like we have in climate
which is kind of dominated by one kind of ideology,
this will kind of shape the results.
So I think that was kind of one,
I think another one a bit later,
when I was studying in the United States,
this was like 2012, 2011, 2012.
This was the time where essentially in the US
kind of the big push, the big push under Obama
to kind of push for climate policy,
Waxman Markey was the name.
So like kind of a cap and trade bill in the United States
kind of had just failed, right?
And this was like a once in a generation moment
with regards to climate policy in the US, right?
So like the Democrats had like won the presidency,
had like a huge majority in the House
and the Senate as well, right?
So like was kind of a situation of reckoning
like what are we going to do now?
Because like even under such favorable conditions
that we kind of can expect
to end every like 15 or 20 years,
like we're not able to pass climate policy in the US.
So I think in that time, kind of discovered kind of,
I think what I would describe
is kind of like the innovation hoc argument in climate, right?
So like people that are like very heavily focused
on innovation, which I think at that time
was kind of not that big a part
of the climate coalitions.
I think that's kind of another thing
that changed around that time.
I don't think I go all the way
but it's kind of interesting.
So because in a way what they did
or what they were emphasizing kind of became a big part
of climate policy that later passed.
So like that has just passed with President Biden
is kind of essentially putting this,
lots of those ideas into practice.
But so that's another one.
And then I think another kind of big one, of course,
for me growing up as a German environmentalist,
I was heavily anti-nuclear.
And being in the US also,
it's the first time kind of exposed
to pro-nuclear environmentalists.
And for a time was kind of lukewarm about nuclear
and at some point kind of realized, okay,
even though it's very uncomfortable in the German context
because otherwise reasonable people become
like very unreasonable and very emotionally aggressive.
Like when you're talking about nuclear
and when they're becoming pro-nuclear
but that was kind of an important shift of mind as well.
I think those are kind of three.
And then two more recent ones,
I would say 2015, essentially a success
of the Paris Agreement.
So up until 2015, I think international climate policy
by and large had always failed.
And this was kind of like the expectations were very low.
And then the fact that the Paris Agreement kind of succeeded
even though it's kind of a non-binding agreement
but it kind of has completely changed the conversations
that we're having in different countries.
So it kind of serves as this kind of North Star
that kind of lots of national conversations
are kind of focused on.
So I think that's kind of was another surprise in a way.
In what sense did the Paris Agreement succeed?
What have been the results of it?
I mean, the Paris Agreement has succeeded.
I mean, not only the Paris Agreement
but like around that time, so like that was in late 2015
and then like 2016, 2017,
the nature of the climate conversation
has completely changed, right?
Like around that time in Western countries anyway,
in the sense that like before it was kind of
a relatively niche issue
and it kind of became like a broad societal consensus
that like meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement matters.
I mean, it's maybe not political consensus
across the political aisle in all countries
but at least kind of for the left,
the center left kind of in all countries.
So I think that kind of really changed
and kind of the idea of net zero
and that climate was kind of a top issue.
Yeah, so I think that's kind of,
I think what the Paris Agreement achieved, right?
And like this is kind of very significant.
Like compare it, right?
It's like it's a non-binding treaty ultimately.
So there is a version,
I think you could have added cynical take
on this agreement kind of before,
like it's not, and I certainly had this to a degree,
like it's not gonna do much
because it's like a non-binding very weak agreement
and on some level that's true.
So that's not what it's doing.
What it's doing is kind of like transforming
the conversation.
And you mentioned a last thing
that you changed your mind on?
I think the last thing that I would mention is kind of that,
I think that's kind of maybe like 2020 or so.
Essentially that the situation around climate
has improved very, very significantly,
which is kind of funny to say this
because I think most people have the opposite perception
but like in general that like,
so like in 2015, 2016 people were saying things like,
there's a 5% probability of more of six degrees
or more warming.
And I think right now if you would make this forecast,
the forecast right now would be something like,
it's maybe like half a percent that we get to six degrees
at all and not more than six degrees.
So like an order of magnitude change.
And so essentially that the forecast before
were probably with pessimistic,
but also that the situation kind of has changed
very significantly, mostly through the success of renewables,
the success of kind of electric cars
that essentially the very high risk climate futures
are essentially almost ruled out at this point.
And that's a very significant change.
I'm wondering when you're working with climate change,
this is such a complex issue.
It involves a lot of disciplines,
not just climate science itself,
but economics and law and physics and engineering
and all of these disciplines.
How do you form an all things considered view
of the situation in light of all of these disciplines?
I mean, you can't go get a PhD in all of them, I'm guessing.
And so how do you approach this?
I mean, in theory you could,
but by the time you have those PhDs, the problem was solved.
Yeah, so I think the answer here,
I mean, has to be to kind of,
essentially you're always in the state
of like kind of being a reviewer
and kind of like a reviewer of different pieces of evidence.
So that's like one piece of the answer.
Another piece of the answer is kind of obviously
you do this on a team, right?
So like, essentially right now in my team,
but like we have a specialist kind of
for the technical economics,
we have a specialist for carbon lock and emerging economies.
We have a specialist for philanthropy
and how other philanthropists behave.
So that's kind of another piece of the answer,
I think to answer it more substantively,
I think there's kind of like three kinds of expertise
that are like most significant
when it comes to the question of like,
that I'm trying to answer,
which is like, what should we be doing philanthropically,
right?
So which is kind of like only one way
to answer the question of there,
I think it's kind of like one is kind of really
the social science question of like political visibility,
like which kind of like carbon taxes can we get where,
which kind of policies can we achieve
in a given country?
So that's kind of like,
what does the option space actually look like?
So that's kind of, I think, one key expertise.
The other one is kind of like,
what do different policies
or different kind of things in the world,
what do they achieve, right?
So like that's, I guess, policy analysis
on that kind of metrics and stuff like that.
And then there's kind of because climate change
is really a decadal challenge and a global challenge.
And like it's also a challenge
of like global technological transformation.
So then there's kind of this question of like,
what do changes in countries kind of,
what are the long-term consequences of that
and kind of changing the technology stack,
if you will globally.
So it's a techno economic question.
And I think those three expertises,
I kind of the most relevant ones
from a solution-oriented perspective.
And then of course, if you're a philanthropist like myself,
then also like, what are other philanthropists doing, right?
Because like doing the best thing on the margin
almost always about kind of finding blind spots
and filling the blind spots.
Okay, so let's get to this broad overview
that I would like of climate change.
On the broadest possible scale,
what is it that's driving climate change?
Is it mostly emissions?
And if so, where are these emissions coming from?
So it's like mostly, mostly emissions, right?
And so like all of the climate changes is about emissions.
And so if you're kind of,
I mean, there's sort of different ways to slice it,
but I guess let's first kind of slice it by sector.
So if you kind of look at it by sector,
then there's like 75% of emissions
are related to kind of energy.
And energy here, like one very important thing
about climate electricity is only a small part of energy.
Electricity is about a third of energy.
So like when I say 75%, that's not only electricity, right?
That's also kind of transport fuels.
That's heating fuels.
And that's also stuff like industrial heat.
Essentially the burning of fossil fuels to produce energy.
So that's about 75% of emissions.
Then there's about 5% of emissions
that's kind of emissions from industrial processes.
So stuff like producing a cement or chemicals
where you kind of have emissions
that are not related to fossil fuels
that are called process emissions, right?
And that doesn't mean that industry is only 5%.
This is about the kind of the non-energy share of industry.
So that together gets you to like about 80%.
And then there's about 15 or like 18%
that's kind of related to agricultural emissions broadly.
And then the last 5% or so is kind of a combination of
on the one hand stuff like deforestation
and then the other hand stuff like waste.
So yeah, I think 80% of the challenge
is kind of energy in the industry.
There's two important qualifications to this.
This is kind of where the emissions
are coming from right now, right?
And like that doesn't mean that this is exactly proportional
to what the solution looks like.
So like it can definitely be the case
of kind of land use change
and kind of like restoring wilderness, et cetera.
It's like a bigger part of the solution price.
I think that's kind of one qualification.
And another qualification is that these percentages
are kind of heavily dependent
on what warming metrics you use.
So the numbers that are on the side right now
are kind of for what's called global warming potential 100.
So like if we're kind of assuming
over the course of 100 years,
if you kind of take a shorter view,
if you would say something like global warming potential
for the next 20 years,
then something like agriculture would have like a larger share
because methane, which is a very potent greenhouse gas
in the short term has kind of a relatively larger share
in agriculture than in other sectors.
So that's another important qualification here.
Yeah, and in global terms,
are emissions still increasing?
Yes.
And for how long do we expect them to increase?
Well, I mean, people have been talking about the end
to emission increase for a long time.
And then there's always something else coming up.
So I think we will probably see
the end to increasing emissions this decade.
So I mean, it's mostly dependent
on what China and India are doing at this point.
And they're both kind of, yeah, have the goal
to kind of peak their emissions rather soon.
So it could happen this decade.
Yeah, you mentioned China and India.
We should talk about geographically
where emissions are coming from,
where have they come from in the past
and where are they likely to come from in the future?
Well, so I think in the past, right,
if you kind of take the long view then,
and just like most of the emissions
are certainly like helping cause by Western countries,
I think that's kind of clear.
And like we do have being in Western countries
like a large historical responsibility.
But if we kind of look at the situation right now,
so like the US right now,
something like 15% of emissions,
the EU is something around like 10%.
And like Asia is kind of something like close
to two thirds of emissions and then kind of the rest.
And if we kind of think this picture going forward, right?
So like the share of the EU
and the share of the US is going to further decrease.
I mean, probably to something like for the US
to something like 5% for like the EU,
maybe something like 3%.
And then yeah, China is going to be something like 25%
I think over the course of the century
than other emerging Asia kind of India and then Southeast Asia.
And then kind of at some point later in the century, Africa,
hopefully will grow strongly
and like, I mean, yeah, let's hope it's going to be low carbon,
but like, I guess there's kind of,
that's kind of also part of the long game.
So like the emissions are very clearly,
the focus of emissions is very much changing, right?
That's kind of what I sometimes call
like the central conundrum of climate policy,
which is like the people that are responsible
for a lot of the historical emissions
kind of have very little direct leverage
and kind of how the problem is going to become
because kind of essentially in the EU,
like there's not a lot of emissions you can reduce.
Like, I mean, anymore, right?
Like, I mean, already kind of reaching the goal
of getting to carbon neutrality by 2050 is like very ambitious.
But at that point, like there's no leverage left.
Because you project that EU is only going to be 3% of emissions.
And so reducing emissions by 3% would be great,
but it's not going to tackle the problem in a big way.
Essentially, most of the leverage that the EU has on emissions
does not come from the own territorial emissions, right?
So if we kind of look at the most significant things
that EU countries have done,
it's like things like Denmark making wind energy cheap,
Germany kind of making solar cheap.
These kind of things have like done way, way more
to like transform the energy future
than like emission changes within Europe.
European countries have subsidized technologies
that can then be exported to other countries
where they can decrease emissions much more than they could
in those European countries themselves.
From what you're saying, the biggest problem
or the biggest drive of emissions is energy production.
I wonder if that category is too broad.
I mean, a lot of things must be covered by energy production.
Is it, what does that category cover?
Yeah, so like, I think, yeah, I mean,
it covers kind of electricity, it covers heating,
it covers transport, and it also covers,
I mean, that's also heating, but it's kind of very different
than what we mean when we say heating,
like stuff like industrial heat, right?
Which is like steel and stuff like that.
And like on some level, it's kind of true broader term.
I still find it useful to think about as kind of one piece
because especially if we're thinking about
kind of the solution trajectory, right?
So like, what, like, I guess the master plan
and so far as there is a master plan
to kind of solve climate, right?
Is essentially electrify everything
or like, I mean, electrify all energy consumption, right?
So that sounds like historically those sectors
have been very different, but like,
or kind of also very different in terms of the fuels,
but like, you wanna get in a situation
where like the central problem is one of kind of,
on the one hand, getting electricity
or energy production kind of low or zero carbon.
And on the other hand, kind of either directly, right?
With electric cars or indirectly
through stuff like hydrogen electrifying
kind of a lot of other stuff.
So in that sense, it's a cross simplification
to speak of like energy as one sector,
but it's also, I think if we're kind of at the broad level,
it's a useful one in terms of, yeah,
in terms of the solution landscape.
Yeah, so the categories is kind of unified
by the same solution, the same solution would solve
all of the things that belong to that category.
So electrification would be a solution
for many of the things that belong to that category.
Or is that too strong?
I mean, it's just a little bit too strong,
but I think it's kind of right in the,
yeah, basically right, I would say, right?
So how far electrification goes kind of depends on,
like things are differentially easy to electrify.
So like things that are hard to electrify
is stuff that kind of requires,
I mean, either a long duration of storage
or like lots of kind of concentrated energy,
or so like stuff like heavy duty transport, right?
Like electrifying trucks is much harder
than electrifying passenger cars.
And like electrifying or like decarbonizing large ships
is kind of much harder and airplanes much harder than cars.
So, and for some of those,
you might either use kind of indirect electrification, right?
So kind of like hydrogen or using power to create hydrogen,
but it might also go another way,
you can also kind of create the hydrogen kind of
with natural gas and carbon capture and storage.
Yeah, so that's kind of where there is more nuance there,
where we can kind of dive deeper.
Why is it more difficult to electrify an airplane than a car?
Is it because the airplane will have a need
for higher peak energy output or something like that?
Well, it's essentially, I mean, batteries are very heavy.
And so like an airplane becomes much more efficient
because once you burn the fuel,
it's kind of not, it has no weight anymore.
And it's also, so like that's kind of one part.
And like the other part is kind of like energy,
energy density, right?
So like in principle, like flying and air,
like flying kind of requires a lot of,
like it's kind of much harder than kind of moving,
moving a car around.
And so you kind of need, need higher energy density.
Okay, so what I want to do is,
is to walk through all of the potential technological options
we have, start with that.
I'm going to start with talking about oil and coal,
which is kind of a funny place to start maybe,
because in some sense, oil and coal
is the whole reason for the problem.
But I think it's interesting to discuss oil and coal
just because if we know something about why
they are hard to replace,
we might know something about how to best go
about the climate change problem.
So yeah, I've written down that oil and coal is cheap
and it works in existing systems.
Do you see other advantages beyond those I just mentioned?
Yeah, I think those are kind of the,
the two really big ones, right?
And like work in existing systems,
I think another way to put this is like,
we've essentially built an entire world economy around them.
So they fit with existing systems
because we built an entire economy around them
and not only an economy, right?
Like the United States is kind of having aircraft carriers
in the Persian Gulf because kind of protecting oil reserves
is kind of part of the, well, it's like part of the overall
kind of strategy, right?
So it's like, yeah, essentially we've been spending more
than a century optimizing our energy and world economy
for relying on oil, coal, natural gas.
I think another kind of advantage that they do have,
I mean, at least if we compare them to renewables,
to most renewables is that they do have
higher energy densities.
So yeah, and then of course,
I mean, in the case of oil, right?
Like oil is easy to transport.
Coal is also relatively easy to transport with gas.
It's a bit harder.
Yeah, so I think this is kind of like,
broadly speaking, that seems like the right characterization.
And of course, the enormous disadvantage here
is that there's very high emissions associated
with oil and coal.
And I think additionally,
there are quite large problems with air pollution,
which provides us with an additional reason
to replace oil and coal.
Maybe you could talk about air pollution
from oil and coal.
How big of a problem is that?
So air pollution at large kills
about 7 million people every year.
So it's like one of the leading causes of death.
And not all of that is related to fossil fuels, right?
So like you also have the situation
that some of that is actually related to renewables.
So like to, especially in Africa,
people burning wood for heating at home and for cooking.
So that that's actually a situation where,
like using a fossil fuel, in this case,
natural gas would actually be much better because of...
But essentially, so in particular,
coal and oil kind of, yeah, kill a lot of people.
So gas is a lot cleaner.
So gas is about 15 times cleaner than coal
in terms of air pollution.
But it's a very significant cause of death.
And I think it's also really underappreciated.
So like people usually talk about air pollution
as kind of like a co-benefit of climate change.
And like climate change has to get really bad
to kill like 5 million people every year, right?
So like it's kind of quite possible
that resolving climate change
and like the most significant effect of that
is kind of a reduction kind of air pollution casualties, right?
Obviously like this is not the highest risk case, right?
Like there are cases with...
There's no case with air pollution
like killing 100 million people, right?
And there's kind of cases, there's a risk cases
around climate that kind of motivate caring
with climate that are more extreme
than killing 5 million people.
But like, yeah, it's just, I guess it's not a co-benefit.
It's kind of a problem on a similar order of magnitude.
Yeah, makes sense.
Air pollution is a huge deal.
Why is it that oil and gas is hard to replace?
And here we might talk about a carbon lock-in also,
which is a term that's used.
The primary reason that if like energy transitions are...
Well, energy transitions are hard
for a couple of reasons, right?
But like, okay, let's kind of start with a lock-in reason.
To begin with, a lot of the assets, right?
Like pipelines or coal power plants or highways,
et cetera, right?
Like those are very long-lived assets, right?
They have natural lifetimes that are like 40 or 60 years.
They're capital intensive assets.
So like, even if like you're kind of in a situation
where like every new build
is kind of the low-carbon alternative,
it will take you like 40 years
to kind of turn around like an entire system, right?
And that's kind of an optimistic case.
So like it's like, there's a lot of kind of lock-in.
And then there's...
So like this is kind of at the pure kind of technical
or infrastructural level, right?
And then you also have stuff like pipelines
and infrastructure, which are even longer, longer-lived
than single assets.
And then of course you have like a huge kind of political
economy, like political special interests kind of groups
and kind of the entire kind of fate of countries
essentially build around that, right?
I guess like when people say like Putin used to behave
like the CEO of like a gas company, right?
Like, I mean, kind of changed a little bit
the way he's behaving, but like, right?
Like it's kind of like their entire countries
or entire kind of regions of the world
that are like heavily dependent on the fossil fuel economy.
So I think that's kind of another really big reason.
And another reason of like obviously
is also like energy transitions in general
move towards denser forms of energy, right?
So like what we're trying to do right now
where we're essentially saying, okay, we want to move
from a fossil fuel dominated energy economy
to one that's kind of dominated by renewables.
It's kind of not a natural direction
for an energy transition to go.
So like the more natural direction
of energy transitions thus far has been like
from less energy dense fuels of like
from biomass to fossil fuels, right?
And like going from fossil fuels
to mostly renewable powered systems
actually it's not a natural move of the energy system.
Probably wouldn't happen.
Like there are many other situations
where it kind of wouldn't happen.
Yeah, maybe here is a natural point
to talk about energy density.
Why is energy density important?
So energy density, right?
So like essentially how much land
and how many resources do you need
to kind of produce a given amount of energy?
So the reason that's important,
I think is kind of like two-fold.
I mean, from an environmental perspective,
energy density is essentially a proxy
for like how much impact do we have on the environment, right?
So if you're using less land,
if you're using less materials,
then you're kind of like a principle
like lower energy density means
like lower environmental impact.
So that's kind of one part of it.
The other part, which is more about like
what's useful for human civilization, right?
So like having denser forms of energy,
like if you're talking about electricity,
it means like you need less transmission, for example, right?
So like that's kind of another use.
And you're also kind of, if you want to power
like an industrial center or like an urbanizing society,
like having lots of energy
and having relatively dense forms of energy is useful.
One shouldn't overdo this, right?
It's like, I'm not saying like on the limit
kind of we would have like one big fusion plant
and we all kind of just get from,
so that's clearly not the case.
I think we've seen this with nuclear fission
that like having very large kind of energy sources
also as it's downside because demand isn't always there.
So like not take it to the extreme limit,
but like kind of on some level,
like energy density in principle
is kind of a useful metric.
But when you talk about energy density,
it's you're talking about also the resources necessary
to produce that energy,
not only the energy density, say for example,
of a 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter cube of coal or oil
or fuel for a nuclear reactor.
It's a broader term than that.
That's energy density where we have historically
been moving towards forms of energy that are more dense
and now we're trying to move towards forms of energy
that are less dense.
I think before we get to renewables,
we should talk about natural gas
that you mentioned a couple of times.
What are the advantages here and disadvantages?
I'm guessing it's better than oil and coal.
Just to add on the energy density,
like because we've talked about why it's important,
but we didn't talk about what does it actually look like.
So like if you look at the metric side,
nuclear power would be something like seven terawatt hours
per square kilometers, natural gas,
which we're going to talk about next.
It's like about half that.
And like solar is kind of about 100,
so roughly what nuclear is, right?
So that's kind of why it matters.
Like the differences are quite stark,
both from renewables to fossil fuels
and from fossil fuels to nuclear.
Like natural gas, if we talk about natural gas.
So I mean, it's about half as polluting as coal
in terms of CO2.
And it's much, much less polluting,
about 15 times less polluting
when we talk about air pollution.
And essentially if we look at the decarbonization successes
of the last 20 years,
like many of them have been coal to gas transitions.
So like essentially the fact that the US
was kind of able to reduce emissions
even though until like 2021
didn't really have much in terms of climate policies,
like mostly the story of the fracking revolution
in the United States
and kind of the replacement of coal by natural gas.
A little bit similar in the UK,
in the UK there's kind of natural gas.
There's also like more of a renewable expansion.
And that's kind of another.
So like that's kind of, this has been a big story.
It's like an easy win, right?
It's not a transformational win
because you don't get to zero emissions,
but it's kind of the easy win.
So if you're imposing a moderate carbon price
in a place with a lot of coal,
that will usually mean you're gonna substitute it
with natural gas.
In which cases does it make sense to switch to natural gas?
I mean, that's kind of like, right?
That that's kind of, I think something
where the climate community
has like two different perspectives, right?
I think there are people that are more incrementalist
that will say like, yeah, it's good
if you're switching from coal to natural gas.
There's also people that would say, okay,
if you're switching from coal to natural gas,
you're locking in another fossil fuel source, right?
And it's kind of like better to maybe have coal
run a bit longer and then fully replace it
with a zero carbon source.
So I think that's kind of the debate.
And I think different people have like different opinions.
And I think also the right answer
might be different in different places.
The best case scenario would be one
for like natural gas replaces coal.
And then natural gas is kind of replaced
with natural gas and gas and carbon capture.
So where you're kind of capping the emissions
or where you're using kind of part
of the natural gas infrastructure
with like zero carbon fuels, right?
So like with natural gas kind of that's produced
for electrolysis and kind of like additional
like adding CO2 there or yeah.
So it's a synthetic on natural gas essentially.
So that last point, is there a way
to produce that natural gas
that's more environmentally friendly?
So I mean natural gas is just CH4.
So in principle you can get it from H2 like from hydrogen
like which you can generate in a low carbon way.
And if you would kind of then take CO2 out of the air
so you can essentially produce
like carbon neutral natural gas, right?
Like this, yeah.
Or you could use hydrogen, yeah.
So essentially there's ideas about using
some of the kind of natural gas infrastructure
for like zero carbon gases.
Yeah. So that's I think something like one way
where carbon lock in can be made a little bit less severe,
right?
Where you're like locking in like a gas infrastructure
for example, but that gas could
at some point be carbon neutral.
Yeah. If we build a new natural gas plant now
how much carbon are we locking in?
For how many years would this natural gas plant
have to run in order to be profitable
or to make sense to build?
If you're building new natural gas plants right now
I think they expect like if you're in a Western country
I don't think the investor would have the expectation
that they're gonna run this for 40 years
because like running this for 40 years
would mean they're not 2023.
So like 13 years after kind of most Western countries
have committed to like reaching net zero.
That being said, right?
Like even countries like Germany
that are kind of priding themselves to be climate leaders
are building new natural gas capacity right now
in an energy crisis situation, right?
So we're essentially, I guess the way this becomes profitable
is because we really do value energy security.
So like as countries we're willing to kind of finance things
that don't make sense in a long run perspective,
if you will.
Maybe we could say a bit more about energy density
and why it's important.
Is it important because some forms of energy
take up too much space and then crowd out other things
we would like to do with that space
like having natural habitats or using the land for agriculture
or what's the problem with energy sources
with low energy density?
So like crowding out of like other land uses
is definitely a factor, right?
So especially for biofuels, I think it's a factor
because like biofuels take up a lot of land
and like kind of agricultural land
that can compete with like food security concerns.
Yeah, so I think that is kind of one concern.
So like land use, right?
So like if you looked at a paper where essentially
that's kind of modeling a transition
towards a lower carbon future
and what they're essentially like
and like a renewable heavy future.
What they're essentially modeling is like, okay, by 2050
there is some six fold increase in the land required
for energy production compared to today.
And like to be fair, like it's not that it's six times
less efficient because also like electricity production
is like assumed to triple over the timeframe, right?
So like it's kind of a half thing of like efficiency
in terms of like energy density
that's like a significant change.
I think to me, the more fundamental challenge
is really one of like,
if you're having lots of decentralized energy sources
like kind of the requirements in terms of transmission
and like infrastructure build out
are kind of like much, much larger, right?
So essentially when we're saying it is cheap
and it is easy to build renewables
that we're talking about is kind of on the plant level
where this is true.
But when we're talking about the energy system level
and say like we want to build an energy system
that is primarily based on low energy density sources.
Like I'm not saying this cannot work
but like this is like a risky proposition
mostly for the transmission and storage requirements
that are kind of related to low energy density
and intermittency.
Okay, so that's oil, coal and natural gas.
What about if we get into the renewables?
So solar and wind,
what are some advantages of solar and wind?
At this point, solar and wind are pretty cheap.
So at this point, I think in many places in the world
will be the case that like adding solar capacity
to the grid is like one of the cheapest things you can do.
It's very important to realize that like this is not a fact
of like nature or like technology itself.
That's a result of like very conscious social choices, right?
I mean, it's essentially countries like Germany
and jurisdictions like California
and then later kind of China essentially saying,
okay, we really want to have cheaper renewables
and we're really like heavily investing that.
So in that sense kind of the fact
that we have cheap renewables right now
is much more a function of their popularity
with constituencies than it is kind of like
the principle underlying technology, right?
So like if like nuclear would be as popular
as like renewables are,
we probably also could have like cheap nuclear now.
This is kind of what I'm saying
or a geothermal for that matter.
So I think that's kind of an important aspect here.
So yeah, there can be quite cheap.
And also there are use cases where decentralized
and kind of smaller production is kind of good, right?
So I mean, you can kind of use, deploy them
where they are needed, right?
So like if you're a small town,
you're not going to build your own kind of big power plant
but you can build your solar on the rooftop, et cetera.
So I think that's kind of the main advantage.
Obviously it produces no carbon, no air pollution.
And can be built quickly.
Yeah, so you mentioned that solar and wind
have gotten cheaper because of basically policies
by European countries and by California and so on.
When solar has reached the price point
that it's at now,
does it require kind of continual subsidies
to stay at that price point?
Or have we developed solar to a point now
that it's price competitive even on an open market, let's say?
So in energy, you generally don't have open markets.
I think that's an important thing to realize.
So solar is competitive in many cases, right?
But like it's not like with oil
where like you have a global price of oil, right?
It's like essentially for solar,
like how costs affect on the solar,
compared to alternatives depends on like
how good is the solar resource?
Depends also on like how much solar is already on the grid
because like you can be in a situation
where like installing the additional solar capacity
is very cheap,
but it's not gonna produce a lot of additional value
because essentially like the sun is shining at the time
where you're already at 100% solar,
then like it's easy to add an additional solar power plant
but it's kind of, it doesn't add a lot
unless you kind of have cheap storage
or cheap transmission, super cheap,
sorry, super cheap transmission.
So that's what's called value deflation.
So it's not really like,
it doesn't really make sense to think about it
as like one price point that is being undercut, right?
So like we're in a situation where
there are places in the world
where like adding solar kind of happens
without subsidies and it's kind of like
essentially the natural result of like market forces
or like mediated market forces.
And we have also places
with quite a high renewable penetration, right?
Places like California or Germany
where like places that made renewable so cheap
but that are now kind of struggling to add a lot more
because stuff like system integration
or like the value of an additional plant
is kind of low.
How much of our energy production
could we replace by wind and solar alone?
The problem with wind and solar
or one problem is that it's intermittent.
So it requires the sun to shine or the wind to blow
unless you have a really good storage technology,
basically batteries.
But how much of our energy production
do you think we could replace by solar and wind?
You don't only need batteries, right?
So like essentially you need to solve,
I think three or four problems.
So like one is kind of short-term storage.
For this you can use batteries.
And right, that's kind of like,
okay, you can run your washing machine during the night.
That's kind of the use case.
Then you kind of need to solve
in most places in the world,
you need to solve seasonal storage, right?
So that there's kind of like parts of the year
where like there's much less solar available.
And like that's like a much, much harder challenge.
And I think that's kind of underappreciated
because people talk about storage,
they think about batteries
and they think the problem was solved.
But like kind of essentially being able to have enough energy
to like have a month or like more kind of work
of like energy reserve requires a very different solution.
It's not probably not going to happen with batteries.
That's kind of where something like, right,
what I've talked about before, like power to X,
like producing hydrogen or kind of other forms
of like low carbon energy, like gases
or like non-liquid to store energy.
So like that's kind of what you will need there.
And then there's kind of the problem of transmission.
And then there's a problem around essentially,
do we have enough land in the jurisdictions?
I think the last one will not be the decisive constraint.
I think that will probably work.
But essentially there's like three challenges,
like storage in the short-term, seasonal storage, transmission.
I can't imagine a world, right?
If when I think about the future,
I always try to think of a distribution.
And like there's like part of that distribution
where like, okay, wind and solar
are kind of really like 80 or 90% of the energy supply.
And essentially, seasonal storage has been solved,
transmission has been solved,
and it's kind of that's a large part of the solution.
Those are not the futures I'm particularly worried about
because I mean, those are really very best case futures.
It's like an AI safety of like AGI is inherently safe.
That's kind of the future.
And then there are kind of the futures
where like something has gone wrong, right?
And like that's kind of like in our climate response
and like a natural thing or things like
one of the most likely failure modes right now
that we can like if we kind of,
if we're kind of waking up in 2040
and like we're on a trajectory to like more than three degrees,
it's very likely that kind of we've been over-bedding
on intermittent renewables
that essentially it is much harder,
even though it's easy to get to like 20, 30% in electricity,
like getting to like 100% in energy right again,
and then like growing demand,
like something like 10X compared now
that this is kind of really hard.
So this is an area where there's very significant uncertainty.
I would say we're kind of, yeah, on the top,
you can kind of do almost get almost 100%
but also where it's kind of quite imaginable
that you don't get over 50% of energy,
which will still be like a huge, huge role, right?
I mean, right now it's kind of something
like three to 4% of like energy.
You mentioned the seasonal storage.
What are the most promising approaches there?
This is something where it's not primarily about batteries,
right?
So where it's primarily about kind of using
more energy dense forms.
So like for example, yeah, using kind of excess capacity,
excess power capacity to produce carbon neutral hydrogen
and to store this as hydrogen
or to kind of store this like synthetic natural gas.
This to me seems right now the most plausible trajectory.
I mean, there's also kind of, I guess,
there's lots of different technologies
that are being tried out.
Okay, so that's solar and wind,
which could turn out very well,
but where there are challenges to be solved
before they can be implemented
and can constitute a large percent
of our energy production.
That sounds too pessimistic.
It's more like solar and wind will definitely play
a much larger role than they're playing now.
The question is, will they take us to 100%
but like, yeah, that's a different framing, right?
So like, yeah, the short-term story
is definitely about the expansion of mature renewables.
We should say something about the, to my eyes,
insane decrease in the price of solar,
or at least it looks like a very, very steep decrease
when I look at these graphs.
Yeah, can you say something about how much cheaper solar
is now compared to 20 years ago?
Well, it's essentially at like less than 10%
of where it was 20 years ago, right?
So like, that's, that isn't an insane decrease.
So I remember when I was kind of entering
the climate conversation,
and people were talking about renewables,
they were always talking about solar, wind,
geothermal, hydro, bio.
At some point people only started talking
about solar and wind, right?
Because essentially those technologies
got like radically cheaper, in particular solar,
wind also, but a bit less so.
Yeah, so that's a very, very steep decline, right?
Which has been achieved.
There's a great book about this,
How Solar Got Cheap by Gregory Named.
But essentially it's kind of primarily a result
of kind of very aggressive policy.
I mean, it kind of goes back to the 1970s
and like the first oil crises from like Jimmy Carter,
but then kind of got really picked up
in the early 2000s, right, of like Germany,
kind of really strongly supporting it,
also like not only Germany,
also like California, et cetera.
And then like, at some point,
China essentially massively investing in production capacity.
So yeah, and that's kind of a big part of the story as well.
It's not a story of fundamental technological innovation.
It's really more of a brute force approach
to making things cheap.
What about hydro?
Could hydro ever constitute a large percent
of our energy production?
So hydro could, I think, I mean, it's like, it's already,
I think it's still, if I'm not mistaken,
it's still like the largest renewable energy resource,
right?
It's not really talked about
because it's kind of like static.
It's not like the sexy, it's not where the action is,
but like it's a very significant part.
I think like with hydro, like large hydro
has like large kind of environmental downsides.
And I think another kind of constrained,
like so there's a couple of other constraints.
In one, it's like geopolitical.
If you're kind of talking about them,
hydro power is often like a very kind of contentious issue
if you're thinking about denial or other areas.
So like that's another big problem.
And it's also like very long-term infrastructure.
So I think like hydro, I think like from a technical perspective,
like hydro could play a larger role,
but it's kind of, I don't think there are many people
that are kind of betting on like an abandoned future
with lots of hydro, or at least I haven't come across them.
I think I know exactly like one charity
that's working on hydro power.
That's mostly on making, that's clear paths in the SM.
They're kind of trying mostly to use hydro power,
making existing hydro power or existing dams more efficient,
like essentially using them more to produce electricity.
Do we even have enough large rivers
to generate enough electricity by hydro?
That's a good question, but I actually don't know the answer
because it's kind of so far out of the overturned window.
One other thing I want to say on hydro
is that essentially hydro is affected by climate change as well, right?
So like essentially that hydro is becoming a less reliable energy resource,
essentially as kind of climate patterns,
precipitation patterns become harder to predict and more extreme.
So I think it's kind of another reason why it's not like,
it's not a major bet that anyone I think is kind of really making at this point.
Okay, let's move on to nuclear energy.
What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages there?
I think like the biggest advantage is like related to energy density, right?
I mean, it sounds like ironic and very counterintuitive to say this,
but like from an environmental perspective,
like nuclear is kind of the cleanest form of energy production
because it's like of those that we have right now, because it's so energy dense,
it doesn't need a lot of materials, it doesn't need a lot of land.
Yeah, so I think that's kind of the clear advantage, produces zero carbon.
Disadvantages I think are well known in the case of nuclear.
So accident risk, nuclear waste, yeah,
and also I guess some dual use concerns around nuclear weapons.
Yes, I think those are kind of the disadvantages.
And also right now, but that's not a fundamental feature of the technology.
That's kind of something of, I guess it's the result of social choice right now.
It's very expensive and slow to build.
Yeah, that was actually my next question would be,
when I look at some new nuclear power plant,
it has often taken a decade or more to build and it's gone over budget.
So why is it so, why does it take so long
and why does it cost so much to build nuclear power plants?
Like I think right now, I mean, we were able to build nuclear power plants in France
in something like four years, right?
And right now, we're not able to do this in the West right now,
it would probably more take something like 20 years.
But so there's a lot of variance here that is like,
it's not like related to the features of the technology
or like our fundamental technological ability, right?
There's like a 5x kind of difference that's kind of related to regulation,
economy, societal commitment, et cetera, right?
That's kind of where the explanation ultimately has to be.
So I think there's kind of lots of different reasons.
I mean, one, like, I guess one most general one,
which is not nuclear specific,
is like in general in the West, we're not able to build things, right?
It's not only that we're not able to build nuclear plants,
we're also not in Berlin, we're not even able to build airports.
So I think that's kind of like the general class of like,
there's lots of general stuff around like regulation and kind of interest groups.
But then there's also like nuclear specific stuff, right?
And I think it's essentially, I think the most significant part
is that essentially the supply chain for building nuclear in the West
has essentially fallen apart, right?
So like, we're building things kind of in the first of a kind style
or kind of not first of a kind, but like first in a decade
or first in a decade more, which is not the way to build like anything kind of
at scale, anything efficiently.
That's not how France kind of built the nuclear fleet, right?
So like the most successful example of building out nuclear quickly
is like France from the like late 70s to like late 80s.
So that's, I think, most of the explanation.
What did France do right?
I mean, France was in a situation of emergency.
So like the 1970s at the time of like the big oil price shocks
and like France is a country without significant domestic energy supply.
So they were extremely exposed to the oil price shocks.
And at the same time, they were already in nuclear power, right?
Like they kind of had like nuclear expertise, very centralized government.
So yeah, they essentially decided, okay, we're going to build nuclear
as like a national project and like kind of standardized it.
Like one of like both the same kind of reactor,
both the workforce in a very centralized fashion.
If you kind of compare this to the US, for example,
where like utilities are kind of really spread out across the country
and like we're like essentially there's like not someone who's buying
like a hundred nuclear plants, right?
There's kind of utilities that are buying like one reactor
or maybe two reactors and one plant or something like that, right?
So like the way that this happens was like fundamentally different.
So these were very special circumstances and like just to be very clear,
I'm not suggesting that those are transferable to today, right?
Like it's not that the kind of shock or stress that France was under,
it's not something we can replicate and say,
oh, we're all going to build like to 80% nuclear in like 15 years
because of climate change.
Most countries are not able to do that.
Like technologically they are, but like politically speaking,
it doesn't seem feasible.
Do you think we need to develop new designs for nuclear reactors?
Do we need to move to better designs?
Do we need molten salt reactors or something like this?
Or are the reactor designs we have today enough?
And this is I think an active debate in the nuclear community.
And I think like it kind of depends on how do we define need and less context, right?
So like I think from purely technical perspective, right?
There's nothing wrong with existing nuclear power plants.
So what's wrong is kind of like the fact that we're not able to build them
is kind of lack of societal commitment and like lack of learning and stuff like that, right?
So like we can imagine a future where we built a lot of that.
So the question is can we actually get into that future?
The most significant benefit of kind of advanced nuclear like small,
small modular reactors is essentially it seems more plausible that this is kind of like,
like there are countries where it seems more plausible that we're going to build lots of
small modular reactors because you can produce them and factories.
You can essentially exploit the same learning curve dynamics that made renewables and electric cars
and all other kind of technologies that we were able to make cheap cheap.
So that's kind of another aspect.
And it's also kind of playing much better with like renewable dominated grid.
So it's kind of more flexible and it's also like a smaller, smaller unit.
So I think there, yeah, I think, I mean, we are like philanthropically speaking,
we are we are betting on advanced nuclear or small modular reactors.
But I wouldn't say it's necessarily related to like technological problem with existing reactors
is more like, yeah, the whole, yeah, I guess one of the themes here,
it's not only about technology, it's about the whole like societal kind of apparatus around the technology.
And so the small modular reactors would be easier to innovate on because you would you would be able
to develop one such reactor and deploy it and get feedback much, much more quickly than you can
with a with a larger reactor where it might take 15 years for it to to be built.
And only then can you go back and think about what you could have done differently.
Is it also a question of potentially you can you can mass produce these small modular reactors?
What are the advantages here?
So like, it is the mass production, right, the mass production in a factory.
So it's not only the 15 year thing, right, like under ideal circumstances,
you could also build a large plant and something like four or six years,
like you could also learn something from large plants and you could build the same plant design over and over again.
But it's much easier to learn and like, obviously, it's like a controlled production environment, right?
So like when kind of most of the reduction happens in a factory, I mean, obviously,
some of the assembly has to happen on site, but like, that is where you can really kind of expect
a high learning rates, right?
So that's kind of, yeah, essentially applying the same mechanism by which we make,
make other kind of technologies cheap to the nuclear case.
One last technology I want to run through is geothermal.
This is something that's maybe like hydro, it's potentially a bit overlooked.
But yeah, how promising do you think geothermal energy is?
So I would say much more promising than hydro.
But I think also geopharmals definitely having a moment right now,
and it's becoming radically less overlooked.
There's traditional geothermal, which is kind of great, but it's very location specific, right?
Location dependent.
You kind of do it, build it in lots of places because you kind of need, essentially not,
yeah, you need kind of good conditions.
You need like, yeah, be close to volcano, et cetera.
So like, essentially, you need to be closer to heat source near in the ground.
And then there's kind of like different forms of like advanced geothermal.
And that's a little bit like, there's like lots of different ones.
It's like six or seven different ones, but I guess the one that we've been focusing on
traditionally is what you would call ultra deep geothermal or like a super hot rock
geothermal where essentially you're going so deep that you can kind of make it much less
location dependent and also kind of get much, much warmer, much hotter fuel.
So you kind of get more, more energy density to get more favorable economics.
And then that's kind of the idea of like geothermal anywhere.
So if you're kind of able to drill like five kilometers or five down, yeah,
that could be very promising.
And that's kind of like, in general, this is not only true for super hot or ultra deep,
but also kind of more generally for like innovation in geothermal.
What this does, it's kind of leveraging the advances of the fracking of the Shea gas revolution,
right?
So like our ability to drill has been like strongly increased through the fracking revolution
and essentially applying this to geothermal is kind of where a lot of the innovation is coming from.
And that's kind of very attractive because once you make it work, right,
you need to solve a couple of material science challenges here.
But like once those are solved, you have like a very mature labor force and you kind of have
like large economic interests, oil and gas, that would be quite interesting on that.
So in that sense, it's kind of an innovation that is kind of locked in, if you will, right?
So like it's kind of not locked out.
Yeah, but if we're talking about drilling five kilometers down, this is not something you could
do in a person's backyard.
So this is not as decentralized as, for example, setting up solar panels on a roof in a residential neighborhood.
No, it's solving the same problem that small modular reactors or like other kind of clean
firm sources would solve, right?
So it's not, this is not about everyone having a super hot rock thing in their backyard,
but this is about solving the hard part of electricity decarbonization, which is kind
of clean firm resources, right?
So like not intermittent renewables, but something that can be dispatched and it can be used the entire time.
I guess technically this is not a renewable form of energy, but in a kind of practical sense,
it will take billions of years for the earth's heat to dissipate enough for this technology
not to work.
So in practical terms, it's renewable.
Yeah, in practical terms, I think the distinction renewable and not doesn't matter because I mean,
renewables also require lots of non-renewables like resources to like right like in a way,
so like the minerals that you need for like solar and wind and so like.
So yeah, it's not a practical thing to worry about, but nor should you kind of worry about
uranium running out or stuff like that.
Okay, we've done an overview of a lot of the technological options we have.
If you were to rank these technologies and think about, you know, a plan for how we might solve
climate change using a combination of them, where would you, where do you see most promise
in the short term and in the long term?
I mean, in the short term, it's very clear that like intermittent renewables and natural gas
will like do most of the like heavy lifting and decarbonization in the near future.
So like, because they are quick to build and they're kind of quickly expanding, right?
And like, okay, in some places also editing nuclear capacity and also many other places
like not prematurely shutting down nuclear capacity, right?
So like, yeah, so those are I think kind of the short term and then hydropower, the short term options.
And the medium runs something like, well, like advances in geothermal or advances in small modular
reactors, right, could kind of address what right now is kind of a little bit of the Achilles heel
of kind of electricity decarbonization, which is kind of clean firm power, right?
So like that's kind of why those are still important and like worth doing, even though
like renewables right now are cheap.
And there's kind of this like seduction of like only relying on existing technologies.
But like the reason to not do that is like the risk that we talked about before, but also kind of the
energy system function of like clean firm, which right now is kind of not adequately solved.
And when you say clean firm, what do you mean?
Well, so clean, right?
Means like zero emissions and like zero air pollution and like otherwise clean.
So like that includes nuclear, that includes geothermal, that includes fusion, if it were,
if it were to happen.
And firm here means that it's essentially, it is not an intermittent resource, right?
It's kind of not like solar and wind that is kind of, so yeah, it can in principle be run
24-7 and you will not use it for electricity 24-7, but you might use it for producing hydrogen
at other times of the day.
But like, yeah, essentially that you're reducing what storage kind of needs to do, right?
Like it becomes a lot like building an energy system that has like clean firm resources in it,
like is a lot more realistic to get to like 100% kind of clean than if you're kind of
entirely batting on intermittent resources.
Yeah, so you think thinking across the different climate scenarios, it's a, it will be a smart
strategy for us to also invest in some of these clean firm technologies and not just
traditional renewables like wind and solar.
Okay, yeah.
So I think it's kind of worth distinguishing two separate strands of the argument here,
even on kind of a normal kind of trajectory where renewables are very successful.
Like clean firm is kind of a useful complement, right?
And it makes the overall system more efficient.
It kind of like reduces the like the necessity to like overbuild intermittent renewables,
reduces the necessity of storage, et cetera, right?
So like the case for clean firm is not entirely like a hedging one.
But then there's also kind of the hedging one, which is like, I think we talked about this
before, right?
Like if we kind of wake up in 2040 and like our situation looks much worse than we're thinking
now, like what has gone wrong?
Well, one of the main things that could have gone wrong is that like expanding solar and
wind was much hotter.
And in that sense, investments in and clean firm are like a hedge against that.
And there's a key fact of like climate that makes the hedging quality important.
And that's essentially like the shape of climate damage.
So that climate damage should kind of like or our expectation of like how climate damage
looks like is that it's kind of like strongly nonlinear.
So like a world of six degrees is like much worse than twice as bad than a world of three
degrees and the world of three degrees much worse than twice as bad than 1.5 degrees.
So it's kind of particularly important, right?
I mean, you need to control for how likely those are.
But like it's like, even if you kind of control for how likely there are, it's kind of important
to like favor solutions that work in situations where a lot of damage is.
So those are kind of right now, I would say those are the world's kind of
more of like 2.5 degrees, like 2.5 to 3.5.
Like those are reasonably likely and reasonably more damaging than the worst cases that kind
of take a lot of the expected damage and the function.
And under those, like if you're in those situations, right, you kind of know something,
probabilistically speaking, you know something that is likely to have happened in those worlds.
Like one thing that's likely to have happened is that renewables will have like,
yeah, been more curtailed than we expect.
Okay. And I think we'll discuss this more later, thinking about different climate scenarios
and where we should spend our money to kind of cover all scenarios.
But before we get there, I want to talk about some governmental options.
What could governments do in order to help this situation?
You mentioned before how European governments and California was able to subsidize
renewables to such an extent that they are now quite cheap.
In general, what's your sense of how well subsidies work?
Would you recommend that governments try to pick out which energy technologies they
favor and then subsidize those?
The broad answer to, which this kind of relates to like, what is, what, how good is the government
at picking winners and like how far should the government pick winners?
I think like the broad answer is here, like the government was heavily involved in every
kind of important technological success when it comes to energy and climate,
and also like heavily involved in lots of different failures.
So like on the success, right, we have like solar, we have electric cars, we have wind,
we have nuclear, we have fracking, on the failure, we have stuff like salindra, we have stuff like
biofuels in the US, which are like subsidized because they're kind of big in Iowa, and Iowa
is important for presidential elections. Like, so like you have like the good, the bad, and the
ugly kind of all, all together, right? So like, that's important, right? It's like, it's not,
there's essentially no example of like energy technology transformation that kind of
where government has not played a huge role.
So I think that that's something worth, like worth remembering kind of just to start.
And it's also, there's no, because there's no clear example where essentially technology has been
an energy technology has been brought about primarily by market forces, right? So like,
so like there's demonstration projects, those are often public or like at least publicly,
partially publicly funded. Then there's kind of about this basic R&D where like government also
plays a big role demonstration projects. And there's kind of like early procurement policies,
like across the entire chain of the environment of the innovation process government plays a huge
role. And I think there isn't really an alternative to this, or like we haven't really observed
an alternative to this. So I think the view that I would kind of have is like, in general,
kind of government is much better than its reputation. Because like once electric cars get
cheap, then we're all celebrating Elon Musk, but we're like forgetting the fact that like,
there's like huge electric cars subsidies that like made Tesla possible, right? And I mean,
there's a similar story like not to pick on Elon Musk, right? There's a similar story for like most
other kind of technological successes. At the end, there's kind of a private company that's kind of
doing the last mile that's getting a lot of the attention. But like before, or even at that last
stage, there's huge, huge involvement by the government. So I think that's, that's what I can
say to, to start. So government will make mistakes. But I think the alternative is not to not let the
government pick. Ideally, and I think that's what we're kind of seeing in the United States right
now. You're essentially trying to support technology at the right, at the right level, right? So
like, you shouldn't choose all technologies. And you should also like be humble in terms of like,
you cannot pick all the winners. But right now, if you look at the inflation reduction act and
the infrastructure bills, like the two major pieces of kind of climate policy change in the
United States are now, they're essentially like very broad, that's unlike lots of different
technologies. And they're very kind of on the one hand, like an infrastructure bill like R&D
driven, in the case of the inflation reduction act, more like subsidy and later stage technology
driven, like, I guess they're a very strong form of government involvement. But in a way, they're
picking a lot of winners or like some of them will not be winners, right? So like, they're,
they're kind of very, very broad in their approach to their credit.
And do you think that's the right strategy to subsidize or to support from the government side
across a wide range of technologies and across different stages of technological development?
So if we're saying that history is informative, then I think that's kind of what history teaches
us about like innovation and energy. Yes.
Are there any research and development into one of the forms of energy technology we talked about
that you think the government should spend more money on? Should the government be subsidizing
at a later stage of development, some of these technologies?
So like, I guess to contextualize the moment that we're in, right? So like, we're in, well, yeah,
mid 20 or mid to late 2023. And like, both in the United States, and to a lesser degree also in
Europe, like we've seen like major climate policies over the last year, right? So like,
like in the, in the United States was focused on that case, right? So like the inflation reduction
act was passed, like essentially almost exactly a year ago, a year before the infrastructure
bill was passed. And like both of those are kind of like, putting support for clean energy, essentially
on a, on a whole order of magnitude, kind of different levels. So we're now subsidizing
or the inflation reduction act, we're going to subsidize renewable like only renewables clean
energy, and other kind of clean technologies on the order of like, 300 billion, at least,
then could go, could go, could go higher than this. We are in a situation where like, money is not
the primary constraint right now, for most kind of energy innovation, or it's kind of like, it's
much more harder to make that case, right? Like that doesn't mean we're in a situation where
everything is kind of going great, right? It's more of that kind of the challenges, maybe more
like stuff like permitting reform, or kind of making those demonstration projects happening,
or like, in the case of nuclear reforming the nuclear regulatory commission. So it's not so much
about money being the limiting constraint that and like, for the second part of the question,
should they support at a later stage? Yes, absolutely. So I think the basic, the basic problem in
the discourse, I think is that there's relatively broad support for like, basic research and
development, right? Like, support for that is kind of very kind of mainstream, right? Like,
lots of conservatives will kind of support investment in basic, basic R&D, because there's
a very clear market failure there, it's very well recognized. So it's kind of very bipartisan,
or at least there's kind of like a broad kind of set of people that will support that. But like,
the area where most failure happens is kind of in the later stages, is kind of like getting
the 100 million for a demonstration project. So that's something that historically in the
United States, for example, has been hard to kind of get political buy-in to fund this work,
right? Because it's also like, when you fail, you fail very visibly, right? So like, Mitt Romney
in 2012, like, started his campaign at the Solyndra plant, right? Like, Solyndra being like, kind of
the example of the failure of kind of the clean energy investments of the Obama administration.
So maybe, maybe explain what happened there. I'm not familiar with the, is it called Solyndra?
Yeah. So like, Solyndra was kind of like an advanced solar company that kind of
was kind of heavily supported by the American Reinvestment Act, or kind of the small scale
version of what Biden did now, like enlarge with inflation reduction act, kind of like,
the recovery after 2018, the clean energy spending there. And Solyndra was kind of a very, very
public failure of a company that was kind of heavily backed by the government. And yeah,
essentially became the symbol of like, okay, the government is really bad at picking winners,
right? And like, that kind of happened at the same time as kind of the shale gas revolution was
playing out, right? Where like, also the government had kind of played a big, big role in supporting
that. So it's just like, we're very selective in picking our examples. What do you think about
carbon taxes? This is a solution to climate change that's often favored by economists,
where you simply price the negative externality of emissions, and then you let the market figure
out how to implement the, or how to reduce emissions. Do you think carbon taxes could work?
So I guess I mentioned this in the beginning, but just just to recap. So before I joined
founder, I spent five years working on carbon pricing and mission trading system, carbon taxes.
So I'm very familiar with those debates. I mean, I think they can work, but I think they will not
play like a major role in kind of the solution. And just like to give a couple of, couple of
like arguments, why? So if you're like thinking again about kind of the example of like solar
and how solar got cheap. So the subsidies that kind of Germany was able to kind of,
that were politically feasible in the early 2000s in Germany, you could have achieved them with a
carbon tax between like 700 to 900, something in that range dollars per ton. That's an insanely
high carbon tax. So like at that point, most of the world had no carbon taxes at all, right?
Like Germany had no carbon tax at all. Like the only kind of countries having carbon taxes were
like Scandinavian countries. And like even then, like the highest carbon tax would be something like
$50 a ton, right? So like the really kind of transformative price signal that you need to
like drive an immature technology, you will probably never get with a carbon tax that's
politically feasible, right? Like you could not, it's not that you could have had a carbon tax at
that level at that time. So I think that's kind of one reason, right? And now we're essentially
like, now we're essentially in a situation where like solar, we're kind of the difference to the
fossil fuel alternative was kind of zero in many cases, right? You wouldn't need a carbon tax.
Essentially, to solve climate change, you need fundamental technological transformation.
And for that, you need like very, very strong push and you cannot get this kind of push
with a politically feasible price. So that's kind of one constraint. And the other constraint is kind
of the international situation. So if you were in a situation where you would have a global
carbon tax, right? Like maybe or a global kind of carbon price, maybe that would be enough to kind
of induce some innovation, et cetera. But like, you never, like it's very far, very far from getting
there. So I think right now we're in a situation where it's very clear that the most significant
things that like individual countries can do, like in a situation where international coordination
is relatively weak, are not about kind of introducing a carbon tax. Like had Germany
introduced the carbon tax in 2005, this would have or sorry, in 2005, we got the emission
trading system. So let's say if we had like introduced like reasonably high carbon prices
early in the 2000s, would have kind of accelerated like transition from like German coal to Russian
gas, that would have been the main effect would not have had like transformative effects globally
speaking, right? So like, that's I think the really big constraint there. So essentially,
yeah, carbon taxes might play a role. Once all technologies are reasonably close to
competitiveness, and then you can kind of iron out a little bit on the on the margin.
But I guess that that's kind of like not not the point where it really matters anymore.
Yeah, and just just to check with you, what do you what do you think about planting trees?
Is that with that work at all? Is that on the kind of with that have a large enough effect to
matter? You sometimes hear claims about the importance of the of the Amazon rainforest,
for example, as a as a way of decreasing CO2 in the atmosphere. Could the government initiate
a large kind of projects of planting more forest with that work?
So I mean, in principle, the easier thing should always be avoiding deforestation,
because planting trees to like to have a carbon effect right like it takes 20 years.
It's not instantaneously useful. I mean, I guess I guess to start with again,
now we kind of need to refocus on we're talking here on the margin. And when we talk about trees,
everyone loves trees. Like the person I meet the most like the superficial kind of climate
person I meet the most right like the first like they want to like they want to plant trees.
Like that's the first thing that essentially everyone kind of coming into this conversation
jumps to. Yeah, this is exactly why I brought it up because I'm guessing that this proposal would
be extremely popular with a kind of broad public and maybe that itself, even though planting trees
may may not be the most effective thing. Just the fact that it's so popular might mean that
it's it's easier to implement and that could be an argument for it. Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean,
you would need to do a certain insane scale. But so if you're thinking about the kind of the
existing solution on the space, which is essentially about like rainforest protection,
right? And like there we have kind of an international carbon market around protecting
rainforests like called web plus. And the basic idea there is like, you're rewarding countries
for avoiding deforestation. So, and like the most significant example of this is like between
Norway and Brazil, where like Norway kind of try to like pay Brazil lots of money to kind of like,
yeah, save kind of like deforest less. And the problem with that is I think fundamentally that
you're rewarding something you can't observe, like you're avoiding counterfactual, like you're
rewarding, of additionally avoid a deforestation, which is not something you can observe, right?
So like you're, and so like that is kind of hard in the best case. And it's like, essentially
impossible when you have like sovereign nation states that all can kind of have their own,
their own estimates. So that's one of the problems. And the other problem, of course, it's kind of
a snot, like the main benefit of like avoiding deforestation comes from the long term again,
right? So like, but you can't really have like credible, credible commitments over like decades
in terms of protecting trees. So like it's a solution that like looks seductively simple,
but kind of in practice kind of doesn't work. Yeah, so like that's kind of the case for avoiding
deforestation and for planting trees. Yeah, I mean, you need to do those on an extremely
massive scale. And like, it's not going to have large effects kind of in the short term.
Yeah, are there any other non technological options that you like, or that you find promising?
There's lots of other things we can do, right? So like, I think one thing
that we should talk about briefly would be climate finance. So which is essentially the
idea of like incentivizing lower income countries for like building or like paying essentially
paying more clean energy infrastructure. Yeah, in principle, that's one of the things that you
would expect if we had a global carbon market, right? Because like, abating abating emissions
should be cheaper in a lower income country. So that's another approach that kind of has
suffered from any of the problems I've now talked about with regards to with regards to
rainforest protection. So that's another approach that I think we should mention.
And then there's kind of when you're kind of in a situation where you have a lot of
growth happening, right? So if you're kind of an emerging Asia right now,
there is a lot of variance and like how emission intensive that growth can be. So like we've just
hired a carbon locking specialist who like she will kind of look at what are the interventions
we can do there. But like if you kind of look at the literature, you can kind of see like
clear differences related to yeah, like how our city is being built and these kind of
things like kind of shape essentially shaping long run behavioral patterns by like different
forms of infrastructure investments. Yeah, and you mentioned supporting innovation or innovation
policy. I mean, that's kind of ties to what we've talked about before, right, which is like
the government is essential for technological transformation. What the government does can
be affected by advocacy, you can kind of fund through like where you can find a charity to
do this kind of work. And it is it locks it kind of souls for this like what I described is like
the central conundrum of climate policy, right, that kind of essentially the US, the EU have like
way more leverage through innovation on like global emission outcomes than like through their
territorial emissions. So you have this potential for trajectory changing dynamics, right, that
we've kind of been discussing with the example of solar electric cars, etc. that relatively small
changes in the world, like in the large in the grand scheme of things, right, like California
aggressively supporting electric cars or Denmark aggressively supporting wind power, these are
like small changes in the world, but like huge long term consequences. So I think that's kind of
the thing and like the other things that I would mention, so like kind of on the on the carbon
lock inside would be stuff like essentially regulatory reform, right. And the US, this would
be something like permitting reform, which which will become like a hot issue or it's already
becoming a hot issue because the financing for clean energy is there, but the permits and the
regulation is not there. And there's similar similar issues and like emerging emerging economies.
So it's not all about technological innovation, not at all, right. It's also about like, yeah,
shaping the regulatory frameworks, etc. And here you're using some amount of money in order to
influence a much bigger amount of money. Basically, you're using philanthropic dollars to influence
the dollars or the money spent by governments. Yeah, so for everything that we're kind of funding
and there's always, there's always kind of advocacy in the broader sense of the term. So I'm
kind of saying essentially using philanthropy to influence much larger budgets, right. And like
like that reasoning comes from the fact that like, all government budgets are like several orders of
magnitude like two to three orders of magnitude larger than philanthropy. And also I think what
we've already touched on, right, like there's things that kind of essentially need the government,
even if it's like changing regulation, etc. Right. So like most impact focused philanthropy and
climate is ultimately about kind of shaping actions of the government or other large actors.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I do wonder though, aren't there a lot of kind of interest
groups trying to get the government to spend money on on various things. And so you might,
there might be a lot of competition for influence over over the government's resources.
When I just talked about like the the different sizes of the changes in the world,
that kind of relates relates to this. I think that the best case or like the kind of the highest
impact case for like philanthropy to have like a large impact on government policy is kind of in
situations where there's like relatively little attention, right. So like, if we're kind of thinking
about the counter example of like the carbon tax, like needs national attention needs like bipartisan
support to be passed, definitely needs national conversation. Like that's probably a situation
where like an additional philanthropic dollar will not make a large difference because kind of like
lots of other money is involved. But when you're kind of in a situation where like, you know,
okay, we're going to pass this big climate bill. And like, there's a big national conversation about
we want to do this, the climate bill, but ultimately, like how exactly does this climate
bill look like, which technology does support and how that is kind of a thing, the sweet spot for
kind of philanthropy, right, because we're essentially there's lots of political science
literature for like how this kind of works. It's what's called legislative subsidy. So there's
kind of special charities that kind of specialize and like knowing which legislation would be needed
to kind of promote a given technology or a given approach. And yeah, essentially providing providing
that knowledge to the policymaker. So I think that's kind of a way in which in which charities can
have a large influence and kind of policy feels that are less politicized and that are kind of like
under, yeah, that are kind of not not not super not super crowded. Yeah, let's give an overview
of the different climate scenarios. So what's most likely to happen with the climate and specifically,
I think we should talk about the worst cases and how likely those are. If you kind of look at the
forecast, there's something like one third probability that we will kind of meet global
climate targets. So that would be like limiting warming to two degrees. Then there's kind of
about another third for something like between two, two and three degrees. And then there's kind
of another third for everything kind of above three degrees from up to like five degrees. So
this is kind of from a we can we can link this in the show notes, but like that's kind of from an
from an LSE paper that kind of tried to try to estimate this last year. And but like there's
different ways to estimate this, but it's kind of like broadly, broadly consistent. So like, we're
probably not in current trajectory, it's not going to meet the global climate targets. We're
going to overshoot them by a degree or so. At the same time, right, kind of the really extreme
scenarios like six degrees or something like that has become like, very, very significantly
less likely compared to what we believe like five or six years ago. Yeah, maybe you could
describe some of the effects of the these different degrees of heating. It's a bit abstract when
we're talking in terms of degrees, could you describe some of the effects of different degrees
of heating? I mean, again, like, this is of course an area where there's always like huge
uncertainties, right? So like, we're like, if you look at the bars, like when do certain phenomena
start, it's kind of always like, okay, this could start at two degrees, it could start at 4.5 degrees.
I mean, the thing that we're kind of like right now, we're kind of in a situation where we can
where we can essentially see climate change in our daily lives, right, where kind of the temperature
extremes have clearly changed, also like where like many, not all, but like kind of many kind of
natural disasters have a climate change signal on there, right? So it kind of become more likely
or more intense related to climate change. So that's kind of where we are right now.
It's broadly kind of, I guess, probably think these things have become more, more intense,
then if you're kind of, I guess, if you're hitting two degrees or more, then like tipping point,
tipping points become somewhat more likely. So there are elements in the climate system that
either would kind of have like local environment effects, so like dieback on the Amazon, for example,
or kind of have like global climate effects, like shifting global temperature up by a half
degree or something of that sort. So those kind of things become kind of
become happening more as we're moving higher up. Yeah, I think that's kind of the main thing. So
I would say this is pretty abstract. The reason for that is this is not really what I'm not really
spending a lot of time on that. I'm mostly interested, like give them what I'm doing day to
day. I'm mostly interested in understanding the shape of the curve and how likely the different
futures are because that's kind of what's relevant for me to prioritize. And so are you
prioritizing the worst case scenarios? No. And I'm really happy that you asked this because
this is a very typical misunderstanding. So what I'm essentially arguing for, and I have a talk
about this, which we can also link like on the structure of climate risk and its implications
for high impact philanthropy. What I'm essentially asking, arguing for is we treat this the same,
that we will treat other problems. So like, we're essentially looking at expected damage,
right? So like an expected damage is the product of two different things. It's like the probability
of different futures and how bad those futures would be. And right now, most of the probability
mass, so when we put these things together based on the current estimates would be, as I said, I
think like above, like most of the damage would be above 2.5 to 3.5. But crucially, it would not be
in like six degrees or more. Because that's like, even though those worlds will be extremely
damaging, they've become so much less likely that they're so that kind of the degree like the low
likelihood kind of dominates the strength of the signal. So it's not about just focusing on the
worst world is kind of taking unexpected damage. And the alternative to this, that I'm criticizing
is essentially much of the focus of the climate community where it's like, black and white, like
either we need the goal of the Paris Agreement or we don't, like there's all of this massive
complexity that you talked about. And we're just reducing it to, okay, on a two degree trajectory,
we will need this and this and this. And like that's kind of, I guess, in a way, the wrong question.
Where do you see the most expected damage then? Yeah. So, and the last time we ran these numbers
and we should run them again this year, but like, it's kind of, I think, in those worlds that are
both reasonably likely and also much more like significantly more damaging than kind of the
best case worlds, right? So they will be like worlds of like 2.5 to 3.5 degrees, roughly,
that's kind of where the bulk of the damages. So those are worlds where the Paris Agreement has
not succeeded, right? Because I mean, the Paris Agreement's goal is to limit temperature to two
degrees. They're also like worlds where like, yeah, some things must, must clearly have gone wrong.
They're also not worlds like those worlds are not consistent with like, super cheap,
renewable, easy seasonal storage, etc. Yeah. And in those worlds, what are the most
promising interventions to alleviate the expected damage? The method here is, let's think about,
because we're in this situation of extreme uncertainty, about lots of different things,
like how much our economy is going to grow, how carbon tensiles is going to be, how will
different technologies play out, how strong will the climate react? And all of these things are
highly uncertain, but we're trying to understand what do we know about the structure here? Like,
what do we know? What is more likely to be true in the worst world, essentially? So like, on the
technological level, where we already talked about this, right? So like, okay, a typical, like,
there's kind of two, two typical or two, I think, failure modes that people would expect, like one
is kind of like, renewables do not scale as much, another would kind of be that electrification
doesn't scale as much, right? So that's kind of related. So if renewables don't scale as much,
then like, the clean firm power sources that we talked about, right, those are kind of, we're
going to play a relatively larger role. So like, a significant part of the motivation of like,
investing in geothermal, investing in advanced nuclear kind of comes, not all of it, but like,
comes from that. There's, of course, also like, other aspects to this, right? It's not only about
the choice of energy technology, it's also about like, different kinds of solutions. So if you're
kind of thinking about those futures, like, those are not futures where, as a side like,
international cooperation on climate, like being on a great shape is not consistent with being in
the 3.5 world. So that means that things that kind of maybe look very good on the best case,
right? Like, if the best case is kind of like, the case that we're in right now, or probably even
better, let's say, saving trees on the Amazon, like if we could kind of get this to work, right?
Like, even if that were very cheap in the best case where we solve this regulatory problem,
that's so far we were not able to solve. Now, that's not going to work in this kind of world,
right? So, so, so that's, I think, something that's kind of contraindicated in this case, right? So
it's kind of like, this will look worse. And similarly, if you kind of think about the structure
of the world economy, like, and kind of like, the future predictions, you probably have like,
more of the higher warming worlds are like, in situations where like, emerging economies have
been growing very strongly, right? So like, yeah, we're, I guess, like, let's say Africa has kind
of growing and growing very strong. So it also tells us something about like, regional prioritization
at some level. I think actually, that's a great segue to where I would like to
end this conversation by talking about kind of interactions between climate and other areas,
we could call them. What are the tradeoffs between economic development and emissions?
Yeah, so that depends on where you are with regards to economic development. So there's a
very strong relationship between economic development or human development more generally,
and use of energy. And that's like, not like a one direction causation, right? So like, we
shouldn't say like, more energy causes more development. But we should say that it would
be very surprising that the world gets a lot richer without losing a lot more energy. So I
think that's very clear. And like, there's papers on that that show this very clearly. And that's
like, kind of really, really strong kind of relationship. And the relationship is much,
much stronger in the earlier part of the ladder, right? So like, high income countries right now
are able to grow without growing their emissions, right? So there's like,
about 20, 25 countries or so that have been able to grow over the last decade, grow their GDP
without growing their emissions, what would be kind of like the, the weak kind of condition
of decoupling, right? It's kind of not, doesn't mean they will meet their climate goals,
but it kind of means that kind of growth is kind of possible without increasing emissions.
But that is not true on the, on the lower end, right? And like, broadly for, for three reasons,
if you're kind of very energy poor, then like, so if you can kind of save more energy, like energy
efficiency gains, etc., we'll just use, like, probably translate into, into more energy use.
So I think that's kind of one reason there's two other ones. So one is kind of like earlier
economic development is kind of more, more carbon intensive, right? So it requires stuff like,
that requires a little steel and cement, the kind of stuff that's kind of
hard to decarbonize right now, or which we actually have not decarbonized to this point
at like, reasonable cost. So that's kind of another aspect to this. Yeah, so that essentially
you're doing lots of infrastructure investments that are, that are very early. And of course,
also like the willingness to pay for climate policy is like very low and rightly so very low
if you're not in a very energy poor context, right? If you're in India and have like, 400
million people without access to electricity, then like the first thing that you're thinking about
is not implementing a carbon tax. And so we mentioned one very large benefit of using less
oil and coal, which is to add, which is a decrease in air pollution. Do you think there are other
additional benefits here in thinking in terms of greater food stability or less conflict,
or something like that? I would call it the more sophisticated case about caring about climate
change is probably less about like extreme weather events and the like the dire impacts of
extreme weather events, but more like political instability and conflict, especially in places
that are heavily dependent on like, well, environmental conditions, right? So if you're
kind of in sub-Saharan Africa, and you have like rain-fed agriculture, like that is probably the
most likely case where you can get social destabilization because of climate change, because
you're like the vulnerability is very high. So yeah, I think that's kind of an important
effect. This seems like very important from like, like, ethically speaking from a perspective of
like, okay, this is like climate change is hurting the global poor the most. And like, it's kind of
the most destabilizing probably in those in those areas. So I think that's a very important
effect. And something that I think effective altruists, it's easy for effective altruists to
forget that because in a way, if you kind of think about climate as a civilizational risk,
I think I would agree that the civilizational risk aspect of climate is kind of low because
it's kind of hard to imagine a great power war because of climate change. And I guess like,
if you're kind of caring about the long-term future, like great power wars are just like
extraordinarily important. But kind of from the from the more near term suffering perspective,
like I think that's a very significant effect. And another one that comes more from
essentially making clean energy cheap, right, is kind of so like reducing energy poverty. So I
just I just mentioned like, I guess 400 million people in India not having access to electricity,
right? So like, we're living in a world where like, what we are thinking about first when we
were reducing emissions, right, like we can use, we can all use a lot less energy without like,
sacrificing a lot of our living standards. But we're not living in a globally representative part
of the world, both of us and I think most listeners. So it's a kind of very different
situation like the average human on this planet is like very energy poor and like we're the human
development benefits of access to more energy are very significant. Yeah, so and ideally,
if it's quite clean and cheap energy, that's the ideal case. Yeah, that's a great point.
Johannes, thanks for coming on the podcast. It's been a real pleasure. Thanks for sharing
your knowledge with us. Yeah, thank you so much. Yes, great to be here.
