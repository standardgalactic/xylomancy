Oh, tell me, New York, why, that it seems so inviting?
Oh, tell me, New York, it spells the thrill of first night in
Goody day rain growls and simmering clouds in canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home
It's out of me, New York, it brings the promise of new life
Oh, tell me, New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamer with empty hands, may sigh for exotic lands
It's old time in New York, it's good to live it again
Oh, tell me, New York is often mingled with pain
