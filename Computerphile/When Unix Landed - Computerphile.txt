We're talking late 70s over to early 80s, a crucial period actually for computers in many
regards, yes. There was definitely a British's best Britain first purchasing policy, either
for government institutions like radar establishments, like the police, all this kind of stuff,
and particularly for educational establishments. The feeling was computers are expensive,
so if we can spend a lot of money it might as well be fell back into the British economy
by buying British. Certainly applied to universities, one or two were allowed to escape. I think the
University of Newcastle on the computer science front was allowed to have an IBM, so of course
was the University of Cambridge. Can't remember what happened at Oxford.
It was a way for me to find out by the back door about the advantages in a way of sharing a
hardware platform with not just other universities but other government institutions. And in one
of the previous videos I've talked about how we only felt able to use ALGOL 68 as a teaching
language because that well-known government institution blessed them, the Royal Radar
establishment, that actually put a huge amount of effort into setting up a very good ALGOL 68
compiler. And of course it had to be on ICO machinery, they were a government establishment,
so were we, so we benefited from that a lot. How did you get into UNIX? You went over to the
States didn't you? Can you tell me about that? Yes, I was true. I went over to the States in 1978
for the whole calendar year and visited in short order and it was all highly educational, a visit
to Oklahoma State University where they'd written an ALGOL 68 compiler, so given my interest in
those days that was a no-brainer. But I then thought no, no if I'm going to be away for a year
I want the California experience and so I finagled my way into doing some teaching at UCLA of course
in Los Angeles. But also in the Cal State system, Cal State Northridge is a well-known California
state thing and I did, I lectured all sorts of computer things, I taught FORTRAN in Oklahoma
and so on. It was weird actually, but in some ways at Nottingham we were a little bit ahead of the
curve there because before I left we'd taken our first tentative steps into getting this thing called
UNIX which enabled you on an underpowered PDP-11 to sort of run your own programming experience,
multi-user but only on dumb terminals, multi-user multi-tasking operating system,
hopelessly underpowered machinery, but it sort of worked and this was, must have been about 76
when we bought, first of all a PDP-1105 just to get used to having our own computer of some sort,
could do a similar programming, but I think just more or less as I got in the plane from America
my colleagues told me that no we're going to get that upgraded to a PDP-1135 as quickly as possible
and that when we do we will be ready to receive this operating system called UNIX done by Bell Labs
and people said to me Dave you'll find just like why did a radar establishment have to support your
compiler, you'll now be saying why does a telephone company have to be the people that
provides me with a little operating system that I feel happy with and it was, it was as Yogi Berrow
once said like deja vu all over again, okay I'm going to say wow you know you're ahead of us we
want to go to UNIX we can't get approval all this kind of stuff, so when I came back 1979
very cold winter all that, it really was a liberation to know that while we might have to
rely on the computing centre for a lot of bulk teaching and running programs nevertheless we
could start to do our own thing on PDP-11s with an eye to the future, but even so we couldn't
on a PDP-1135 give a bulk service to our CompSci undergrads, we continued running Algo 68
on ICL machinery with a huge extended overlap with us getting UNIX because we couldn't become
self-hosting on UNIX or have enough big powerful machines until well after this era, we were made
very aware that we were getting this for a few hundred dollars because it came from Bell Labs,
Bell Labs was a so-called regulated monopoly and that meant they were caught in the crossfire
from everywhere, they must not be seen to be using their massive leverage and obscene telephone
bills to squash little startup telcos, they must not get in the way of IBM because there was a
suspicion that you know when people said to Bell Labs well what are you doing for the public good
they thought it was a nice cool idea to say look we've got basically a computer science research
department, we're not a computer company but these researchers, it really was a bit like
Malvern's radar, Defence establishment, we are not a computing company absolutely not but we
have developed some software that universities might find interesting, so we're proposing for
the public good to virtually give away this software if anybody's interested and it's a start
and IBM won't see it as a threat, so we're all right you can get hold of this so long as you are
a bona fide degree giving institution, you can get hold of this UNIX, you must have of course
pdp11, got to keep America's balance of payments in the black and it must be at least a pdp1135,
not the most minimal you could get, if you do that this UNIX will get you started in the great world
of multi-user on simple terminals, you can do your own thing, you'll run out of steam after about
four or five users but nevertheless it's all yours, so we cheerfully signed up for this and this
as I say it was back in 1979 it's all about to happen, version 7 of UNIX, I think we did somehow
get hold of the previous one version 6 but serious usage started with version 7, to find out more
about this version 7 that we were getting, how did you find out, let me be boring and oldy and say
yet again there was no internet, there were no web pages to tell you about this, there was not even
email, you had to send out posters to departments, you had to use letters, you could send faxes right
and you had to say we are the UK UNIX user group principally populated by representatives from
computer science departments in UK universities, we are almost all of us absolutely long to have
UNIX, we have persuaded the American master UNIX user group and AT&T the ultimate owners of Bell Labs
who ran all the patents and licensing, they're going to come over and tell us how to get licensed
for an academic use only, license for UNIX and what's it all about and it was a superb chat shop
and ideas, swap shop as it were, enjoyed it hugely, the star of the show is a visitor from AT&T
Patents and Licensing Frank J. Riffle Jr. I remember his name and oh boy did he have the job from hell
trying to keep everybody happy and he said I want to license you all, you're wonderful you know
we love universities and I'm in charge of Patents and Licensing but I got to warn you you must not
do any commercial usage with this, it is purely for degree giving teaching only right and he kept on
muttering to himself there were a lot of gray areas and it's my job to stamp them out and
what a heck of a job it was, he said just remember you must be a bona fide degree giving university
institution then you will be licensed, no others, a hand goes up from the audience, a guy I got to
know quite well later on but he really was the odd man out, hand goes up and said well how about me
you've licensed me for version 6 but I'm not at a university, where are you from sir and he said
Marcus Gray this guy's name was, he said I'm just a college, I'm pre-university you know
from basically we concentrate from 11 to 18, I'm Marlborough College, I'm a public school,
now I think even the Americans know that there's nothing more
badly named than an English public school, it is not available to the poor and the needy as it
probably should be or was originally, no some public schools are so expensive you need serious
money to attend them, principally Eaton is the most famous but Marlborough College isn't far behind
I mean the tuition fees at Marlborough College will make your eyes water so this guy said no,
no I'm not, I'm pre-university, I'm Marlborough College but sir over here you know most colleges
are like universities and Marcus said no it's not the case with me and Riffle was getting more and
more ruffled, that's a joke and said sir let me try and summarize are you trying to tell me
that you are more or less a very expensive version of what I would call a high school
and Marcus said, yeah that's roughly right, he just looked at Marcus and said sir
you should not have been licensed and he didn't say it but in parentheses I could hear it going
on in the background, oh boy somebody's going to be in deep trouble when I get back to Murray Hill
New Jersey, he said sir you should not have been licensed but Frank J. Riffle is a man of his word,
I will not take your license away sir, truly it did change everything and I do remember very well
we had a lot of conversations at the UK Units Group saying those guys at Bellab's are just so
good, the two of them obviously, Dennis and Ken we've talked about them many a time, they've invented
the C language for system implementation, they've developed Units and it does things sensibly and
this is absolutely great, aren't we lucky I thought as a community to have them being on our side
and I did think I wonder if they'll ever get any recognition from the ACM, shall we say about what
they've done and I was very pleased, it took till 1983 I think but eventually so many academics in
the US and all over the world were using Units that Dennis and Ken were given the ACM Turing Award,
it was actually awarded to them in 84, it was won and achieved in 83, so in 1984
they had to give a talk about what their work meant and normally when you write a paper to go
with your presentation, you thank everybody which you did but then you go on to say here's how Units
came about, here's the nuts and bolts of what it's like to really run it, we didn't get that at all,
we got thank yous from Ken in cryptic terms but very heartfelt to a lot of people so he said I now
just want to point out something to you, effectively you've got something here
where we use C as a system programming language so the operating system is written in a high-level
language, have you any idea the problems that is going to open up to the potential flaws,
security holds, let me just demonstrate one of these to you, you'll be amazed and amused
and I mean you know what standards we have on computer file, we don't swear so I'll allow
myself to say that one of the rather celebrated people that we're going to point you at in the
next video just described Ken's contribution as a total effing bombshell and he wasn't wrong,
a lot of people couldn't understand why it was a bombshell but it really really is
and I'd like to do my best to explain to you just how, what a fundamental earthquake this
caused once people understood what he was trying to say, a few seconds or half a second of time
then give him a half and then give her a little bit and just go round and round the people who
wanted to do some kind of computing and because computers were even then, so the speed of those
pulses tell us the rate, we know which direction it is because we know which role it's coming from
