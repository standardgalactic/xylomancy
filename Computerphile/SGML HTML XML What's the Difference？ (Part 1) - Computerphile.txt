The people defining what was called the standard generalised markup language,
SGML, they took over the pointy bracket notation and actually used it within documents themselves.
It leads back into computer science principles in so many many ways and there has been so much
confusion. So I suppose you could say what this episode is about is SGML, HTML, XML,

was in the big database, so that was the overall idea of it. But in order to show you
how this SGML worked let's start straight away with something very simple. Here is a sample memo.
There is a two part. It's been sent to Tony Blair. This is way back in the early years of this
century around, about the time of the Iraq War I think is this fictitious memo. It is from
y White House. The message is as follows and it says, the president says, thanks for your support,
simple as that. So there's a two, a from and a body, a message body. Now as computer scientists
we realise straight away that even if it's just a sequence you can still present it as a left
to right structure within a tree. So here's a structured tree representation of what we've just
informally written down. The whole thing look at the top is a memo and when you look below in the
tree it says, ah obviously a memo is a sequence of a two part followed by a from part followed by a
body part, great. Within the two part there's just some text, it says Tony Blair, the from part,
more text, it's from the White House. Body part, I've deliberately made this a little bit more
complicated. I've said that the body part can be if you like just be a single paragraph a p and within
a p there could be arbitrary mixtures of plain text the president says or marked quotations
because what I'm going to do is to say that thing that was in quotes is an example of a
quotation so that if in future Sean were to say to me go through all our memos and dig out the bits
that are quotations or quoted speech then because it's tagged and marked it's so much easier to
pick out of course. From that tree then how does that translate into sgml notation? Don't panic it's
very very similar to what you're now familiar with as xml notation. Right here is a tag that says
this whole thing is a memo and this is where it begins. A two tag is to Tony Blair but being a good
boy I must remember to end the two tag. From the White House end of the from part here comes the body
now I typeset the thing previously as the word message but this is just to illustrate that if
you're crawling all over this spec with a typesetting engine you could take the decision that every time
I see the word body as a tag I actually put out the typeset thing saying message. I could have said
body but the tags themselves can trigger typesetting and stylistic decisions if that's what you
want to do. So here we come then here's the body of the memo and like I said it's got to be a paragraph
denoted with a p. Here's the free text that I'm allowed the president says and here is the nested
quote inside the paragraph denoted with a q tag thank you for your support end of quote end of
paragraph end of memo now some of you eagle-eyed will immediately be dashing to the comments on
this video right now hold on and we'll say you've missed out the end of body tag to which the answer
is yes sgml allowed you to do that so long as you warned it in the spec that goes behind this of
the legal tags if you said I will optionally make end of body be omittable then the biblical
handerbook here says you may specify that you want certain end tags to be omitted provided that
doing so will not lead to ambiguity and therein lies a complete nest of vipers but in this particular
case it's all right you could put in and replace end of body why did they do this well in Charles
Goldfobbs eraill you have got to remember disk space was massively expensive and this sounds
stupid but it isn't every single saved end tag all added up to so many hundred kilobytes that you
didn't need because it could be assumed and safely replaced you hope so you know they were not off
their heads they were trying to save disk space here's where we have to try and choose our words
very carefully and say what you're allowed to say and what you're not allowed to say in terms of
building memo out of sgml technology so let me begin with the bedrock and when I say sgml technology
don't forget what I mean it's basically sgml is like specifying the punctuation if you think about
it it's saying you can have any tag you like but the punctuation around it is pointy brackets so
here's our bedrock on top of this using sgml notation I've devised a memo language so remember
the right way to say this is that memo is an application of sgml in other words it uses the
technology of you must not say memo is a subset of sgml because they're different things sgml is a
meta notation memo is a specific tag set and just to tell you I wasn't alone way before me in the 1980s
there was a initiative within the US Department of Defense and I think it was to do with
requisition and stores and stuff like this I've even forgotten what the acronym refers to now called
cows one of the earliest applications very big of sgml I thought it was great being able to tag
things with what they are and what they mean there was also a more scholarly initiative called
the text encoding initiative I mean one can imagine there's no end of literature is this an example
of the early medieval subjunctive you tag it up to say yes it is everything was hunky dory document
professionals thought this is wonderful when computer scientists shouted at them basically
saying you shouldn't have allowed omitted n tags you've no idea the grief you will get into
the answer I think to that is if you're careful and if you take advice you can avoid the grief
but in a closed world of document professionals where very few people see the markup this is all
right then in the early 1990s oh boy did something happen that really blew it all wide open and
led to a much wider adoption of sgml a certain Tim Berners-Lee came along in the early 1990s
and it was about 1992 when it was first revealed to an unsuspective world and Tim said I like this
sgml and for these web pages rather than invent my own tagging meta notation I'll use the pointy bracket
notation of sgml but it was massively massively successful everybody oh yeah it's great pointy
bracket notation we love this specify our pages get them all out there well the weaknesses
in html first of all because it didn't have a document type definition to say what was optionally
admissible on what wasn't Tim had a certain view about well for example end of para even nowadays
in an xml compliant browser it's not going to refuse to show your page because you go from
p to another p without formally closing off the first power he just says oh I've hit another
p I'm already in the middle of a p I think I better close off the one I'm doing go into another
one fine but there were far worse problems than that and they really really came home to roost within
the first 18 months in 1994 there was a meeting I was there at Edinburgh where all of this came
out into the open a full furious frank discussion took place about what was wrong with html could
we ever put it right this has to be another story they wanted it to be clear it's part of the
definition and they said easy we're not going to call it hell or do a very quick report on how to
do a subset of full sgml that's cleaner
