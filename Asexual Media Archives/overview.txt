 Marty and her associate conducted a series of experiments to explore the differences between feelings of lust and love in relationships. In the first part of their study, they primed subjects to think about sexual desire or love for their partner and observed their reactions to various photographs. The results showed that subjects spent more time looking at and rated higher photos of young, scantily clad members of the opposite sex when primed to think about lust.

In the second part of the experiment, they brought in a new set of couples and asked them to discuss feelings of love for their partner. This time, the responses were different. Men who were primed to think about love viewed a woman in a bikini with less interest compared to men in the lust condition. The study found that thinking about love suppressed the desire to stray, especially for men. However, when men were primed to think about sexual desire, even images of their own partner could capture their attention for longer periods.

The research suggests that while both lust and love are powerful emotional drives, they serve different purposes in relationships: lust is primarily for finding and mating with a partner, whereas love is designed to help partners stay together, especially for raising children. The study highlights the ongoing conflict between these two forces within human relationships.

Lust influences behavior in myriad ways beyond just romantic relationships, potentially affecting parenting, work productivity, creativity, and more. The researchers believe that understanding the role of lust in various aspects of life is an area ripe for further investigation. The study underscores the complex interplay between our conscious and unconscious desires and how these drives shape our daily lives.
