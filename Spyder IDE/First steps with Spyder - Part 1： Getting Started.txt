Hello everyone, I'm Juanita and in this video I'm going to show you how to open
Spyder and go over the basics of Spyder's interface. We will learn about Spyder's
four paints that you'll likely be using most often, as well as really explore the
others that are open by default. If you don't have Spyder installed and would
like to follow along, you can download it at the link below this video.
The easiest way to open Spyder is by opening Anaconda Navigator and clicking
on Spyder application once it is open.
In case you have another version of Spyder in Navigator, open the command
lined or the Anaconda prompt in the case of Windows and type the commands
conda-update-anaconda and conda-install-spyder-equal-4.
To launch Spyder without opening Navigator, open your command line and
type Spyder. If you follow the installation guide, you should have
everything necessary to open Spyder 4.
This is what Spyder 4 looks like in its default configuration, though you can
terribly customize it, which we'll get to in a later tutorial. You can see that
it is divided into three sections showing three different paints, the
editor, the console and the help viewer. These three, along with the variable
explorer, are the four core paints you'll work with the most in Spyder.
On the left we have the code editor, where you can open, edit and run files.
Bottom right is the IPython console, which you can use both interactively and
to run your code in the editor. It shows you which version of Python you are
using. Above it, you'll find a help pane, where you can get more information and
documentation for any object in the editor or console by pressing Ctrl I or
Command I in macOS. We'll see how to do this in our next video. For the two
sections on the right, you can switch tabs to see the other paints that are open
by default when launching Spyder. In the top section, you can switch to the
variable explorer, which shows you the name, type, size and value of the variables
that you have previously defined in the editor or the console. You can also
modify the value of these variables directly from this pane by double-clicking
them right under the value column. The plot pane will show you the figures you
generated with MatplotLift and other libraries. And the files pane allows you
to browse the files in your computer and open them in the editor with just a
click. Finally, in the bottom section, you can also access the history pane, which
shows you the commands you have entered in the iPython console, including those
from previous sessions. I hope you're now familiar with the basics of using the
Spyder interface. In the next video, we will start working with Spyder's core
paints. Happy spydering!
