Checking Burback/Video Game Marketing Needs to Change.txt
 The discussion revolves around the challenges and pitfalls of video game marketing, with a focus on how games are often shown and advertised before they are fully developed. The example of God of War is used as a positive case where the gameplay demonstrated at E3 was indeed what the players eventually received after additional development. In contrast, Cyberpunk 2077, published and developed by CD Projekt Red, faced significant issues upon release, partly due to overpromising and underdelivering based on early marketing and demonstrations.

The key points highlighted are:

1. **Marketing Realism**: Game developers and publishers should show what they have in terms of actual gameplay when marketing a game to avoid the mismatch between marketing promises and the final product.

2. **Developer vs. Publisher Responsibility**: While both can be at fault for poor marketing, the responsibility often falls on the publisher who may push for grand announcements without ensuring that the development team can meet those expectations.

3. **Self-Reflection by Developers**: Some developers, like CD Projekt Red and Bethesda Game Studios, have a habit of overpromising, which leads to disappointment when the games are finally released. This self-generated hype can be damaging to both the reputation of the developer and the enjoyment of players.

4. **Change in Marketing Practices**: The video game industry needs to adopt more honest and realistic marketing strategies. Developers should refrain from sharing too much or too soon about their games, especially if the content shown is not representative of the final product.

5. **The Financial Pressure**: While investor pressure can drive publishers to market games early, this should not be an excuse for misleading consumers.

6. **The Reality of Game Development**: Making games is a complex and costly process, and the industry must recognize that marketing should align with what the team can deliver, not with what might be promised by executives or the hype generated by early demonstrations.

In essence, the conversation calls for a more transparent and responsible approach to video game marketing, where what is shown is what players can expect to play, thus fostering a better relationship between developers/publishers and their audience.
