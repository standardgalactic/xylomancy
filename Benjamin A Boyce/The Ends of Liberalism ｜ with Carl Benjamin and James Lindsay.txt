Benjamin sent me homework last night to read one of your articles and I may actually do a podcast
based on the article at some point. Which one was that? Which one is it, Benjamin? It's your five
laws with liberal philosophy. Oh, the false assumptions, yeah. Yes, the five false assumptions.
I think that's a very important piece, honestly. I'm working on a follow-up to that, actually,
because I've identified at least four more false assumptions in liberalism, which,
unfortunately, it's one of the problems of it. It's just this
kind of irreconcilable for the philosophy and I'm not happy to say that.
Right. Yeah, I mean, I think about these things a lot because this was
philosophy that was hashed out over 200 years ago when, I mean, we're getting a lot of trouble
for saying this because there's a lot of old wisdom in things, but frankly, people didn't
know what the hell was going on. And liberalism falls out of the Enlightenment and the Enlightenment
is this sprawling, messy kind of quest of discovery. And the scientific, the dawning of
the scientific revolution is kind of beginning, but science doesn't mature until the early 20th
century, certainly until at least electromagnetism is tamed, which is early 20th century. Quantum
mechanics throws a wrench into the whole thing later. But you have this kind of unfolding of
ideas where people are making sort of stabs in the dark and there's this kind of, I don't know,
almost miasma of deep philosophical thought mixed in with literal mysticism, mixed in with
religion and trying to cut apart from these things all at once, where people again, I mean,
you know, with the five false assumptions essay that you wrote, you talk again and again about
this root of this kind of being in this image of the state of nature, which is of course just crap.
No such thing ever existed. No such thing applies whatsoever. Again, a bunch of them admit that
it's probably not true as well. Right, which is even funnier. Yeah, why base anything on something
you probably think is not true? Why do that? Because humans, I mean, what do you mean exactly?
But yeah, it's just fantastic to look at this because my opinion, and maybe you agree with me
and maybe you don't agree with me. And maybe you hope I'm right is that there is, if we might lift
language from Karl Marx just for the hell of it, that there is a rational kernel in this mystical
shell that can be pulled out and updated for the 21st century. I think that these assumptions poke
at something true and valuable. I know that you have identified yourself and I identify myself
as classically liberal in many regards. I don't know if that still holds for you for sure, but
with your desire not for those things should not be the case.
Yeah. I guess I would call myself a post-liberal at this point. It's not that I don't owe anything
to the legacy of liberalism. I feel that it's time to figure out what was true and what was not,
and then what to keep and what to lose. So yeah, post-liberal.
In that sense, I don't know that our project is wholly different except that what I would rather do
is put the truth of those insights that are based on incorrect assumptions on firmer ground and
update them for the 21st century and the circumstances we find ourselves in.
That's something we can definitely discuss. Definitely something we can discuss.
Where would one begin? Because both of you guys have attacked very thoroughly in your own ways,
progressivism, and then moving on to, as both of you, I've watched you guys develop your critiques.
You go deeper and deeper and deeper. So where do we start? If we just say, okay, we know that
something's wrong, society's fragmenting at the same time, power's congealing in a way that doesn't
seem to be good. And we want to have some sort of philosophy or some sort of philosophical grounding
from which to proceed towards organizing society. So I'm seeing the situation that we're in. And
then you and I spoke about this, I think after we ended the stream last time, Benjamin,
where we talked about the idea of what we're dealing with, whether we call it communism or
neocommunism or Marxism or this kind of legacy of Marxism or woke or the kind of weird fascist
thing that they built at the World Economic Forum in the United Nations out of all of this
and are applying it to us. I called it a parasite, a liberal parasite. And I think that a lot of the
post-liberal movement thinks that this is the culmination of liberalism, whereas I think it
is a parasite that has slashed onto the side of liberal philosophy and societal organization
and is basically taking control of the ship. It's like that beetle that went viral the other day
with the parasites. It has no body left. It's just the outer carapace of the beetle walking around,
literally like a janky beetle, but there's no bot. The thing's not even just dead. It doesn't even
have a body anymore. It's been eaten literally apart from the inside. And I feel like that we
have a parasite on liberalism rather than a coming to fruit of what liberalism was always intended
or likely to go to. And so when I think about that, to switch metaphors, which I know is always a
dangerous thing to do, to maybe more of like a garden, when does your garden get taken over by
weeds? It doesn't get taken over by weeds when the plant life, for example, is healthy and well
tended. And so that's kind of, in my opinion, getting this basic philosophy right. If we want
to get our basic substrate to where it excludes the possibility of the parasite being able to latch
on, but the problem is the parasite's already latched on. Its fangs are deep, deep inside. It's
already drained most of the blood out of society. It's drinking what it can now very quickly of
what's left. And so we actually also have to kill the parasite. So what I see is we've got this
weird techno transhumanist future awful thing happening, being foisted on us by the exploitation
of being able to get around the kind of liberal government principles by using the corporate
sector to circumvent most of the protections that are supposed to be there. So we get this kind of
monstrosity that has to be destroyed. I think that every sane person who wants freedom in the
future, whether we're liberal, conservative, post liberal, whatever has to just focus on destroying
that, which includes the woke ideology. But we also have to figure out how to get this
fundamental philosophical substrate right in order to make sure that we don't easily get
reinfected. Or in fact, just like I hear a lot about like creating parallel structures,
parallel economy, parallel this, parallel that. I think that that's interesting and a bit
yeah, ambitious and in a kind of fake way. But at the same time, how do you prevent such a thing
from being immediately co-opted by the parasite? And that becomes the question. Like I'm looking
at this school choice movement thing happening in the United States. And I'm just like,
you guys have done literally zero of the groundwork. This whole thing is going to be a woke
disaster in three years, the whole thing. Because you've done none of the groundwork to prevent
your alternative structure from getting taken over from the inside. This is a mistake the
reactionaries have made throughout the world. The integralist movement in South America made
this. They created all these powerful structures. They got their little helicopters. They got rid
of the communists. Everybody clapped and now look at South America. The whole place is going
communist full blast and using the apparatuses that they created in order to oppress people.
It doesn't work. It's not just making a parallel, but we have to also get the philosophy right.
And it has to be the philosophy updated in terms of what we've learned. So these five false
assumptions or the nine I guess now that Carl has identified of liberalism have to be addressed.
Those problems have to be identified and addressed. The philosophy has to be clarified and
updated. We have to figure out what liberalism actually was intending to achieve. Therefore,
clear it up and then at the same time destroy this beast. I mean, I use that in the biblical sense.
This beast that's consuming freedom and humanity. Not even civilization. Screwed civilization.
It's consuming humanity. It has to be stopped. So these are the things that I see as our big
project. But we've got to also get the philosophy right. The cultural renewal underneath. The
cause of whatever human liberty looks like in the 21st century has to speak into not just what
we've learned that shows these nine errors, but what we also know and what we're dealing with,
the tech sector. The idea of a kind of literal ethereal world that we semi-live in through the
internet. Space and time are actually different. We don't need the queer theorists with their queer
space and time being the only people speaking into that. Are you suggesting that we create a
state of nature thought experiment for the internet? A state of virtuality?
Yeah, no. Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
Carl, what's your response to that? Or where would you like to focus on?
I think I actually do disagree with James on this. Sorry, James. I hate to be confrontational about.
To disagree with me. I've got my anti-science aggression mug here for this. I'm ready.
Oh, good. Yes, because yeah, I'm the leading anti-science activist.
I think this probably was an inherent aspect of liberalism because, and it seems to be the
enlightenment itself is a movement dedicated to the supremacy of reason. That seems like a rational
thing to have in the 17th century when everyone is incredibly prejudiced. Things are bad. People
are suffering all the time and the human condition is far worse than what we have now. But the thing
is I've come to the conclusion that ideas are a product of a time and place. They don't just exist
in the ether to be accessed at any point. They are a product of the human experience and we are
living in a very different world now after 300 years of this supremacy of reason. And so much
good has been done that we are forgetting, we have forgotten what good can be done through
ways of life that are not based on reason. Because in fact, much of our daily life is not
really based in reason. Most of it is based in habit, in custom, in prejudice. And I don't mean
prejudice in the way that the left would use it to describe bigotry, but the accrued wisdom of
habits is really what we mean by prejudice there. We don't necessarily know. For example,
I'm not vaccinated. I don't know anything about vaccines, but I thought I would just
be prudent on this and not jump like everyone else. And lo and behold, I'm not worried about
having a random heart attack. It wasn't because I had any special knowledge or wisdom or insight.
It was because a long, long experience has taught me that when everyone is moving in one
direction and you're not allowed to criticize or challenge that, there's something, there's something
you need to know about this. And that wasn't a product of reason. That was a product of my
prejudice. And so it's not that these things aren't valuable. It's not that they don't contain
knowledge and wisdom. And it's not that they aren't helpful. The problem is that prior to the
Enlightenment, that was the dominant paradigm. And it was oppressive. And it was maintaining
social orders that people understood, rightly understood to be intolerable and should have
changed. And it's good that they did. But I think that the pendulum has swung too far now.
And it's normal and natural for people who are committed to reason to stigmatize things like
prejudices, things like unthinking habits, biases. It's normal for them to do that because that's
what's in the way of them achieving what they're trying to attain. But the problem, I think, that
lies at the very root of the Enlightenment itself is it can't really stop itself from the way it is
constituted in its origins from admitting that the ultimate goal of the Enlightenment is to free
the will from the body. Because ultimately, it is the physical necessity of being a human being
that will forever be inhibiting what the will is. And there's a massive conversation to go into
about the kind of circular nature of this as well. But I'll try and sidestep that just to save time.
We see this, as James points out, very, very honestly. This was probably, I think, one of the
insights, James, where I was watching one of your podcasts, and it just clicked for me.
If you'd described them as a Gnostic cult, and I was, you know, that is exactly right.
Because I read about Gnosticism when I was studying the Cathars. And I'd never made the
connection before, and you would spot on. But that's exactly the problem, isn't it?
It's the stigmatization of the material world that is the issue. And then I watched a podcast
that Michael Knowles did with a science-based medical student. And he just drilled it down at
the end to her saying, well, he was like, well, this is your body, then what's you? And she's
like, well, it's my soul. So oh, my God, okay. So now we have arrived at the Gnostic position
where the soul precedes the body. Now, I'm an atheist. So I don't believe that at all. I believe
that the mind is a product of the body. And in fact, the mind is not separate from the body,
it is a part of the body. And so I think this is where we can properly begin to see where the
enlightenment actually has this fundamental flaw in it. And how we can begin, like I said,
James just started, I consider myself these days, sort of a post liberal. My instincts are, of course,
as they've always been, and I'm still very classically liberal in what I would choose for
myself. But as I noted in those articles, there are false assumptions that liberalism is built on.
And if you are forced to build a an intellectual foundation that is consistent and accurate to
reality, which not everyone is, I mean, you could have a mythological foundation, which lots of
people do. And that's not necessarily bad either. That's another conversation. Then we have to
ascertain what the real situation was. And as you pointed out, James, they were doing their best
300 years ago. But of course, there's just so much more that we know now, thanks to the use of
reason. So the core thing for me is to actually stitch back together reason and our physical
bodies. This is something I think actually needs to happen. In tradition, too. Well, that's the
point. Almost everything physical you do is kind of a tradition. It's kind of part of a tradition.
But you get up every morning, and you get your breakfast, and you don't think, well,
you can have breakfast. What do I feel like? And on a Thursday, you might feel like a fry up or
something. I don't know. But you make your breakfast. You don't really think about it. It's
just something you do. And this is the habitual patterns of life. This is most of what we do.
And it's okay that that is unreasoned. It's okay that most of our life is actually kind of impulsive
as Jonathan Hight's work has gone through. And we've known as far back as Hume, actually, most
of what we do isn't rationalized. Most of what we do is post hoc rationalization for what we've
just done, because habitually, we've always done it. And so the remarriage of these things
is an important thing. But what I think that does is actually to destroy the concept of ideology
itself. And that's a problem for ideologists. And ideologists are mostly, as far as I can tell,
a product of the Enlightenment. I think you could make an argument that Islam is a form
of political ideology that came obviously long before. But what do you mean by ideology? It's
like a ruling. So there are lots of definitions of ideology, and no one seems to be able to nail
them down. But a few that I've been working with, one of them comes from critical race theory,
actually, which is a set of contested ideas. And a second one is from Oak Shots, where it's
the distillation and abstraction of a political tradition that is used in order to justify the
seizure of power. And actually, I think that one, combined with the other one, but that one is the
most accurate because an ideology is essentially programming code for political NPCs, for midwits,
to tell them, oh, no, if you do this, this and this, you should get X or Y result. And now,
I mean, we know that this just generally isn't true for most ideologies, because the world is
horrifically complex. But it is the retreat out of, well, I should say the advance out of
this scholarly place into a more real place, where we're approaching the sort of more Edmund
Burke in position of, yes, I'm a weird guess, I'm all these things. But I also think the traditions
are important. To kind of marry these things back together, I think is actually the job of
post liberals, because we don't want to lose the good things that liberals liberalism provided to
us. But we also don't want those things weaponized against us. And when you're existing purely in
the world of theory, actually, that's entirely possible, as James and I have both spent a lot
of time explaining through critical race theory. It's actually an attack on the liberal view of
civil rights that birthed critical race theory and has allowed it to prosper, because the parasite
itself knows how we work. And so it can do these things. And so we want to retain the good things
that we achieved without opening the door to radical extremism, like the critical race, critical
race theorists. And we also want to rehabilitate the authentically human dimensions of being a
human. Because one of the problems of reason is that we're looking at AI at the moment saying,
okay, well, it's only a matter of time until this is effectively a human, as far as we can tell,
because it's capable of reason. But I think that's the wrong way of looking at it, because the
constituency then, if it's a rational being, well, a lot of things could end up being rational,
but only one type of thing is a human. And that's the thing I think we need to be concerned about,
because we are all humans. And the human experience is very rich and very complicated. And I think
that we need to bring these things back together. And that means we need to, I think,
have a more sentimental view of ourselves, each other, and the sort of connective tissue between
each people, each person, that is the relationship that they have with one another, with the place
around them, with their own civilization, with their country, that any metaphysics that they
happen to hold, that I think is what needs to really be thought about, rather than
trying to continue on the path of ideology in order to try and defeat the woke virus. I mean,
I agree, it needs to be defeated. But I think, actually, it's kind of a more advanced technology
in that regard. And so it'd be like trying to win the American Civil War with bows and arrows,
rather than rifles. I don't think you can do it. So I'll leave that there.
But a sentimental connection to each other can just as easily slip into a ideology or a
formula for acquiring political will, which is not necessarily bad, because we need to have
some sort of political will to protect society and some sort of unification within that. But
you see from the left, or at least from the elite, that any sort of disturbance of a American
nationalism freaks them out, or they continually prop it up as controlled opposition.
So just to make a point there, the problem of an ideology is defined a priori
from a position that is not interested in what the world is like. And so it describes what it
wants in an idealistic way, and then tries to format the world to fit that. The difference
between that and this sentimental view of politics would be to take things as they are,
and try and imagine a slightly better future, rather than reformat the entire world. So you
are localizing the issue that you're trying to change, rather than universalizing it, which is,
I think, the inherent problem with ideologies. Because you're starting in the realm of the
abstract and then coming into the real, rather than coming into the real, and then trying to
look slightly ahead. It works in different directions. So on the topic of ideology, just to
kind of put it out there, and maybe this will help you since you're working on a project with it,
Carl. I don't know if you've ever read, you mentioned critical race theory. I don't know if
you've ever read this book called, what's it called, From Class to Race by Charles Mills.
And so the first chapter, I hesitated to read this thing forever, and I finally sucked it up
and read it. And the first chapter actually is Charles Mills, who's a very, he recently died,
like last year or something, or the year before. He's a very famous, I've been told I'm not allowed
to call him a critical race theorist because he's a critical philosopher of race, and we can all go
off in our leftist circles and jerk around or whatever we do in them. But anyway, the first
chapter, he basically lays out literally a claim that everybody who's a Marxist ever
misunderstood Marx about ideology. And he gives the most cogent explanation of what it is that I
think I've ever read. It's one of the most valuable chapters I've ever read in my life, I think.
What he mostly is doing is taking apart other Marxists and saying how inadequate they are,
which is for me just great. But the definition kind of boils down to that it is the mythology,
that the ruling class kind of semi organically, but sometimes deliberately weaves in order to
justify, maintain and entrench its own power. And so it is a political mythology. And the reason I
think that we see this rising within the Enlightenment is not specifically because of something to do
with the Enlightenment, although perhaps I'm open to the contention to the hypothesis. What I see
happening in this regard is that when you said that it clicked with you with the narcissism,
I think that what we saw is that the kind of Gnostic architects that were kind of operating in
parallel, and not even in parallel, literally mixed in, I said miasma earlier, I really mean it,
there was no real distinction between mystics and scientists and philosophers,
and even theologians sort of throughout Europe in the late Middle Ages, early modern period,
it just there just wasn't Francis Bacon, which one was he all of them. So what are you going to do,
you know, Newton, several of them at once, you go to the, you know, the Swabian pietist theologians
from which Hegel and Marx derive several at once, what do you I mean, it's just mixed together.
This is the problem with thinking from three 400 years ago, is we hadn't clarified some of these
things. And so what I what I see there is that the Gnostic project got moved into politics,
sociology and economics very deliberately. And the reason I actually say that Hegel is the one
who codified this, I don't think it's his doing, we might blame Kant, we could definitely blame
Rousseau, who I fear you sound a little bit like at this point. I'm very, very familiar with Rousseau.
And so I can explain why I'm not. I'm nervous that the project you've outlined tends in the
Rousseauian direction, without some guardrails at least, the sentimentality, the, you know,
attempt to get back to sensuousness as a meaning, as a basis for understanding reality.
But I don't disagree with you about the body being the center of our experience in the mind.
I'm all, you know, I'm also famously an atheist, aka America's top Christian nationalist, but
Christian nationalist. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, we're at the front,
forefront of this movement that's definitely not a Fed operation in the United States at all,
like the most obvious one that's ever been created, like watching them just jump into.
But no, what I see though, is that I see that the mysticism got moved into politics,
into the Rumble politics. And I think Hegel codified this with the phenomenology of spirit.
In fact, this is sort of the other day, believe it or not, I tweeted, I just spent half my day
reading Judith Butler, and it was surprisingly clarifying. First of all, I shocked myself.
I don't know if you've had the pleasure. I've read gender trouble. Yeah. Well,
as you know, it's a slightly painful book to read. Didn't she win like first place or second place
in like worst sentence ever contest or the worst writing ever or something? I don't know,
but I wouldn't be surprised if she did. I can sit down and read Judith Butler straight through,
like it's not that hard now. Are you found out the Judith code?
I just know what the words mean and how they construct sentences. So it's really not that
complicated. I read I had the same thing with the dialectic of sex. I can't remember.
Oh, yeah, that one. Yeah. That was the first theory books I was going to I tried to read
total gibberish after about four years of studying. I went back and reread it. I was like,
I get this. Yeah, it took a long time. And Fausto Sterling, that's who we're looking for
on that one, I think. So anyway, I'm reading Judith Butler and it finally clicks with me
because she's got this whole thing. I'm kind of like blowing my load too early here talking about
this because I want to talk I want to do my own podcast about this issue. But she's deriving this
quote from Foucault, where Foucault, of course, you know, these fucking French guys. So what are
these postmonitors? What does he do? Well, it's not that the some very with the Gnostic concept,
right? It's not that the body is the prison for the soul. It's the soul is the prison for the body.
That's Foucault. That's a literal statement from Foucault. Judith Butler brings it up
repeatedly throughout her writing. It's mentioned in some other kind of foundational queer texts.
So this is an important concept. And of course, you read it and you're like, that makes zero
sense whatsoever. How is the soul the prison for the body? And what you realize is that what I'm
saying when Hegel codified, what I'm seeing in this transition to modern mysticism or modern
Gnosticism, modern era Gnosticism is which is by the way, what Marxism kind of distills and it
makes actionable. He becomes like the grand priest of this is how you do modern Gnosticism.
What Hegel codified is that the social constructions are the spirit. So the social construction
of society around you, which you're trying to manipulate by either manipulating the idea or
the material conditions, the the the the geist of society is the spirit. But that's that I mean,
literally, that's what the word means phenomenology disguises. That's what the word means. So it's
a spirit. And your soul is as a person, just part of that spirit, which is on the trajectory of
transformation of of history. And so you are a part of that greater spiritual whole, your soul,
whatever that represents is therefore your understanding of yourself through the social
constructions of reality. And thus the soul, which is the social constructions of reality
applied to you becomes the prison for your body. So you're born with a weenie. And the social
constructions of what it means to be a man imprisoned you because of your body. So your body
is imprisoned because and I'm like, oh, shit, that's what she means. That's what Foucault means.
The social constructions become the artifice of the prison of the Gnostic
line of thought in the modern going into postmodern era. I do like this idea of it being a
superior technology to have exploited this phenomenon. But what you're seeing is simultaneously,
we always talk about like the enlightenment, and then there's a counter enlightenment, right?
And of course, we have Steven Hicks, brilliant guy. I don't know if you ever met him. He's fun to
be around actually spoken to many times. Yeah, I like Steven quite a lot. And Steven's got his
wonderful book, what back from 2005. So we're talking a while ago explaining postmodernism.
And he's talking about the counter enlightenment. And I he's approvingly interacted with stuff I've
said to this, but I haven't spoken with him about it yet. I actually should call him and talk to him.
You definitely should. I mean, we've talked many times. We actually went to the beach together
for like a week. It was kind of fun. But I don't think there was a counter enlightenment. I think
there were two. I think there was the religious reaction to the enlightenment. And then there
was the romantic reaction to the enlightenment. And I don't think that these two things are
perfectly separable, right? Again, that mixture of enlightenment thought, religious thought,
and then mystical thought or Gnostic thought all kind of blended together in this. There was no
distillation of these kind of three alchemical ingredients. And the romantic reaction, this
is where when I start hearing sentimental and during a person, maybe I should have chosen my
words carefully. I'll explain in minutes. That's fine. That's fine. And I'm not putting you on
the spot. I'm just no, no, no, no, I just reacting as I go. But the the romantic reaction is
so if we think of the religious reaction to the enlightenment as the ability to carve out space
for faith against reason, and there's a huge interesting discussion, I'm about to have a talk
I did in December come out today or tomorrow actually on this specific thing that I think
actually paints a way forward that might tap into something you really like. If we think of the
the religious reaction as carving out against reason space for faith, I think of the romantic
reaction as carving out against reason space for mysticism and mythopoiesis.
And I think that's poison. And that's where the parasite lives. And so the space forward for me
looks like how do we get faith and reason the mist that for me the magic sauce of the West Ben
Shapiro touches it. And is I forget which book it is he writes a book like every 15 minutes.
You know, he writes at the same speed he talks. And so
we're not very far behind him. I'm trying to catch up. I'm training. I'm training. I got
an energy drink in my hotel's mad cup over here. I don't have coffee or tea in it.
But no, what he says is that it's somehow Athens plus Jerusalem, right? And so what is that
emblematically that's kind of an archetype of reason that's Athens and an archetype of faith
that's Jerusalem and also tradition, the Jewish tradition. I mean,
Hanukkah, you eat fried food because 5,000 years ago they didn't run out of oil one day.
Like that's tradition. Like you can't beat tradition to that level, right? And so the idea
of those things coming together to box out mysticism is I think what's made the West so
successful. But we've had this weird undercurrent of mysticism and sometimes just main current.
We can't deny that there were masons involved in the founding of the United States and in
the direction of its creation. What do you mean by mysticism?
I mean, these kind of Gnostic, esoteric and hermetic approaches to transforming reality.
But it's similar to affecting your will upon reality or some sort of process.
It's the ability to believe that you can project your will forward into reality and make your will
come to be in reality, which is the realm where ideology lives. In fact, it's in a sense what
ideology as Carl was describing it. It's what it exists to do that you put your idea out first.
And then what you do ironically almost is you pretend that science, you pretend that you've
put out the hypothesis and then you check against reality to tweak your hypothesis to keep going
forward. But in fact, really what you're doing is you're bending circumstances to make your
hypothesis come true and you never allowed to be falsified. And that's the problem. And I say it's
and I'll let Carl talk and let you guys talk in a second. But just to bring it up,
we do have to go back when we start excavating the roots of this and I brought up Athens,
we have to excavate deep because when Plato names Sientia, that's what he's actually talking about
anyway. Sientia has broken down into two components. If you go read how he organized it,
you've got a piece to May, which is the higher level reason thinking, and then you have the lower
level of knowing stuff, understanding how the world works called Dianoya that applies to
Techne, which is Techne is the idea of gaining technical knowledge to be able to do things in
the world. So why is that relevant? Because how did it get into the story that I'm telling?
Well, it's not even that mysterious. There's pretty good evidence out there that Hegel just
imported that architecture from Plato, which is to build a technocracy. That's what if you
read Republic, that's what he's describing as a technocracy. That's the technology to build
a technocracy on the episteme is the higher level reason of the philosopher kings who are going to
guide the knowledge to the point of idea, wherever the ideology points that they've thought up their
philosophy that they thought up a priori from the realm of reason and the forms of how the world
should be. And then Hegel just imports this shit and puts it in German calls them for nymphed and
for stand. And all of a sudden, he has the exact same program. He updates it to early modern thinking
or kind of late period. It's like the late end of early modern. I don't know what they call that
late early modern, because he's talking about if you read philosophy of right, he's talking about
organizing a constitutional monarchy. If you actually read it, you're like, wow, that looks like
America with a king. And like it's a lot of the same stuff. Of course, America preceded Hegel in
this. This was like 1821 or something like that. He's writing this down. And so it's like divided
powers. It sounds great, but you still have this king and this, you know, how it's in that, how's
the king chosen? Well, by the forces of history and the conflict of opposites. And you know, all
this nonsense that they're always into, but he just imported the tech, the platonic technocracy
with the concept of the platonic episteme being the pathway to understand the ideology that guides
the technocracy, put it in German. And he actually becomes the guy who outlines the plan that Marx
picks up and says, actually, yeah, but flip it over so that we get to be on top as the grubs
that don't do anything and have an entitlement complex and hate everybody and don't take baths
and stuff. Let's take the program and flip it over so we win. But other than that, yes. And the
thing that's keeping this thing, this pyramid, the platonic pyramid of society upright, is the
mythology called ideology that's understood in terms of their in German, their Vernunft, the
reason as it gets translated, that guides the ideological program. And so what did not to
again put Karl on the spot because I actually like him. But when he says, you know, this is the
end of ideology, that's what Marx said he was building was the end of ideology. But really,
what he was, of course, doing was he was forwarding his own ideology. So I'm not saying this is what
Karl's doing. Just everybody's clear. I'm saying that becomes a pitfall of programs going forward
that we must be very cautious about. And so for me, I define liberalism and the Enlightenment
very differently. I don't actually like I look back at these philosophers, these false assumptions,
and I think aren't they adorable? That's great. But that what I'm trying to find the essence
under it. And I think the essence under the liberal project is that none of us is God,
that's it. This none of us has the power, none of us can become God. And that's retaining that human
thing you were speaking of. It also refutes the world economic form, literally explicitly,
a homo deus coming from God, man coming from a Harari, him openly saying they are going to
become gods and little see the arrogance of these people. Look at him. He's golem. He just hasn't
turned ugly yet. Like he literally golem. And so, you know, he's got the rain, he's my precious.
And humans are hackable animals, these people. But it's that we're not God. And so how do we
determine questions of things like political authority? Who gets it? Well, the liberal
answer, in my opinion, is well, nobody, nobody deserves it. So now we come up with a scheme to
lend it to people with the consent of the people being governed, et cetera, divided powers and all
this. So I keep coming back to this and like Christians tend to get pissed at me because I'm
like, distilling their Christian heritage of the nation or whatever. But I actually think the
fundamental assumption of this kind of broadly successful liberal project is you're not God
and you don't get to be God. In fact, that's true for everybody. So you end up getting, you know,
kind of a, we don't have obvious like physical equality, like some people are better at stuff,
et cetera, or some people are bigger, some people are stronger, some people are stupid,
some people are whatever. We don't have that. But we, in terms of what it means to have fundamental
human dignity, there's a, there's a fundamental basis of equality because only God in some sense
has the authority to judge what somebody's human worth is. And since it's not, it doesn't
matter if God exists or not, all you have to say is none of us is that. So who has the authority?
And so what the whole liberal project does is it open for me is to open the door to start
trying to figure out how do we solve actual practical political problems under the assumption
that none of us gets to play God over anybody else. And it's not more complicated than that.
Everything else is details that flow downstream from this.
Assumptions like the blank slate and things are just frankly idiotic.
Good try, John Locke, which thank you so much for your project, especially for your articulation
of the necessity of life, liberty and property as inalienable rights to secure liberty.
But the blank slate, I mean, in the state of nature, like come on guys, you can't blame him
for his time, though. You know, you can understand why he would think that. I can blame him for the
state of nature thing. But yeah, he actually seems to have believed it as well. Yeah.
That's literally silly. Yeah, it is. And there's so much in John Locke that is
in one way genius and in the other way, obviously crackpot. And it does make me wonder, but
how old was he when he was writing this stuff? Because we often forget that a lot of these guys
were like in their 20s. Yeah, I would have to go back and check. I know he had to go into
exile after writing it. He had to write it anonymously, because what he was saying, he knew
was insanely radical. And this is actually one of the one of the sticks I used to beat the reactionaries
now. Well, like, well, this is this is our version. And it's like, no, you are sitting in your house
that you own, and you're not worried about the state kicking down the door with you openly
espousing counter radical views. And so actually, we can say that liberalism has done good things,
and there are fruits of it that we'd like to harvest and keep. Man, I thought so many of these
guys that are telling me that they're ready for the war and that they practice on call of duty.
Yeah, they're not going to go to war. They're going to post memes to inflame it. And I'm like,
bro, yeah, I have spoken to the I went to a conference with them last year, and I'm going
to go this year as well. So a lot of them are nice people, but just a bit online. And so essentially,
my first explanation was that we're not we're not revolutionaries, we're not going to we're not going
to take up arms. Don't be silly, you know, none of you are. And that's fine, you don't have to be,
we can win this in other ways. Because in one sense, they have something that is true, right,
they have a good grasp on like the human, the genuinely sentimental artistic human, the aesthetic
side of what it means to be a human, what makes life worth living, right? And that's what I think
actually the enlightenment kind of doesn't have. And this is what we need to start stitching back
together. Because I agree with by the way, great. In fact, I think it's a I think it's a feature,
not a bug, but it leaves a massive hole. That's a problem. Well, I I I it's not just aesthetic,
it's familial. It's family. If we say aesthetic is in coming at the
having its origins in the sentiments, right? The what the what an aesthetic experience is not
something that's outside the world. It's actually something that's within us and is playing on
our sentiments, the environment plays in our sentiments in order to make us feel in a particular
way and have certain kinds of experiences. And so the human experience is mostly aesthetic in
that way. And so this this is where I feel actually we can say it's kind of the fault of the
enlightenment. But when I say that I'm not saying right, we need to jets in that, because that's
obviously irrational and silly, because so much good stuff came out of it. We don't want to jets
and the good things. But we also don't want to be committed to the obvious absurdities.
And James make a good point there. The it is important. And I swear to God, like it makes
me laugh so hard that it's too atheist saying, look, we need God, okay? We need we need to have
that spot filled. Because at the moment, look at the transhuman and transgender is I am God. And
I will remake my body in my own image, right? It's like, no, you're not you're actually someone
with a mental illness. Okay, I'm not literally the hermetic thing, right? Yes, it actually says
at the point, you know, like the corpus hermeticum, like the poimondris says that the point is to
remember that you're God and then to become God. Yeah. And exactly. And so we need to we need to
acknowledge that actually, the problem with reason alone is that it thinks, of course,
it processes the world in abstractions. And it categorizes the world. And that's actually
the opposite of I think, how the aesthetic world exists. And so we need to find a way of
reconciling these things. Because so look, picking up on your point on Russo, I know that
after you said, I thought, how did he get to that? But I kind of see how what I said could
lead you to that point. But it's actually the opposite of where I'm trying to go with this.
Because so one of the one of the good things about liberalism is its individuality. It's
individualism. It is a good thing to treat a person as some a cause in and of themselves
and as something that is perfect, not a perfect, sorry, worthy and unique, right? So yeah,
sacred. Yeah, sacred is the right word. Now, the problem with liberalism is that it can treat
every person as something. However, the problem it has is the categorization,
the essentially, it's the epistemology and ontology of it, where it has to reduce each human being
to the universal shared characteristics. And so actually, you're kind of reducing all of those
differences, the human qualities, the detritus of tradition that builds up in people. For example,
my accent is one example, it's not a universal accent, it's an English accent. And so we'd have
to subtract that in our analysis of how the three of us are all human. And so we have to slowly
whittle away those things that actually make us uniquely us in order to get to the universal man,
which again, is another false assumption of liberalism, there never was one, in order to say
right now I have a conception of every individual human person. Because of course, a universal
thing is also an individual thing, because it means everyone. And that's actually, I think,
the wrong way to go about it, because we do want to be concerned with the individual, but we don't
want to reduce the individual to a mere fungible item that is something that could be produced
in an assembly line. Something like where we would make a new kind of style of art where we put
nobody's face, but just maybe what color. Exactly. Think of the representation of signs of the
crosswalk signs and things like that. It's a universal human shape. So you know,
it's meant to represent a human, but no particular human. And that's where I think the problem of
not just Rousseau, but like Rousseau most embodies this problem, I think, where it's a generic,
universalized human that has no commitments other than to the ideology in the state that propagates
the ideology. I find myself not having better language to use when I say, actually, I think
the reverse is necessary, and we should have a more mythological view of people. And I'm trying
to take an aesthetic foundation to explain what I'm trying to get across here. I've not read anyone
who's been able to articulate what I'm trying to articulate. So if this comes across as clumsy,
please forgive me. But essentially, we need to be able to frame ourselves as the protagonists
in a story because every single person in a way is a protagonist in a story. And the important
thing about a protagonist is in a story is not that they are a universal human. It's actually
that they are a unique human and they're an irreplaceable human. As in, you can't have Lord
of the Rings without Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo, and Sam. You can't just replace one of
those people, right? They are unique and they will always be unique. And it's the relationships
that they have with the people around them and the events going forward and the moral,
the overarching moral teleology of the thing that makes it what it is in a kind of holistic way.
And so these people don't just exist, they belong in this thing. And actually, before
enlightenment, and even afterwards, I suppose, that's how people kind of view the world. That was
the point of these stories. That was the point of telling the Iliad. That was the point of
reciting the Iliad in ancient Greece. The characters are a unique and necessary component
of the story in the same way that you and the people you love are a unique and necessary
component in your story, personally. And so now we've got away from the idea of categorization.
We don't have to interchange anything. We don't need a universal human. Everyone
is their own story. And actually, this gives us a much more human dimension because now
we don't have to whittle away all of those differences. Actually, the differences can be
enriched and brought out and fully understood. And suddenly, you
bind yourself being empathetic to that person because of their characteristics rather than
to abstract groups, the oppressed or whoever it is. Because an individual, you can say,
look, I can see the suffering. I can empathize. You can put yourself in their shoes. And this is,
I think, a better way of conceiving of these things. And also, it allows us to bring across
the set of virtues that the Enlightenment identified and say, well, these are goods for
the individual. They're goods for the public. They're goods in general. We don't need to be
committed to false rationalistic foundations. And we can hopefully bring these things together
and create a world that actually we like living in where we don't hate each other for arbitrary
reasons. And the only people that we would hate are people who have actually physically wronged
us. And even then, this is where Christianity comes into it, is let's talk about forgiveness
and reconciliation, justice. What do you think of that?
No, I actually think that this, I think I might be able to give you something to chew on that
might help you think about what you're thinking about. I don't disagree with this conception.
And in the fact that this is how humans understand ourselves and each other in
relationship to each other. And that part of the problem is that in the search for universal man
in the realm of differences, like I made the interjection a moment ago about the interchangeable
avatars of race, gender, identity, et cetera, that is so characteristic of we'll call it diversity
art, which is a form of postmodern Soviet realism or socialist realism. I would actually say it's
socialist hyper realism if we're going to just incorporate into it. Well, I mean, it's very
good for corporatist marketing purposes and propaganda as well. But it's a form of socialist
hyper realism, this art form where everybody has no face, but you can tell what color their hair and
clothing tell you what gender they probably are. So they become avatars of identity.
But what this is, this is the search for identity and class, right? And so the other side of the
coin, and I'll come back to the kind of storytelling thing in a moment, because I think that's
actually huge. And I think you are banging on a very important door. Nothing to take away from
that, but it's something to add to it. But this other side of the universal man coin is the individual.
And there are some, this is a fruit of the enlightenment that we are thinking of each
other or as each person as the individual, there's this weird tension. And, you know,
we dragged it out in cynical theories and talked about it, that kind of if you think of it, that
liberalism is pointing toward the concept that there is something universal about mankind
that makes us in a sense sacred, but at the same time, we are at the end of the day,
each individuals, and we can't forget that. So we don't want to lose the fact that that is a fruit
of enlightenment thinking, we're not just, you know, peons under this Lord or serfs under that,
we're not just members of this nation or members of this church or this
diocese or whatever else. We don't think of ourselves necessarily just in terms of whatever
class we've been assigned or cast, depending on how thoroughly gnostic and monistic the
circumstances are. There is a fundamental individual at the bottom of the pile. And so that
weird tension is key, I think, to enlightenment thinking. But what I was going to point at,
I don't know if you, not that I'm a giant fan of Daniel Kahneman by any means,
but I think there's something interesting. Actually, I don't like his expression of it,
as well as I like Joshua Green. So there's these two books. Daniel Kahneman is very famous,
Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow or something or thinking fast and slow. I've heard of the
book. I've never read it though. Yeah. And so Joshua Green has a book called Moral Tribes.
And they both present the same idea, although it's not the, it's the point of Kahneman's book,
it's not the point of Green's book. But the idea is that there are basically two modes of human
thought. One is we could call Thinking Fast, when one is thinking slow. Green gives a much, I think,
more graspable metaphor for it, which is a camera on automatic settings versus manual settings.
A camera on automatic settings, you pick it up, you take your picture, comes out good,
never great, right? Or great by accident, sometimes. However, you're sitting there twiddling the lens
and on manual mode, and you can get it perfect. You can get the, you can get the framing, the
lighting, the lens, whatever. I'm good to focus. I'm looking for words and I can't think of them.
The boco, whatever the hell you want to get. No, no, I totally get that.
Exactly the way we want on the manual settings. And the automatic will never quite do it.
But the problem is, you got to set up your shot. I have a friend who actually used to be a professional
still life photographer, like for commercials and stuff. And he told me about this one time where
he spent literally every waking hour for a week, taking a picture of a fucking bottle of Coca-Cola.
And the picture that came out is like, wow, that should be in a magazine because it turns out that's
what it was. But he ended up taking like, there's digital. So he ended up taking like 800 photographs
of a bottle, tweaking the light, tweaking the light and twisting the knobs and everything that was like,
you know, this bottle that's more real than real in the end, this perfect photograph, right?
And so that's manual mode. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is our thinking fast mode,
according to both of these guys is where we spend most of our time, more than 90% of our time,
almost all of our social time. We are not thinking rationally when we are interacting with other
humans, except to like hash out ideas, which is a philosophical project. But in our normal,
like social interactions, how do we guess what we're going to do with the person? You know,
we're face to face, you say something, I have to respond and react. That's all done in what they
call intuitive thought or automatic mode on the camera. And it's therefore done by heuristics,
it's done by that weight of tradition, it's done by those kind of, you know, either aesthetic or
sentimental decisions that you just kind of make. It's not rational, like you described,
I don't make breakfast like you do, apparently, but like you describe making breakfast, right?
Would you just bring up Carl, fry or something like that or fry up some thing, nobody does.
Some probably involves a fish or some mashdown and bacon sausages.
Well, God, I love sausages. That's the only British sausage is British. Thank God for you
and your little kippers or whatever you call them. Yeah. So anyways, Cumberland sausages.
That's so good. Yeah. Yeah. But so anyways, and it's funny, I live in the Cumberland region of
Tennessee, but so I'm all confused when I go to your island. But you know, I've talked to Peter
Rogosian now, because I called it your island. Yeah, your small savage island nation where I
was recently, it was beautiful. The point being that we have two modes of thinking, and that
one of these discoveries since John Locke or whoever you want to hold up as an avatar
is that the intuitive mode of thought is where we spend most of our time,
do most of our social interaction, have most of our experiences that we call human.
But the thinking slow portion, the manual mode is where we have to go and we have to get right
answers about something important. And what we have to be able to do is tame that. And this is,
I think, the essence of that enlightenment that we don't want to lose, that liberal
project that we don't want to lose is we have to tame those intuitive modes, override them very
oftenly, like for example, the impulse to want to be right, which feeds into confirmation bias and
these other biases, where rather than going to disconfirm our hypothesis, which is ultimately
what mature science is about, we go to confirm our hypothesis and thus create a mythology or an
ideology for ourselves or around our concept. Oh, you know, I think this guy is in cahoots with
so-and-so and I'm going to go out of my way to go find like every time he was ever in a picture
with Bill Gates or something so that can prove that they were working together. So sometimes,
yes, sometimes no, sometimes whatever, but you get me. And so the rational aspect, if we look at
liberalism, and we kind of loosen our grip on it a little bit, and rather than it being this,
you know, age of reason, that's reason becomes the only in the gold standard,
it's actually that reason has its domain and that reason is the corrective to the tribal
class thinking, very intuitive default mode. But we can't lose that because that's the human.
That's, I think, the space that we need to be working on, that there's this very human,
intuitive approach, but that you kind of have to keep in the back of your head that you're
probably going to be, for navigating daily life, yeah, great, but you're probably going to get the
wrong answer when it matters nine times out of 10 if you live there. You're going to come up with
bullshit, self gratifying, self self-justifying, post hoc rationalization land. And so there's
this, and not everybody spends like, not everybody is a scientist in a sense, they are, but they
aren't. Not everybody spends a lot of time in that. So it becomes that there's almost these two
domains, are we living, or are we trying to get right answers so that we can live better, right?
And one of those requires tremendous discipline. And that's the ascension of reason. So when I
see liberalism, again, I go back to this one axiom, which, whether you believe in God or not,
doesn't matter, it's we're not that we don't have omniscience, we don't have omnipotence,
we don't have perfect clarity and understanding of thought. And so what? And so what we have to do
is we have to be willing to recognize that we're limited and fallible. Christians like to call
it fallen. I don't need a story for why we're limited and fallible. I just think that we're not as
cool as we think we are and are not as smart as we think we are. In fact, I think I'm wrong 95%
of the time and the 5% is pretty damn good. Twitter agrees with you on that, James.
Well, Twitter is wrong. Twitter is wrong, literally. What did I say recently? I said that
Twitter, it's like, oh, shit, what is it? This is actually great. It's like upside down Cassandra,
right? Cassandra is this myth where she sees the future perfectly, but nobody believes her. But
Twitter is like, it sees the present completely wrong and everybody believes it all the time.
It's like, it's like inverse Cassandra complex or something. So anyway, I just think that what
we have to view liberalism is saying, listen, your natural impulses are going to get it wrong
when it matters a lot. So let's tame those. It's like, I used to think that it was the
ascendancy of reason and then I started to think it's like, maybe these guys thought humans aren't
very good at this, but it's good when we try to discipline ourselves for it and that it became
corrective to our impulses to live in thinking fast, even at times where we need to step into
thinking slow. And again, I'm not endorsing Conom and Conom has got his own issues.
But I mean, anybody in the academic world that's propped up, I think he's the second most cited
author or something like that. Anybody's propped up that far. That's one of my little traditional
heuristics these days is like you said, if everybody's going in a direction with the vaccine,
maybe he's great. I don't know. Maybe this isn't a rational decision, but he's propped up
something fake going on over here. Beware. But that concept though, that we have two modes of
thinking, intuitive and rational, which in a sense is a mathematician, I'll say are artistic and
mathematical. I think there's even like this kind of like, I'm bullshitting right now, give me a
minute. But I remember reading something at some point that said that when we do mathematics,
because I'm a mathematician, it crossed my path. It's like you only have one math channel in your
brain unless you're John von Neumann or something. And so if I tell you, go ahead and take the number
37 and square it in your head, your whole focus goes down one path and you can't do anything else
functionally while you do that because it eats up all of your RAM, so to speak, to run down that
path. But if I tell you to start thinking of artistic things, it's like you're in free association
land in an instant. You're thinking a million things at once, once I tap into that site. So
these kind of very linear and very like explosive intuitive fluid sides of thought. And I think
that these and how long would it take you to square 37 in your head? Like, if you're good at it,
like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, if you're Arthur Benjamin, you can do it. Speaking of all of our
famous Benjamins, the mathematician, he can do these things like up to four digit numbers in
like an instant. It's really impressive. But it takes a while because that's a slow form of thought.
And I think it's that when you need right answers to social questions in the human experience, you
need to dive into the intuitive. And when you need right answers about hard detailed things that
matter, you have to dive into the rational. And then wisdom becomes like this capstone that helps
you determine which realm you're in and when. And which realm you need as well. And to purpose,
right, to the circumstances. Like, I don't need to be try to go be hyper rational with your wife.
See how that works out for you. Right. And sometimes it's just better. Well, yeah, right.
Just try it. Right. But you know, tell your wife that she seems upset. And that's an irrational
thing. See how it goes. You know, it's like irrationality is going to multiply. There are
times where you have to know which realm you're in. And you don't need to like, if you're going to
a party, a social engagement, a conference or whatever, the after meet and greet, the reception,
and you're like calculating and triangulating who you're going to talk to and when you're going to
talk to them and why you're talking. First of all, you're spurting out, stop it. But second of all,
you're living, you're in the reason mode when you need to be in the intuitive mode and you're
missing something. And I think that there's something gigantic here. I think that there is a
huge temptation within liberal enlightenment thought to put this primacy on reason, rather than
putting reason into the container where it goes, which is when we need to slow down and get right
answers, if somebody's got to have a surgery or something, we need to slow down and get right
answers. But if you're just trying to figure out how to make somebody feel better about the fact
that they need a surgery, it's not time to start doing calculations. It's time to sit down and put
a hand on their shoulder and be a human being with them. That's honestly exactly how I feel about
this. I can't help but be brought into mind of Aristotle when, really, he summarizes all as
the cardinal virtue of prudence, knowing when is a good time for what is literally the beginning
of all wisdom and the very first virtue. And with good reason, this is precisely how somehow
we've gone two and a half thousand years back to this exact place. Because we're in the same fight,
Carl. It's still Plato versus Aristotle. Exactly. The human condition has never changed.
And so very much when he's like, man is a rational animal, I think that is the correct dichotomy about
what a human being really is in its essence. And it is that I think that the enlightenment has
latched to the rational side. And now it's come to a point where it's stigmatizing the animal side.
And the animal side will happily stigmatize the rational side if that's let alone to its
own devices as well. And so when you were saying how these things need to be in their proper place
and use their proper time, that's exactly right. And the problem that I think the rational side has
is that it can only work in the realm of theory, right? It can only think that's all it does.
It's rational. And so it can't help but categorize the world. But when you start
categorizing things, you are abstracting away from a real animal thing, a real solid thing
in the real world. And it's that where the beating heart is, it's that where the feelings are.
Right. I mean, this is what Hegel said about immediacy, right? You have to get to that. That's
what they're seeking. That's what the sentiment of Rousseau is, is looking for that immediacy,
that true experience, not just interject. No, I'm not criticizing by bringing them up.
I think that they're the reason their project has been so successful at screwing up the world
in such horrible ways. French Revolution, anybody, Bolshevik, you know, yeah, the legacy
is horrific is because that that's tapping into something extraordinarily real.
Yes, it's something that resonates with people because there is a truth, a kernel of truth
embedded within it. And it is the the issue, I think, is that we have allowed ourselves to pretend
that virtue can be done by thought rather than by action. And it is through the exercise of these
virtues that we become the kind of people that we have self respect for and the kind of people that
we take on respect for others. And so the reason that I'm trying to get away from abstract categoricals
is because they've got this inherent dehumanizing effect. As soon as you start abstracting to more
than one person, then you necessarily have to start removing the human element to a degree from
whatever group you're trying to identify. And this is where I think this is where you end up with
the Holocaust. This is the logical endpoint where it's just a group. I don't know any of them,
and they're all bad because I've calculated why they are bad. And actually, that's just not real.
You know, the reality is if there is a particular person who's done a particular act
that comes with it, a moral judgment that a sensible person would make,
then you can take action because that person is a criminal or a conspirator or something like this.
You don't just have this abstract category that you're applying to a bunch of people you've never
seen and you can't identify. And so it's this way of thinking that we need to find a way of
breaking past. So we can marry up the, and there's a very good way of describing it,
the slow and fast thinking. Because it just genuinely represents the rational and the animal.
We need to have these married up. These just can't be separate ways and unique ways of looking at
the works. It just is not true. And it comes with significant price. It really does. And
we're watching it now. And the problem as well with the rational side of things is that, okay,
let's assume that everyone is a unique, is an independent sovereign will that is
in the flesh on this earth. Why? Why do they do anything? They don't know, you know? And so
not only is there a falsehood embedded within it that, okay, yeah, actually turns out that
all of your impulses aren't just the sovereign will of its own making it, you know, in choices.
It's all biological impulses that are being translated into thoughts by your brain that you
desire, ultimately. But it also means you don't feel like you're attached to anything. And it's
these human attachments that we really need to start thinking about, especially in the modern era,
where everyone's on social media and no one really feels attached to any of the people
that they actually believe in.
We're all parasocial in our entire experience.
Exactly. And it's giving us false senses of belonging. And that's actually really quite
terrible. And I'm just as guilty as anyone else of doing this in totally guilty of doing this.
But the concept of belonging, what it's predicated on is that there is something
into which you could belong. And this is where the human side of the sentimental side of our
existence is withering away. It's genuinely a concern to me that people in Generation Z,
I see them talking to each other about things that they have no idea about, like love.
They don't seem to understand the concept of romantic love. They have been conditioned
by the progressive millennials to view every interaction as transactional and not sentimental.
And so these people just don't understand what it's like to feel like they belong somewhere,
to feel like someone is uniquely related to them in some way. And it's horrific. And I honestly,
I don't know if it's resolvable. I don't know if you can teach someone this,
if they haven't been brought up in this way. I mean, I'm genuinely afraid of it, actually.
I'm a little more hopeful on that than it can be because of things, you know, growing up myself
and my own things I've overcome as I've matured into what I now believe is a fairly fruitful
adulthood. So I'm a little optimistic about that just to lay your fear. The thing is,
I don't disagree with you about what you're saying. I just don't lay the blame for it at
the feet of the Enlightenment because I go back to that emphasis on the individual that is also
there that is not present in the same way previously. And so that emphasis on individual,
especially individual rights, which thus defines the individual that enables, I mean,
why did Locke say life, liberty and property? If you can't lock somebody up and you can't
set liberty and you can't kill them, that's life and property, you can't depose them of
their ability to feed, clothe and shelter themselves, then you have a hard time controlling
their thoughts. You have a hard time controlling their speech, which is like the expression of
their thoughts. And therefore they can be an individual. And in fact, being that he was a
pious man, they can pursue their belief in God without the strictures of a state or some
other external power, possibly condemning them to eternal torment because of what, you know,
if you were that state, you decided I have to believe about God. What if I'm right and you're
wrong being the kind of irresolvable question? And if none of us are God, none of us can answer
that question. So none of us has the right to impress them on each other. So this is the individual
is preserved in a unique way by the Enlightenment, but that there is a method of going too far with
it. But where I'm seeing, again, I really want to play this blame. And the Enlightenment carries,
as I mentioned, that miasma again, its own set of figures that I think that this is the problem
we have to figure out a resolve is the literally, and I mean this quite literally is the Gnostic
thread that has run through the modern era into the postmodern that we've never disentangled,
academics won't touch it, nobody talks about it. But this idea of
of this kind of hyper rationality is the Platonic episteme. This hyper rationality is
the fornumped this idea that are that we're going to lift up where you you identify the
problem. So now we have two people and they become a group by default. And so we abstract,
we have two opposites and that are different, and we try to understand them in some kind of
unifying whole. That's the dialectic of Hegel, he even describes it in terms of apples at one
point, they only have a green apple or a yellow apple and a red apple. How are they the same?
How can they both be the same? How we dare call them both apples?
You know, this kind of thing this categorization, the idea of obliterating categories to arrive
at immediacy is in fact, in my opinion, the Hermetic project, which is a Gnostic project
that is a huge dangerous swing and a miss from what so when you keep saying it's like,
I'm like, you sound a little bit like Rousseau, you sound a little bit like Marx,
that sounds a little bit like Hegel, but you're like, but no, it's the other way.
And that's I think what we're getting at is that you want a non Gnostic approach to answering
the same questions that are there. And this is why I say that I don't feel a need to lay the
blame at the feet of the Enlightenment, I feel the need to lay the blame at the feet of this
esoteric thread that none of us have pulled out of that story yet. And then my thought is,
I actually like, you know, when you're talking about looking a little bit ahead or whatever,
I don't necessarily disagree. I'm not sure what to do with that yet. So I'm just not doing anything
with it. But I like the idea, I feel like liberalism properly construed and properly
implemented, whatever that would mean. So what do I mean by that? Essential identification of the
individual and the human freedom secured, etc. Okay, allows for the organic evolution of society
without the selection pressures of, frankly, megalomaniacs stepping in and trying to determine
which direction things are going to go, which is the essence of what the lack of direction means
that the megalomaniacs and the psychopaths will rise to the top without a direction. How do you
weed out the wrong direction? I think, I actually, sorry to interrupt, but this,
we seem to be a particularly interesting point here, because there's always direction, right?
Direction is, it comes from your personal impulses. As in, what do we want? As in, what do we not
have? What do we want more of? You know, what would be good for us? There's always direction,
right? So I'm not worried about that actually. And there are always going to be external pressures
that are going to cause trouble that we have to deal with. The thing that I want to talk about
is the the Gnostic thread here, because there's something about the privileging of reason
that I think ends us at the point of Descartes, where he essentially says, no, the will is the
only thing I can be completely sure exists. And everything follows from that. And I don't,
you are right. I want a holistic approach to the human being, right? The human being is both
his body, his will, his experiences, his memories, his stories, his
like relationships. He is this full rounded thing. And the problem with the enlightenment is,
I think the thread goes to that place where it thinks of itself as the only legitimate thing.
I agree with you that there could be something we could call liberalism that
does have a holistic approach. But the way that the philosophy is constituted at the moment and
the emphasis it places on some things instead of other things leads us to a point where we,
I think, are always going to get the fangs of the parasite in us.
I think that might be true.
Whether we like or not. This is why I'm actually interested in beginning at the place that
Aristotle found himself in, actually, and working from there. Aristotle believes that
all hierarchy of these things, and they're all appropriate. None of them are stigmatized in
his view. And that actually seems like a more reasonable place to start to be. But sorry, go on.
No, it's fine. I actually think that, again, I keep drawing back to this miasma thing.
It's so important to realize. Let's take Stephen Hicks, for example, and you read
explaining postmodernism. And of course, he absolutely blasts Russo as you should.
But then who does he kind of like create as the character who sort of the universal problem
that leads to postmodern? Kant. So he makes Kant kind of this arch figure of the counter
enlightenment. So it's Kant, an enlightenment figure or a counter-enlightenment figure.
And you go into these online debates, at least, or you talk to even philosophers who are
professionals, and just watch them. You're talking cat fight. Is he an enlightenment
figure or a counter-enlightenment figure? What this suggests is that there's something else
going on. And one of my attempted resolutions has been that there were two counter-enlightments.
That's fine. But as a matter of fact, these things aren't distinct. The miasma thing is a
real problem. You had a character like Hegel, who is doing certain enlightenment thinking,
who is also explicitly, unambiguously, proudly a mystic. He's just a fucking wizard. The dude's
a sorcerer. He's not even a philosopher, but he does some philosophy. He does some theology. He
doesn't do any science. Let's just not even lie. He's a shithead on that. But you have these
characters that are kind of all of these things at once. And so why is this thing that you just
brought up? It's because there's more than one definition of reason. That thing where, for Hegel,
the word is for nymphed in German, gets translated. I don't even know what that word means on its
own, but it gets translated as reason with a capital R when Hegel's rendered into English.
Not reason with a lowercase R, reason with a freaking capital R. And so now you have this
same situation that you always end up with when you have these, whether it's woke, whether it's
Marxist, what does democracy mean? We'll ask a Marxist. It means you're under communism because
everybody's equal, so everybody has equal representation. Without that, it's not truly
democracy. What does the people mean? Those people who support the system? There's double
meanings for all these things. I think that when we say the enlightenment, there's not
only just not one counter-enlightenment, there's not even the enlightenment. There's this kind of
sprawling mess of different thinkers that you kind of can put in and out at the same time. Kant being
an enlightenment figure and a counter-enlightenment figure of one type or another, all at the same
time. Hegel may be being all three at once. Rousseau, where's he? Definitely some enlightenment
ideas. Definitely informed some of these things that we call the Enlightenment. Also a blatant
Gnostic. Man is born free and everywhere he's in chains. There is no more Gnostic sentence than that
other than I am a Gnostic. And so you put these things down and it's like, which one were these
people? So this is why I'm saying we haven't pulled this thread out. In fact, we kind of have to
rescue liberalism from the long train of Gnosticism that's been running through it from its beginning
because it grew out of the fusion of trying to mess around with the space for a reason,
meaning two things at once. Faith, meaning maybe more than one thing at once. And then mysticism,
which is like, oh my gosh, guys, we can transform the world. Maybe we can transform humans.
What does that look like? I don't know. Let's get into some weird racicultism and then put a
bunch of Jews in ovens. That's where that ended. But that's racicultism and this same idea that
we can out reason what the world really is. And so that was a rambly thing that boils down to,
I think that there are two definitions at least of reason that have threaded their way through
the development that we're calling the enlightenment in that particular, meaning the word the that
particular article there makes us blind to the fact that what we're talking about is a much more
complicated and organic derivation that sprawled across over hundreds of years with a couple of
hundred years with lots of different kinds of thinkers. And so that's where like my project
with regard to thinking about liberalism or post-liberalism, if we want, or going forward
or 21st century liberalism or holistic liberalism, let's just make up words. Let's just throw adjectives.
I don't care. My thinking with it is, is we have to get down to the essence of what was trying to
be achieved, what something made for enormous, and I don't mean it in a flippant or glib way,
genuine progress over the last 300 years. And I know the return dudes with the V can pretend
that this progress is all fake and they show the picture of like, you know, a wonderful palace and
they're like, why do we build these ugly buildings now? And it's because we don't have slaves.
Well, no, they've got genuinely like actually valid points about that.
Because there are valid points and there are invalid parts as well. Like I've seen,
I've seen them share the images of like the czarist palaces in Russia that literally bankrupted
the nation so that the king could have his awesome palace. And there's a reason why we don't do that
anymore is because when everybody's actually free to do their own thing, we don't bankrupt nations to
build something awesome, except for, you know, vaccines or something. But the point being is,
I just think that there's more than one meaning of reason, one of which is mystical, which is that
science, it's the episteme and say NTI or the fernumft and the system diverse, vis and shaft,
the Hegel put out. And then there's this thing, this is just like with the progression of science.
Newton's over here cooking up calculus, figuring out the Brachastroni problem,
or whatever it's called, Brachirstochrone, that's what it is. And he's over here solving that problem,
he's over here developing fucking differential equations out of his ass, creating physics,
you know, mechanics, like unbelievable stuff. This guy's doing, meanwhile,
he's drinking mercury so he can figure out how to live forever, right? Yeah, like,
we got some problems here. 400 years later, we're like, oh, shit, quantum mechanics.
And science hasn't even really matured. We have Hegel criticizing Newton over optics. Well,
Newton's optics turned out to be right, Hegel's full of shit. Because we have this guy that's
over here working in his reason, oh, you can't, how could there be seven colors inside of one color,
you know, or whatever he's doing? This is just nonsense. What you have is this maturation process
of what we're calling the enlightenment. And I feel like we were to the point where there was,
where we're really getting to kind of a mature understanding of it. And that's also when the
parasite latches onto the side of it. We're the 30s and the 40s, not to hold them up at some special
time or whatever. But this is when we really started to like, holy crap, we've got to pull
some of the mysticism off of the way we've thought about some of these things. And this is kind of
why a lot of people look back at the 50s is like this hyper rational, but in some weird way, really
good time is because it's kind of like the peak of the fruit of that turned out to be positive
positivist movement, which is its own complicated thing, and went too far. But there's, it's almost
like we have to let the idea of reason mature. And we have to shed off that Gnostic aspect, which is
not reason, it's like the difference between truth and your truth, they have like reason and our
reason, or science and the science. And it's that where I think the center play goes. So again,
I don't even know that there's a thing called the Enlightenment to lay blame upon. But to the
degree that it's true, I don't lay blame there. We don't know what it looks like when we let it,
when we mature it, and take this Gnostic aspect and just hammer it out. Because nobody talks about
it. Nobody, I mean, it's green space completely right now.
So the problem that I think we might have, and I'm not saying this is definitively,
but this has been my impression of it, is that actually, it might not be possible to separate
the thread of Gnosticism from liberalism. And so if that is the case, we have to question
what our commitment to the term liberalism is. Because actually, I think, and there are,
I think I was guilty of this for quite some time, I was emotionally attached to the term
liberalism and thinking of myself as a liberal, I had attached a bunch of moral sentiments to this
that made me in some way a morally good person, because I thought that this
contains something within it. But I think actually, we can detach ourselves from the term
and realize that actually, this doesn't make us morally invalid. And it also allows us to be more
flexible with what we do here. Because I agree with you, there are definitely different kinds of
reason or intelligence. I agree with you, by the way, on detaching from the term as well.
And so this is why I'm happy to use post liberal, because I don't want to abandon liberalism,
and I never have wanted to. But it's clear that there is something that's wrong with it.
And I think you may have identified it accurately in the Gnostic thread. But I think it is so bound
up. I don't understand how it could be unpaved. I don't see a way, right? So all I'm thinking is,
okay, well, let's, we can bifurcate here and learn from the experience that liberalism has given us
and craft something that is free of that Gnostic problem.
Right. And so this, for me, is where it's like, I'm trying to, I want to boil down. Imagine
it's like, literally, we're taking liberalism and putting it in a pot and boiling it down.
And so all of these kind of false assumptions, we don't have to think so much about these.
I mean, we need, we need to address them, but like, what's under them? Why, what's going on?
What were these guys after? What were these ideas chasing? And that's again, I just keep coming back
to it, is that let's start with a simple fundamental axiom, which I think is the fundamental liberal
axiom. We don't have to call it the liberal axiom. The name doesn't matter. I'm not at,
actually, by the way, don't have an emotional attachment to be identified as a liberal. I don't
like to be identified, like as anything. It's just James Lindsay is that's right. People are
No, no, no. How mythological of you? You know, that's right. The man, the myth legend.
That's not wrong. But yeah, so the thing is, though, is it's,
we're not God and we're not going to be God. And let's start from there. What does it look like
if we just accept that no human being gets to have that status or gets to usurp that status
and lord it over some other person? And the word Lord is chosen very intentionally in that
expression. What does it look like? What do what does political authority look like?
What do we have to do to deal with that? What does kind of social relating look like
under this kind of thing? And what you start ending up with is a whole lot of libertarianism
and a whole lot of Americanism and a whole lot of stuff that they stabbed at really well in the
Magna Carta. And so you know, you're kind of along the lines of those projects when you get to that
point. And so it also is a fundamental rejection of the Gnostic project. We're never going to
it's not even that we're not gods. It's we will never become gods. We have no claim to make on
that level of authority. So then you have questions like, well, how do you decide who gets to be in
charge, whether it's politically, whether it's in terms of a project, whether it's leading a family?
Well, the answers come down to things like, you know, traditional Moors and which is a question,
but ultimately competence and merit. The people who get to lead projects are people who prove that
they have the access or the ability to lead a project as the hard part becomes how do you
determine whether or not they have proven such credentialism is a problem, nepotism is a problem.
People just, you know, going on TV and scamming a bunch of voters and getting elected, even though
they're frauds is a problem. People being run, you know, like actresses being run, you know,
through deliberate campaigns through things like the Justice Democrats as a problem.
You have ways that that system would be gained, but Jordan Peterson hit something extremely
important here, that the legitimacy in the hierarchies, if we want legitimate hierarchies,
comes from competence. And that that's an ideal in the sense, not in like a platonic ideal,
but that the higher the level of ordering of a hierarchy, the higher the competence is the
fundamental principle ordering that hierarchy, the less corrupted it is. So those are kind of like
two antagonistic competence and corruption are like literally two antagonistic concepts.
And so by, if we start with the assumption, so again, what does it mean to be liberal, absent
all of the kind of like John Locke and Montesquieu and all these guys, what are they right?
Absent all of that baggage, what does it mean? Well, we start with the idea that we're not God,
how do we resolve these questions? Like who gets to be in charge? Well, we have to defer
to merit and competence. And what it then becomes is a mechanism that starts to build out legitimacy
and hierarchies, which is ultimately, I think, what the liberal project is meant to be about.
It's a conflict resolution scheme. It's a mechanism by which we can start to
hash out legitimacy and hierarchies to the best of our ability. It's never going to be perfect.
But the problem is, and this is what I alluded to this earlier, you brought it up earlier,
and when you bring up now, that you had an emotional attachment to identifying as a liberal,
which God knows we know a lot of people in our spaces that are that way pathologically.
What I see happening in that case is that people are expecting liberalism to do something
it's not meant to do. It's not meant to give you a story of your life. It's meant to make
it so the state can't give you one for you. It's not meant to give you meaning in your life. It's
meant to free you up to pursue meaning where you seek it. It's not meant to tell you how to operate
your relationships. It's meant to allow you to pursue that on your own terms, which is freedom
and scary. And not something everybody wants. When I've been to China many times,
I've talked to Chinese people who obviously live under a tyranny. And some of them are like,
please, please, please don't let America fall if it falls, the world's done. And others are like,
we like to be told what to do. It simplifies things. I haven't ever run into an individual of this
kind, but I just read something yesterday talking about one of the impulses underneath communism.
Of course, I have it's very famous that it gives you the power to punish your neighbor.
But there's a lot of people who actually don't want actually to get the state to punish your
neighbor for you. They don't mind being told what to do if it means that their neighbor gets
told what to do. And it's not going to, you know, they don't mind it. They like that idea. I talked
to a guy, one of the things that radicalized me in like 2012 or 13, I was talking to a grad,
a guy I went to grad school with. And he was, we were, you know, it was atheist days right back
in the day. And I mean, you were, you were in there, I was in there and the whole thing and
there was like all the feminist bullshit was just out of freaking control. And I was talking to this
guy about his frustrating man. He was like, yeah, but I look forward to our feminist overlords. I'm
like, wait, what? And he, I'm like, this is some, some beta orbiter stuff. And he's like, I'm like,
what? And he's like, yeah, when women are telling men what to do, that's one last thing for me to
think about. And it turns out that's exactly the rationale I heard in China. So it's not everybody
craves this. It's scary to be free. But if you start believing that liberalism is going to answer
questions for you, like what you're meaning in life or what it's supposed to be, or what your
aesthetic experience is supposed to look like, then of course it's going to disappoint you.
It's designed literally to make sure authorities can't do that to you. And so
do you mind if I introduce you? I think this is very interesting. Because I think it's at
this point, because Benjamin, I know you've been interested in the concept of tradition
for a while and the traditions you've been tradition. Yeah, just the spaces you've been
engaging with recently. And I think this is where the concept of tradition actually begins to apply.
Because yes, I agree with everything you just said there, James. But I'm also aware that what
you've said is particular to a people, a place, a time, and the result of a continuous and
contiguous history. Because like you said, not everyone values that. But the way that was framed
was very much rationalistically, right? It was this was the, as I was saying, ideas are actually
a product of a time and place. The way you'd, I'm not, I don't mean there's a criticism either,
it's a very natural for us post enlightenment people to frame our ideas in exactly that way.
And what you've constructed there is a kind of ideological frame that we can pick up and
place down. But that's not how I think we should think about it. Because as you referenced,
there's a reason that we speak in English, there's a reason that we care about the things that we
care about, as the postmoderns would say we're placing value on the fact that we've been talking
about them. And there's a reason that you trace that lineage back to the Magna Carta. Because
what we are talking about really are the values of England. And this is something that of course,
why wouldn't America hold the values of England that was founded by Englishmen?
Why wouldn't these continue to be propagated generation after generation? And so now we're
not thinking in the abstract realm of ideas, we're thinking in the concrete real world in which we
live. And I think that changing the locus of where we begin like that actually allows us to
center ourselves in a way that allows us to properly understand the people around us as well.
Because like I said, I agree with everything you're saying, but I'm also aware that I only agree with
that really because I'm an Englishman. If I was some Iranian imam or something, I'd be like, no,
this is preposterous. Why would anyone agree to any of this? God's law is God's law. They would just
think you're a kook, a loon. But to me, it seems like second nature. And of course I
agree with all that. Why wouldn't I? Who could think differently? Well, the Chinese person,
you know, an Iranian. And so if this is the problem with remaining in the work realm of the
abstract, and so if we make it particular and civilizational, it also means that we actually
have to draw boundaries, right? It actually means that we have to define where it started and where
it stops. And the range that we have within that is where we are. And so now we actually don't need to
find ourselves groping in the dark for what hierarchy should look like. You are right. I mean,
the hierarchy will be based ultimately on either corruption or competence. That sounds absolutely
correct. And they are in contradiction. I agree with that. But also, there's a way of being
competently corrupt that I think someone like Vladimir Putin actually deeply embodies. He's
obviously a very competent guy, but obviously he's an evil villain. So they aren't mutually exclusive,
even though they're in contradiction. But we don't value having a competent villain in charge.
We value having someone who might be actually incompetent, but at least they're virtuous in
charge. That would be preferable because of our cultural situation. And so once we have this
sort of continuum that we can see ourselves within and situated in the human experience,
in a time, in a place, then I don't know if we can call that liberalism, because as you said,
liberalism is this body of ideas. But it is definitely a product of this time and space.
If you were to trace the genesis of liberalism, and Stephen Hicks just says, well, it begins in
England. And there's a reason for that. Because what, and this is what Michael Oakshaw's perspective
was, was just the distillation of the English political tradition. And it is through these
political traditions that we could just carry on as we do, intuitively and instinctively.
Because you are right. I mean, like I said, we can rationalize why these things are good.
But the rationalization will really be for people like us and those foreigners who agree with us,
right? And so now I've had to make a distinction between these people and those people. And that's,
you know, more realistic than having the abstract set of ideas. I'm not even sure where I'm going
with this point, really, but it feels important to sort of take the ideas out of space, you know,
the abstract, the realm of the forms and put them in the world. This is where they belong.
And this is who they belong to. And this is why they belong to these people. And you are right,
you know, like they came into being for a reason because of royal oppression against the peasantry
and against the nobles. The argument was, well, God has mandated this way. It's like, well, we'll
see, you know, we'll see who's right arm mandates it, you know, who God is really with on that case.
And it turns out that it was actually with the people with the lower orders and not just with
the king. And this had happened a few times actually, and eventually the king gets his head
cut off until we get to this negotiated settlement, effectively, that becomes the sort of English
and then American constitutional system. But that is the product of layers and layers and layers of
tradition and experience and personal negotiation between people. And so this is why I return to
the kind of mythological view of this thing. You know, it's not just something we can abstract
away and then, you know, we can't give liberalism to Afghanistan. And they don't have the institutions,
they don't have the traditions, they don't have the thoughts in their head, the instincts
to make this thing work. It's just, it's a false oath. It's not their mythology.
But so just one interjection. When you bring up the mythological and the sentimental,
it's not just a negative, it's not just romance, it's not just faith. We can we can see like
Hegel embarked on a project and J.R.R. Tolkien embarked on a project, a massive project that
have stood the test of time and influenced huge amounts of genre. But they were both operating
probably mythologically, both oriented or dealing with the same kind of imaginal forms,
right? But Hegel abstracted them into ideas. Tolkien put some ideas in there, but nested them
in character, right? So he oriented his imagination differently than Hegel. So the Gnostic tradition,
I think, is a type of creativity. It's a type of Western man, a man who is trying to achieve
godhood. And that, that project is incredibly ambitious project and will drive people to do
great things. Now, those great things might not be good, but those ambitious people that prompt,
become god, will create great things, terrible things too.
And that's like the tolerance of sociopaths question. How much do you tolerate sociopaths
because they'll create, say, industries by doing horrible things that benefit us all massively,
even though they do massive evil in the process of doing it? I mean, that's a hard question.
But seeing that that type, the Gnostic type, is always like in dialogue, has always been creating
artistic works alongside these other types of artistic works, poetry and storytelling that
expand the tradition. I just, I think that there's a dialogue there.
Artistic is a strong word there for the Gnostics, in my opinion. I don't feel like there's very
much art going on there. But I mean, this is a story in Genesis. Genesis chapter three is
about this. So this is a human dialogue that's not going away. Definitely not going away.
But what I'm worried about with this contingency of culture, I do agree. We're not going to just
take liberalism and plop it down in Afghanistan and it's going to take off.
It would have to grow there, right? It would have to be that the ideas underneath it
land in people in the right way and they articulate it in their own contingent context,
etc. And it has to grow and flourish and whatever on its own and kind of grow in and through that
context. I don't disagree with that. But I will be as culturally chauvinistic as I have to be
about this particular tradition. And I don't think it's just a product of the fact that I
happen to live in it and happen to think this way and happen to have been born into
a tradition that thinks this way. I look around the world, and as Donald Trump rightly pointed
out, many whole countries. And I see that there are better and worse answers to these questions
of how human beings, which I do not think are, despite our cultural differences, despite our
different histories, I do not think that we're functionally that different as organisms as that
animal side. If we're going to ground our future political projects into human,
I don't believe in universal man, but I do believe that the boundary of that which is human,
that as a collection is a bounded set. There's a gulf between that set and the set of chimpanzees
that is enormous. It's not a small difference. It is a constrained system
that defines what it is to be human. And the similarities within that does define
kind of a imaginary and abstract, yes, universal concept of human. But whatever that boils down
to, it seems to me literally not just intuitive or obvious or anything, but just evidentiary
over the past 300 years that where these values, we can say are these English values,
or as Stephen Hicks often frames it, the English enlightenment or Scottish enlightenment, even
as a Southerner, I'm in the United States, I'm just kidding, my family is from New York,
but mostly actually my family history is partly English and Scottish. It's a little more British
highly than that. I've got some German in me to watch out. The bugs are coming for you.
But I've got this whole view that this English enlightenment tapped into fundamentally human
values that somehow attached to what Sam Harris kind of comically called human flourishing and
moral landscape 15 years ago or whatever. I want to reclaim the term human flourishing. I think
that's a perfectly noble goal. Right. But the thing is, I don't think that these ideas are,
I don't go as far into the postmodern condition as to accept that this is a totally contingent
cultural phenomenon that these ideas worked. These ideas did work because these ideas in
this culture, because they grew out of this culture. And so there's that aspect of it. But
where these ideas have been successfully implemented in other places, they have led to similar
levels of flourishing. Like I said, when I go to China, you have people who desire to be ruled.
You have those people in America too. I talked to those people. They're all over that. My friend,
for example, who had master's degrees coming out of his butthole, but he couldn't get a job.
And he wants women to rule over him and whip him or whatever hell he wants. I don't know.
Well, just a brief interjection. It's not just the export of the ideas, but it's the virtues too.
You can't just have liberal ideas without some sort of Christian virtue.
Well, I don't know if it has to necessarily be, I mean, I'm not going to say it has to be a
Christian virtue. Humility, patience. Every time that you guys bring up a virtue, it's a Christian
virtue. Every single virtue that you guys give up is canonized. I would also go further and say
that this isn't contingent either. I'd say that Christianity codified those virtues extraordinarily
well in a cohesive system that's extremely pro-social. But these, I think, again, Aristotle
wasn't a Christian. These are human virtues. No, but the Christians were very influenced by Aristotle.
Well, of course they were. They took that from him. He didn't take that from them.
So just as a quick interjection, because I find this fascinating, because I wonder
if this isn't the cultural difference between me as an Englishman and you as Americans, right?
Because, no, no, I'm serious about this, because Americans do have a habit of seeing
themselves as universal men, because America is, of course, the most successful project of
liberalism. And it's done phenomenally well, because historically, it was very rooted in
the English tradition of liberalism, which is, as Oakchop put it, just a distillation of English
political practice into theory. But of course, if you've got a bunch of people who have been born
and raised as Englishmen and then calling themselves Americans, but still having the
common law, still having these values of accountability and justice and political
decentralization, all of the traditional values of England just replicated on the American continent,
then it makes sense that that would work. Because, of course, to the people,
and this goes down to the way the language is constructed, the kind of institutions we have,
the family values that we share and that you're raised with, these things are
radically different in Britain than they are literally just 100 miles away in France. France
has a totally different set of social values to the English. And it's actually remarkable.
And the Germans have a totally different set of intellectual values to the English. And then
that's not even talking about what the Italians, the Spanish and the Greeks are like. And so it's
actually kind of crazy. I had a conversation with a Greek friend of mine the other day,
and I was like, me, if your cousin drove to your house and he was in a stolen car and you
recognized the car as someone when he worked makes cars, would you tell the police and say, no,
that's crazy, right? You would tell the police, right? I would tell the police, you have to tell
the police. But that's because we have literally got radically different social values. He would see
that as a form of betraying his cousin. I would see that as a form of betraying the rule of law
entirely in his country, right? I would know you, you, you have committed a crime. You have not
been virtuous. You have not done the right thing. And I would be doing the right thing by contacting
the police. And it would be right that you be punished for your theft. That's a very much an
English set of values. That's not something that they value in Greece. Probably not in America.
I don't know, right? No, like, bro, you should probably go give that back. Like you'd have a
conversation with your cousin, but you wouldn't go around your cousin out.
Well, if he was intransigent about it, you know, maybe I think you probably should.
But the, the point is though, the American perspective has always homogenized Europe.
Well, that's because of the nation of immigrants. No, no, it's not just that. I think it's the
remoteness from Europe that helps. And, and the thing when you're a lot closer,
you start to gain a better understanding of actually how particular and parochial our value
system is. I mean, for example, the English have never as a culture have never been particularly
haunted by the ghost of Faust, right? Whereas the Germans, and he's been mentioning many Germans in
this, they're deeply riddled by it. They don't know what to do about this concept. But there's
never been a problem with the English because the English actually have always been quite humble in
this idea that actually, of course, God's there. And of course, we're not gods. Of course, you just
look at what's in front of your face and you do the best you can with what you have. Because the
English, I spoke to a German professor a while ago, he was like, well, you're intellectually
lazy. And it's like, yeah, that's true. That is actually quite true. We're not stupid. We're
just intellectually lazy. The Germans are not intellectually lazy, though. And this is one
of the problems with Kant. If you look at what Kant is trying to do, he's essentially trying to
formulate a technique for looking into the mind of God and say, right, what is a categorical moral
imperative? Only God can set a categorical moral imperative. That's nonsense. No one, no human
being could possibly do that. But of course, it didn't come out of the mind of an Englishman. It
came out of the mind of a German. And I wonder if this Faustian spirit is the Gnostic element that
is running through this. And so when we see this, this exchange of our souls in exchange for
unlimited wisdom and power, well, this is essentially what the transgender movement is
asking for. Like we want to be able to do it. And so you can see the Faustian German spirit
being embodied in this movement, but it's very alien to the English perspective. And of course,
America being an English country means that it is, I think, the parasite that you were trying to
describe earlier that you, you know, you were saying that this is and so but when you put it in this
perspective, you can actually name where it's come from. You can name the people. You can name
it's not just an abstract thing. But then it means that you have to kind of police your own
boundaries, right? You have to actually we should do things in the English way because this is what
we feel is right. This is our prejudice or you can you can do a little empirical. If you look at
how these different cultures, let's say France, Germany and Britain, how they scaled when they
were exported to other places or when America was started, like what which traditions from Europe
stabilized at scale and the English stabilized at scale and maybe the Catholic hold on but
but this thing which traditions from Europe, there is no Europe, really. That's the thing
like half of well not more than half of the Americas is Spanish or Portuguese. Yes. And that
is utterly alien. You know, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. So something in the Spanish
tradition scaled and was able to stable. I mean, more or less, they have a lot of problems with
communism stuff like that, but but any scale and and something was unique about the way that the
English tradition scaled and was, you know, it's in Australia, it's in Canada, it's here, right?
So yeah, maybe Germany can't scale, but it can scale within the English, right? Maybe, right?
Do you do so? I'm saying like the body politic should be in charge of kitchens. They shouldn't
be in charge of countries because German food is wonderful and German governance is diabolical.
The other way around, of course, applies to England, right? English kitchens are terrible,
but again, English governance is wonderful. And this is what we're trying to achieve with
Magna Carta, with the American Constitution, with liberalism in and of itself as a project.
But this means we have to be able to identify what is not what we're looking for. And actually,
you know, now I've been able to bifurcate these things. Say, right, okay, you are right. It's not
just the Enlightenment as one giant thing. There are lots of different places where
Enlightenment's were going on. And you know, cross-pollination of ideas comes back and forward,
and we are suffering from one of these cross-pollinations at the moment.
Right. French and German cross-pollinating into English and Scottish.
Absolutely. And this is David's dark point.
Correct. And this is again, Stephen Hicks, where he's talking about Germans and bad Germans,
and more bad Germans, is like the title of one of his chapters. If you haven't read into the
Swabian pietist movement, which was a southern German mysticism movement that it's like,
within the broad conception of Europe, it's like the longest holdout in mysticism
as the modern era kind of persisted. And this is Hegel was trained at one of their seminaries.
He was trained... I'm not familiar with that, actually.
Yeah. So the Swabia, you know, the southern portion there of Germany,
Swabia held out with some occult magic for a very long time, well into the 19th century,
well into the 19th century. And that's where a lot of these bad Germans and more bad Germans
happen to come from. But the influence there of mysticism was much more profound than you had
in England. This probably why this spirit of Faust, and of course, Gerrit was one of the
characters who was swept up in all of this. Just a quick thing there. England, in this
sort of time period, suffering dramatically from Puritanism, the opposite problem.
Exactly. Yeah. And so what you actually, if you haven't looked into the Swabian pietist...
No, I'm going to put in the brows of it.
A lot of these so-called Germans and bad Germans, you'd want to look up a character
by the name of Friedrich Oettinger. I can't ever say his name. It's O-E-T-I-N-G-E-R, right?
Oettinger. Oh, with a fricking umlaut, which nobody can pronounce except Germans.
Yeah. And so this guy is one of... He's a teacher of Hegel. This is a very important character
and understanding. Also, another kind of German mystic much earlier is Jacob Boma,
which is B-O with an umlaut, H-M-E. These characters are extremely influential in the
progress of this broad German Enlightenment, which is where you're getting this kind of
Kantian thought. You're getting this kind of Hegelian and Marxist thought. A difference with
American culture to British culture, besides the fact of this Greek cousin loyalty thing,
which we have a surprising streak of kind of the fundamental American value, if I had to
kind of boil it all down. Just a quick thing there. I mean, we probably do here, but I think that
if you approached it as a philosophical conundrum, almost every English person would say,
well, of course you should tell the police. When I listen to your accent, I hear you say that,
but if you were speaking cockney, I don't think you would. Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to
have at home. I think they would concede that that is the value that they know that they should
uphold. Whether they do or not is a totally different question. Obviously, not everyone here
is the same or anything. Well, the thing in America, when I said we're a nation of immigrants,
this moment ago, is the fundamental American value is, oh, you're an American. Great, get a job.
Which is, I don't give a shit about you. Do something productive. And that's kind of what
binds us all together. It doesn't matter if you're Muslim. It doesn't matter if you're
Buddhist. It doesn't matter if you're white. It doesn't matter if you're black. You're here.
You're legal. Great. Shut the hell up and get a job. Like, that's, you know,
that's the problem. But that's de-proston, isn't it? It is. And it enables us. De-proston.
It also enables us, though, to, as I said to somebody the other day, where some intersectional
shit was on Twitter and I just replied kind of glibly. And I said, can we just get back
to a time when I could like people in particular and dislike people in general?
Yeah. Yeah. And I think, like, I want to like cool people in particular because I got to know
them and I got to hear their ideas. But this is that rampant, like, shut up, get a job, do
something productive, be somebody. And also, you're an individual and that's what I'm going to respect
in you is what you've done, not where you came from, not even what your traditions are. Oh,
yeah, these are your traditions. Cool. Let's have a barbecue and find out about them or whatever.
Let's hang out. Do your, do your fest. Let's come. Let's all have, like, Greek day or whatever.
Whatever happens to be, it doesn't matter. But it's like, at the end of the day, though,
if you're an American, it's like, shut up and get a job. What are you doing?
That's our value. Yeah, this is the American tradition. This is, which is why it taps into
that idea that there is something that's not the exact idea of the universal man.
There is some universal. It's definitely not universal. This is not how Italians think, right?
Unless they come to America and they get told to shut up and get a job.
No, no, no. They'll do it because they're forced to do it. But that's not the wellspring of their
culture. No, I understand. I understand. It is the wellspring of English culture,
right? It is exactly here. Get a job. Stop being a loafer. Other people, you know,
don't rely on them. They should rely on you. You know, you should do your part for the rest of
the community rather than have them do their part for you. These are very parochial values.
That's the thing. These are very parochial values. And so this is the problem, I think,
inherent in liberalism is, because now we're talking about things in a totally different
way, right? Instead of constructing an abstract set of ideas that connect together in a certain way
and suggesting that this could be universalized, now we're talking in a particular way and saying,
we're actually, we exist in relation to other groups of people. Essentially, you're speaking
in a more Europeanized way, right? Because I think the American project being a propositional
nation actually contains kind of this problem where you guys fall into abstractions. Whereas,
in Europe, we are not propositional nations. And so we are used to the tradition, the long
accumulated, long accumulator, cultural baggage that we've had with one another, right?
I know what a Scott is going to say to me. I know what a Frenchman is going to say to me.
I lived in Germany for eight years, right? I know, I know every German thinks
before they open their mouth, right? Because they are all the same in many different ways.
But they're also all very different to what the average person in England is like, right?
And they're all lovely, by the way. I never met a German I didn't like,
but that's because I never put them in charge of the country.
And I swear to God, I'll go to my grave believing this. But you realize that these differences
are really important and they matter and they are tangible. And what's more is you begin to
build a relationship with the differences. And it's probably the same with Americans and Mexicans,
actually. Because I mean, I personally don't view Mexicans as Americans.
The blacks are Americans, the whites are Americans, the Mexicans are not Americans,
they're Mexicans. And it's because they come from the inquisitorial legal system,
they come from the Mediterranean family system, they come from a different religion,
they speak a different language. Oh, by Mexican, you mean the Latinx?
What? No, no, just Mexicans. Okay, okay. You mean like Mexicans?
People from Mexico. They are Mexicans, right? You said American in front of Americans who
mean the United States and we got confused, you meant Americans like American continents.
Okay, we're clarifying. No, no, I mean like people from the United States, right?
Mexicans from the United States. No, no. Mexicans have a different legal system,
they have a different family structure, they have a different religion and a different language.
Correct. In Europe, you would never call that, you know, like that, you're essentially saying
that these are Spanish people, right? Mexicans are Spanish people, you're English people,
you're not the same, they're not the same, they're different.
Okay, I see what you're saying. Yes.
And so it's, so when, you know, when they're like, Oh, Mexican Americans, I know you're just
Mexicans who live in America, you're not Mexican American. Well, see, we have a completely different
way of thinking about America, and we have a problem with the border, you know, but we have
so much cultural mixing, we don't think of America as white Anglo-Saxon European, that's just one
strain. I'm not, I'm not, right? It's, it's, see, now you are abstracting into a category already
there, right? Because what I'm talking about is America is so abstract, that's the problem with
America. We're not as pro-queal as you guys. No, no, it is, that's exactly the problem. And it's
because America is a propositional enlightenment nation that's built on liberal, liberalism itself,
liberal philosophy. And so, but there is a thing that other people outside of America recognize
as an American, and it doesn't mean white, it means American. And that doesn't mean Mexican,
right? Like, I don't know how to describe it. Like I said, the blacks are Americans,
but also the whites are Americans. And there are, you know, people who are born and raised America
in American customs and traditions, who have never been in another country, who are not black
or white, but are American, right? But people who move to America from another country and like,
yeah, I just want to get a job and, you know, work hard and make money, that's not enough to make
them an American. No, no, no, I agree, I agree, I agree. Right. Okay, I know what you're saying now.
Yeah. Yes. Yes. That is true. There is a cult, there is a distinct cultural value,
cultural suite of values that defines that which is American. But also, it's not just
the values, it's about how you're raised. It's about the communities you're raising. No, I hear
you. The customs, you know, the character, yeah. I agree, I agree. But the one thing that America
has is that Europe doesn't have, and I think it's actually the lack of this is kind of crippling
Europe at the moment, is this incorporative ideology that is becoming an American, right?
We don't have that. That's exactly what I was wanting to suggest off of that is, yeah, because
you can have that character, whether they come from Mexico or they come from China,
whether they come from, I guess, your primitive island, and they can become American.
They can kind of adopt that suite. They can join the tribe.
Well, yes, in a sense, but Benjamin had a wonderful point, though, when we look at how,
what happens empirically when these particular sets of values get exported,
formerly by empire, but not in the literal sense by empire by anybody but China anymore,
but we have these kind of weird economic empires and so on. We thought, allegedly, we thought we
could transform China into a kind of more Western liberal nation by exporting business values,
which they seem to have judoed on us. Turns out, we didn't study our martial arts before we went
to the center of martial arts. They acted Chinese about it. A little bit, or, yeah, among others.
That's not an insult. That's just an observation. No, but I mean, there's more to it than this,
but the fact of the matter is that when we export these values, we see improvements.
And that doesn't take away from somebody's, like in America, I don't see anything that
takes away from your ability to be German or Mexican or whatever as you become American,
which is a very interesting thing. Having known people from all over or from all different
backgrounds, who at the, like, I don't know how many Iraqis, for example, that I've met,
who become American, right? They come, they immigrate, they go through naturalization,
they become legal citizens. And so you have these guys, their accent never goes away,
their kind of cultural demeanor doesn't change because they were raised in these things.
And yet, you know, they're walking down the street literally in a suit made of American flags,
like waving an American flag, shouting about the 4th of July, quoting Thomas Jefferson.
There's something about this where they become uniquely Iraqi and American at the same time.
And that in corporate development, and I think you're right, it is crippling Europe,
and it's, I think, why you guys have fought with each other, the way that you have so much.
And America, I think, was founded in part looking over at you guys and being like,
not you specifically as in English. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You're up broadly with the UK kind of as an appendage of that. I know we don't get too much
into whether or not it's European and saying, like, not this way, American man, you know,
let's let's try a different path. And that's why I said that, you know, oh, you're here,
you're legal, get a job, become such a constitutive thing for what it means to be American.
And it's also, it's not with the like the Australian tall poppy, keep your head down mate,
kind of attitude. But there is a certain like, it's, it's much more New York City,
shut the fuck up, you know, kind of attitude in America of kind of a humility. Unlike, again,
it's in Australia, they cut each other down and nobody's allowed to be cool at all.
They did. Yeah, I know you. Yeah, I've been to your island.
But we don't know that. It's about knowing your place though, right? And this, this is,
this is the difference between the rest of the Anglo sphere in America. But the,
this incorporative ideology is a remarkable technology. But I think it's only possible
because America is an explicitly propositional nation. And so what, what, but what I'm, what I
mean then is essentially America has a moral responsibility never to build a McDonald's anywhere
other than America, right? Because what you're doing is you're not being sensitive to the fact
that actually this is an intrusive cultural institution that begins to subvert and undermine
other native cultures that are not based on this kind of customary traditional propositionalism
that is not prepared to deal with it either. Because why would you have thought about this
in any way, shape or form, right? So it, America can't help but undermine the traditions of other
countries all over the world. And the only reason I think that place like China are kind of immune
to it is because they're essentially affected by the Germans. They're not into it by the way.
Well, yeah, yeah, sure. But like, you should go and you should see why they have any antibodies
then is because they are, they're currently occupied by German ideology, you know, and I agree
with the German ideology part there. Yeah, it's, it's, but it is, you know, it was invented by a
German. And so it's, that's the only reason they can resist it in any way or, or shape it to their
own ends. And so, I mean, they covet it and they dress like they covet it and don't know how to
covet it correctly. It's not as bad now as it's matured a little. The Nouveau Rich in China,
the first times I went, I mean, it was, you know, the most garish, you know, you pick whichever
brand Gucci, I don't even know my brands that you're supposed to be all the big ones, right?
The, they're obnoxious symbols, the G's and the D's and the things and the whatever.
We're not supposed to mention the Balenciaga one anymore. Every piece of clothing on a person
was a different one of them with the brand logo as large as it can possibly be. It's like a guy
wearing a jacket that's a giant Ferrari with like Lamborghini pants, like to show off how he's part
of all the big expensive brands and like everybody was like that. And it's toned down now. I mean,
just the most obnoxious kind of, you know, it was a phenomenon of being the Nouveau Rich phenomenon
and the covetousness of the West and they have this weird like exploitative ass, like mentality
about it. But at the same time, they also, it's like, if you're a white American in China, they
worship you and use you at the same time and hate you at the same time. It's a really weird
phenomenon to kind of experience. You're getting major positive and negative racism at the same
time against you for sure. My sister worked in South Korea for a while and she had a friend
over there who he had a beard and Koreans would just come up to him in the street and just touch
his face. That's happened to me in China. Yeah. And I was just like, that is horrific. You know,
I can't imagine strangers just coming up and touching my face. No, come up with a cell phone
right in your face. Yeah. I mean, all kinds of really strange things. And then on the more fun
like pretty girls will just run up to you and take selfies with you for no reason.
But this, but this is what I mean when essentially we have to make the Americans
understand they are parochial and their view of mankind as universal is tied to the liberalism
and it's also damaging other cultures, right? But I don't think I don't as maybe it's my
Americanness. I just don't see a problem. Well, there's the flip side with wellness.
No, no, no. That is, of course, you don't because it's what you're used to. It's what you are
familiar with. It's what you expect, right? But I'm, I've, this, this is what the return guys
are talking about, but not articulating it well enough. It's this kind of cultural imperialism
that seems justified when you say, well, we have a better culture. But you've got to remember that
everyone thinks they have a better culture. And what you really have is just more power, right?
Because if it was the other way, there'd be like, well, my Latvian culture is just better than your
American culture. That's why I get to impose on you. And so it's actually not sentimental in any
way. It's actually now rationalistic. And actually, the way that the, the European powers have been
have forced us into sentimental relationships with one another because of the lack of over
single power domination of the continent. Actually, if you look at the European nations,
they're all roughly the same size, you know, they're at least all comparable. And so it's
kind of forced us to have some form of respect for that other culture that we don't. And so we,
we've got a saying in England is when in Rome, you do as the Romans do. But that's not something
Americans believe. And it's destroying civilizations. And so it's this, but I genuinely think it's
tied to the, the American liberal experience of the world, thinking of themselves as universal men,
and anyone can come in to be an American. And actually, no, I don't really think that's true.
And also, I think that that concept is being exported in a damaging way to other people.
And so I think that I think a lot of it is why there's a fundamental resentment against America.
Because I like, I like loads of Americans. I like loads of Americans. But also, I can see why a lot
of people don't like Americans, you know. And so, I mean, it's probably because I'm English,
and therefore we've got very, very, very, almost harmonious values and sense of humor,
and I'm used to American culture. And so yeah, I get along really great with Americans.
But I do understand the complaints against America. I think that those vaguely sympathetic
those complaints are actually working themselves out within America. When we have
the democratic establishment, the deep state, whatever it is, they think that they're superior,
that their values are universal, and they despise the parochial Americans. And, and
they're worlds apart. Yeah. And so one of the tensions between the left and the right in our
country, which we project out of the world, is that universalizing all consuming bureaucratic
mindset, and then this like localized red state-ish, more rural uniqueness that you are
explaining is America at large is doing the rest of the world.
No, and this is why I'm so totally in support of like the MAGA movement, you know, not so much
Trump himself, but the people that he is representing. These are the sort of people that
in Europe, I would recognize as just my countrymen, you know, they're just my fellow Englishmen,
right? And this, this is, and these are the people that I don't want to see the left destroy,
you know, the left will destroy this unique traditional culture. And that's what it is.
And that's what we have in Europe. And so we have to get out of the mindset of rationalistic
universalism to be able to appreciate that that that's there. Now, that's not to undo any of
what we were talking about at the beginning of this conversation, because honestly, I agreed
with almost all of it. I think you'll agree with the next thing I'll say, but carry on.
Okay. We need to be able to have a rational perspective on the world, obviously. But I
think that should include the appreciation for the native traditional cultures that we have.
See, so I don't think that the left has a rational universalist perspective whatsoever.
I think they have a Gnostic universalist perspective, which is they know better and
everybody has to be that. And I don't feel like that's actually fundamentally American at all.
I don't think Americans, no, it's not at all think. Yeah, it is German. That's right.
They have a systematic philosophy. That's why they shouldn't be heads of states ever.
You can go to your grave. I'll go with you. Maybe not to your grave, but
in agreement, it'll be a group grave, I'm sure we can. We're all going down some hill,
sometimes we can. Yeah, we can tell them on Louise right off the side of that one together,
holding hands, the whole thing. But it is that's a but that's and again, this is that
Swabian pietus thing, because it so informs what we see as German philosophy, because the German
systematic philosophies grew largely out of that, which was a Gnostic kind of attempt to fuse Gnosticism
and the kind of emerging enlightenment science and the emerging enlightenment philosophy
in the German context. So I I hear what you're saying. I think that these things should be
allowed to play out organically. If that I don't think that destroys, it does damage or transform
or change traditional cultures, but only get destroyed societies or even cultures, I think
it allows them to change with time. And if you want to be contingent about it with the
contingent circumstances of that they find themselves in the times and places and communication
modes that they have. That's not a problem. But it's when you have this imperialistic
that I have a problem with. So let me stop you there because
this again, feels like an opinion that is centered in the sort of rational liberal perspective.
And I'm not trying to just constantly pull you up on it, but
traditional cultures do change over time. The great example of that was Queen Elizabeth's
funeral, where you could see traditional uniforms and costumes from each era of Britain's history
marching in procession. You know, it's kind of preposterous in a way, but it's also a testament
to what we have been through as a country. And so the it's not that traditional cultures don't
change. The problem is that the American rationalism that I agree is infected with German Gnosticism,
I totally agree. But this is being exported around the world and it's kind of liquefying
these cultures. So it becomes impossible to have a true and sincere commitment to
the traditional way of life in that place. And so I think actually it is a problem and it is
kind of anti-human because at least one thing we can say about the traditional cultures is
they're authentically human. They're just that kind of human, that kind of human. There are lots
of kinds of human, but it's authentically a human experience.
Yeah, I think this is where I don't go with you.
And so, which is fine. We don't have to agree, obviously, but this is where I don't go with you.
And I just impressed that I again, we can call it the English side and the German side or whatever
we want to call it. But this difference, the Gnostic aspect is not necessarily woven
thoroughly through what it means to be American or liberal. It is a thing that has grown up with it
and is parasitic upon it. And I think that our values of universalism, as we were talking about
earlier, created an opening by which, say, through critical race theory and the perversion,
the literally Marxist perversions of civil rights that have created this kind of monstrosity.
I think that we can make it very evident that this German idealism or this Gnosticism by asking
where does it propagate? Where does it scale? It scales within bureaucracies specifically,
which means corporations, which means, you know, nominally efficient systems and it propagates
in media, it propagates in colleges too. And if we see that wherever these ideas are transmitted,
they're probably transmitted through business, through forms of business, through forms of
interaction and a culture. And what they blend, it is a type of person. The cubicle man is a
type of person. It's not not a type of person, but he's thinking in a universalized form. He's
thinking in terms of bureaucracies, thinking in terms of what did you guys say? Abstractions by
just chopping people down into a little functionary but fungible. He just thinks in that way. And
that way of thinking is, again, it's very good at doing certain things. But it also propagates,
I think Carl's critique is that it puts every individual into a blender and it erodes societies.
But when we go back to the question that you posed at the beginning, James, about there's this beast
that we have to defeat, if you do want to tie it to Gnosticism and then see where Gnosticism
propagates through the systems or the cultures, then we can see how to create cultures or systems,
corporations, and states that are immune to it that still have the same kind of functionality,
that still train people, that still inform people, and that still rule people. But it
are still immune to that whatever this mind virus is. I mean, it attaches to centralization of power
and monopoly is what it attaches to extraordinarily efficiently. And so whatever you're looking
forward to, and I actually think that one of the reasons besides this kind of civil right
parasitism that we cannot ignore, it cannibalized civil rights movements from within, became very
strong and emerged as kind of a destructive dragon that's burning down societies. The woke problem,
I mean, specifically through the identity politics, what I've referred to as identity
Marxism, more specifically, it cannibalizes or attaches to, I should say, to centralized power
and monopoly. So we have to be thinking in terms of I think that other than just that what that's
where I was going with it, sorry. I think that one of the main things that has happened is that
because of the rapid changes that came, structurally speaking, in every culture, this is not even a
cultural argument, due to the rapid transformation of technological communications technology in
particular. But also, so that's big tech, basically, but also financial technology. These two sectors
of the economy rapidly changed, rapidly gained the kind of monopolistic power,
because they were ahead of whether it's legislation, whether it's out of culture,
they were ahead in their developments of everything else. They gained this kind of
power. I was thinking about this yesterday, it's the kind of power that corrupt or evil
governments covet, or maybe we should just be more realistic and say that all governments covet.
They covet the kind of power that the tech industry and the financial industry were able
to accrue over the past 20 years due to technological transformation that we haven't been able to answer
yet. So what does it look like going forward? I think that the liberal project of decentralization
of power that nobody deserves political authority, so we're going to decentralize that. Nobody gets
to answer questions, does the final say, well, this is just how we do shit around here. Nope,
we're going to ask the question. I think that while that does have a corrosive or a subversive or a
acidic dissolving kind of effect or can, it also prevents the ability for this thing to take over.
But the reason that it was able to take over was because new technologies emerged.
I think I've hit it. I think I've hit it. You are right. There is a parasite.
You are absolutely right. Because the distinction, I think, should be made between English and
French liberalism, because English liberalism is built on negative rights, of course,
what the king can't do to you. And this, of course, comes from the medieval tradition of,
essentially, the Anglo-Saxons fighting against the Norman occupiers. And that's, it manifests
explicitly in negative rights. However, the French view of liberalism, as we know as Rousseau,
manifests in a series of positive rights. In fact, it's almost an entirely positive
positivistic doctrine when you get down to the base of it. I mean, you can literally see this
in the formulation between Locke and Rousseau. Whereas Locke thought we sacrificed a portion
of our natural rights to protect the rest through the creation of a government, which, of course,
then is subject to negative behaviors, negative restraints. Rousseau believed we exchanged our
natural rights for civil rights. And that's a positive perspective on rights rather than a
negative one. And that strikes me as the parasite itself. The problem, though, is that that really
inflames 20th century civil rights doctrines because, essentially, the Civil Rights Act would
have to be one of those key points where you point to and say, look, that's the parasite.
It has to be grounded back in the very English declaration that Thomas Jefferson wrote down
and following Locke, of course, and then tried to live up to and fail that they exploit. It has
to be grounded correctly. I think this is where, not that I'm a huge fan of Caldwell's book, The Age
of Entitlement. I do like it. I think it's an important book, but where you actually see with
the Civil Rights Movement that there was this split. And in fact, the problem in the United
States is we have two constitutional orders right now, two fundamentally different,
irreconcilable constitutional orders. One of them is, in fact, an entitlement state that is this
French Enlightenment or French liberal positivistic state. And I don't think that,
I don't know about the Civil Rights Act themselves, but the judicial interpretation of those that
followed very rapidly, the enactment of the Great Society with Johnson and going forward,
these things explicitly took the path that he's outlining as the Asian entitlement.
These things explicitly became the pathway by which the woke virus was able to start to cannibalize
the liberal tradition. And I think that this is absolutely crucial for us to understand and
start unwinding, because now when we understand it this way, we have one massive advantage.
Not only do we get conceptual clarity, we can start to identify unique judicial decisions
that took us down the wrong road, which means that those judicial decisions can be brought to
review. We just had the huge thing with Roe v. Wade, but you start looking at things like in
universities, Bakke versus, what was it? Is it the Regents of the University of California?
You start looking at that, you start looking at employment like Duke versus Griggs Power.
I think that's what that's called. You start looking at those, there's a handful of these
cases, like kind of landmark cases. You can figure out which ones they are, because the critical
racers point to them obsessively. And you can figure out which ones they were that took us down
this path. And then those going under judicial review can actually take, not the Civil Rights
Act necessarily themselves, which could be rooted in our 14th Amendment, which can be rooted back
to the Declaration of Independence, but all of the judicial interpretation that came after those
that created this second constitutional order that was parasitic, pseudo constitutional order
that we go under where we are now reinterpreting what the Constitution was intended to mean,
or what the civil rights laws are intended to say. In particular, here's one of the little
manipulations, protected class. So civil rights law says that race, for example, is a protected
class. That's not the same thing as saying certain races are protected classes of individuals,
right? That's a completely different conception of what a protected class means.
I think when we entangle these, we actually can find a path out of this through means,
while post-liberal cultural renewal may be a valuable project. We can find ways that are
strictly within the liberal legal tradition to unwind this mess, where again, like we said
earlier, nobody has to become a revolutionary to get out of this.
No, so this I think is best exemplified in the bake the cake controversy, right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
This seems to me to be the perfect example that the state is going to force someone to bake a
cake against their will, because it would be discriminatory for them not to. It's such a
perfect exemplification of positive rights in action. I get to force you to do something
or else, right? That's the total inversion of the English liberal tradition, what I consider
to be the proper liberal tradition, like we were trying to think of.
You see that in the conversion therapy bills too, where they took the concept of forcing somebody
to change their sexuality being wrong to questioning somebody's gender identity to be wrong, right?
Yes. But the thing is this, what this means is that you will be opening up a space where
it will be allowable for people to be bigoted, right? Because it will be that right. You can't
tell them not to be. But of course, it will also mean that you don't have the parasite saying,
right, now I've been given a license to force you to do these things. Why can't I just use
this license to force you to do a whole bunch of other things as well?
Correct.
You know, and this is...
When did it become the government's job to rid the world of bigotry?
Approximately 1968, thank you for asking.
Yes, that's exactly, that's the positive right. That's, and that is the parasite that gives itself
totalitarian license over society. Actually, I'm glad we've hammered on this actually.
But I mean, it does mean you will find a shop with a Nazi side.
Who cares?
I'm totally liberal about that. It's like, I know, I'm not going to shop there, you know,
and like, I actually am persuaded by the capitalist arguments on that. It's like,
no one's going to shop there. And this, in fact, ties nicely into my theory of social
moral sentiments, which is people in the community will exert their own kind of moral pressure on
that person. They'll be like, are you the guy with the Nazi sign? I'm not going to shop.
What a piece of shit you are, you know, piss off. I'm going in just any other shop
that doesn't say no blacks or no Irish, you know, on it. And so I do think you will get this kind of
moral corrective measure. No Irish? Is that a thing where you're from? Do you guys have...
It was the thing where you came from. That was the thing where we are.
Okay. You guys don't have like pro-Irish legislation in the 60s coming down where you
guys are forced to adore them. Okay. No, that was you.
Don't start potato explaining. No, no Irish was assigned. That was in America.
That was totally American. Maybe we should have stuck with the no German. I don't know.
I'm just kidding. Yeah. But the point is...
You just put that on the Capitol and left it there.
But did it have to be legislated that the no Irish signs were taken down or did they just
fall out of favor? That, you know, that's the perennial question. I mean, that literally
is the question at the heart of what was going on with the Civil War. So I don't know that we're
about to answer that one. Well, it takes a certain amount of humility to...
Well, I guess it takes a certain amount of hubris to try to shape culture, to say our culture,
we are no longer going to behave in this manner. And maybe sometimes that's a good thing where
you force people to behave differently. Maybe there are good uses to put that. But once you give
that power, this is the old kind of tired, once you give that power to the government,
then they can do that. And they actually have to do that indefinitely to maintain their cutting
edge power. And that's why you have the civil rights going all the way down into, for some reason,
children being exposed to grown men and women face, right? Yes. Progressive in that direction.
But this is the point, though. I agree that it would be far better to have a system purely of
negative rights and that would be not only sustainable. I don't think that would actually
have an acidic effect either, because it would be tolerant of things that you didn't like.
You would have to be like, well, look, that's just the way they do things. You'd effectively arrive
at the when in Rome, do as the Romans do perspective. You let them do what they're
thinking and you might not agree. But then it's a social issue. So then it's for all of us to
have a conversation about, say, well, look, actually, why are you saying that black people
can't come to your shop? That's awful. What an awfully stigmatizing thing to do that
would be. And so we can agree that that would be a terrible thing to do without having the state,
essentially, and the Ben Shapiro at gunpoint. I mean, technically, yes. It's a bit hyperbolic,
but yes, technically. You got to go through a lot of dorks to get to the gun.
Yeah, I know. I know. You're more acceptable. I get some more functionaries than dorks.
I just hate it when he compresses down everything into right now to guns. Oh, come on, Ben. Come on.
You know, it's an extreme way of framing it. But then we're into the realm of being human,
right? Then we're into the realm of consideration and empathy and dealing with each other like
human beings rather than having a bureaucrat telling you what you have to do. So, you know,
that's my view, I suppose. I don't think I disagree with that at all.
Right. That was an amazing conversation. I have to get off to work. That's why I'm wrapping it up,
and I'm sure that you guys need to do other things, but thank you both for blowing my mind
and stretching my bladder. That was fascinating. Yeah, mine too. So I'll link links to your work
in the description, but James got new discourses and Sargon runs Lotus Eaters. You also have
YouTube, both have YouTube channels, which are fascinating work. Yeah, they're good ones.
They're great. If we do say so ourselves.
