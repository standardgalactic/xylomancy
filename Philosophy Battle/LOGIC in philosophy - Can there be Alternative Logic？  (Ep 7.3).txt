Hey everyone, my name is Ajay and welcome to Philosophy Battle.
Before this video starts, I just want to make clear that this video is about logic.
And whether or to what extent there can be alternative logics.
Because if there can be alternative logics, then which logic we are using can be considered
relative to some other factors.
And typically logic is taken to be one of the strongholds against claims to relativism.
Logic is often taken to be as proof of something that isn't relative, much like math.
So this video will introduce also some basic logic and the basic concepts of logic.
And if you are already familiar with logic, well just be a little bit patient.
The more philosophically gripping stuff will come at the end.
Either way it does get progressively more intense, but stick to it.
Even if you don't get certain parts or know what's going on, it could still be very well
cleared up later on at some point.
And at the end the main point or main conclusion will be made pretty clear, at least I think
so.
But the video will be covering a section from a book of a philosopher, a lecturer at Trinity
College in Dublin, philosopher Paul O'Grady, because I think that his book has got a lot
of great and interesting battles in it and a lot for us to learn.
But if you don't care about O'Grady or the larger discussion of relativism I'm having
here, that's okay.
You don't have to watch anything else other than this if you're just interested in logic,
even if I'm suggesting it.
Just take it more as a kind of signpost if you want more information.
If I do suggest another video at various parts of this one.
Trust me, even if you don't watch any other things, this will still be a great video introducing
the ideas of logic and the possibility of alternatives in philosophy.
Finally, I just want to thank my Patreon supporters.
Slick pockets.
But now let's start the show and hear a short recap of how we got here first.
Logic vs Relativism
This video is part of a series covering a few books on relativism, before we go back
to the battlefield of the philosophy of science, where we had encountered some extreme relativists.
And trust me, it's going to be awesome when we do go back because of what we learn here
in the battlefield of metaphysics.
In particular, this video is covering a section in this green book simply called relativism
by Paul O'Grady.
We previously already covered in a video his first chapter that explains the power of relativism
that I visualize as this philosophic weapon.
That video explains how this philosophic weapon came into being in modern philosophic warfare
as empowered by five great philosophers, and thus how it's possible that even a reasonable
person may perhaps be led into believing that everything is relative.
Not just what flowers look the best, or what candy tastes the best, or who's the best
philosophy YouTuber, it's me obviously, but that everything is relative.
They feel truth, knowledge, scientific fact, logic, even reality is relative.
Nothing is objective.
Nothing.
Absolute.
Now that's an extreme position.
But the powers of this weapon is actually based in philosophic writing and the history
of science.
It's not just some made up contrived stuff here, so please go check out that video if
you'd like to really understand why one can't just offhand dismiss a relativist.
When you really see the reasoning, it can be clearly a difficult enemy to challenge.
But also, this wickedly powerful weapon is an important one for philosophers to use ourselves
in investigation to challenge to question claims of objectivity.
It's just that, unlike these extreme relativists, we will gain the understanding to see that
it does still in fact have limits.
And Paulo Grady in his book covers two places where he defends against the charges of relativism,
where those limits of this weapon should be, on truth and rationality.
So these are the two battles that I wanted to cover, one on truth and one on rationality.
And actually we already covered that first battle defending truth and trust me, it was
so awesome.
So if you're interested in just trying to figure out how to defeat this enemy in terms
of defending a non-relative truth in particular, then you can check out this video.
To be honest, the way I presented it was that Ogrady does a kind of setup first, where
he actually uses a logical principle of non-contradiction to then go into battle on these two areas.
So it's understandable that he actually has a section devoted to relativism about logic
in particular right in that first chapter, where he's going to discuss whether or not,
or to what extent, we can have alternative logics, whether logic is relative.
So that's what we're going to be covering right now.
And I did promise I'm going to try and go a little faster in this normal one because
it kind of was just an additional section to that first great battle.
But I thought it might be also nice for me to show you all what formal symbolic logic
actually looks like, if you're not familiar with it, it might be kind of cool to actually
visually see.
And it will also give you a kind of good mental understanding to sit in the background of what
philosophers really mean when we're talking about logic.
First is just some, you know, I don't know, it's like a political hack on the internet
touting rhetoric about how logic is on their side.
We mean something much more than that.
So despite me trying to blast through some stuff, since I am still covering what Ogrady
says, as usual I will cite things down to the line.
And when I'm not speaking for or giving my interpretation a presentation for our purposes
of what Ogrady says in the text, then the citation in the corner of the screen will
just disappear.
That way you'll know it's coming from me, and what is coming from my interpretation
of what he's saying.
Cool?
Okay, let's go.
Logic is intimately tied into issues of truth because of the notions of coherence and contradiction.
Not everyone feels that way though, some will say it's more noticeably about inferences
than about truth.
But I don't have time to deal with them here.
And most do see logic as having something to do with truth, and I already mentioned
a couple of logical laws in the previous battle against the Alithic relativist, Alithic being
about truth and relativism as in being dependent on something else.
And namely, I mentioned the laws of non-contradiction and the law of the excluded middle.
And if you want to see that, you know what to do.
Anyway, the question is, even if yes, so say the truth isn't relative, even if the truth
is absolute, couldn't there still be legitimate alternative systems of logic?
Or is there just one most basic, one correct one?
Ogrady then tries to explain what logic even is, saying it's fundamental to human reasoning.
It governs the process of inferring beliefs in a truth-preserving way, such that if one
starts with true beliefs and then makes no mistakes in logic, one is guaranteed to have
true beliefs as a conclusion.
This is usually what we call validity, and it's the central notion in logic.
A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.
Now thousands of years ago, Aristotle was the first to codify logical laws and principles,
but they were around even before him.
But this codification marks it as a formal discipline.
So I'm going to try now and explain this as best as I can with some actual visual examples
that might help us for the background for the rest of this video.
Logic is a way of reasoning, and let's look at three examples of mine.
If it's true that if it rains, you should put on a coat, and then you find out it is
raining, we can conclude you should put on a coat.
We just kind of reason it out.
Or for another example, if it's true that if it rains, then the street would be wet,
but then you find out the street isn't wet, then you can conclude that it didn't rain.
This is us using logic to figure this out.
Simple right?
But let's do one more.
Let's just for the sake of argument imagine that it's true that either it's raining
or we're eating pizza.
But we find out, hey, we're not eating pizza.
We can conclude, then it is raining.
So logic is the ability for us to figure out a conclusion that kind of preserves the same
amount of certainty as the stuff that led to the conclusion.
So technically logic isn't about figuring out if those premises are true or not, but
just that if they are, the conclusion must be true.
So like in this example, logic won't be telling us if it's actually true that it's actually
raining outside, for example.
Unless of course, you know, it's raining is derived from some other argument prior.
In any case, logic is just what's helping us reason out this conclusion.
And philosophers have codified that like math has been codified.
And just to help us with a comparison to math, which actually is going to be a running theme
later on, reasoning in math doesn't need to look like this.
This is kind of a codification and symbolization of math.
Technically, one doesn't even need to know any of what these things even mean to reason
out mathematically.
In fact, when we first teach this symbolic math to children, we actually teach them the
reasoning in other ways first, without this symbolic language.
For example, we might say, hey, look at all your fingers, put them up.
You see, there is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, up.
Now put two fingers down.
Now see how many fingers you have left up.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
So there are eight fingers up.
Thus children may be able to figure out how many fingers are up without even being literate
or even ever having to see these particular symbols ever.
But math has been formalized and symbolized and has functions that we slowly begin to teach
children moving away from saying something like, I give you five apples but you eat two
apples to just saying you have five apples but take away two apples.
Then we just stop saying take away and start saying minus two instead.
Also we'll just stop saying the apples so we end up saying just five minus two.
Then again, perhaps we will teach them a more appropriate way of saying it as five subtract
two while showing these symbols in particular.
Then we fully begin to discuss our numerical or quantified reasoning through this mathematical
symbolic language in ways that don't even have to connect to real world stuff.
We don't have to be talking about apples and oranges or whatever else anymore to do
math like this through symbols.
So now a similar type of thing has happened and from here I'm just going to ask you to
follow along as much as you possibly can but if you get lost don't worry we're going to
go back to O'Grady but I think this will be pretty fun.
So similarly philosophers have made it so that we can symbolize the process of this
stuff.
But by representing these propositions as letters we'll be using in our calculations
and having certain symbols to represent those relations between propositions kind of like
these symbols in math I guess you could say.
Such as the if then symbol, a conditional symbol.
So if P then Q or this symbol for negation and while we have these symbols we also have
inference rules that allow us to use these symbols and figure things out using these
symbols in different ways.
For example if P then Q well given P therefore Q.
This is called modus ponens it's super simple and it fits pretty well with our first example.
But now let's look at that second example.
If these propositions are represented by these letters then we can show it as if P then Q
and we find out that not Q thus we can conclude not P.
This is called modus tolens.
Again so like that first one was allowing us to show the truth of P that led us to the
truth of Q this one kind of allows us to use the negation to move backwards.
The falsehood of Q or rather not Q allows us to figure out not P backwards.
And now for our third example if these are our definitions we can present this with an
OR symbol and we can do something called disjunctive syllogism where P or Q means either this or
that which means both can't be false.
If one is false the other has to be true.
So if we have not Q it means that we can conclude P.
So that's what these would look like.
But again remember logic isn't actually figuring out if not Q is really true for this argument.
We have to find out other ways to actually verify not Q in this case it's just that
if it were not Q then we can conclude P must be the case and so this is a valid deduction.
Deduction is either valid or not.
If it is valid it can be sound or not.
And we know if it is sound by some other means by figuring out if this particular argument
still has all its premises are actually true.
Now that might not seem like an important distinction but actually it's very important
for a philosopher because sometimes your enemy presents an argument and technically their
logic is valid as in these things really do lead to this conclusion logically.
So the problem isn't that it isn't valid just that perhaps you question one or more
of the premises as being true.
So you're not saying the argument isn't valid but that it isn't sound.
Because say this premise isn't true for example.
Now that may be not super important for what we're going to be talking about in this video
so don't worry about trying to remember all these things if you don't know about it.
But it is super important for philosophers just to be accurate about what we're criticizing
in another to ensure our attacks actually land.
But getting back to the symbols now let's go and make a big old puzzle.
But now kind of like not needing apples anymore we're not even going to need these definitions.
We're just going to show these letters because we don't even really care if it's sound.
We're just going to be trying to figure out if it's a valid deduction.
So let me just add a couple of other things so we can make a bigger one just as an example.
First of all dn or double negation.
It's where there's two knots.
Two knots cancel each other out.
So knot knot p through double negation just makes p and vice versa.
That one's pretty easy.
We kind of spoke about this previously in the previous video.
But also there's another one where p and q written maybe with this symbol instead of
ampersand could be simplified through the process of simplification either as p or as
q.
And the other process can happen too where if you have p and q in different places you
could actually just put them together through something called adjunction and have p and
q.
Anyway now let's look at this one for funsies.
If q then p, q or r?
If r then not s.
Given t and s prove q.
It's like a puzzle isn't it?
Let's solve it now.
So we're given p and s.
We can simplify that to just s.
And with just s we can make it knot knot s through double negation right because it's
the same thing.
But with knot knot s and if r knot s we can do modus tolens and therefore get knot r.
Because remember whoop so that's knot r and with knot r and q or r we can do disjunctive
syllogism therefore getting us q.
Because remember if it's knot r then it has to be q.
And with q and if q then p we do our basic modus tolens and therefore conclude p.
Boom done.
That's the proof.
We've proved p.
If these are all true then given this one can prove logically this must be true.
Fun huh?
Well if you don't think so that's okay.
It's like a puzzle and if you learn all the rules intimately and do more puzzles it can
be super fun just like doing math or stats puzzles or playing chess or doing sudoku
I don't know they can all be super fun if you play them.
And it can really be cool and enjoyable to take the truth of this and run it through
this big ol process and get a result here considered a proof.
This is really basic stuff though and actually there are far more advanced logics than this.
But let me just stop there before I cut myself off too early.
When it comes to logic being presented in this way it's called formal logic and it
is a kind of symbolic logic.
So personally just to be clear when I find some in the common regular non-mathematicians
non-philosophers non-computer scientists saying logic they kind of just generally mean some
kind of reasoning something like I believe what I believe based on this this is what
I think and I think this makes sense that's my logic.
Well that seems really loose and open and it seems to also sometimes mix or not even
regard the difference between soundness and validity but either way still there's some
understanding that logic has something to do with some kind of reasoning but when philosophers
say logic it pays to mention if you mean formal logic like this like as in a system created
for us to do reasoning in of a certain kind.
Kind of like saying I'm doing math to a mathematician they will tend to now really think of math
in this way in particular.
This may just seem like an aside but trust me we'll come into play later.
Formal logic just systematizes and articulates the kind of inferences we make in our everyday
reasoning processes to help us figure out valid reasoning versus fallacious reasoning.
Fallacious is if a conclusion doesn't actually follow from the premises.
While Aristotle's classic formal logic was so good that a couple of thousand years later
Immanuel Kant was like logic is a completed science nothing to add but then there was
a renewed interest in logic in the 19th century because of big developments happening in math.
And as we've been mentioning in like the last four videos I think German mathematician
and philosopher Gottlieb Frege made one of the most significant contributions with his
uh, Berg-Beg-Bieg-Rift-Begerschrift Forgive me for not knowing how to say this properly.
I've read it a thousand times I just don't have friends to tell me how to say things.
Anyway, Beggerschrift actually kind of looks like this but it was Frege's writings who
actually brought for a more modern symbolic logic.
It was even more sophisticated than Aristotle's and could articulate relations and generalities
in such a way that one could even show mathematical truths derived from logical truths.
So like I was saying earlier we can do a mental processing that we call reasoning which makes
use of a kind of logic in terms of inferring beliefs from other beliefs and formal logic
systematizes and makes a symbolic language of us doing that kind of reasoning which actually
helps us do that kind of thing but maybe we could say there's another kind of mental
processing perhaps we'll call it calculating which is the use of math and this math stuff
is also systematized and put into a symbolic kind of language which helps us do that.
Well Frege's articulation was actually so good it made it possible to show that maybe
even math actually is from logical reasoning that it isn't a unique different kind of
thought processing.
This was called logicism and Russell and Whitehead furthered that position in their famous Principia
Mathematica showing their logical systems and how they can derive mathematical truths
from them.
What logic was shown to be more fundamental to our mental processing than math?
That actually math comes from it?
Wow so cool.
At least I think that's pretty cool.
Anyway they only actually used five basic symbols in their logic but later Wiccanshine
you know who came after goes Frege or Russell Wiccanshine.
Anyway Wiccanshine in the TLP the Tractatis logical Philosophicus which is his most famous
writing from when he was younger actually suggested breaking down all of logic to just
one symbol.
Actually I think Wiccanshine used the Shepha Shrope to show this and really Shepha was
the first to show this I think to show that we can do all of propositional logic with
just one symbol but I'm not sure if he was the first to actually show it.
So if you're a logician and you know who is actually the first to show this let me know
in the comments below but also if I remember correctly I think Wiccanshine was trying to
show that even predicate logic can be expressed with it too.
But anyway if that sounds like nonsense don't worry about it.
Basically we have these five symbols right the if then conditional the if and only if
by conditional this symbol which is basically and the or symbol which means that one of
the two must be true both can't be false and the negation symbol.
So there's five symbols right but actually I can be fine doing it all with just one symbol.
What really just one symbol how are you going to do that well let me show you.
Firstly this by conditional is pretty easy P if and only Q all it means that both if
P then Q and also if Q then P it was just a combination of both anyway to show that
if you have one you can get the other and it goes both ways.
So scratch that one since we can actually express it simply by using both of these in
separate ways.
But now what about this one the conditional if P then Q how can I replace that well actually
I can replace it with the or symbol by saying not P or Q wait what why well if you remember
at least one must be true so if one is false we know the other is true and so if Q is false
or not Q then we can conclude not P must be true and that's also basically modus tollens
here if P then Q but we have not Q then you know we would have not P so it works in both
senses but now also if it's not not P then it has to be Q not not P is the same as P
remember with double negation so that's the same thing as saying if P then Q so actually
these are logically equivalent so I can express in if then just using or so scratch that one
too.
Now what about these last three well check it out you can take the shepher stroke to
mean well it can either mean NAND which is to say not and or NOR which is to say not or
as far as I can tell I think you just got to be clear on which one you mean when you're
using it and for some reason it seems that people use the arrow down to be nor and is
also associated with Pierce and this arrow the arrow up is more associated with NAND and
I don't really know why I'm not really a logician or anything I'm just trying to be as honest
and truthful as possible here remember we're actually trying to talk about relativism but
anyway I can't tell technically why it is that way but as far as I can tell I think it
just matters what you're actually clear on when you actually do use it so if this slash
means nor this shepher stroke then it means that both must be false that neither this nor
this so to show not P you would show neither P nor P the only options for P here show
that they are false so with this shepher stroke I don't technically need this not symbol
to show and P and Q I can show it by saying neither neither P nor P nor neither Q nor Q
remember this is negating both sides saying both sides must be false so to say not P is to say
this and if both of these are therefore not this and not this and both of those are shown as being
negative because they're shown with this and that flips them back to being both true and thus you
are saying P and Q pretty cool huh anyway so that means I don't actually need that symbol either I
can show it all with just this stroke and also I can even show P or Q by showing neither neither
P nor Q nor neither P nor Q and you can look at that and figure out how that one makes sense
yourself if you'd like but either way the point is I don't even need this and so I can show all
of these just by using one symbol this shepher stroke just this line and you know what technically it
doesn't even have to be this one symbol in fact I can make it all another symbol or rather I can
just take this line to mean something else the NAND the arrow up instead and they would look like this
anyway this is not at all important to remember for us and our sake so let's just take a deep
breath and clear our mind a bit and not feel too bogged down if you didn't get what I was saying
let's just get back to O'Grady the point is that we can break it all down to just one symbol if we
wanted or more if we wanted more depending on what suits us best each would be its own system
so we can make a new system with four or one with six but hey the real question comes if maybe we
can make an altogether new system we set up with new symbols that tell us to do completely different
things hmm anyway there's really no limit to how many systems you could have one just set up a new
set of symbols and a new system of rules of inference and a new system appeared but these would be
syntactic systems pure theoretical or formal like not connected to anything outside of it
when it comes to having to connect to things outside of it like those letters representing
real-world stuff or true or false representing ones and zeros on a computer then yeah then it seems
like there's limits on what those systems could be and how are they these new systems even related
back to how we normally commonly just do reasoning logically you know without these
formal systems before us there were so many systems that could be very different not just
different from the Principia Mathematica but from the way we normally do daily common logical reasoning
now there were two fundamental laws in the Principia Mathematica that actually go way back
all the way as presented to Aristotle in ancient times those were the law of non-contradiction
and the law of the excluded middle the law of non-contradiction holds that a proposition and
its negation cannot be both true together the law of the excluded middle holds that all propositions
are either true or false there is no third value both of these came up before when we
battled against relativizing truth arguing to keep both of these and yo you really gotta watch that
previous video of truth versus relativism because Paulo Grady does some awesome stuff and some
important lessons there that could last forever in philosophy so please do check it out well even
those laws logicians have experimented with getting rid of them in these new various systems
that they can make but is it possible that even they can kind of represent how we in common day
do reasoning well well before we do that let's just be clear about the difference between a
classic logic with just a small change or a small difference and a full-blown alternative logic so
philosopher Susan hack actually has a very useful way of distinguishing between systems that are
actually rivals versus those that are just slightly added to so a basic logical system
is symbols that have rules on how to set up those symbols and what some of those symbols mean as in
what it says about their relation those are the inference rules or transformation rules like modus
ponens or modus tonens like i showed you earlier these things are also called well-formed formulas
by hack but whatever anyway now this is just a syntactic characterization of how thus a structure
is set up a semantic characterization is the idea that truth of the premises that we put into the
system is preserved in the conclusion we get out now if we have two systems that are set up the
same with the same transformation rules but just looking different with different symbols but they
mean the same thing then that's not really a rival system the real differences start when you get
two systems let's call them a and b that share the same basic symbols but b has more symbols
and thus more theorems and greater expression we'll call this extended logic it doesn't actually
clash with the earlier classic system just adds to it o'grady gives the example of modal logic
with the distinctions of necessity and possibility which is a kind of logic that i didn't really do
but i can imagine it one that i have done that i think would count here is called quantified
predicate logic is the one where you have the universal and existential symbols uh logicians
forgive me it's been a long time but anyway another difference here is if the symbols actually mean
something different if there's actually different rules of inference in that case a would be a
classic logic and b would be a deviant logic i assume because of how much it deviates not because
of how naughty it is in the bedroom to do or is it hey girl you down to do some deviant logic with
me back at my place okay sorry back to uh philosophy so an example of a deviant logic would be a
three-valued logic which we discussed three-value logic in the previous video again please please
do go check that one out it's a system where something doesn't have to be either just true
or false it can be even some other thing anyway another example would also be a quantum logic
where certain rules can be dropped in favor of different ones now some of these deviant systems
are actually proposed as a full-on replacement for classical logic like saying this three-valued
system is actually superior and should replace the two-valued one in all cases to be clear for our
question of relativism advocating that one is just right the right one in all cases that we
should always use it even if it is a deviant one therefore isn't relativism it's still saying that
just one is correct so it's not really relativism about logic even if that one is a deviant one
but how can we determine which is the true system of logic relativism emerges if you say two or more
systems are legitimate candidates and we can just choose between them and even move back and forth
even why would we want to be able to move to another system well hack has four different
sorts of reasons why one would want to do that that ogready outlines and i'm gonna blast through
these because i don't want this video to be too long like i said i don't like how ogready phrase
some stuff in here and really it's not all that important for us to know the details of these
only important that there are legitimate reasons to want to use a deviant logic so this just goes
to show that the issue goes well beyond just oh we can create them firstly there's a general
metaphysical reason an example of this is from dutch mathematician bauer who thought unlike
russell that math actually can't be derived from logic and while it can exist as calculating in the
mind in a way without an explicit symbolic language it is its own fundamental way of thinking he felt
the nature of math is that it is constructed by the intellect so there couldn't be mathematical
truths that are unknowable to the mind but this logical principle of the excluded middle would
mean that there are some math truths even things we don't know that are still nevertheless true
or false just we don't know them bauer denied this for mathematical truth so he wanted to drop
the law of the excluded middle so i guess like for bauer that means math truths can't be unknown
i'm not really sure here look this is a section where i don't think ogready says things right
because clearly there's a difference between unknowable or unjudgeable by the human mind
versus just unknown or unjudged but anyway i guess if we really wanted to see what's going on here
or with any of these things i can just go and check out susan hack's fuzzy book or maybe for this
one in particular perhaps it came from bauer's two-part paper i i don't really know if that's
where it came from i'm not sure because i didn't read susan hack's book but if you want here's
the journey for you you can read this and this and let us know anyway maybe one day i can do
hacks book in a series on logic like i'm doing these three books on relativism right now but
anyway the second reason hack presents is a desire to avoid philosophical problems some philosophical
commitments may be considered troublesome an example of that is that someone wants to avoid
fatalism the doctrine that events are predetermined and unmanable to free will and one version of that
comes just from accepting the law of the excluded middle it is either true or false that i will
be knocked down by a car tomorrow even though i have no way of knowing which it is the case that one
of these options is a determinate fact remember with excluded middle something is either true
or false not both not some new thing so facts about the future must already be set in that way
and for those of us who want to believe free will that my choice which hasn't been made yet should
impact what is true or false this could be seen as a problem now there are different ways to deal
with this one can just say that facts about the future can't be true or false but doing that has
a price you wouldn't even be able to say the sun will rise tomorrow is true then so instead of doing
that just denying the excluded middle could be one way of defusing the fatalist issue while at the
same time allowing some future statements to be true in any case the third source of reasons that
motivates adopting another logic is a desire to avoid scientific problems whereas the previous ones
dealt more with dropping the excluded middle this one's more closer to dropping the law of
non-contradiction the reason being how these deviant logics work with well-confirmed stuff
happening in science namely quantum physics now i had questioned this but whatever the idea is
quantum particles behave in ways not describable in the standard laws of logic like quantum super
positioning now ogrady uses david zed albert's quote about the path of quantum particles but
ultimately says of this quantum logic that it drops what are called the classical distribution
laws but the distribution laws isn't the law of non-contradiction i just want to be clear on that
but anyway for the next one the fourth reason is a desire for logical innovation systems can
actually be made to drop the law of non-contradiction why do that is it just useless well you know it's
pretty much just making them for the sake of expanding our minds sort of thing and maybe it
can also help us to understand paradoxes and stuff too so those are the four reasons ogrady
outlines that hack has for why someone would even move to an alternative logic it's not just a
trivial or for the fun of it type of thing that different systems can be made but now let's see
some objections against alternative logics ah the husband wife duo influential historians of logic
w niel and m niel hold that even from a purely formal point of view the ordinary two-valued system
has a unique status among deductive systems which can possibly be called logic since it contains all
others as fragments of itself in short they are not alternatives to classical logic but this can
be challenged truth for multi-valued logics actually may not appear in fact cannot appear
in classic two-valued systems i think that one's kind of obvious i don't know why they even said
that then ogrady says the distinctive position here seems just historical a long-standing tradition
but tradition can hardly stop philosophers and i agree with ogrady on that heavily but i would
like to note that from that quote though there's actually nothing in it to suggest that the niels
were making their claim on the basis of long-standing tradition but it reads like ogrady is saying
that's what it seems like their position also is but didn't cite that part or put a quote for it
not saying ogrady is wrong about them he certainly knows the niels ever more than i ever will but
just pointing it out that that quote actually had nothing to do with long-standing tradition of a
two-valued system anyway ogrady then devotes a few pages particularly to an argument by the
champion philosopher quine who uses the translation argument against deviant logics he gives us the
details of the background and all that and i don't really think that's fully necessary for our
purposes especially to show what ogrady's position ultimately is but i'll blast through it super
fast just so that i'm not depriving y'all of at least mentioning it given how much time ogrady
devotes to talking about it and i think you'll see why he's doing that though so like i said not to
confuse anyone but i'm gonna go kind of fast and be a little bit lax on this see first there was
these folks right and we'll call them rational intuitions who thought that logical truths can
actually be known in a special way prior to having any experience of anything so like you
don't have to make any observations in the world you can just kind of think about it and realize
it's true and so that's you using your kind of rational intuition to grasp its truth and while
there are a lot of logical truths that we know because we infer them from other ones some of them
can actually be no just straight up immediately with rational intuition no other premises required
and even some of those things that the rational intuition can figure out for us can even reveal
the nature of reality like some fundamental truths about how the world works anyway russell who
co-authored the principia of mathematically that book that shows logic more fundamental than math
you know logicism and whatnot well he felt this way too that logical truths are known through
our rational intuition not through any experience like other empirically dependent beliefs while at
first that kind of makes sense for us actually that would seem super spooky and mystical for the
positivist so they were all like yo f that but then to explain or make sense of how we grasp logical
truths then they claim that we know logical truths because they are dependent on the linguistic
framework we make or are using and if you think of it that also kind of makes sense based on what
we're saying remember we can make different syntactic structures if you want to so positivists
advanced a linguistic theory of logical truths holding that logic derives from linguistic rules
and there's different in many complex versions of this but carnap was one of them remember he was a
positivist philosopher who thought that we could make different linguistic frameworks or as we might
want to start calling it different logics for scientists to use so for those with the linguistic
theory of logic all logic really is is just following the rules within a linguistic practice
which if you think of it kind of implies there wasn't particularly anything special or deep
about logic beyond merely which linguistic framework we are using and i guess that's where
we kind of are now and now we're gonna see quine respond to this because quine ain't down with us
you see because quine likes logic so quine agreed with the criticism against the intuitionist because
he too wants to be empirical in certain ways and we'll get to that in another chapter but he thought
there was actually no need to bother trying to explain logic with something else as if there's
something more fundamental to it quine be like logic is so fundamental to thought you can't
explain or argue for it with something else or gritty says of quine logic is so basic to our
thinking that nothing more fundamental could explain it so quine be like nah you don't need
something to explain it because if you understand the language you will just give a scent to logic
anyway it's obvious and anyone who correctly understands the language in question will just
give a scent to a logical truth as an obvious truth yeah you could have trivially different
logical systems and textbooks and whatnot but when it comes to actual deviant logics well if
someone comes up to you and is like ayo p and not p you will be like no this this isn't a
sincere deviant logical person it's better to just assume that they probably don't understand what
and means or what not means or they actually mean something completely different when they say it
because the assumption is if they did know what those things mean in the way that we do
they simply would not be saying it it's just always better to believe there's actually a
mistranslation going on even if we don't know exactly what it is then to believe someone is
actually using a deviant logic he compares it to master david hume's move of saying if you come
across some claims to miracles it's better to believe no there must be some explanation to this
than there actually being a miracle and that it's always better to believe there is some actual
explanation for some event even if you don't know what that explanation is yet then to believe
there is a miracle and quines boy david sin well boy no uh sorry for my colloquialism anyway
that is quines former student david sin took this argument to a whole next level not just for logic
but even against different conceptual schemes now part of the reason of this book isn't just
to survey all the places where relativists can attack and where ogready can defend but also
actually he wants to battle david sin to the death no i'm just kidding there's no actual
violence here and even what ogready wants to do isn't actually all that confrontational with david
sin i find he just wants to present a softer argument rather than a hard argument david sin
does in his chapter on rationality so maybe that explains why he went to some depth of the background
of this argument from quine 2 talking about it here even mentioning the positivists and stuff
like that which i didn't bother getting into ogready says he will talk about both of these
philosophers anyway in different places though when he gets to them but for right now he's
gonna suggest that quines argument ain't that perfect in part because it's coming from him
nothing personal just pointing out that this argument seems to anticipate or set up a just
offhand rejection of deviant logics a priori but quines whole epistemological thing is that there
are no a priori nothing we know before experiencing it everything can be changed with experience
no beliefs have any kind of special unchangeable place but at the same time it seems he's making
logic special here and remember the translation argument is an argument that a priori rejects
deviant logics so what's going on here quine you all over the place well ogready admits the
precise interpretation of quines position is a delicate and disputed issue so it seems ogready
is open to a quinian philosopher defending quine and clarifying the different positions quine has
taken and evolved over time in which particular ways also my presentation of quine would probably
make a quinian even more frustrated and heck this ain't even my own details covering of ogready
talking about quine it's just my blast through but to be fair again ogready does say he will look
into quine himself in more detail and clarify his position better than he has done here at least in
this chapter at least he will do better when he gets to his chapter in ontology anyway there's
other problems for quine's argument too like it just assumes a classic two-valued logic is what's
obviously deep in the mind fundamental and all so everything outside of it we kind of just translate
to it but there's no argument here in particular for why this obviously correct thing in the mind
can't be for someone else say an intuitionist logician having a three-plus-valued logic
or something else the argument just states that there is a base logic but there is no argument
here for what that logic has to be that it has to be a classic two-valued system and not a deviant
one also it seems quine is using considerations about translation because of his own commitment to
empiricism and behaviorism but one could argue that empirical evidence isn't appropriate to
determine the nature of logic i mean maybe there's some metaphysical underpinning that can explain
why logic is special in any case ogready seems to hold that there are indeed arguments against
deviant logics but they aren't all that perfect there's flaws in him ogready then goes on to
describe his own position that looks like this he says and we're going to quote this line by line
while i give my own visualization of it even if one accepts a deviant system and believes there are
good philosophical grounds for defending it there seems to be general regulative principles
governing the choice of a logical system these include consistency coherence simplicity efficacy
and so on our choice of a logical system is itself governed by a more general conception of
rationality he says there are notions of logic that operate up here and those are what he argues for
in his chapter on rationality the law of non-contradiction and he says he won't argue for it but
it's possible that for the reasons of simplicity we would also have up here a two-valued system the
law of the excluded middle simply because then you don't have to mess around with truth where does
that leave the legitimacy of deviant logic well it's pretty clear that multi-valued systems
are possible and there's no compelling formal argument against having them but also up here
the meta level that governs the adoption of such systems is committed to at least the law of
non-contradiction and probably for reasons of simplicity to the law of the excluded middle
lower level contacts requiring suspension of this to require the existence of such a meta level
is to argue for the core conception of rationality which will be argued for in chapter five
this is an absolute non-relative conception governing degrees of diversity beneath it
so the upshot of this discussion is that there are legitimate alternative logical
calculi useful for various purposes but ultimately governed by a system adhering to the
traditional laws of logic and with that the chapter ends so we see Ogrity does allow relativism
on logic in terms of the lower level but argues that there are some principles of logic on the
meta level or above which he defends and he will be calling the core conception of rationality
once again leading us to that second great battle where he defends against relativism
on his chapter on rationality so we gotta go and check that out this means though for some folks
that come up and be like hey this isn't relative it's logical you could say there are actually
different logics back to that but ultimately they may be just saying something about how
basic rationality that governs fundamental way we think is nevertheless beholden to logical laws
if that's what they are saying you could say so you mean rationality isn't relative
which is kind of different but maybe that's just not much criticism behind what they meant to say
only that it's probable that they don't really understand logic in the way philosophers or
logicians or mathematicians do certainly many people don't know there are different kinds of
maths as well different interpretations of what counts as the correct mathematical procedure
that perhaps mathematicians and philosophers are familiar with but the common person isn't
so it's much easier for the common person to say math and mean something about the fundamental
ways we think about things in any case is logic relative it seems like yeah it is but logical
principles kind of are necessary to the way we think certainly there are actual alternatives and
you can actually pick different logics depending on what you need but can we use a different logic
at least in terms of the principle of non-contradiction in the way we actually think in the
way our rationality is well O'Grady will argue nope we cannot so let's go see that awesome
battle now against the relativists that would argue even rationality is relative oh and before
you go I just want to say very quickly unscripted if you like my visualization or my videos here
please go check out some of the other ones and please actually do subscribe to my channel if
you can please support me on patreon or send me a direct donation to paypal it's really difficult
and it takes hundreds of hours to make these videos and I don't get much support even socially as you
can see my subscriber count isn't even that high so it's not like even youtube pays me for this
so if you can do that that would be great that could really be nice you know other than that I
just want to say let's get to the next battle of rationality versus relativism and remember
philosophers keep battling
