Relativism. It is one of the most powerful modern philosophic weapons. Its power is immense.
However, it can become dangerous if wielded to extreme degrees, by those with insufficient
philosophic understanding. While it can be traced back to ancient times, it is philosophies from
five different great philosophers that are noted to have been imbued into this weapon,
empowering it into the modern philosophic warfare. Relativism is most useful in carving out the layers
of presumed objectivity and the naivety of our old ways. We use relativism now as more a clear
path to being skeptical about all sorts of claims, not just who makes the best pizza,
or even what is right and wrong, but now, even what we may have previously called facts.
And so this weapon becomes incredibly crucial for any good philosophic warrior to appreciate its
power. But equally important, also its limits. And ignoring those limits can create dangerous and
frustrating enemies for us on the battlefield. We must learn to wield relativism to become good
philosophers. The question, to be skeptical of all sorts of claims to objectivity, we must use it
whenever it can be used. But we must also be cautious and not be impatient in our journey to
investigate cases where perhaps it cannot. The limits of its use. So today we're gonna explain
those two things, the power and limits of this tremendous philosophic weapon called relativism.
Which is why we came here to the battlefield of metaphysics in the first place,
so we can dismantle it, and see more than merely a blur of all it can destroy, to see that it indeed
does have limits and indeed does become volatile when those limits are crossed. Limits that we
will later point out, if it should be crossed by those on the battlefield of the philosophy of
science in particular, when we get back to the battlefield, science, if we ever get back.
Anyway, we'll be looking at the power and limits as explained and set out in this green book,
relativism by Paul O'Grady. In the last episode we looked at a battle in this red book, Relativism
and Reality by Robert Kirk, because I wanted to make a social point. You see, as it is clearly
outlined in all three books I may want to cover on relativism, including this blue book, The Challenge
of Relativism by Patrick J.J. Phillips, most find relativism alluring for social reasons.
Because we want to be open and tolerant to people of different perspectives, different viewpoints,
and understanding, from different political spheres, different cultures, races, genders, and so on.
But if we jump into it, guns ablazing as the phrase goes, without sufficient philosophic
understanding first, one might hastily end up wielding relativism to an unlimited degree,
such that one takes the position that everything is relative. Even truth, yep, knowledge, truth,
reality, everything. And that's what we might call an extreme relativist. So while I personally
find those in the pursuit of tolerance, not just noble but necessary, I present extreme relativism
as a terrible strategy in that pursuit. Now it might sound kind of ridiculous right now,
like who would think that say oh I don't know that literal scientific facts are relative.
It does happen though, it did happen, and probably it still will happen. But we will explain in this
video how this weapon appears to become even that powerful as wielded by sophisticated relativists,
with seemingly good reasons. In any case, Robert Kirk, in a section of that red book that I have
here, took an unsophisticated version of that extreme relativist that's known as the true for
me relativist, or if you're fancy the protagorean relativist. Anyway, for that version of the extreme
relativist, there is no truth, there is just whatever is true for me or true for you. So what
counts as truth depends on the personal perspective of the speaker. Though at first it may have seemed
kind of funny, but we actually encounter people who hold this kind of belief at all levels of
society, not just in the philosophy classrooms, people use this to express their truths about
politics, religion, and even about literal states of the world, facts, and so on. From the newsroom
to the bar conversation, arguing over global warming, alternative medicine, or even if the
dragon eater sports team should have won the golden cup. True for me is often used to speak
without trying to offend others, or tell others that they are wrong for having a different position,
or perhaps just to hold on to what you believe despite evidence shown otherwise.
And I go over a few different reasons why people do this in that Robert Kirk video series, Episode
6. Now back in that last episode though, Episode 6, in that battle, Kirk shows that this position
of saying everything is just true for me or true for you, actually can't support the idea that
everything is relative. But also that in trying to defend against Kirk's attacks,
the extreme relativist also becomes further committed to a path that leads them to becoming
a solipsist. What is a solipsist? It's thinking that you're the only one that exists, that there
are no other minds, just one mind, just you. Everything else is just a presentation around you.
Please check out that last episode if you'd like to see how TFM, true for me, relativism
leads to solipsism. But from there Kirk does show that that too, solipsism, is a position that
doesn't support this assertion. And I thought that was a pretty cool philosophic move to do.
But then I made my own move to re-explain why true for me or TFM leads to solipsism in my own way.
And then that a solipsist's position isn't actually open and tolerant. That actually,
while you may have started out as a relativist for those good noble reasons of tolerance and openness
that I agree with, that if you stay committed to TFM and become a solipsist, it's actually closed
minded, selfish, intolerant position that denies the agency of others, and even defies the grasp
of the very concept of otherness. Instead of bringing understanding from different perspectives
together, they actually become a segregationist of sorts, preventing any real engagement with
otherness. Thus becoming exactly what they hate, opposing the very heart or organs of why they
wanted to be a relativist in the first place. Again, if you think that's kind of interesting,
and would like to see how all that happened, you can check out that series of videos here.
I'll put the links below in the description. And if you were or will be influenced by my
move made in that video, well, you know, even though this is a YouTube video and not an academic
source, you know, I'm just a shadowy nobody here, but please still credit that video in some way,
at least in the footnotes. It's about intellectual honesty, you know? Also, that way if I say anything
wrong and you're influenced by it, others will know why, and blame can also fall on my shoulders.
And hopefully that might bring some other philosophers to come battle me over it,
and surely one of us will learn something from that battle.
Anyway, that version of the relativist isn't actually the more powerful version that philosophers
battle against. So I ended up promising that we would go and move on to bigger,
better relativists, ones who are actually empowered by arguments from philosophers themselves.
Those five that I mentioned earlier are the ones that Paul O'Grady specifically notes.
For him, it's actually one of three tendencies that showed up in the different areas of philosophy,
pushing out this more modernized weapon. So here we are today looking at the imbuing of this power,
the three tendencies that includes ideas from these five philosophers.
Briefly, in Paul O'Grady's book, he has a general outline that looks like this.
Here we will find the philosophies that helped embolden these relativists and empower that
relativist weapon. This is what this video will cover now, the power. Here and here,
O'Grady draws the limits of relativism, at truth and rationality.
Now on logic, relativism is sort of allowed in the sense that it is allowed on a lower order,
but I will explain that later. Relativism, however, for O'Grady is allowed in ontology.
I find this much has to do with the basis of conceptual relativity,
but we won't be covering it for our purposes right now. Also, some relativization is allowed
in epistemology, but limited by the amount set out in chapter five, limits on relativism about
rationality. Today though, we'll go over some of that power, as I promised. It may seem kind of
quick though, because O'Grady seems more about wanting to point out the sources of this power
than actually getting into with examples what those sources really are that gave it the power,
so hopefully at times I can assist there. Also, don't worry if it's a bit fast. In each place,
each battle, later on that we cover, the philosophic arguments from the actual
philosophic thought is often addressed anyway, and sometimes the philosophers are other than these
five, but one in particular I will be doing myself in an additional video. To help explain so that
people really understand why simply thinking literalism or scientific physical descriptions
is not actually strong enough to oppose this relativist, whose weapon has been empowered
by these five philosophers. After that, we'll move on to talk about each of the chapters that
include the limits of relativism and the battles therein, so this part, power, may not have much
battle itself, but it is a look at that weapon that will be in play in the battles hereafter.
Finally, after all this, I will give my overall evaluation of the book, and maybe then I'll
touch on some of the chapters that I left out. So, let's get to it.
Philosophy battle, the most entertaining presentation of philosophy you'll ever find on the internet,
probably. Now, entering the battlefield of metaphysics.
Oh, light switch. Oh, uh, I'm gonna keep this off.
Hmm, whoa.
That's better. Here is Paul O'Grady. That's not really him. That's just an image I made.
Support me on Patreon, or make a direct contribution to me on Paypal, who will give us
a little history lesson that will lead us to explaining the powers of this weapon. And to
be clear, as he says it in his preface, he's more going to cover this topic in an analytic tradition
than a continental one. And also, he's not going to be covering Einstein, which doesn't really
have to do with what we're talking about here. Anyway, let's begin. Long ago in the land before
time. Oh, okay, wait. That was just me, not him. Listen, whenever I'm speaking for O'Grady,
it will be sited down to the line on the bottom of the screen, unless I say otherwise. That way,
you know I make up nothing. And if I misinterpreted anything, you know exactly which line I didn't
do justice. Also, you will know that when I do say something from my own opinion, or my own
information offered here, you won't misinterpret it as if he were saying it, because then the citation
will just disappear when it's me talking. Okay? That's how we roll in philosophy battle. Citation
down to the line. But on the other hand, while I am citing everything down to the line, it will be
my interpretation or my paraphrasing of what is being said, unless of course I actually put it
up in quotes on the screen. And it might be shifted just a tiny bit in order to make sense
for this video. Anyway, in the 20th century, there was the linguistic turn in philosophy.
Oh, wait. So this happened in large part because of a guy named Frega, who kind of tried to make a
more scientific or math-like perfect language to do philosophy in. It kind of looked like this.
And hopefully we can talk about Frega at length later. But anyway, cruelly crunched down for you
guys now, basically traditional discussions about what is knowledge turned into what can we say is
true. And from that to how can sentences about the world, i.e. propositions, be true. And how do
they relate to each other? What even counts as a proposition? Doesn't all information need to be
in some sort of language? And if the world is made up of information, is there an inherent
language of reality? Or on the other hand, isn't language a tool of communicating among different
people? And so this linguistic turn led to a social turn because language brings into the
account of the social context that the language is created in. And because there are different
societies previously stable philosophical concepts about truth, meaning, ontology, knowledge,
they became unstable. To be clear, I'm dealing not with moral relativism, what's right and wrong,
good or bad. I'm interested in cognitive relativism. Relativism about things like truth,
reality, and knowledge. Everything that isn't aesthetics, like tastes or beauty and art,
or morals, ethics, right and wrong. So in my terminology, the opposite of relativism is absolutism.
So phorogradie relativism is the opposite of absolutism, just as the subjective would be
opposite to objective. Just keep that in mind in case an imperfect philosopher uses the term
objective as opposite relative instead, as is my preference, I tend to do this. But anyway,
saying something is relative is saying that it comes from or is determined or dependent on something
else. For example, saying something is big, big relative to what, to me or to an ant, or to the
planet Uranus. Big is a relative term that depends on something else here. Something absolute is
independent and doesn't require a relationship to anything else. Ogrady then describes three
traditions that in the beginning seemed more unified, that later split with little contact in
between them. He describes them as the English-based tradition of Russell, Wittgenstein,
Ryle, and Austin, the American-based tradition of James, Lewis, Quine, and Putnam. And while they
had little contact with each other, they pretty much practically completely left alone the Husserl,
Heidegger, Sacha Derrida tradition, which Ogrady doesn't call that tradition by any particular
geographical name, but I would guess on that basis he would call it the continental tradition
therefore. Yet some tendencies began to emerge among all sides and aided in the rise of cognitive
relativism. Relativism about even those things. Here are three of those tendencies that started
emerging independently from different places. Rejecting the theory-practice dichotomy,
rejecting the fact-value dichotomy, and framework ideas, which come from those five philosophers.
So first let's deal with rejecting the theory-practice dichotomy.
In ancient times, morals, morality was just as much a part of the world in how the world is.
With technological and scientific advancement studying nature though,
it left behind questions of behavior and human conduct. The investigation of nature
actually pulled apart from that of morality. The discussions of nature became disconnected
to that of morals. A split appeared in the kinds of knowledge we had. On the one hand,
we had the objective, reliable nature. On the other hand, we had the subjective moral,
society, and religion. So there was a realm of the world that existed independent of us,
that science investigated, and the human world that was dependent on us. Philosophical
conceptions developing from this reflected that split between a world independent of human input,
as reality, and a world dependent on human beings like morals, ethics, and behavior.
And he says what I suppose as it was taken at the time, that genuine knowledge is knowledge
of that which is there independent of our knowing of it, knowledge of what was there anyway.
Human knowledge is an effort to adequately capture or represent this reality. Philosophers working
within this built the conception of primary and secondary qualities. This is going to sound a
lot like the legendary John Locke now. Primary qualities were aspects of reality that were
independent of human cognition, like shape, motion, and mass. Things that are taken to be
there as they are even if no minds were around to perceive them. And then there were secondary
qualities like color, sounds, and so on. Things that are dependent on our awareness of them.
So like vibrations in the air hitting my eardrum, technically doesn't need to invoke consciousness,
but actually hearing sound does. To this day these appear to many as fundamentally different
things. Like the difference between the mind actually seeing the color red is thought to be
fundamentally different, koalia, than the mere detection of say 430 terahertz on the wavelength
of the electromagnetic spectrum. So one set of phenomena was part of the furniture of the world
itself and the other are products of human receptivity and dependent on human cognition.
Now it was taken to be that investigations of nature, while helpful to make technology that
can be used for certain purposes by our society, that the actual investigation of nature itself
was still nevertheless pure for the sake of truth itself. So you know they felt it was still
objective that sure we made technology and make use of knowledge for different things depending
on our society based on the particular parts of the world we're in or in different periods of
history with certain levels of technology and advancement let's say, but at least practicing
the method of gaining knowledge of nature itself, practicing science was still objective. But then
this came under attack from different areas in the 20th century. Scientists are members of society too
like anyone else influenced by fashion, economics, politics, social status, etc and also science itself
doesn't actually turn out to be so clear a systemic progression in its study with rules and
methods as it turns out. History in fact shows us that it's actually full of chance and lucky
screw-ups. But so what? One may say that despite still living in a messy human world,
scientists are still able to pull out the goods, unpolluted absolute conception of reality.
As in the sentiments, yeah maybe how and why we get the knowledge is relative to the time and
society we're in but still like the knowledge itself was still objective right? Well to that
Paulo Grady says there's still a bigger challenge, a massive skeptical challenge. The sentiments that
if such a pure dehumanized picture of reality is the goal of inquiry, how can we ever reach it?
Surely we would inevitably infect it with human subjectivity in our efforts to grasp it.
Imagine knowledge is like a snowball or something super soft and we live in a blind world. To know
it we would have to grab it but by grabbing it we change sort of what it is. We forced our
impression onto it. We can't really know what it is on grasp. It's always going to be affected,
not just in order to observe it but by observing it, by conceptualizing it, by knowing it.
Things can't be observed without a perspective from which we perceive. So how could anything be
known in ways beyond a particular perspective? One might feel well we will never really have
knowledge then of reality itself. It will always be infected by us therefore.
Now there's also a different conception of objectivity which is inter-subjectivity.
That is the objective is just that which the reasonable people agree upon. Well I'm not
gonna touch this for now but I just want to note there's much to say about this to think of later
on but anyway still even with this conception it involves that for them while we do get in touch
with a reality independent of human thought but mediated via human thought. Now what this has to
do with relativism is that reality can be mediated in different ways. Representations of the same
objective reality can be different depending on the concepts we use to think about it.
Different features of reality come to the fore as we deploy different sets of concepts to deal with
it. Quoting here, philosophers from different traditions such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger,
and William James came to hold versions of this view which are framework ideas but O'Grady will
talk about them later more closely. In any case this all goes against the idea that our practice
or doing science or anything is somehow not altered by our theories or our concepts which
are relative to the type of creatures we are, how much we already know, what we are still ignorant of,
what time and place our society is based in etc and therefore from different societies it would
mean differences in our practice and concepts. But I think this issue is being kind of muddled
within next failing dichotomy so let's look at that now. Rejecting the fact value dichotomy.
The idea of facts is connected to the idea of an absolute conception of reality as if they are
independent, objective, solid, reliable, and is contrasted with the subjective,
unreliable things like feelings and desires. One of the big changes is the idea of value
no longer being inherently in certain things, like gold, but instead something we project
onto certain things, a way human beings have been coloring the facts. So we could split language
into a descriptive vocabulary that just says what the facts are and an evaluated vocabulary
that reports how we feel about those facts. This is a fact value split. Facts are supposed to exist
as if independently of the mind, but in order for a human to know a fact it has to be conceptualized
by the human mind. We dress the world in concepts in order to think of it. The world doesn't
automatically conceptualize itself. Throughout our own history we've created concepts to help
describe the world and the concepts we create pick out the things we are interested in. For
example we use concepts related to our senses, take color. We had color concepts only for the part of
the visual spectrum that we can see before learning about light and how much bigger the spectrum is,
there were no concepts to discriminate the spectrum beyond what we saw. So before we may have only
thought about you know red, green, and blue, yellow, etc. we didn't even have the concepts to
differentiate between say infrared and ultraviolet for example until after we learned more about light.
With this we can still say that there are facts that are either true or false,
but what counts as a fact also depends in part on us. Both in whether we have concepts to describe
it but also if it even fits with everything else that we already know. We can decide if something
counts as a fact or not if it fits with everything else we already know about the world. Our decision
on saying something as a fact is therefore based on a number of considerations that are actually
value laden. Value laden which means something like soaked in our values, soaked or endowed with
our interests. Interests like whether or not it makes our theories more simple, coheres with the
facts, allows for greater generalizations, etc. Things that will help us make further predictions.
These things aren't in the facts themselves, they're values where human interests enter the picture.
Now this alone doesn't make a fact subjective, just what counts as an
objective fact isn't independent of the subjective mind. So there's actually two pictures here,
an old picture where the world exists totally independent of the human mind constructing
anything and the mind merely mirrors that. And now a more recent picture where the mind is in
some way to some degree constructing the world that we live in. So this more recent picture
allows for describing the world in multiple ways since people could have different values,
thus their accounts of the facts will differ. Now anti-relativists will want to say it can't be
varied all that much, there's a limit to how different they can be and we can work towards
unifying a picture of reality. But the relativists focus more on the differences themselves,
that they can't unify different versions of the world. And one of the ways that they do this
is by using the idea that the world is mediated through a structure that yields different accounts
of reality to us relative to that structure. And different terms are used by the relativists
for this structure such as conceptual scheme, paradigm, linguistic framework, and language
games. Oh sorry, I didn't mean to make that sound too spooky. I'm actually laughing with joy
because paradigms and language games are two that I feel reasonably comfortable talking about.
And the latter is often spooky because of its misunderstanding and again which I feel I can
contribute to getting rid of that misunderstanding and misconstruing. But don't worry now,
O'Grady is going to explain how these other philosophers framework ideas, oh okay oh well
I guess we're going straight to the slide this time. So now O'Grady is going to quickly cover
some philosophers because he's more so trying to show the similarity in what he calls framework ideas
in all of them rather than actually go into depth explaining and giving details of their
philosophies. Some of it may then therefore seem unclear to you right now but just focus on what a
framework idea is generally even if you're unclear about a specific philosopher's version.
In any case I'm here for y'all to help fill in some of what might be missing and hopefully a
faithful way anyway. Let's start. C.I. Lewis American philosopher C.I. Lewis was influenced
by Immanuel Kant's idea that there was a division of knowledge between the given and that which
processes the given to be understood by us I guess. Whoa wait a minute maybe we should stop early.
I realize Kant seems very much to be the backdrop behind a lot of this so I'm going to give a sort
of one of my visualizations of this kind of philosophic picture here. In this picture the
unprocessed reality outside what is currently grasped by the mind would be the sort of indistinct
undifferentiated gray mush but really I can't even say it's gray I can't even say it's mush
I can't say anything about it I can only say things about what I do perceive and this stuff
is beyond perception but whatever it be if it be at all it then be processed by our minds
through these things called categories of understanding to produce the familiar perceptions
that we do have so there's a difference between reality or the pure world in itself you could say
or maybe we would just make up a new word for it like numina and then there's our perception of
the world as we perceive it that reality is processed filtered and shaped by our categories of
understanding aspects of our mind we cut up things to understand the world as the kind of creatures
we are that results in our perceptions what we might call phenomena and I talk more about how
this relates to relativists in my bonus episode for episode 6 where I first introduced this kind of
image so it would be lovely if you do check that out in fact you might get to appreciate the powers
of this philosophic weapon and the sophisticated relativist position to some degree just from
that bonus video alone so again please do check out episode 6 I know it has a lot of parts to it
but hey it's a fun journey so anyway the basic idea for our purposes here is that there is an
input from outside our mind and then some processing of the mind happens of whatever that outside
input is in order to even perceive what we do and those perceptions are what we would call
observation in this sense we don't actually directly observe reality it's like we have
spectacles on so O'Grady is saying that lewis was influenced by this sort of picture which I made
sort of loosely generally based on Immanuel Kant but lewis was also influenced by pragmatists
emphasizing the relation of thoughts to action you know actually doing things ah good old pragmatics
that things have value only if they're useful to us to actually do things or survive it's the
spice of american style philosophy he fused both of these into a position that also denies the theory
practice dichotomy and the fact value dichotomy he thought of philosophy as investigating these
categories that we use to think about the world denying that the world conceptualizes itself
instead the way we think about reality is socially and historically shaped concepts the
meanings that are shared by human beings are a product of human interaction with the world
theory is infected by practice and facts are shaped by values concepts structure our experience
and reflect our interests attitudes and needs think about that talk about light going from
colors we normally see to now even including ultra violent violent ultra violet and infrared
or even and if you're big into history you might get a kick out of this but blue was not
recognized as a unique color concept until practical societal reasons came about more often in our
cross cultural history we find the color concept that combines what we now consider green and blue
but as it seems to me the most popular theory goes that we only began to use the color concept of
blue uniquely after we became capable of making blue pigment in ancient egypt a color which was
otherwise very rare in nature itself and perhaps it's just that blue did not require being uniquely
identified prior to that anyway back to lewis though the categories we use aren't from reality
itself but reflect enduring human interests in that way reality is relative to a system of concepts
the world as we know it is shaped by the concepts we use to interpret it experience though governs
which system of concepts we use in respect to which ones are successful faulty and useless
concepts lead to bad predictions and unsuccessful courses of action it's come to my attention
that i may want to make something clear here even though i have already said it but i'm gonna
say it again but i'm not saying this gray mush is what's actually there that reality is actually
gray mush really i don't know if it's gray and i don't know if it's mush it's just that i can't
say or talk about it at all and cons categories make it even difficult to even say that it is
so there are different ways to interpret this that we will talk about later especially if we
cover chapter 3 on ontology and i don't really know lewis directly actually i only know what
ogready says about him here but he does say much later on in a different chapter that lewis
nevertheless does take the given as data of the senses upon which we build knowledge so this is
just what it seems to me right now but it's more simply the eyes do very much still pick up this
visual light input let's say but whatever this light reflections mean to us in order for it to
mean anything in order for it to even be information in a sense at all it has to do with our concepts
so this is as it appears or is given but then it's still the concepts that cut it up meaningfully
so really there is all this then we have say a concept of saying something is edible and that
cuts this out and of course therefore i guess a concept of the non edible and maybe we have the
concept of things from nature and also things that are constructed from and for humans and
then we have concepts to identify colors so it's really that concepts are cutting up all this
information that there is from the given and for lewis those concepts themselves are a social
product certainly children are taught to recognize the type of things that are edible and not and
certainly children go through a process of recognizing the type of things that are just
there in nature and the kind of things that humans must have made these concepts came into
being and survived among any number of concepts because they help us survive or accomplish goals
ourselves so that's my example of what's going on here i bring this up just to be clear that with
both of these the given or input doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't something if anything
scientifically it is nigh infinite information in a sense if there even is such a thing as
information at that stage and it isn't simply just gray mush i'm just visualizing it like that
that whatever is presented to the mind cannot be thought of or talked about or even recognized
without concepts to cut it up out of the rest of everything else that's just one interpretation
of what's going on but don't worry about it too much right now we're just trying to grasp this idea
that we're actually contributing to what we observe anyway so the framework idea for lewis
are systems of categories by which we mediate reality to ourselves for lewis these categories
are almost as much as social product shaped by our society as language itself is this is kind of
different from earlier contos categories appeared to be an attempt at more of a universal description
of how the human mind must conceptualize reality in order to understand it but from lewis these
categories are socially constructed from our social environment that you are in while lewis
really didn't talk much about how this would mean that there could be different sets of categories
therefore he has acknowledged the possibility on occasion and we can see that different categories
would mean that the world as it appears to us would be different in a sense according to different
societies if a different society can lead to different categories that leads to different
ways the world appears to us as at least what we can say about what we observe peaking out or even
recognizing only certain things we have the concepts our society has provided to pick out or
recognize but anyway there is no unmediated access to reality itself and the only curbs on the system
of categories would be pragmatic ones for lewis so possibly having different sets of socially
constructed categories that's what ogready calls lewis's framework idea a presentation of the world
comes with it a certain set of categories from which it was processed a framework now let's move to
rudolf karnapp
sharing a lot of the same sources with lewis german philosopher rudolf karnapp articulated
his framework idea of linguistic frameworks that was super relativistic he was also influenced
by kant thinking that our knowledge is a result of some kind of processing and shared the idea of
pragmatic value of applying one's knowledge but he was also influenced much by science as that
which constitute actual knowledge and as a force therefore to get rid of metaphysical and theological
fake knowledge this is a kind of deflationist view of philosophy where instead of talking about
things like truth and reality philosophies suggest clarify meanings for scientists doing that too
may have seemed itself another discussion of philosophical truths but when it came to certain
things in philosophy like what is really real these kind of questions seemed unanswerable
in a way that questions and science could be answered so instead philosophers suggest focus
on investigating and creating these models which are like languages and systems where one can
calculate and identify things with clear meanings logical implications and criteria for confirmation
so that scientists can then go on and actually do the research using these models this was to
deflate philosophical questions into merely practical choices of which model scientists wanted to use
so central to karnapp's project is this notion of frameworks frameworks for karnapp outline all
the rules using the terms and relations between the terms so number terms can be introduced
and have a relationship or rules based on that relationship within the framework of math let's
say so for example in my interpretation of this it means that five seven and two within the framework
of math five has a relationship to seven being a difference of two you can add two to five and get
seven or subtract two from seven and get five those terms have a relationship and they are clear
in the framework of math relative to that framework questions about numbers are easy these kind of
questions about the relationships like what is nine plus eight they are internal questions questions
that presuppose the existence of such a framework to get an answer relative to the framework
internal questions are uncontroversially answerable and there are different frameworks to discuss
different kinds of things physical objects properties or spatial temporal objects do numbers
really exist do properties really exist karnapp calls these external questions
because they are outside the context of a linguistic framework such questions are improper
because the choice of framework is pragmatically decided on if it is useful to speak of numbers
then such a framework will be used if it is useful to speak of properties then that framework will
be used the only appropriate external questions are ones about the expediency of using a framework
or not so pretty much within this linguistic frameworks questions are answered easily within
the structure of that framework but to try to step outside a framework and discuss it itself the only
meaningful question here is if that framework is useful us to use right now or not but still
this can lead to a huge number of frameworks so karnapp points to a kind of natural selection
akin to biology to how we come to use particular ones reducing how varied they can be but even
with natural selection there's still a lot open here for relativists but let's leave that there
for now karnapp will come up again in the battle and we will cover again sort of what the idea is
so anyway that's what ogready calls karnapp's framework idea and now for lw Ludwig Wittgenstein
he's probably the most important developer of framework ideas of the 20th century and is well
known for making two influential philosophies whoa wait a minute uh so to be honest with you
i do not think this section is very good at explaining what wittgenstein's framework idea is
even less so than any of the other philosophers the framework idea of language games has less time
devoted to it than the other things and yet it's very important to grasp this idea in particular
especially considering ogready himself thinks he's the most important contributor to it but
also it could be very helpful for us in the future as well so i want to make clear it's not that
paul ogready has gotten wittgenstein wrong in this section or that ogready cannot do a better job
at explaining him or isn't so much smarter than me but that this particular section doesn't really
explain what a language game really is and how it leads to the other points that ogready brings up
so i will do that myself explain it in a separate video a video that's just off the cuff you know
not cited from the top of my head just me trying to explain with examples what language games are
and how it connects to the points that ogready is going to be bringing up for the purposes of
just getting the idea out there to move on but hey maybe it could also be a great standalone video
if you've kind of forgotten what wittgenstein's language games were kind of about at least until
i do make a proper video since we definitely will get into wittgenstein properly one day and i promise
to give away all my secret stash of important citation everything cited down to the line like
i normally do you know even back to his blue and brown books where we will find a cheat code okay
but for now let's see what ogready does say anyway ogready tells us that wittgenstein had two
influential philosophies one presented in his tractatis logical philosophicus that articulates
what essentially language is you know its essence and the picturing relation between language and
reality now ogready doesn't say what he thinks wittgenstein said is the essence of language
but i think it's simply that it has this picturing relationship that language is that which corresponds
to reality like a picture does with words and a proposition having the same relationship to
each other as the objects that they pick out or stand for in the world the other philosophy later
in life his latter philosophy is presented in his philosophical investigations and it actually critiques
a lot of what was said in that first account rejecting the idea that language has a particular
essence and that philosophy shouldn't focus on advancing theses but be a kind of therapy to
help clarify language instead of having a single determinant language language is comprised of
many language games now i'm just gonna read like six lines and tell you what i think of them
a language game is a complex whole of verbal usage and associated activities words simply
don't label or stand for objects but relate to each other and the world in highly complex ways
words are like tools there are many different kinds performing many different kinds of activities
therefore there are many different language games and many different associated forms of life the
kinds of activities associated with the language game the language games are governed by grammatical
rules rules of grammar prescribe the modes of representation by which the world is represented
to us oh super clear isn't it no look i don't think old gradie is wrong but only because i
actually studied vikenshine but also i haven't forgotten what's wrong with talking about vikenshine
like this in part because i haven't forgotten what it was like as a young philosopher that was
unfamiliar i think this could to someone less familiar make vikenshine seem complicated or
even mystical in some sense neither of which is true the last lines in particular could seem to
imply something radical like what you say changes the world itself that reality as commonly taken
is literally changing when you change what you say that's kind of extreme if you think about that
kind of picture and not at all what vikenshine's about though it's hard to say but also to deny
what vikenshine's actual metaphysical position really is because he himself won't do that since
his philosophy aims to stop speaking metaphysically in such a manner in the first place but if you
insist to be unfaithful to his philosophy there is still a cheat code in the blue and brown books
like i said that i can give you later so subscribe in any case i can imagine someone reading this
and just feeling like or whatever just another philosopher using a bunch of words together to
obfuscate their position to appear deep and complicated but it's just vague nonsense jargon
so this is why i believe my video becomes necessary for anyone who hasn't studied
vikenshine's language games already because you're not going to get a good sense of it from
ogredi despite what it may seem like other actual philosophers say for someone new and not familiar
with the kind of concepts that philosophers use all the time this really isn't easy text and i
definitely think kirks book was probably much more palatable to somebody new in any case there
are a couple of more things that ogredi does point out about language games vikenshine's
framework idea that are important so let's cover them ogredi points out three things and two of
them are that vikenshine emphasized that it was important not to conflate one language game with
another or to think that there are super language games that govern all others ogredi also points
out that there is a quite popular use of vikenshine's idea was to try to defend religious belief
against rationalistic critique by claiming that religion is its own language game and that it is
illicit to use criteria from another language game usually science to challenge it but as it is
always really important to point out this is not to say that vikenshine himself espoused such views
again as i said that he didn't mean and likely didn't want his philosophy to be used by extreme
relativists especially considering how he was trying to be anti-philosophy in his own way but
his views lent themselves to such use ogredi then talks about how in uncertainty vikenshine's latest
writings that vikenshine does seem to have this image of a riverbed with a bedrock below to kind
of represent even how in a language game there are beliefs that we're willing to change more easily
and fluidly and some more deeply entrenched which are likely bedrock at the bottom of a river but
that even those can change just at a much slower rate ogredi brings us up to kind of say how it's
this bedrock beliefs that are the framework upon which the fluid beliefs depend and that this for
ogredi is also used to say the framework may alter and indeed there may be alternative frameworks
but really he didn't need to bring that up at all i think the fact that there are different
language games is enough to see how vikenshine's philosophy empowers the relativists in fact as
far as i've seen the issue of whether the bedrock can change from within a language game isn't a
discussion that the relativists using this weapon even bother with it's seemingly to me always a
discussion about how there are differing language games but maybe i'm missing something as to why
he felt this was important to bring up i mean i guess there's another argument to how there can
be different frameworks but really the language game argument not the bedrocks can change argument
is ultimately what's taken to be the power that is imbued into this weapon from vikenshine now i
do wish ogredi would have done don't think look more which is give more examples for us to actually
look at in many places in his book but as i said in the beginning of the video paul ogredi does seem
to be more concerned with pointing out the sources of the powers of this weapon rather than actually
explaining what the sources are which is why i said i would try to hopefully fill that gap and bear
that responsibility myself so again please do go check out that video that i will be making i will
definitely be more clearly explaining what the idea of a language game is and i will explain why
we would be against the idea of a super language game and why we shouldn't mix language games as
well as how these kind of vikenshinean philosophers may be in a tight spot sometimes if one is trying
to stay faithful to his philosophy while explaining it anyway please check out that video so now i'm
gonna give things back to ogredi who will talk about w v quine w v quine was one of the earliest
to popularize the phrase conceptual scheme the conceptual scheme is revisable but there is no
neutral position to talk about the world is to apply some conceptual scheme to it from childhood
growing up we learn the conceptual scheme and as we learn more the conceptual scheme gets refined
and right now science is the best as the most inclusive scheme that covers everything that
exists it is the best to understand the world and predict changes in it but borrowing the term
language game from vikenshine quine says that there are other kinds of language use for poetry or
fiction for example and they are used to see the world in a different way imaginary worlds so of
course they'd have different conceptual schemes which is fine but what if it's the same world like
the real world can we nevertheless have different conceptual schemes well it seems there's enough
in quine to say yeah for sure for example he believes that all beliefs can in fact be changed
that none are unchangeable and absolute that there are no a priori beliefs for quine but
what that even means could use some further detail but it's in a different chapter that again i'm
not sure if i'm gonna cover exact but also he did believe in under determination of theory by fact
which is to say that any set amount of evidence could support more than one theory so with my
famous example i used in the map of philosophy of science video check it out if you have time
there i used an example of dots on a graph that i give with the dots representing observations
or even what counts as evidence for any certain amount of dots can support more than one theory
of what the shape the dots are making and in fact no amount of dots will ever fully guarantee
only one shape or theory that could fit it so it would be like quine does believe that even
in dealing with the real world people could nevertheless have different conceptual schemes
these two things that all our beliefs can change so our conceptual scheme can change
and that we can have different theories based off the same observation
thus different conceptual schemes while based in the real world would make quine fertile ground
for relativists but we'll talk later in chapter three whether that's actually his position or not
chapter three chapter three well okay so we can stop with that look i don't know if we're
really gonna be covering that what okay fine we'll see anyway ogready is calling quine's
conceptual scheme which is like our best theory of the world that we use to make sense of the
world which can change and can be different quine's framework idea now finally drop that
quine hold on a philosopher and historian uh science ts cune helped relativists in a big way
his notion of paradigms not paradigms became influential well beyond philosophy of science
a paradigm is a context within which scientific inquiry proceeds like assumptions training methods
standards goals methods of experimentation again ogready doesn't provide examples even
in places where they would be super helpful but i would just say maybe it would be helpful to imagine
a newtonian paradigm let's say versus an einsteinian paradigm you know a paradigm of relativity or
now say a quantum physics paradigm they characterize a scientific community at a stable period but a
crisis can happen that lead to a new paradigm the paradigms themselves though are supposedly
incommensurable paradigms create their own context within which it rationally operates
so one can't rationally judge or decide between them here's where i think there's some leftover
blood soaked soil of the positivists that have us thinking of it like that which i mentioned in that
map episode but yeah think of it as in that evidence is interpreted through a paradigm so
then it isn't evidence that's actually deciding between paradigms we can't evaluate the evidence
without a paradigm first so each paradigm judges itself and one cannot judge a paradigm from another
based on evidence itself now i have actually created two videos on kuhn already one video is
kuhn's response in his own words to those that contrast him with his predecessor the great champion
carl popper so it gives i think a decent outline of what kuhn's position is but also i made a
video explaining in much more detail how it is specifically his philosophy that allowed these
relativists therefore to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science using his philosophy
of paradigm shifts and crises if you're interested please check them out the second video can be a
bit spooky it's called the gates of hell but uh i'm just being dramatic don't worry hell isn't
really involved in any case it's these philosophers that are the big names of whose philosophies are
similar enough in terms of a framework idea to be pressed into a single weapon and a nearly
supremely powerful position the relativists takes wielding this great weapon framework ideas from
them developed from very different places of the world and was one of the three big trends that
brought forth this weapon into the modern philosophic battle according to ogrady but i think he is
missing a couple of other things namely that there's also a lot of scientific discoveries that led to
similar beliefs about how what we perceive isn't objective reality that it is shaped by the type
of creatures that we are with the faculties that we have brain science shows all the ways we filter
out non-essential information and what counts as essential again has to do with our evolved
histories as human beings again such as what kind of colors we can see in the light spectrum and even
many people's beliefs and interpretation of what quantum physics supposedly shows us evidence for
that our act of observing itself affects the observed not that i believe that interpretation
but it is one that many more people have been taking on because of quantum physics of course
though ogrady is talking about philosophy but i do think philosophical conversation is obviously
being influenced by discoveries and technological advancement in science in modern times as much
as it was in his own little history lesson given to us here describing the separation of nature and
morals the battle so we may find ourselves up against an enemy wielding this weapon in an
extreme position let's say because we are endorsing the use of science to decide on the role of
vaccines the reality of global warming or the age of the earth we can actually believe that this
position of wielding this weapon to an extreme degree of thinking everything is relative was
created not because they are evil and want to attack science we may believe that they are actually
sincere in their honest virtuous morals of pursuing tolerance and open-mindedness of people of
different perspectives and a weary of western imperialist thinking of having used claims of
rationality and logic and scientific advancement as a reason to oppress and invalidate others of
non-western belief systems but of course it's that same extreme position that can be used to
defend attacks from science against the intolerant abusive tyrannical belief systems that will say
science is just relative so it cannot be used to attack their abusive beliefs that aren't grounded
in reality but dogma and deep rooted insecurities like misogyny or homophobia so taking this weapon
as if it were infinitely powerful isn't in the best interest of even those who are primordially
interested in a more tolerant social world and there is real world evidence cases about this
but we'll talk about them later in any case we as good warriors on the philosophic battlefield
should wonder how if i do come up against an enemy wielding this weapon to an extreme degree
enough to attack science claims to truth or rationality let's say then how am i supposed to
beat them when i want to say something is science when i want to say something is the truth when i
want to say something makes rational sense so think about it against this enemy i cannot just
take something out of my pocket and say see this is the objective thing here it's not relative
because everything i say is merely relative to a language game i can't show any evidence either
because evidence is relative to a paradigm and i can't even show any observation of anything
because all observations are structured relative to our conceptual scheme there isn't anything i
can produce anything i can offer that cannot be attacked by this enemy so it's difficult to figure
out how can i beat this enemy when they can attack anything i show them if i say objects or reality
they can even say that those are just in fact words relative to a language game
even if i try to be very clear that i mean mind independent reality they can still attack that
and say whatever mind independent reality even means is structured by a conceptual scheme tied
to particular social groups that make use of such conceptual structures thus hastily concluding that
reality is relative so yes it is incredibly frustrating trying to deal with this kind of enemy
who will continually attack constantly so i want you to remember this situation facing an enemy
that will always attack no matter what is shown how can you win think of it for yourself first
do you see a way we could deal with this kind of enemy can you come up with a cool move or a
counter think about it before we get to the next video where we will cover what paul o'grady does
on the battlefield choosing specific areas to defend against charges of relativism this weapon
however made by philosophers is being wielded to attack science not by philosophers themselves
but by sociologists who used coom to enter onto the battlefield of the philosophy of science in
order to attack it and these sociologists do not understand this weapon well enough to grasp the
dangers if it is used as if unlimited they only know its power to attack the attempt to speak with
authority not the limits which we unlike them will learn in the next videos once we learn that
this weapon does in fact have limits and the dangers that happens when those limits are crossed
we will then return back to the battlefield of the philosophy of science where they had these
science wars the battlefield from where i came in this journey and then we will take on this
particular group of sociologists that are attacking science or those influenced by them called
the ssk who started the science wars so if you would like an account of what led to the science
wars and who are these ssk please watch my video buru sociology as paul o'grady now prepares for
battle himself against this extreme relativists presented in the next video one that attempts
to make a few attacks on objectivity by proclaiming that even truth is relative
