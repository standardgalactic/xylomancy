Checking Appalachian Junction/Ep 26 Installing floor trusses and subfloor!.txt
1. The speaker has been waiting for floor trusses, which were delayed by about a week due to design issues. During this wait, they took delivery of other materials that had already been ordered and didn't want to reschedule. These trusses arrived on August 30th.

2. To make the best use of the waiting period, the speaker decided to relocate their burning operation to a spot further down the hill. This area is potentially zoned for a 40 by 60 shop, and they plan to continue the driveway and create a 40 by 40 parking area there. An outbuilding that was previously at their house has been moved to this new area for trailer, camper, and equipment storage.

3. The trusses were mostly set in place the previous night, and despite an issue with a block out that needed adjustment, they were able to modify the truss to fit properly. The notch was cut to accommodate the non-structural portion of the truss that serves as a nailer for drywall.

4. The floor trusses were fully set, and the subfloor was almost completed by the end of August 31st. The plan is to start erecting walls on the first day of September, which is the following day.

5. The speaker notes some historical trivia, mentioning that it's the "first day of September Hadley" and jokingly says goodbye for the day with a playful reference to the Florida Gators ("Bye bye. Say bye bye. See you later. Later Gators.").
