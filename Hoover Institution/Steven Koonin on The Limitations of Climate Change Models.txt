Okay, since this is a policy-oriented gathering, I thought the best thing I could do as a scientist
was to lay out some of the factual context for climate and the closely related subject
of energy.
So if you listen to most of the political dialogue and certainly the media, what you
hear is that climate science compels us to make large and rapid reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions, take climate action immediately and on a large scale.
And that is driven by the fact that global greenhouse gas emissions have been rising
at about one and a half percent a year.
The UN says that we need to get to net zero emissions by thirty years from now in order
to, quote, avoid the worst effects of climate change.
And they have various trajectories of emissions going forward.
Do I have a pointer, by the way?
I guess not.
As you can see there, emissions would have to go to zero by 2050 or so if we are to keep
the global temperature rise to one and a half degrees above pre-industrial.
You think about policy required to implement something like that, and they have to strike
a balance.
On the one side we've got the certainties and uncertainties of climate science, and
I was amused to hear during the banking talk yesterday the reverence with which physics
and chemistry are treated in terms of the precision and certainty of their understanding.
It's very much not the case.
And the hazards and the risks of a changing climate, and on the other side as we'll see
the world's growing demand for reliable, affordable, and clean energy.
Striking that balance is about policy.
You have to fold in values and priorities, environment versus development, tolerance
for risk, equity across north-south and across generations, and really do any of the responses
that you might make in policy make a difference and how much will they cost.
And of course it's in the center box that I expect most of you are interested and focused.
So I want to take you through some of the considerations involved in striking that balance in the form
of three high-level statements.
The first is that the notion of a climate crisis, which you hear so often, has scant
scientific support.
The climate today is not broken, and fears of future catastrophes depend on extreme
emission scenarios that are fed into models that are entirely unsuited to the task.
And so if we act too rapidly and in an ill-thought-through way, we will incur a greater threat to human
well-being than climate change itself.
And of course I'm going to show you data and trends that support these statements.
The second is that if you advocate for rapid or overly rapid global decarbonization, you've
got a moral issue, which I will try to elucidate.
And the third is if you try to decarbonize too rapidly at the national level, it's going
to be disruptive, expensive, and will ultimately degrade national security.
Let me start with a definition first.
Weather is not climate.
Climate is the long-term average, typically 30 years, of the properties of weather.
And that's nicely illustrated by this chart, which shows about a 900-year-long record of
the annual height of the Nile River measured during the summer minimum in Cairo.
The Egyptians, of course, cared a lot about the height of the Nile, as did the people
who were ruling Egypt in any given time.
And what you see when you look at this graph, the blue values are the annual values, is
that there's a lot of up and down from year to year.
One year it could be up at almost six meters, and the next year or so it's down at two
meters or one meter.
So that's whether it happens year to year.
The second is if you look at the 30-year average, which is the red line, you can see that it
also goes up and down a lot.
And if you were alive during the first 150 years of this record, you would see the annual
minimum going down and down, and no doubt some medieval Egyptian climate panel would
be screaming new normal, new normal, and recommending prayers and sacrifice.
In fact, the climate varies a lot on its own.
Human influencers were entirely absent during this time.
And if they had just waited a couple hundred years after 700, you see it comes back up
quite a lot.
So you can get fooled a lot by year to year variability or by variability over decades.
And untangling the response to human influences from this natural variability of the climate
system is something that is a major challenge in the science these days.
We do it a lot in the media.
The media entirely misrepresent the science.
Here's a little vignette.
NASA Press release in March of 2020.
The Guardian used newspaper in the U.K. in December 2019.
Headline, Greenland's ice sheet is melting seven times faster than in the 1990s.
And if you look in the text of the article, the rate of ice loss has risen from 33 billion
tons a year in the 90s to 254 billion tons a year in the past decade.
That's a true statement.
But if you look at it in context, it carries a very different message.
Here's the actual data compiled by the Danish Meteorological Institute.
This is how much Greenland lost in ice year by year averaged over 10 years.
And you can see that from 1990 to 2012 or so, it did go up a lot.
It's a lot of part of this graph.
But if you look at the past almost 100 years, it went up and down a lot.
And if you go back to 1930, when human influences were much smaller than they are today, about
one-fifth, you can see that it was goose at ice almost as much.
And even as the globe warmed from 1930 up to 2022, the ice loss went up and down.
And in fact, it's currently declining rather than going up.
So this is not global warming.
This is weather.
It turns out to be weather in the North Atlantic.
So it's impossible to talk about weather without talking about the unusual heat that we have
seen this summer.
Here is context.
This is data from the US EPA, official government data.
It's the heat wave index.
We can talk about how you define heat waves, but not now.
And you can see that in the last 40 years or so from 1980, not much changed.
This does not include the last summer, of course.
We don't have that data yet.
But even so, one year is not going to make all that much difference in a climate sense.
And it was a lot more active in terms of heat waves in the 1930s than it is now.
Again, human influences much smaller.
This is the satellite-derived record of the global temperature, temperature of the lower
atmosphere, month by month.
And the last point in that graph is July 2023, last month.
And you can see, wow, big spike, right?
But when you look at it, you see other big spikes, mostly due to El Ninos.
And you can see that there's a gradual long-term trend.
So however much the media and other folks make of the unusually hot July that we have
had, that's not human influences.
It's weather.
The long-term trend in this data may well be human influences, but they can't resist
capitalizing on dramatic weather events to make the point.
There it is.
What are the causes?
Maybe greenhouse gases, but that seems unlikely again because greenhouse gases act over long
time periods smoothly.
El Nino, we are in the beginnings of another El Nino cycle.
There are other oscillations in the climate system that are conspiring to work together.
Stratospheric water vapor is another explanation.
You may not know that in January of last year, there was an enormous underwater volcanic
eruption that increased the water vapor in the upper atmosphere by 10% to 13%.
You can see it here in this graph, that big, dark blob at the end of the graph the most
recent years is the water vapor from this underground eruption, undersea eruption.
And that increases the heat trapping of the atmosphere.
And then finally, we've been cleaning up the lower atmosphere from coal emissions and from
ship emissions that allows the earth to absorb a little more sunlight, and that's also playing
a role in recent warming.
Finally urban heat island, you hear a lot about records being broken, Phoenix, Houston,
and so on.
The temperature in the cities is hotter than the surroundings, as much as five or six degrees.
And if you've got a weather station that's in the middle of a city that's growing and
growing and growing, the heating of the city starts to affect whether you're going to break
a record or not.
All right.
Temperature is not the only thing that is a manifestation of climate.
Of much greater concern are extreme weather events and sea level rise.
This is a chart from the most recent UN report issued about a year ago.
And the colors indicate whether a trend has been observed or not in various phenomena.
The ones associated with heat and cold, well, yeah, we've got more heat.
More heat waves globally, though not in the U.S., less fewer cold spells.
But then there's a whole category of wet and dry for which there is no trend.
There's a whole category of wind, including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons.
For which there is no trend, et cetera.
So in fact, for most of the extreme weather events, we have not seen trends over the last century.
Here's some of the text that goes along with it.
Low confidence in most reported long-term trends in hurricanes.
Low confidence in mid-latitude storms.
Tornadoes hail lightning, no trends, et cetera, et cetera.
The one in which there is confidence is that we have seen some increase in heavy precipitation
on a global scale over land.
We can go on and on again.
Not a lot that gives us support that there is a climate crisis underway.
Here's some of the data for hurricanes.
This is the record of the number of hurricanes globally.
Upper trace is all tropical storms.
Lower trace are hurricanes.
And this is a record that extends over 50-some odd years.
It's hard to see any change at all.
This is a measure of hurricane activity.
It weights the strongest storms more than the weaker storms.
Again, globally in the top, northern hemisphere in the bottom,
lots of ups and downs over 50 years.
But it's hard to find any effect.
And in fact, the official reports say we can't find any trends.
I'm not going to go through the language, but that's what it says.
By the way, I don't know if you'll have access to the charts,
but they have links to all of the supporting either UN reports or quality peer-reviewed
literature in each of the statements.
So that's the climate of today and the past.
You might ask, what about the future?
Well, for that, we rely on models.
And one of the major measures of a model
is how sensitive is it to increasing the carbon dioxide.
If you doubled the carbon dioxide in the model,
by how much would the temperature go up?
And that's shown in this graph.
There are about 40 different models listed there.
They're produced by institutes and universities around the world.
And what's parted is how sensitive the model is.
And the ones in yellow, about 40% of them,
were deemed too sensitive by the UN and so are not used at all.
That's a little bit scary.
The world's best models making their best tries
get it wrong 40% of the time.
It's even worse when you ask, how well do the models produce
the temperature history that we've seen?
And that's shown on these graphs.
The black is the actual observed temperature rise of the globe.
And the different traces are the different models.
And you can see that many of the models differ from the data
or they differ from themselves by more than the temperature rise
that they're trying to describe.
And in fact, even the climate models
don't believe their own models, at least at the regional level.
Tim Palmer at Oxford and Bjorn Stevens,
who is the director of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology,
says, for many key applications, the current generation
of models is not fit for purpose.
There's Bjorn.
He gave a lecture at UCLA about a year ago.
And he says, it's difficult in many places
impossible to scientifically advise societal efforts
to adapt in the face of unavoidable warming.
We can't assess the extent to which a given degree of warming
poses an existential threat.
And there's Tim Palmer in an email not publicly published,
but broadly published in the National Academy membership.
He says, our understanding of climate change,
especially at the regional scale, is rather poor.
How can a country adapt if it doesn't even
know the sign of precipitation change as the IPCC figures show?
And he says, the policy and decision
makers start to feel uncomfortable when we say that.
They'd rather we didn't say such things in public.
They claim it undermines the public's faith
in the need to take action.
And I think this is a disease, a dysfunction
of the science in this particular field.
As a scientist, I think it's our duty
to lay out the science, knowns and unknowns,
transparently, completely, and without bias.
That's not happening.
I can tell you, show you specific examples.
All right, let's look at just one or two more model projections.
Sea level.
I live most of the time in Manhattan, in New York City.
There's been a tide gauge at the foot of Manhattan,
the southern tip, for 150 years.
Maybe a little more.
This is the rate of rise of the sea
at the tip of Manhattan since 1920.
It averages about three millimeters a year, you can see.
But it goes up and down.
Three millimeters a year, by the way, is a foot a century.
NOAA, the part of the US government
concerned with oceans and atmospheres,
says that over the next 30 years,
this graph is going to do that.
Remarkable.
Who am I to challenge NOAA?
But we'll know soon enough whether that's going to happen
or not.
And in fact, other researchers say,
you shouldn't be using these models
because they're not very precise, they're not very accurate,
and so on, giving an impression of false confidence to users.
Well, if you can't believe the models about what's
going to happen going forward, how
might we get a handle on how things are going to change
as the globe warms?
Well, we can look at the past.
So here's the global average temperature since 1850.
And you can see that since 1900 or so,
it's gone up by about 1.3 degrees to the present.
That's just about the same amount
of warming that the UN predicts on average
to the end of the century, 2100.
What will be the impacts?
Well, we don't know, but we can see how the globe has
fared during the previous 120 years.
And the answer is humanity has prospered as never before.
The global temperature went up by 1.3 degrees.
The population went up by a factor of five.
Life expectancy went from 32 years to almost 73 years.
The literacy fraction jumped by a factor of four.
GDP per capita went up by a factor of seven, et cetera,
et cetera.
And the death rate from extreme weather
went down by a factor of 50, even as the globe
warmed 1.3 degrees.
That doesn't say things are going to be perfect
over the next 80 years, but it sure
gives some sense that humanity is perfectly
capable of adapting and flourishing as conditions change.
Here's one example of that.
Agriculture.
This is 60 years worth of agricultural data globally.
The land area used for grain production
hasn't gone up at all, shown by the lower trace.
But the population, of course, has gone up.
The grain yield, which is how many bushels per acre
you get, or tons per acre, or whatever,
has gone up spectacularly as agronomy has gotten better.
And the grain production, how much grain the world actually
produces, has also gone up by 250%, even as the globe warmed.
If you look at weather losses, how much GDP
did you spend because of extreme weather events?
This is global data.
You can see, first of all, that it
hovers around a quarter of a percent of GDP.
Second, you can see it's actually gone down a little bit.
Again, people who are concerned will say, well,
this is just going to go up and up.
But in fact, as the world develops,
we get more and more resilient and able to deal
with extreme weather events.
And in any event, right now, it's only a quarter
percent of GDP globally.
What about the economic impacts?
Well, last March, about four months ago,
the White House put out a white paper
that summarized the result of 12 independent peer-reviewed
studies of how much warming would affect the US GDP.
This graph comes from that report.
And what you can see is that, as the change in global surface
temperature, it's in degrees Fahrenheit,
because this is a US graph, but OK.
We're currently at that vertical line.
And you can see that it's expected
that warming has affected the US GDP.
Those different lines indicate different models.
The black line is the average.
You can see it's down at less than a tenth of a percent.
And that, if we go out to the extreme end of this chart,
which is where we would be under the Paris 2 degree warming,
you can see it's still at 2%.
In other words, the economy would be 2% smaller in 2100,
let's say, than it would have been otherwise.
It's in the noise.
Bjorn Lomborg and another paper compiled a similar set
of estimates for the globe as a whole.
And again, the takeaway is a few percent for a few degrees.
While you might say, well, what about tipping points?
And of course, people have studied that as well.
There's a paper.
It's another 1% or 2% for the tipping points.
And so economically, this is in the noise.
Now, you might argue GDP is not the only thing that matters.
There will be differential impacts, poor people versus rich
people, et cetera, all true, but hardly a catastrophe
or existential threat.
OK, let me turn to the second statement I wanted to make,
and that advocacy for rapid decarbonization globally
is immoral.
And it starts with demographics.
This is the global population historically
and projected out to 2100.
And you can see we're just across 8 billion people right now.
And according to this projection,
we'll get to 10 billion by the end of the century.
Most of the growth between now and the end of the century
is in Asia and in Africa.
That means that the developed world, where there are one
and a half billion of us, is getting older.
The developing world is younger.
And urbanization is proceeding at a spectacular pace.
50 million people a year.
The equivalent to six New York cities a year
are getting created.
Half of the world now is urbanized.
70% will be by the end of the century.
Steve Haber yesterday talked about the developed world bubble
we're sort of living in, I would say almost echo chamber.
This graph makes it rather apparent.
What's plotted here is for a number
of representative countries indicated on the right.
The annual energy consumption per capita.
How much energy did each person use?
Parted as a function of the GDP per capita in constant $2017.
And you can see that there are lots of interesting things
to understand about this chart.
Some of us in the US, Canada, some other very developed
countries use a lot of energy.
We sit in the upper right corner.
We have a relatively high GDP as a result.
In the middle of the graph, you find the European countries
and a number of other middle countries
that use about half the energy per capita of the US
and have a somewhat smaller GDP.
And down on the lower left corner,
you see a set of countries whose energy use increases
universally and monotonically as they get richer.
Richer countries use more energy,
and when you're a developing country down on the lower left,
your energy use is going to go up a lot
as you become better off.
What is sobering about this chart is
that there are only one and a half billion people
in the upper parts of this chart.
If you go down to the bottom left,
you've got about 6 billion people.
And so it's pretty clear that as they improve
their standard of living by using more energy,
the energy demand is going to go up.
People down there, maybe some of you
come from those countries that have been in them,
life without energy is no fun.
It means cooking and heating with what's
politely called traditional biomass or wood and dung.
The indoor air pollution from that is terrible,
kills 2 million people a year.
Without 24-hour lighting, you've
got to study under extreme conditions.
It's OK to eat romantically by candlelight,
but studying by candlelight is no fun.
The inequalities are astounding.
Nigeria consumes 1 30th the energy per capita
that we do in the US.
And there are 3 billion people in the world, 3 eighths
of the population, that use less electricity per year
than the average US refrigerator.
And I will say, with a little bit of embarrassment,
I have three refrigerators in my house in New York.
So if you combine the demographics of population
growth with the need for energy, as you develop,
you get a strong growth in energy consumption.
This is shown projected out to 2050.
Again, you can see most of the growth, about 50% in total,
is there in Asia.
And the developed world is pretty flat.
And where are we going to get that
if we don't change our policies?
Most of it is going to continue to come from fossil fuels,
even though renewables may grow strongly.
Fossil fuels continue to dominate.
This shows where the world got its energy
from different sources from 1965 up until the present.
And you can see that the great bulk of the world's energy
comes from the bottom segments, oil, coal, and gas.
The others growing a little bit, but not
a tremendously rapid amount.
The world has spent about $4 trillion
over the last decade trying to change the energy mix.
But fossil fuels still amount to just about 80%
of the world's energy.
And that means that there are going
to be increased emissions from the developing world, whatever
we do in the OECD.
You can see right now emissions are just about half and half
the vertical line 2020.
But as we go out to mid-century, the developing world
dominates.
That's because fossil fuels are in fact
the most reliable and convenient way for those countries
to get the energy that they need.
There's a guy, a political scientist, economist named
Anthony Downs, who died about two years ago.
He wound up working at Brookings.
But for the early part of his career in the 60s,
he was working at UCLA, watching the smog get worse and worse
as more and more people were able to acquire automobiles.
And he wrote a wonderful paper called Up and Down with Ecology.
1972, I would highly recommend it.
What he said there is that the elite's environmental
deterioration is often the common man's improved
standard of living.
And so we, in the developed world,
might clutch our pearls and recoil with horror
at the threat of human-induced climate change.
The folks in the developing world have much bigger problems,
more immediate problems, and more readily soluble.
And so when we say the science compels us
to make emissions reductions, they say, what do you mean us?
So you have PM Modi in India saying the colonial mindset
hasn't gone.
The developing nations are closing to us the path
that made them developed.
And the ex-president of Niger, who was just opposed in a coup,
said about a year ago, Africa is being
punished by decisions of Western countries
to end public financing for foreign fossil fuel projects
by the end of 2022.
You see this when the IMF or the World Bank
refused to fund fossil fuel projects.
We're going to continue to fight.
We have fossil fuels that should be exploited.
So there is a moral issue.
For those of us who are sitting fat and happy
in the developed world, what are we
going to tell these folks?
Nobody's got a good answer, as I've gone around
and asked that question.
Finally, let me turn a little bit to rapid national decarbonization.
You say, well, OK, the US, EU should lead the way
and reduce our emissions.
Well, it's not so simple.
Because, to borrow a phrase from a movie recently,
energy touches everything everywhere all the time.
It is one of the fundamental systems of society.
Energy systems evolve very slowly because they
need to be reliable, and the assets last a long time.
Power plants, refineries, automobiles, et cetera.
So you tinker with the energy system at your peril.
If you try to make the energy system change too rapidly,
it is going to be, it will be, extraordinarily
disruptive.
The cost and reliability of energy services.
California here has very close to the highest
electricity rates in the country because of the strong dependence
on solar and wind.
We're going to change the way people are employed.
You put in electric cars, mechanics will disappear,
the flow of funds, you lose the fuel tax.
What are you going to do to replace that?
Financing an electric car, as an example,
costs a lot more upfront, but has lower operating costs,
at least until the government starts
taxing it to recover the lost fuel revenues.
Domestic manufacturing costs increase.
If you make energy expensive, manufacturers
make energy expensive, manufacturing gets expensive.
Germany, which has the highest energy costs almost in the world,
is seeing an outflux of manufacturing
as the manufacturers decamp for cheaper energy costs elsewhere.
You deploy immature technologies,
you're going to have to replace them.
Wind is not quite up to snuff yet,
and so we're seeing a lot of wind turbines
having to get replaced before their projected end of life.
30 years, it's turning out to be more like 15,
because we haven't taken the time to mature the technologies.
We need new supply chains.
A major part of the energy transition
is going to be technologies that employ exotic materials,
relatively exotic.
Lithium, more copper, cobalt manganese rare earths,
because renewable energies have to harvest energy
over very large areas, and they need
to be very efficient at harvesting it.
So you need fancy magnets and conductors and so on.
So you've got to rejigger the supply chains.
And right now, China has got a market
on the processing of these exotic materials,
and that's causing grief, if you like,
in the energy transition.
How much is it going to cost?
Well, it's hard to estimate, but people try.
Number of estimates show that to go net zero by 2050 in the US
is going to cost somewhere between 5% and 7% of GDP
each year.
That's $1.5 trillion a year.
We could do a lot with $1.5 trillion,
besides trying to reduce our emissions
while in the US is only 13% of global emissions anyway,
and the rest of the developing world
is going up rather than going down.
Globally, the numbers are about the same.
So we should be thinking hard before we
commit to investing $1.5 trillion a year to go net zero.
And we're already starting to see pushback
on these overly stringent regulations
that are aimed at decarbonizing the economy.
In Europe, we probably are seeing what people call peak green.
There's been pushback in Germany, in France,
in the UK, and Netherlands about how you heat your homes,
whether you can ban an internal combustion engine by 2035,
and so on.
And there are political shifts that
are underway as a result of people, consumers,
being unhappy about these.
The mandates in the US are just beginning
to affect everyday consumers, and I
think we will see similar pushback.
People will start asking, tell me again
why we're doing all of this, as electricity costs go up,
as electric vehicles cost more than internal combustion
engines, and so on.
All right, so I've given you a lot of things
that are somewhat on the cup is half-empty side.
What do I think we should do?
I think the first thing we've got to do
is cancel the climate crisis.
When the UN Secretary General stands up and says,
we're on the highway to climate hell with our foot
on the accelerator, that's just flat wrong,
and it is counterproductive.
At the same time, I think we need to acknowledge the task
and the challenges in trying to reduce human influences
on the climate.
We need to have better and more transparent representations
of the scientific knowns and unknowns
and the technology potentials to non-experts.
And more generally, I think the public and the decision-makers,
including policymakers, have to become more literate
about energy and climate.
We need to work harder on the science, observations,
understanding.
We must not constrain the developing world's energy
supply.
If we in the West, US, EU, try to do that,
China is going to step in and make sure
that they get the energy.
And that's not a good thing geopolitically.
We need a greater focus on adaptation and resilience.
If we can't, reduce emissions sufficiently rapidly,
and I think there are many reasons why we can't,
we need to understand how to better adapt
to a changing climate.
One of the things we don't do is to prepare for the past.
The terrible tragedy we've seen in the last week or so
in Maui was anticipated by many, more than a decade ago.
And there are reports that say you should do x, y, and z.
And of course, nobody did most of them.
And of course, for the developing countries,
we need to make sure that they improve their lot
so that they can be more resilient.
Technology is really important.
We've got to make technologies that
are low or zero emissions about as cheap as fossil fuels.
I have my own favorite list there.
I won't go through in any detail.
And then finally, I think graceful decarbonization.
Right now, governments are just throwing stuff at the wall
and trying to see what sticks.
So you've got, for example, in the US IRA,
I think totally unjustified subsidies for wind and solar
when they cannot be the primary source of electricity
in the country.
So we need to figure out these pathways, involves
technology, business, regulation, behavior.
Nobody has done that.
We're just all running around saying the sky is falling.
Glasschart, I thought it would be good to just offer a couple
of thoughts on S&T input to policy more generally,
not just climate and energy, but pandemics, for example.
Other S&T matters, artificial intelligence.
For those of you who are not experts,
as most of you aren't, as I read your bios in S&T matters,
don't be afraid to ask dumb questions.
Sometimes they can elucidate or reveal gaps in our understanding
or things that the advisors are not telling you about.
Ask about the data, coverage, bias, uncertainties.
We saw that in COVID.
Ask about model protections.
How do you know the models are right?
What's the range of models that you get, for example,
for the spread of COVID-19 or for climate?
Do not rely on the media for S&T input in these policy matters.
They get it completely wrong.
It's like shooting fish in a barrel to write op-eds that
pick out one another media story and confront it
with the real data in climate and energy.
Get yourself out of the echo chamber.
Look for diverse perspectives among the scientists
and engineers, and welcome bad news.
If everybody tells you the same thing you want to hear,
that's not very good at all.
Paul Simon wrote 60 years ago almost,
man, here's what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.
So look for that diversity of perspective opinion.
And finally, don't misrepresent the science
to justify a decision.
Make that balance that I talked about at the beginning
explicit.
Yes, on the one hand, on the other hand, and so on.
Having been a scientist most of my life
and only gotten involved in policy matters,
I would say, in the last 20 years,
I at one point heard the phrase, science-informed policy.
And I thought, when I heard it, well, of course,
what other kind of policy is there?
And then I discovered that you often see in climate issues
policy-informed science, namely that the description
of the science is meant to conform
to what policymakers would like to have happen.
So I leave you with those general thoughts,
and welcome any comments or questions that you might have.
