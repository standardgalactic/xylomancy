Okay, so you think we ought to try this again?
Well, again, best feature in America according to Bill Gates.
Maybe they've got lots, thousands, I think, of content up there.
Maybe we just picked a bad example.
And this is from the same guy?
This is from the same guy, but this is more high school content.
So maybe he's got a better repertoire with the high school stuff.
So this is introductions to matrices.
It's also a little bit longer, so maybe he'll get to some of the wise and stuff.
About this one?
Yeah, because this is 12 minutes.
Con.
Really? Every time?
Okay, yeah, maybe.
Let's learn about matrices.
Let's!
See, I think the interesting thing is something that I've learned in my classroom.
It's probably a word.
Hollywood.
Mathematics.
Matrix.
So what is a matrix?
Well, it's actually a pretty solid matrix.
Good.
Do you have any on you?
No, I don't have any on me.
I don't like that.
To get into a kind of category, do you have to stay in the matrix or leave the matrix?
At least this one has color.
Oh, my God.
And the other one was all white, wasn't it?
Yeah.
I wonder when he decides to use a different color.
Minus five.
That is a matrix.
And all it is is a table of numbers.
And oftentimes, you know, if you wanted to have a variable for a matrix,
you could use a capital letter.
So, you could use a capital A.
And sometimes in some books, they make an extra bold, so it's a bold A.
So, I'm just going to take a look at it.
So, they make an extra bold, two by three matrix.
Two by three.
Two by three.
All of the bold letters in this matrix.
And what is two and what is three?
Uh-oh.
Just for watching?
I don't know.
Stinking badges?
Oh, there's your badge.
Barges?
We don't need no stinking badges.
Oh, no.
One, two, three.
So, that's why I call it two by three matrix.
When we say, you know, three columns, okay.
I set a, I set a B in an extra bold.
Extra bold.
Extra bold.
Five by two matrix.
So, that means that B would have, I could put it to one.
I was typing number zero.
That looks a lot like it's writing those numbers.
So, that's five by two columns.
So, not another column.
It's minus ten, three.
I'm just putting random numbers here.
Seven.
And a random number generator at the same time.
Five.
What's that going on?
Five!
One of the chances of putting a random number takes five.
I'm pretty sure it's literally zero.
These are some table numbers you can represent data.
But it's nice to show when we go on all of these types of data.
The whole space capital letters sometimes we write a two by three there.
And you can actually reference...
Have you ever written underneath it, like what's five minutes?
No.
For the top of that four matrix.
A, if someone wanted to reference...
And I certainly haven't said it three or four times in the last, maybe again, that's my problem.
So, what is that?
That is in the second row.
It's in row two.
And it's in column two, right?
It's in column one.
Negative signs?
In column one.
In column two.
It's in the second row.
Second column.
So, sometimes people will write that A is a right, you know, two column two.
So, that's not a matrix.
Is equal to zero.
Or they might write, sometimes they'll write a lower case.
A, two, column two is equal to zero.
But what is A?
These are just the same thing.
I'm just doing this to expose you to the notation.
Because a lot of this really is just notation.
Because it's one, two, three, one, column three.
Well, that means we're in the first row.
Two, or two.
Two, three.
That's not a matrix.
So, this is just all the matrix.
The fact that there is no third row is just a whole number.
So, you might be asking, Sal, although that's nice,
able numbers with fancy words and fancy notation,
but what is it good for?
And that's absolutely nothing.
The matrix is just a data.
So, it's war.
Well, that's all it is.
But it can be used to represent the whole seven of them.
If you're doing this in your algebra,
longer algebra, two class,
you're probably using it to represent many of your equations.
But we'll learn later that an element...
I'll tell you later what that's about.
You can use it to a whole bunch of different things.
It can represent, it's very powerful in computer graphics.
The elements can represent pixels on your screen.
It can represent points in coordinate space.
It can represent... Who knows?
There's tons of things that they can represent.
But the important thing around this, to realize that the matrix is...
He could think of what?
A natural phenomenon. It's not like a...
It's not like a lot of the mathematical concepts we've been looking at.
It's a way to represent a mathematical concept.
Wait, what did you say?
I have to hear that again.
That was a backwards question.
Again, John, this is the power of...
A natural phenomenon. It's not like a...
It's not like a lot of the mathematical concepts we've been looking at.
It's a way to represent a mathematical concept.
It's a natural phenomenon.
Not like a lot of mathematics.
Because it's a way to represent mathematics.
What exactly represents mathematics?
Oh, he's going to tell us?
I'm looking for a problem.
Wait, what does that mean again?
It's a matrix. It's actually representing.
I was wondering the convention.
But let's put that on the back for a moment.
In terms of what it actually represents.
I'm looking for a problem.
I have to say, as a teacher, that's never happening to me.
We do get interrupted.
So it's not my wife.
It's how I do predict her experience.
How do you multiply?
How do you multiply you and add her?
I have to determine the matrix.
I don't know all of these words.
I'm going to try to get confused by them.
He's going to do the determinant of these matrices.
That should be...
You're always really human to find conventions later on.
That's the intuition behind what they actually represent.
Oh, if I can only walk out.
So let's say I wanted to add these two matrices.
I don't think we're going to have enough time to finish this.
I'll do relatively small ones.
I'll compare to you already.
Smaller.
Two and zero.
I try to think up my examples in advance.
Maybe that's your problem.
I could just say matrix B is equal to minus seven, two, three,
ten, five.
So my question to you is, what is A?
It's not going to be old.
It's not going to be old.
Why didn't you just add those two in the first one?
Someone defined...
Oh, because you can't.
They could have defined some other way.
But they said, we're going to make matrices add the way I'm about to show you
because it's useful for our whole system.
We'll talk about that later.
Essentially, just add the fourth one.
So how does that work?
But in most other matrices, the elements, you know, it's not connected though.
It's three plus minus seven.
Three plus minus seven.
That'll be the one one element.
Then the row one column two element will be minus one plus two.
Minus one plus two.
The parentheses are obviously going to be separate elements.
I think you can guess how this keeps going.
This element will be two.
But you're going to make us sit through it in any way.
What does that mean?
This element, this last one, will be zero plus five.
Zero plus five.
Isn't that better than that?
Even my class, because why?
I'll try to think about whether it's better than a power point.
Why is one plus two?
Because a power point, at least, because it's just filled with all of what he's done.
Boom.
Zero plus five is five.
So there we agree, Adam.
That is how we humans have defined the addition of two.
But the aliens?
What are they doing?
They're playing the same thing.
What's that?
You know, in mathematics, you might have been right about colors.
This is something I have to think about.
We're not adding numbers in here.
He was just a dedicated model.
Wait, maybe he's transiting?
I need two normal numbers.
It doesn't matter what order you're at.
The matrices, it's not completely obvious.
When you define it in this way, it doesn't matter if we do A plus B or B plus A.
If we did B plus A, this would just say negative seven plus three.
This would say two plus three.
It all would come out in this way.
That is matrix addition.
And you're going to manage all of A's of traction.
I don't think he's lit that up.
I'm not going to look at anything yet.
Transitivity.
A minus B.
A minus.
Oh, it's a bold minus.
Because that's a big curts-up rule.
Did he really die?
Oh, that's the same.
I think it's a spider.
Plus, what's that?
B.
What's B?
It will be A.
Whoa!
Oh, okay.
Two, three, five.
So he's defining subtraction.
You multiply the number times every one of the talents.
So that equals A matrix A.
Plus the matrix.
If he hadn't bolded all of those,
this would be like a five minute minus two minus three.
Five.
And then if you do that.
That should be negative.
He doesn't have an editor.
But he couldn't take another eleven, twelve minutes to fix it.
Negative one.
Minus three.
Two plus minus three is minus one.
So wait for it.
Plus five is five.
And you didn't have to go.
I like that.
I made mistakes, too.
Right.
Multiply a scalar.
But I don't put video of that on YouTube.
Yeah.
As the best teacher in the United States.
I think that's going to make it bitter
if we just keep thinking about it.
This definition of matrix addition.
What do we know?
Well, we know that both matrices have to be the same size.
By this definition.
Wait.
We're happy.
So for example.
You could add these two matrices.
You could add, I don't know, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Not so random, I don't think.
Just look right.
Two.
And a minus ten.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
