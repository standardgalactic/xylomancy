hello and welcome to book sandwiched in um we're uh in the new haven free public library here in
new haven connecticut my name is isaac shubb and um we're joined now uh by our guest professor
noam chomsky who's in arizona uh so welcome professor chomsky we are we are incredibly
grateful to have you here um this evening for this special edition in the series of author talks
and i should just note to to everyone else that um noam chomsky is um just by the evidence an
incredibly devoted person devoted to service and um has uh has been doing tons of these talks and
has been busy all day with these talks so um we'll try to keep you entertained um if you'd like to
change the subject and need to uh please feel free to do so there are a lot of people at this uh at
this event um and there are likely a lot of people streaming on facebook so i anticipate a lot of
questions and we'll try to get to those that we can in the time that we have um so um professor chomsky
really needs no introduction but for those who are unfamiliar he's widely considered the founder of
modern linguistics his contributions in that field have influenced developments in philosophy
cognitive science computer science psychology and beyond he is among the most cited scholars in
modern history and he has also written widely on politics and became known in the 60s for
protesting the vietnam war beginning most prominently with his essay in the new york review of books in
1967 titled the responsibility of intellectuals his political work has challenged the often unspoken
assumptions driving american political commentary chomsky is professor emeritus at mit where he taught for
over 50 years and since the fall of 2017 he has been laureate professor in the department of linguistics at the
university of arizona um so this program is called books sandwiched in it's usually during lunch so
it's usually a kind of book sandwiched in during lunch um kind of talk um and the main impetus um for
the talk was your recent book with marv waterstone consequences of capitalism so before we get into that i
just briefly want to ask you about language um when you were interviewed by the new york times in 1979
and i hope they're you know they quoted you accurately um they you were asked whether there's a link between
your scientific and political work and you were quoted as saying there's no direct connection between
them but that perhaps in some measure they derive from certain basic assumptions and attitudes with
regard to human nature can you expand on what those beliefs are about human nature and its potential
and how you see those qualities indicated in the human capacity for language
well there's a there's actual actually classic discussion of this so the crucial issue of the
crucial element of human language its most salient element which was already discussed by
galileo other great scientists in the 17th century and since is that language has an inherently creative
aspect our language capacity enables us to construct infinitely many new thoughts in our minds
and even to convey to others who have no access to our minds what are their innermost workings
galileo and his contemporaries many successors i regarded this as one of the most amazing facts about
the world altogether actually galileo uh regarded the alphabet as the most stupendous human achievement
because it was able to record this astonishing process i think that's right uh the use of language is
is normally creative innovative evoking new thoughts in cartesian terms we're incited and inclined to talk in certain ways but not compelled
the innovation the creativity comes from this well this was linked plausibly to the conception of human freedom
that uh fundamental classical liberalism was based on the around the same period some of the same people
like bill humph on humboldt was based on the assumption that any external infringement on a person's right to the
the free exercise of his or her abilities is intolerable in fact that was the basis for the
strong bitter opposition of the working class in the early industrial revolution to the
uh attack on human dignity imposed by wage labor which they called wage slavery same conception so there's
that kind of link it's not a logical link but it's a link in a kind of conception of the core of human nature
so for the um the last several years you've taught this class at the university of arizona with
geographer marv waterstone um and the lectures for that class were compiled uh for the book that i i
have behind me that hopefully the audience can see consequences of capitalism manufacturing discontent
and resistance published by haymarket um so the book um starts with a discussion of um of gramsci's
concept of hegemonic common sense and uh david hume's observation which you note that nothing is more
surprising quote than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few and the implicit
submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers unquote and
you say you know this this is the case just as much in dictatorships led by force as in countries
like the u.s where the ability to use force to suppress dissent is relatively limited um in the u.s
consent has to be engineered in the words of edward bernays um and uh i thought it was also telling
you included that the 17th century philosopher john locke who said the greatest part cannot know and
therefore they must believe so i know you've you've talked about this countless times over the years but
can you give us um maybe an example or two of this engineering of consent maybe it's history if you like
how it functions and i'm curious how you see hegemonic common sense in operation today
well let's take a look at 9 11 the anniversary of 9 11 coinciding with the anniversary of the
invasion of afghanistan then iraq a lot ton of commentary about it of course
lots of discussion about 20 years and so on well it's pretty obvious that the most important
interview that could be uh presented on the 20th anniversary would be with the person who called
himself the decider and was the decider the person who initiated the war in afghanistan quickly translated
transited to the war in iraq both devastating for the countries involved and so on
obvious isn't it well i managed to ferret out one interview with george w bush it was in the washington
post major newspaper in the style section it was a story about uh it didn't it was on the 20th anniversary
and it described this lovable goofy grandpa who has fun with his children and looks at all the
portraits he painted of the great men he knew and there's a side mention of there were these couple of
wars uh but uh at least he's not as bad as trump who called his opponents evil and bush never did that
so it wasn't too bad a couple million people killed millions of refugees two countries destroyed
ethnic conflicts and uh elicited the spreader and spread over the whole region but he didn't call his
opponents evil so that takes care of the decider well that's in a way that encapsulates the nature of the
flood of commentary ton of material about the cost to us you know trillions of dollars spent american
lives lost what was achieved there's some side mention that other people didn't do too well either but
uh that sets up a framework for thinking uh and in fact it's pursued it's not the first time the united
states didn't invent it when the british were running the world they handled it the same way
there are a um there are a few people who are saying um if you could speak closer to the microphone that would
be helpful um but i can hear you um so um you you've already you know you've already covered a lot of
things that i wanted to ask about but one of the questions that i was getting a lot um leading up to
you know questions that people had for you was about um the departure the u.s departure from afghanistan
um many in the media who who didn't seem to comment a lot about what was happening in afghanistan over the
last few years were really upset and frustrated by the departure and um you know by the leaving of u.s
soldiers and and paid a lot of attention to it you know and it it seemed like it merited attention but
um is that the kind of case of uh you know um certain certain attention is being paid to to an event
um when it's kind of convenient um are you surprised that uh that biden actually went through with
withdrawing u.s soldiers well that's a very interesting story now right now there's a closed
senate hearing on the withdrawal in which the republican party is lambasting uh biden for one of the worst
tragedies in history which gets reported but something's missed uh the trump president trump
in february 19 2020 totally betrayed the afghan people and the afghan government made a private
arrangement didn't even invite any afghans made an arrangement to hold to withdraw in may of 2021
worst possible time right at the start of the fighting season and to do it with no conditions
taliban could do anything they like just not shoot at american soldiers because that wouldn't look good
for him that was his agreement republican party en masse praised him for this historic achievement
magnificent achievement actually that remained on their web page up until the actual effects of the
withdrawal were shown what biden and then of course they took it off their web page since then they've been
denouncing biden for actually improving on what trump the hideous betrayal of trump's that they were
praising by delaying it a couple of months and bringing in afghans and now just follow the senate proceedings
one after another is getting up it has to be impeached a horrible atrocity how could anybody do this
i mean if there's no word you can't call it hypocrisy that isn't anywhere near strong enough
i mean it's so beyond shameful that you can't even find a word to describe it and you can say the same
about the media i mean they're condemning it too did they condemn the worst proposal oh nothing in fact the
whole idea that this was a surprise is ridiculous i can if you want to send you back to videos i had a
couple months earlier predicting the obvious as soon as the u.s withdraws the afghan government which is
just a morass of corruption will disappear probably taking most of the funds within the afghan army which
is mostly on paper others who haven't been paid others do don't want to fight for a foreign power
no collapse of course i mean anybody who wasn't burdened by intelligence information could see this
and i mean burdened by it if you look at the way intelligence is created we have plenty of evidence
of this from vietnam and other places the people on the ground know what's going on and they give
accurate reports they give them to people up a little higher in the chain of command gets modified
into what they want to hear and the next guy wants to hear by the time it gets to the top it may have
no relation to what's happening we've seen this over and over but if you're not burdened by this system
and you just look at the obvious facts which it's not hard to find of course this is going to happen
uh it's a duplicate of what happened in iraq the u.s created this huge army hundreds of thousands of
people heavily armed a couple of hundred jihadis waving rifles came towards them in pickup troops
the officers ran away the troops ran away left their weapons on the ground the taliban who were
marching into kabul if you look at the photos our arm looked like special forces from nato why because
they have all the u.s equipment they themselves had rifles and sneakers uh happens over and over
for pretty obvious political reasons i mean if you were occupied by a foreign power
and uh driven into the army and told to fight your kill your fellow citizens which the foreign power
wants you to do is that what is that what you would do
it is um quite striking and it can be enough to make a person um question his or her sanity um because
um you know hearing that the taliban was uh coming very close to recapturing the retaking the country
um seeing that people were you know that people were surprised was really hard to wrap my head around
because i'm not a military expert um i don't spend a lot of time studying these you know intelligence
report i don't have access to them and i don't spend a huge amount of time even following the news but
just from reading the new york times occasionally you could tell the taliban was making uh they had
been it seemed like capturing cities um throughout the past six to twelve months um so then to hear
john kirby um you know say a few days before uh the uh the taliban takeover that um the the afghan army
could hold out if they just if they just tried hard it was hard to know was he was he being is he being
serious why doesn't he pick up a rifle and go there and help him out why should they fight for him
yeah um so in the context of kind of trying to cut through distractions and better understand the
truth um i wanted to ask you you know to return to someone you've mentioned and that's um donald trump
and large you know the the republican party that he's kind of taken over in large part and um also
the january 6th insurrection um and so that that washington post article that you pointed out about
the interview with bush was very interesting um because you know it said basically um bush may
have invaded iraq on false pretenses but at least he didn't inspire an insurrection you know as you said
at least he didn't call his domestic adversaries evil so you talk in in the book consequences of
capitalism about robert jackson the u.s prosecutor at nuremberg and his reference to
the the metaphoric poison chalice being handed to the defendants and uh you explained you know
if we sip from this we are guilty of similar crimes you know we have to suffer the same fate
otherwise we should concede the judicial proceeding is a farce this is victor's justice so i guess i'm
just kind of wondering if if you can help establish some continuity in the historical narrative you know
what brings us from 9 11 to january 6th um to the present and going forward well let's start with
robert jackson chief prosecutor at nuremberg what you quoted was his address to the tribunal saying as you
said we're handing these defendants a poison chalice chalice if we sip from it we must suffer the same fate
crucial element in nuremberg was what they called the supreme international crime differing from other
war crimes and that includes all of the consequences that follow that's aggression of crime of aggression
there is a treaty called the united nations charter which is the basis for international law
it bars the threat or use of force in international affairs except under conditions that apply
uh there is something called the u.s constitution which everybody is supposed to worship especially
if you're on the right carried around in your pocket you love it and so on well if anybody bothers to
read it article 6 says that treaties entered into by the united states government are the supreme law of
the land and anyone who violates them has to be brought to justice well there's a treaty the u.n charter the major treaty
every u.s president violates it some violated extremely remember it says threat or use of force
have you ever heard a threat of force from a u.s president okay how about use of force like invading
afghanistan and invading iraq in brief george bush dick cheney the rest of them can add obama they're all
guilty of violating the u.s constitution have you ever seen anybody write about it actually i've occasionally
just for fun i write about it but occasionally for fun i've brought it up at talks at law schools
good law schools faculty seminars people listen you say kind of interesting let's go on to the next topic
okay i'm sure you can find plenty of analogues right where you are uh okay well that's uh what
gramsci called hegemonic common sense it's just built into us yes we're a gang of criminals we don't have to
pay attention to the constitution we can kill anybody we like i mean let's go on with that suppose that
iran right now was carrying out a global assassination campaign in which the leaders uh sat down every
tuesday morning uh read a little bit of the islamic equivalent of saint augustine and just war
and then judiciously decided who they're going to assassinate today namely of the many people around
the world who they consider might be a threat to them which ones should we assassinate today how would
the australian press react to that how do they react when it actually happens during the obama
administration that's exactly what was described obama brennan south down tuesday morning read a chapter
from saint augustine pondered the question who should we murder today the one of the people who we think
might turn out to be a threat to us uh maybe some collateral damage if people happen to be standing
across the street that's called drone warfare okay just goes on it's uh it's our right we have the right
to be criminals murderers uh do whatever we like because we say we're good in fact it's interesting to
look at the commentary on the iraq war or the afghan war uh take iraq uh there are people who are greatly
honored for having opposed the iraq war like barack obama most prominent of them who described the war as
a strategic blunder well i think we've heard that phrase before go back to nazi germany
uh plenty of general top generals who said it's a strategic blunder to carry out operation barbarossa to
invade the east to front war ought to knock england out first do we honor them as great heroes
if we have i haven't seen it uh in fact we regarded as criminal that's them this is us
uh let's take the invasion of afghanistan uh everyone is supposed to have loved that in fact global
opinion was mostly against it but what do they know uh it's uh the uh you know the anglosphere was in
favor of it uh united states england australia that's what matters uh they had no international
authorization plain crime of aggression what did the afghans think about it kind of an interesting
question we have evidence about it uh there was an anti-taliban afghan resistance with some very
famous and honored figures leading it like abdul khak later murdered by the taliban
he bitterly condemned the invasion he said it's the americans just want to kill a lot of afghans
it's going to undermine our efforts which are succeeding to overthrow the government from within
uh the americans are doing it because they want to show their muscle and intimidate everyone
uh he was backed by a meeting of a thousand tribal elders got together issued a declaration pretty
similar to this by the main women's group we're supposed to be concerned about afghan women uh
brawa major women's group issued a similar delic declaration saying yes we want to overthrow the
taliban but it's the responsibility of the afghan people not invaders from the outside did this
bother anyone has it even been reported well actually if you look closely there's a little bit of
reporting it was the interview with abdul khak actually was recorded in the guardian london but it has no
effect uh they don't count they're what sometimes been called unpeople not real people just people
are in the way it is striking the um the consistency with which the wars in afghanistan and iraq the u.s wars
there are referred to as disasters um or mistakes um fundamental errors rather than um rather than uh
great immoralities um there is a word called crime supreme international crime that's part of the poison
and shallows nothing that the u.s or britain or australia does can be called a crime maybe it can be a
mistake in our innocence we didn't understand something couldn't be a crime the crimes are for others
so you've um you've talked a lot in recent years about two uh very major threats to the survival of
the human species in its present form global warming and nuclear weapons um and uh i also saw
a recent interview with you where you referred to a third what the who and some others have called an
infodemic um so especially since the election of trump and with the decline of print media there's been
more discussion about the spread of misinformation bad information propaganda fake news um so this is
something you i guess i'm wondering you know since it's something you spent a lot of your career
on can you talk about where you see why you know what you see the sources of this infodemic being
the infodemic is worse than dissemination of inaccurate news there has actually been a virtual collapse
of the environment for rational discussion not over the whole society but substantially there's just no
arena of rational discourse on almost anything take uh take the covet epidemic very serious it's not as bad as
what you just mentioned it's not as bad as eating the environment nuclear weapons but it's pretty severe
the latest estimate of deaths by london economist careful estimate says it's probably around 15 million
people and increasing it's not trivial the united states just passed the half million mark
uh well it's actually higher that's the counted deaths actual ones are a couple hundred thousand higher
uh take a look every day in the new york times probably other newspapers they publish a map global map
of the global hot spots okay take a look at it the united states stands out in the world
world there is no other functioning society that's marked red on the map now if you look more closely
at the united states it's not the whole country it's the southeast the old confederacy during the civil war
and a couple of other rock group uh republican states wyoming idaho and so on they are in those states
uh hospitals are collapsing under the crush of covet victims virtually a hundred percent on accident unvaccinated
the same states are subjected to a
of a barrage of claims that covet was created by china to destroy the united states the vaccine is
invented by state authorities who want to control you or maybe bill gates who wants to put a chip in your
head or trump fosters this they worship trump i mean there's no rational discourse and the gap between
this is incidentally a very large it's probably the base of the republican party majority of republicans
say they don't want to say they don't want to be vaccinated it's just a a hoax you know that's uh
that's take something more serious destroying the environment major poll just came out from
pew research major polling agency in which they asked people they gave people a choice of
15 serious problems asked them to rank them in terms of urgency divided by republicans and democrats among
republicans the very last one at the bottom was global warming at the top was illegal immigrants and
uh the uh the debt the debt incidentally became a problem last november 4th uh up until then the debt
was fine republicans were creating it to enrich very rich people so it was no problem november 4th
biden took it over might use it to help others poor people terrible major problem it's not that the people
who said that actually believe it it's that's what they hear in the bubble in which they're contained
you listen to the murdoch tv station fox news read the murdoch press that's what you hear
and when you're stuck in that bubble that's what you believe so the real problems are illegal immigrants
a terrible problem uh the debt suddenly became a problem and at the bottom of the list is destroying
the environment in which life can be sustained all of these are signs of the collapse not only of
the arena for rational discourse but just general social collapse the social order is collapsing
it didn't just happen by itself it happened because of a plague that was set in motion
40 years ago we discuss a lot of in the book it's the plague of neoliberalism
was actually started in the 70s massive business campaign to institute it but it took
off with reagan and thatcher and if you look at their prescriptions it's perfectly obvious what's
going to happen so reagan's inaugural address said the government is the problem not the solution
decisions have to be taken out of the hands of government well they don't stop being made
were they going to be made in the private sector they're going to be made by powerful corporate
tyrannies which is what corporations are uh unaccountable to the public the government of course
has a flaw it's partially accountable to the public can be controlled somewhat by the public private
tyrannies are free no accountability uh second point was milton friedman the economic guru who
pronounced that corporations have one responsibility to their owners state shareholders period and
management nothing else uh corporate rights are a gift from the public there's plenty of advantages that
come from incorporating it's a gift but they don't have any responsibility just to themselves
put this these two things together and decisions over to private tyrannies who have no responsibility
other than to enrich themselves uh margaret thatcher comes along and says there's no society
just individuals uh somehow managing on the market that they're supposed to survive in uh first step
that both riggan and thatcher took was to destroy any possible defense against this assault their first
steps first were to attack labor unions with uh actually illegal measures like strike breakers that opened the
door to corporations do the door to corporations do the same the one way people have to defend themselves
namely by organizing taken away put all this together they have to be a genius to figure out what's going
to happen well actually 40 years later it was studied by uh the rand corporation super respectable american
corporation they invested uh tried to estimate the transfer of wealth robbery we should call it the transfer of wealth
from the lower 90 percent of the population middle class and working class to the very top which turns out to be a
fraction of one percent their estimate was about 50 trillion dollars during the 40 years of neoliberalism
it's a vast underestimate they didn't include other things which are now on the front pages when reagan
came in he opened the spigot to businesses to do whatever they liked tax havens had been illegal before that
and blocked by the treasury department opened it up it's probably another tens of trillions of dollars
uh changed the rules on corporate management which the government said allowing ceos to pick to buy to be
uh compensated with stock options instead of salaries that means anything you can do to raise the stock like
buyback stocks great may ruin the corporation but it's good for you to get a higher income
that's got a result also of course executives were permitted to pick their own board the board that
would determine their salary what do you think is going to happen okay just take a look at the figures
i mean ceo scout salaries just skyrocketed carrying all of top management along with them extended to the
public sector university presidents hospital president so on meanwhile majority of the population gets by
from payday to payday in a precarious existence it's a major assault on the population and it's happened all over
the world australia europe not as severe as the united states but severe effect of that is people are angry
disillusioned resentful very easy prey to demagogues of the trump variety who says i'll save you you know
uh and uh will and just distrust for everything why should i believe what the center of disease control
says about uh the pandemic they're probably just run by crooks and washington liberally leads i don't
believe anything they say so you have a breakdown of the social order it's happening over much of the world
and it's not hard to trace so there is um unfortunately we are still having some problems
uh people hearing you and um i'm not sure if the problem is on it may be on our end so i apologize
um thank you um so there's somebody that's asking about um wanting to hear your thoughts as they relate
to the title of the book consequences of capitalism what does it mean and the perennial question what can
be done and it seems to me that is that's exactly what you've just been discussing um is that right
well first of all there are many different kinds of capitalism it's a very broad concept
the fact of the matter is that the so-called communist states are capitalist soviet russia
communist china there's different variants of state capitalism uh we as we discuss in the book in the
west uh since the second world war there have been two periods quite different periods of how the state
capitalist system worked first was first couple of decades after the second world war and what was
sometimes called regimented capitalism basically moderately social democratic in the united states
it's called new deal you're not allowed to use the word social in the united states that's illegal so
it's called new deal but especially what's called socialist and you're in most of the rest of the world
uh band in the us the uh and it was a period the highest growth period in the history of capitalism
egalitarian growth uh no financial crises to speak of uh banks were banks they just served the general
public uh taxes on the corporate sector and the wealthy were very high up to 90 percent uh very
fast and egalitarian growth plenty of flaws but it's basically the way it was by the late 70s under there
was a business backlash tried to destroy this all the way through finally by the late 70s they were able
to make it then came along reagan and thatcher and you get the whole radical so-called libertarian
neoliberal assault well those are two different kinds of capitalism uh so for example during the first
phase uh the minimum wage tracked productivity if it stopped in the late 70s if it had continued
the minimum wage now would be about three times as high as it is but it stopped okay you didn't have
roughly 70 percent of the population uh living from paycheck to paycheck you didn't have the top
one tenth of one percent doubling its wealth share from 10 to 20 percent these are aspects of a different
kind of capitalism so at the very least we could move towards a moderately beneficial form of
capitalism but it's still capitalism still based on the principle that certain people are masters
who give orders and others are servants or slaves who follow the orders that's called having a job
having a job means spending most of your waking hours
in a condition of subordination to a master that stalin never achieved stalin couldn't tell you at three
o'clock you can go to the bathroom for five minutes and or here's the clothes you have to wear or here's the
path you have to take from this point in the warehouse to the other point stalin couldn't do that
uh president g in china can't do that but that's the life for most people that was bitterly opposed for
millennia back to classical greece and rome they was recognized that there's no assault on human rights and
dignity harsher than being subordinated to a master of course they excluded slaves women
poor and so on but that was the principle and that was the guiding principle in the for work working
people in the early industrial revolution right through the 19th century well finally sort of gotten
beaten out and beaten out of their heads but that's something that's not far below the surface should
be revived why should you take orders from a master most of your waking life there are other ways to
organize production can be organized by the workers you can have cooperatives collectives of various kinds
in fact working people and farmers in late 19th century america vast majority of them wanted to create what
they called a cooperative commonwealth where the people themselves would cooperate to organize work life
communities without masters well it was crushed by a plenty of violence and also by plenty of
ideology doctrine imposing corruption hegemonic common sense and now it's regarded as a peripheral
position but it can come forth well those are among the consequences of capitalism people are i imagine
um usually struck um when they hear these um these kinds of ideas about wage slavery um at least in this
country um and and i highly recommend to to anyone who's listening who's not familiar with it a talk
you gave in 1970 called government in the future um which i found very useful um where you trace a lot
of these ideas um we're talking about um you know kind of given you know demonstrate an exposition of
classical liberalism in uh von humboldt and um basically make the argument that liberal ideas
in their essence though not in the way they developed are profoundly anti-capitalist um so
in this book you know professor waterstone speaks a fair amount about marx and you do talk about wage
slavery um i'm wondering you know what what aspects of uh marx's work have do you find useful and and which
aspects um do you find not so useful well more of my colleague is much more of a marx scholar than i am so
i read it but he's the one i talked about it mostly so you should ask him uh i've preferred to come to
a quote classical liberals people like john stewart mill leading intellectual figure of the 19th century
highly regarded one of the most honored intellectuals his view was that in a properly ordered society
there should be no masters and those servants production social life should be organized by the
participants in a democratic participatory fashion uh that abraham lincoln and the republican party
are the ones who use the term wage slavery not mark american workers had never heard of marks
when they picked this up this was the republican party uh considered it intolerable except as a
temporary measure till you become free now lincoln and the republican party talked about individual
freedom till you become individually free but the working people and farmers in the united states
we're talking about collective freedom and a cooperative commonwealth far beyond the republican party or even
classical liberalism well i think those are ideas that we should resurrect uh there's plenty to learn
from works for me the most at least personally the most important parts of the historical uh analyses which are
pretty insightful uh and uh many of the concepts fundamental concepts like alienated labor exploitation and so on
which incidentally were fairly common coin in the uh uh late rationalist early romantic period people like
humboldt for example for humboldt uh just to pick one of his aphorisms he said uh if an artisan
creates a beautiful work on command we may admire what he did but will despise what he is namely a tool
in the hands of others and uh humboldt's aphorism that nothing is more important than to allow
the full flourishing of a person's capacities in every aspect of life that was taken by mill as the epigraph from
on liberty's famous work so this right runs right through our own uh history right through our own
tradition i quoted adam smith repeatedly who was anti-capitalist in his fundamental sentiments and
perspective so let's take a look at the famous words invisible hand which you study in every economics class
do you study the way he used the term well it's pretty easy to find out he used it twice in any relevant
sense so not hard to find once in wealth of nations once in his other major book moral sentiments
in wealth of nations he's discussing international trade and he says that the merchants and manufacturers
of england might make greater profit if they if they bought and from abroad you know
uh sold to abroad but their commitment to their own country would lead them to prefer to invest and
produce and consume at home so as if by an invisible hand uh england would be spared
to be anachronistic what we call global neoliberal globalization
that's one use the other uses in moral sentiments where he discusses kind of a thought experiment what
would happen if it's an agricultural country if one landlord accrued almost all the land to himself
said well wouldn't matter too much because the landlord because of his concern for others and his
desire to be admired by others would make sure to distribute his property so that everybody would be
pretty well off so as if by an invisible hand we would get relative justice is that what you're taught in
economic classes is that capitalist ideology not exactly those are the two uses
um i know you know our time here is short and i certainly don't want to waste it um by asking about
something that maybe is not is not all that important um but there's a question um submitted by
somebody about overpopulation and i do hear overpopulation written about and discussed occasionally
and a lot of people you know some people have asked me personally do you think it's ethical or moral to
have children because of global warming and my response has always been well this is you know
this is these having children is natural to to human beings and um it's important that you know we find
hope in children um do you have anything a little more studied than that to kind of say about overpopulation
do you have any thoughts about it well there's a well-known solution to the problem of overpopulation
works very well poor countries and rich countries it's called education of women
everywhere where you try education of women whether in rich countries in europe uh poor countries like
the one province of india that's run by the left kerala just poor poor province you get a very
sharp decline in fertility if women have choices understanding planning you get lower fertility okay so
you want to solve the problem of it of overpopulation you don't need force you just need minimal humanity
educate women there's an interesting sideline on this the right wing claims i stress claims
to be strongly opposed to abortion it's a huge issue are they opposed to abortion in fact they're in favor of
abortion in favor of illegal harmful abortion that's the consequence of opposing family planning
contraception uh banning legal practices effect is more abortion more danger
more deaths not opposed to abortion of course they're also opposed to child welfare so what happens to
the child after he's born to his family i mean in fact if you look at the abortion issue rabbit in the
united states it's a very interesting history you go back to the 1970s the right wing was not opposed to
abortion ronald reagan governor of california passed one of the most strongest pro-choice
legislations in the country george h.w bush the first bush uh strongly pro-choice barry goldwater the
Republican candidate the same by the 1980s same people had all become passionately opposed to abortion
abortion what happened moral reawakening something very simple chief republican strategists
paul viro richard vigory recognized that if they pretend i stress pretend to be anti-abortion
they pick up the evangelical vote huge vote in the united states and the northern catholic vote
furthermore it can be a cover for racism
uh this a lot of this started because southern racists when schools had to be uh opened up started
segregated religious schools with government funding well
the court stepped in and said no that's in violation of the law
the law so here's a way to become to get your segregated racist schools without violating the law
say well we want schools which uphold christian values like abortion rights so we're not racists
except we are of course well change it from that's the change from the 70s to the 80s
one aspect of the neoliberal programs in fact an essential aspect if you're going to get people to accept
the neoliberal assault you have to shift attention away from class and economic issues to what are called
cultural issues abortion guns uh you know then you can maybe get people excited you know so since we're
just winding down here i just wanted to ask i don't know if you have time but um yesterday house democrats
announced um this plan to to raise taxes um by more than two trillion but they did not um choose to
they don't want to institute a wealth tax that biden and the senate had favored um so surprisingly most
americans seem to favor a wealth tax um but you know clearly the democrats are you know not they're
not a monolith but i'm curious how you you assess their performance since biden's election
well you have to recognize that 50 percent of the senate which is republican
are rock solid opposed to anything that might help anyone for very good reasons strategic reasons
if the biden administration can do anything positive for the country he'll get credit for it
and if you want to roar back into power next year and 2025 have to make sure that the country suffers as
much as possible so anything that might help the general population they're going to block 100 percent
they've virtually said it in those words so the question is what about the other 50 percent well
republicans have a red line which they've made very explicit nothing in the bill can raise taxes
on the wealthy or the corporate sector period the one legislative achievement of the trump administration
was a tax scam which radically reduced taxes on the very wealthy and corporations and that can't be
touched that's a red line and a number of the what are called moderate democrats meaning right-wing democrats
go along with that so you can't touch that well yes you can't have a wealth tax you can't have
measures which reduce subsidies to the fossil fuel industry just think what that means you read the ipc
report that just came out can't stop subsidies to the fossil fuel industry we have to race
over the abyss catastrophe in order to ensure more profits to our corporate funders in the next couple
of years well put a bunch of these things together the bill if any bill passes probably none but if any bill
passes it's going to be very watered down
we um we do have to wind down um and uh we have you know tons of questions and i think that's you know
like i i think i hope i said testament to um the interest that your work has generated and continues
to generate for people um but i just want to encourage people you know um noam chomsky is out
there giving talks all the time um giving interviews and writing papers so um you know please follow him and
uh follow other people who are speaking out um so i just want to thank you so much again for joining
us um and my thanks also to everyone who attended um if you like this talk you can watch um other
