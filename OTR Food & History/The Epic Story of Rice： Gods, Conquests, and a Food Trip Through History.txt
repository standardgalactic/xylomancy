I probably don't need to tell you what this is.
Half of the people on this planet eat at least a bowl of it every single day.
Rice is the staple for civilizations from Southeast Asia to the Caribbean, China to
West Africa.
And wherever it's grown it doesn't just provide nutrition, it forms the backbone
of entire culinary cultures.
This simple grain has built empires, led to the establishment of cities and been the cause
of everything from diplomatic feuds to full-on wars.
Its cultivation was the single most important moment in the history of agriculture and yet
somehow it manages to be everywhere and still overlooked, taken for granted, never given
the credit it's actually due.
So today on OTR we're out to change that, to trace its incredible path and wade into
its long and often controversial history, and of course, to try some of the best versions
of the world's most ancient and enduring rice dishes.
This is the story of rice.
There's a legend told in the villages of Vietnam that a very long time ago there were
no such things as grains of rice.
Instead every night rice would grow to the size of basketballs and each morning piles
of them would proudly roll themselves towards every house and wade outside the front door
for the family to wake up, ready to eat.
Humans thanks to rice had everything they needed, and all rice asked in exchange was
a little bit of gratitude, a simple thank you in the form of some decorations left outside
to show appreciation.
So the people would decorate their houses with tributes to the friendly rice, but one
night a farmer ate too much and fell asleep, forgetting to display his sacred shrine.
To the rice gods this was a sign that humans had begun to take their bounty for granted,
so in anger they shrunk down to a tiny size and decided to stay put out in the fields.
From then on wherever rice would grow it would be up to the farmers to do the work themselves
or go hungry.
This is just one of the countless origin stories and legends about the creation of rice, found
in the oral histories of cultures from one side of the planet to the other, because for
so much of the world, wherever you find life, well if you go back far enough, you find rice.
Since the beginning of time in this part of the world rice has been everything, the very
foundation of society and the staple crop that allowed cities to form and caused empires
to rise and fall.
Way across the planet, 14% of every crop pulled from the ground is a rice stalk, and if you
put all the rice fields together, it would make the 13th largest country on earth.
A billion people on this planet make a living from planting, harvesting, packing, shipping
or selling rice, from Asia to the Americas and almost everywhere in between, with the
plant itself cultivated from the lowest points below sea level to the mountains of the Himalayas.
It can be grown on water, in the fields or even high up in the mountains.
Where there is rice, there are people.
Throughout history, the rice plant has been used to make clothes and insulation, paper
and even particle board.
In ancient Korea, it was used as currency for paying taxes and today it might even rescue
your cell phone.
Rice is used for preservation, for adding strength to concrete and for fermenting into
alcohol.
But of course, most of all, it's used as food, with as much as half of the world's population
consuming at least a bowl of rice every single day.
Now, alright, this is a story about history and as hard as it might be to fathom, there
is always a first, in this case someone, somewhere, who became the first person to ever plant
and cook some rice, the tiny act that would change everything.
And that's usually how these videos begin, but let me issue a caveat.
Finding origins is always going to be complicated, not necessarily because the evidence is hard
to follow.
If you cut through the nonsense, there's usually a decent trail you can follow that
leads somewhere before anywhere else.
But the problem when it comes to rice is how much nonsense there actually is, mainly because
this has become an existential battle for national pride.
I mean, the concept of food wars isn't new, like there's stuff like french fries, kimchi
and hummus where multiple countries make a claim.
But this is rice, it's different.
So with that said, before we get to our first meal, let's start by going back to the very
beginning and waiting into a fight that's divided the world.
Alright, before we get into speculation, let's start with facts.
First, the consumption of rice is very, very old, and second, rice is a grass, and before
it was first domesticated, variations of wild rice grew across much of the world.
But with that said, let's begin with the generally accepted point of origin for the
use of rice as a food source, which is China's Yangtze River Valley.
Specifically here, in the area between today's Ningbo and Hangzhou, at dig sites dating to
as far back as 12,000 BC, or 8,000 years before the invention of the wheel, and 2,000 years
prior to the fictional lives of the Flintstones.
Anyway, this evidence is generally based on rice having famously been found in storage
basins.
However, what's not as widely known is that rice was just a small component of giant pots
filled mostly with nuts and acorns, which probably, not definitely, but most likely,
means that rice wasn't actually that widely accessible.
Or in other words, it wasn't being farmed yet, just foraged.
Let me digress for a second to explain something about how rice works.
Basically the rice we eat is the seed of the plant, and grasses have this thing they do
in nature called shattering.
What it means is that when the seed becomes ripe, it falls off.
That's how the species survives.
But when something that's just ripe and falls off, it kind of ruins the idea of farming.
So at some point, I mean, thousands and thousands of years after people filled those basins
in China, we see a genetic shift.
All of a sudden, the fossilized samples archaeologists found starting around 5,000 BC had a mutated
gene, one that would stop the plant from shattering and therefore allow farming.
This would have been incredibly difficult.
I mean, it took as long as 8,000 years to be achieved.
It would be perhaps the most significant breakthrough in global farming history, and that's not
an exaggeration.
But as for where it happened, well, that's when we start getting into the controversy.
The oldest fossilized remains of non-shattering rice were actually not found in China, but
in India, where rice consumption also dates back to the beginning of the written record.
Now, Indian legends claim that rice has been consumed in the country since at least 13,000
BC, although with no evidence to support it, it feels like that number might have been
chosen only because it's older than what they found in China.
But it is without question that rice also has an ancient history in India.
It's closely linked to many of the country's great religions, and those claims are also
backed up by archaeology.
The Indian and Chinese strains of rice are two distinct variations, known as japonica
and indica.
However, they both belong to the same species, oriza sativa, and both possess the exact same
non-shattering gene, evolved identically.
So scientists have come to generally agree that it would be impossible for them not to
come from the same source.
It had to start somewhere.
Now, since scientists first started studying this topic, both countries have put a lot
of money into commissioning research backing their own origin claims, which makes finding
truth in the history books a complete mess.
There are tons of studies from China which show irrefutable evidence of the Chinese origin,
and just as many from India proving with certainty that they were the ones who made the breakthrough.
Maybe the best actual clue comes from an American research team that in 2011 did a full genome
mapping of more than 100 types of Indian and Chinese rice, and determined that the actual
point of origin based on genetic comparisons with wild rice wasn't from the banks of the
Yangtze or the Ganges.
Instead, it was the flood plains of the Pearl River Delta in China's south close to Hong
Kong.
According to that theory, the rice from there would make its way across China and by land
to India, along the way being cross-bred with local endemic ferritals.
Anyway, one last point on the topic which may or may not be relevant, but in 2003, a team
of archaeologists in Korea announced that they'd found evidence that rice actually
originated there as far back as 15,000 BC, jumping the line even ahead of China and India.
The studies flew in fast and furious from both of those countries, with literally thousands
of papers discrediting the Korean claim.
Successfully, by the way, as by now it's almost completely forgotten.
At least China and India can work together sometimes.
Anyway, regardless of where rice started, as soon as farmers figured out how to grow
it, well, towns started forming.
Then cities.
Here was something so abundant, so resilient that it literally took Asian society from
hunter-gatherers to urban dwellers, which finally brings us to our first meal.
The earliest versions of rice eaten, whether in China, India, or Korea, wouldn't look
that different to how you might typically see it today.
Some steamed rice, along with a protein or maybe some simple vegetables.
But around 1000 BC, we start to see the first culinary breakthroughs, the use of rice as
a component in a complete dish.
What we find at the very beginning is something incredibly simple, made with just rice and
water, created after a flood to stretch a limited supply further.
But as far as we know, it's the world's first rice recipe, a dish from China, known
as joe.
So all right, Michelin rated joe restaurant, although realistically, joe is joe.
It's rice cooked until it's a soup, the texture, if you've ever had it before, it's kind of
like oatmeal.
You can make it as thick or as thin as you see fit, although this is pretty standard.
It's kind of right in the middle.
The whole idea is just to stretch rice further.
And in this case, I put a couple of classic components in it.
The more elegant, famous joe restaurants will serve it with seafood, especially in South
China.
Here, I just have sun-dried pork and century egg, which are both preserved ingredients
that would have been in a classic joe, at least as far as we know, a really long time
ago.
And we got it on the side with yo-tiao, thank you very much, otherwise known as patong-go
here in Thailand, which secretly is kind of what this is really all about.
The genius, of course, of joe is that it stretches a limited supply of rice further, a way to
save a population dependent on rice from starvation when there's not enough to go around.
Joe, also known as kanji, or here in Thailand, joke, is said to have been created in China
during the joe dynasty.
The name is probably just a coincidence around 1000 BC.
Now the joe ruled from what's now Xi'an, and they pretty much based much of their rule
on rice.
They claimed to be descended from a man named Ho Ji, a figure from Chinese mythology who
was, and this is hilarious if you've ever dealt with Chinese bureaucracy, an administrator,
a prehistoric minister of agriculture who was revered for giving the Middle Kingdom rice.
And through the spread of joe, the joe dynasty could claim to oversee an empire that was
almost immune to famine.
It wouldn't take long for joe to spread wherever there was rice, and to become revered as almost
a miracle.
You can find it in ancient recipes in Southeast Asia, Japan, and Korea, and also of course
in the Indian subcontinent where it was used not just as food, but as traditional medicine,
and where we get the name kanji, a temel word meaning boiling.
And to this day, in the same region where it first emerged, it's an everyday breakfast
staple.
Never really thought about this, but since we're on camera and I have to look okay, eating
joe with a mustache is really causing me some trouble.
Alright, between the advent of non-shattering rice, the fast expansion of rice across Asia
in the introduction of dishes like joe to make rice drought-proof, the thousand years
before the year zero would see an explosion in both rice consumption, and also more and
more new recipes, new uses of rice adapted to local palates.
In those years we see the first example of sushi made in Japan, something called narazushi.
Fish and rice pickled together in salt, said to have originated around the year 300 BC.
It's the time frame in India when we see the birth of something called kheer, basically
joe but cooked in milk and sugar instead of water, seasoned with cardamom and topped
with nuts and almost definitely the world's first sweet rice dish.
And it's around the same time as the Qin dynasty, the first to unify China, saw northerners
from non-rice growing regions move south, where they began to make their own staple, noodles
from rice instead of wheat.
But those noodles, while they would spread around much of the world, well they weren't
technically the first rice noodles.
Because long before those show up, another group of people from China had settled the
basin of the Irawati River in what today is Myanmar, bringing rice farming to Southeast
Asia and putting their stamp on cuisine through their own signature dish.
These were people known as the Maun, and what they made brings us to the next part of this
story.
Now, we've talked at length about the Maun on this channel as they were massively
influential in the origins of Southeast Asia, but basically they were rice farmers who swept
down from the Yangtze River Valley around 3500 BC.
It's true that pretty much every civilization from this region would develop their own
techniques and varietals of rice, but the first to sow the land, to plant the seeds
literally and figuratively, were the ethnic Maun.
It's the Maun who introduced the region to irrigation and rice cultivation, and while
they didn't leave a lot of records behind, we can follow their spread through two paths,
their language, and their most famous dish, something that would become a staple of ancient
civilizations from the Lana to the Khmer.
It was made by milling rice into flour and then making it into a dough, fermented in
the tropical heat for preservation, and then forced through small holes directly into boiling
water.
It's a technique still followed today, an essential part of the cuisine in Thailand,
Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and even as far away as Sri Lanka and southern India.
The Maun called it Hanom Chin, the root of the Thai name, Kanom Chin.
Like Joe, it was most likely developed to stretch a rice harvest even farther,
something critical here in the floodlands and with the added benefit of tasting really, really good.
Its history predates almost anything else still found in Southeast Asia, food or otherwise,
and where it started, today's Myanmar, it's still the national dish.
Served in a soup made of fish stock and aromatics, something found in every corner of the country.
There it's known as a dish called Mohinga.
This is like the ultimate Burmese breakfast food.
It's salty, you know, it's a fish stock.
You have the chickpea fritters because it's from Myanmar, which means it's going to be some kind
of textural contrast. Egg, fish cake, and long beans, some cilantro or coriander if you prefer,
and the soup with some chili on top.
And yeah, this is just, this is just one of my all-time favorite things.
It's a lot of people's favorite thing. This is a very popular dish.
We did a whole video about these noodles, these rice noodles that like,
you can see them all across Southeast Asia. Thailand is Khanom Jin, Cambodia it's Numban Chok,
Vietnam it's Bun, and the whole point is that like wherever you see this, that's where the ethnic
mon once settled. These are probably, we don't know for sure, and there's some disagreement in
South China, but probably the first rice noodles that were ever made, and it has, you know, a
history that's a lot older than any kind of modern Southeast Asian society,
and it helps. It is absolutely delicious.
It's also pretty light, which I'm thankful for with the amount of eating that we have ahead of us.
I'm already getting full.
By the year 500 BC, rice was found pretty much everywhere in the eastern half of Asia, and I
mean everywhere from the southernmost islands all the way into the Himalayas. And maybe the most
fun part about tracing its spread isn't really the fundamentals of how it was traded, so much as
the myths that spring up around its arrival. I mean, in the eyes of the earliest people,
something this important had to be a gift from the gods. In fact, almost every culture and ethnic
group in this part of the world has an origin story about this plant. And if you'll indulge me
just a minute before we get back to the history, well these are very much worth acknowledging.
In China, the most common story involves the goddess Guanyin, who you might also remember
from our history of oysters. It's said that she gave her milk and her blood to create the first
rice plant, with the milk explaining the white color of the grains and the blood, the reddish
husk around the outside. To early Japan, it was another goddess, Amaterasu Omikami, who was given
grains of rice by a swan flying through heaven and presented them as a gift to the Japanese islands.
Female deities also play roles in a few ancient stories here in Thailand, where according to one
legend, a goddess was cursed by the wives of farmers because she was too beautiful, and their
husbands desired her affection. So she hid herself in shame and lived with her best friend,
a freshwater fish, where she would remain until the farmers apologized and as a show of goodwill,
she gave them rice. Maybe my favorite story about the origin of rice comes from Tibet,
where people once battled starvation as they relied on hunting in a land with few animals.
One day a dog came running across an empty field and hanging from its tail were clusters of rice
seeds, which they planted and the hunger disappeared. Versions of this story are found throughout the
Himalayas and western China. One from the Miao people, where a dog with nine tails went into heaven
to steal a rice plant, fighting the heavenly gods and in the process, seeing eight of its tails cut
off before achieving its mission and returning to earth with rice, which is also the origin story of
dogs. Regardless of which version is told in a community in the region from Sichuan to the
Himalayas, it's still tradition to give the first cooked handful of that year's rice harvest
to the family dog. A couple more than back to our story. In the Philippines, there's one legend that
says a girl born into slavery named Agmei was sitting at a river crying tears of sadness when
she saw a bundle of golden stalks floating with the current. She buried the plant in the mud next
to the river and when it grew, her family collected the rice and used it to buy their freedom.
And a Laotian tale involves a farmer who had no food to eat, so he trapped a fish,
but the fish turned out to be sacred. To prevent the fish from being eaten, the king of the fishes
gave the farmer rice instead. Rice would become so important and allow that eventually a king would
take all the rice and hoard it in a locked dungeon. So a peasant, when in search of the rice goddess,
hacked her into pieces and planted them, which gave Lao countless varieties of the plant,
white, black, long grain, short grain, and sticky rice. With so many types of rice now growing,
the king could no longer control the supply and from then on the people lived in abundance.
And even though there are countless more, well that's as good a segue as any into another
important topic, which is the diversity of rice itself. With so many cultures and so many climates
relying on the plant, it's not a surprise that this simple grain has evolved in thousands of
different ways. Actually 120,000 different ways, that's how many varieties of rice are said to
exist today across the planet, 20,000 right here in Thailand alone, which all evolved from that very
first big bang. It's a number that might sound crazy, I mean it is crazy, but to see for ourselves,
well we had to take a trip to the local market.
I wonder if the uh, I wonder if the ducks and chickens still remember me.
Probably not, I don't think they're the same ones.
This is Klangtoi, Thailand's largest wet market in a place we just filmed a couple weeks ago,
spending 24 hours here without leaving. And while then our focus was on the meats and vegetables,
this is also where Bangkok shops for rice. There's rice in all forms, toasted for use in
Isan cuisine, made into kanom jeen or mohinga noodles, and of course, sold straight from the farm in
massive quantities. All right, we already found our destination, we don't need to go beyond this,
31 types of rice at least. And obviously like, you know, we have the all kinds of different
sizes and variations of, you know, Chinese white rice, we have all the Thai jasmine rice,
the long grain, long grain Thai jasmine rice, I think is going to be this.
We have what looks like sticky rice, so this is going to be the Isan sticky rice,
one, two, three, at a minimum of that. We have the unhusked varieties, black rice, brown rice,
slightly less brown rice.
The diversity of rice on display at a place like Klung Toi is both impressive and honestly,
unless you grew up in this culture, confusing. Now, we need to get back to the history, but
before this channel, I was a chef and the food side of this needs to be addressed.
What's the difference between all these variations and how does the choice of rice
impact the dishes it's meant to be served with? Well, I can't answer that question,
but I do know someone who can. So for our next meal, I set up an appointment with the owner of
one of Thailand's best restaurants.
This is Ban Deng by Methe Valai Soren Deng, an offshoot of the Michelin-starred place that's
often called one of the best Thai restaurants on the planet. The third generation owner,
my friend Nam, agreed to join us to pass along some of his secrets when it comes to selecting
a proper rice to pair with his cuisine. Tell me, as a Thai person, how important rice is
in the culture, in the language of saying, like, how are you doing essentially, right?
It just explained to me about the importance of rice to somebody in Thailand.
Wow. Wow. What metaphor can it use? It's basically the same as just waking up and
breathing. I'd say we eat it every single day. I'd say for the typical Thai, like every day,
just every day. It's an everyday thing for us. So it's very important.
According to Nam, of all the varietals you'll find at a market, there are subtle differences in
tastes and textures, and certain sizes work better with some dishes. But for an educated
shopper, what you're really paying attention to is not just the type of rice, but how it's treated
after it's been harvested. Wow. You were telling me off the air something that's really interesting
about a side of choosing what rice you're going to use that I hadn't really considered.
Right. So I guess the most common is jasmine rice, which we use here as well. But what I've learned
throughout my career is that the amount of time for rice storage before it is used also has also
affect off its uses as well. Typically, when a rice is stored, give or take less than three months,
it still has its starch content, which makes it more sticky and most people use it for let's say
jock porridge. It creates a more sticky feeling and then the aroma is going to be nicer. However,
after it's stored later than three months, six months or a year with proper storing,
it can be more used in a versatile manner. For example, fried rice. It becomes less starchy,
less sticky, less clumpy. That's why it's a bit of a hidden technique. You don't have to use
a day old rice. You can use rice that is properly stored for a long time. And so it's... You just
cook it and fry it. Yeah, just cook it and fry it basically. What do you choose to use here?
So here we use a typically three to six month old rice. So it's more versatile use in a restaurant
manner. And for newer rice, it's much harder to cook properly because sometimes
it's so easy to overcook it and it becomes this sort of like pasty kind of feel.
So you get your rice. Yeah, get your rice. Thank you. And then let's do it here so we can
endorse if you want to film this from above while we're doing this. All right, so basically what
you typically do, you get the sauce, the curry, and then you pour it over the rice.
And then basically, you just do that. So the rice absorbs all the flavor and that's how basically
we eat cow latte. All right, let me eat. Thank you. Go ahead. I'm just looking at this. I got my plate
off to the side. Enjoy, enjoy. Yeah, thank you so much. Nice to see you again. You're welcome.
All right, to get back to the history we left off around the time the Japanese developed sushi
and the Maan created rice noodles, all using crops and techniques brought from China. But not
long after that, the global rice trade would change, with China putting a hard stop on rice
export. See, China might have become a nation completely dependent on rice, but by the time
of the Tian dynasty, it was already clear that there just wasn't enough to go around. They had
a growing population to feed and only a small percentage of land suitable for farming. So for
a long time, there would be no more trade in Chinese rice. And so this story shifts to India,
which was at its peak as the linchpin of global culinary commerce. Let's start around 500 BC,
when India was a trading partner of the ancient Persian Empire. At some point around that time,
the Persians began to import quantities of Indian rice, the first time that it reached that far to
Asia's west. Rice would become common in Persia, with their own agriculture centered around Basra
in today's Iraq. The Persian Empire wouldn't last much longer, it would fall to the Greeks under
Alexander the Great in the year 330 BC, and it was that conquest that first introduced rice to Europe
and the Western world. As a matter of fact, it's also how we get the word rice, from the Greek
Orisa, which was taken from the language of Persia, which itself came a very long time ago from
India's southern language of Tamil. Anyway, just because the Persians were growing rice doesn't
mean they were using it as a staple food source. After all, theirs was a baking culture and rice
should be steamed, something not yet found in West Asia. Instead, as far as we can tell, in Persia
and later in ancient Greece, rice was used for making into flour for desserts and most of all,
for making beer. After rice first shows up in Persia, it would be another few centuries before it
would become part of their diet, and for that, well, let's go back to China again. Well, maybe
not China itself, I mean it was close to the rice trade, but to the borderlands where Chinese rice
had first spread so long ago. One of those neighboring countries to China's west was Uzbekistan,
where as far back as the 4th century AD, the people were known to favor a local dish of rice
cooked in stock with spices, called hualao in Chinese, locally pronounced as pilaf.
After the Muslim conquest of Central Asia in the 700s, new trade routes would spring up,
linking the region to the Middle East. It was along those paths that pilaf was first introduced
from Uzbekistan to Persia, and then during the Mughal Empire, from Persia to India,
where it would become biryani. That dish would change the way rice was consumed in the Middle East,
and for our next meal, well, that's where we're headed.
In the alleys between Bangkok's Sukhumvit Soi 3 and Soi 5, there's a neighborhood known as the
Arab Quarter, the home to a densely packed maze of restaurants run by and servicing people from
the Muslim world. And one thing those cultures have in common, from Morocco to Iraq, is the use
of rice. But nothing draws a crowd like this one. One of my favorite dishes served in this city,
a legendary Bedouin dish known as Mansaf Rice.
All right, so I understand that at this stage in the shoot, and this is not a camera trick,
we've done this all in succession, having this enormous 10 kilo plate of food is a strong choice.
However, I mean, I don't care what the circumstances are, I will always have room for this. This is
Mansaf Rice, and it is the national dish of Jordan. It's found sort of throughout the Levant region,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, it's very popular. And what it is, is basically rice that's cooked
in a sauce made of yogurt. We have more of the yogurt sauce here. Mutton is the meat of choice,
and it's cooked on top of and with bread, you know, which is the flatbread of the Middle East.
So I'm going to start scooping this, and it is just like, this is a treat. This is the kind of
thing. Me and, you know, we've never filmed at this restaurant before. This is called Hafid,
and the restaurant itself is actually Egyptian, but they do have foods from throughout the region,
and this is the highlight. Me and Daria actually came here for this off-camera like a week ago,
and that's something that we do quite frequently whenever we're in the mood.
I would say that this is one of our two or three most frequent stops in the whole city
for a place that we eat regularly off-camera. So yeah, months off rice, it's a dish that has
a ton of history. I mean, like thousands of years of history as a Bedouin dish, the incorporation
of rice is more modern. It was traditionally mutton yogurt sauce and bread. However, rice
as a staple grain in the Middle East is also something that has ancient history, because of
course it does. It's rice.
That's unbelievable. I'm going to just eat because the hair salon across the street
is celebrating stone crime. It was just high New Year, and so they were very nice and agreed to
turn their like blasting music off for us while we were filming, but I told them just a few minutes
and then we promised we'll let you get back to your party. So I'm going to let them do that
because I have work to do. There's a lot to eat, and talking is just distracting me from the actual
mission. Unreal.
All right, as long and convoluted as the path of rice is, the one thing that's certain,
the one universal truth is that in ancient history, rice grew wild across much of the world.
Before somewhere, probably China, maybe India, after thousands of years of trying,
breeders were able to crack the genetic code and successfully domesticate rice.
I mean, we covered that right at the beginning, and it's the most important thing that might
have ever happened in food. But it's not the whole story. What isn't usually included in the
history books is that there was a second domestication, half a world away from Asia,
a second miracle of agriculture completely independent from the one that we all know about.
It happened around 3,500 years ago in Africa, and you probably don't know about it because nobody
talks about Africa, but it happened in what's now the country of Nigeria, and for the people there,
it would be history changing. Now, according to theory, and keep in mind this isn't well
documented, as the Sahara dried out around 2500 BC, the local versions of wild rice,
which were once abundant across the whole of Africa, became in the Northern Hemisphere harder to find,
so the people set out to make their own. For the record, this would happen more than a thousand
years before any record of trade between Africa and either China or India, in fact a full 1500 years
before the first rice was shipped to the port at Alexandria. This was something completely different
and totally independent, unique in global history, and the only rice found anywhere on earth that
belongs to a different species than Oryza sativa. Basically, we start here in Nigeria, and the area
we're talking about is here, the Delta of the Niger River. Now, again, this story has to rely
on a bit of speculation, but the farmers who first managed this incredible accomplishment
were most likely from a group of 16 small clans known as the Volta Niger, who were pastoral farmers,
and yet were still, according to archaeology, advanced enough that they were smelting metal
as early as almost anyone else on earth. And it would take an advanced civilization to have
developed this rice, because it was no joke of an achievement. It was bred in a way that's still
baffle scientists, with a dense canopy that prevents the growth of weeds, a faster maturation
than that of Asian rice, and most significantly, the ability to thrive in even the harshest of
conditions, tolerating bad soil, arid soil, and even no soil at all, growing literally on top of the
water in the Delta region. When this rice, by the way, was first encountered by European slave traders,
they wrote of its impressive nature and described its cultivation as the most complex they'd
ever seen. Anyway, just like in Asia, after rice was domesticated, it led to the construction of
cities, with the first recorded a place called Ile Ife. It was here that the Volta Niger would
consolidate into a tribe known as the Yoruba, who today number almost 45 million. In the Yoruba
language, by the way, the name Ile Ife translates to the home of expansion. From that new city,
the domesticated rice would quickly spread across a large swath of West Africa,
blanketing the coastline and moving inland as far as Lake Chad. It would be this rice that
would serve as the staple food for the greatest empires that region has ever seen, beginning
with the Mali Kingdom, which would spread from the Niger basin to become, for a time, the richest
civilization on earth. The consumption of rice would also be the linchpin of the Songhai, the
great rivals and eventual successors of the Mali. For a time, there were a number of large
kingdoms centered in West Africa all consuming local rice, which again means this story is about
to get controversial. See, somewhere in one of those civilizations, sometime in the 1500s,
a dish emerged that would quickly become the single most iconic food of West Africa. It was
made by cooking rice with onions and tomatoes, which had just arrived from the Portuguese.
Now, this dish, which would be called Jolof Rice, would lead to centuries of intense feuds between
West African countries, particularly Ghana, Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, as to where it first
actually originated. And when I say intense, I mean this manifested not just in generations of
arguments, but in more recent years, cookoffs, articles, and even musical battles with rival
songs staking their claims to the dish. In the end, UNESCO got involved and decided the actual
credit should go to Senegal, which in all honesty should have been obvious from the beginning because
the name of the dish itself comes from the Senegalese Jolof People. But I guess it didn't
really matter because in West Africa, there are so many other preparations using rice,
including even inversions of the continent's most beloved staple.
When you allow your water to boil, when the water is already boiled, then you mix it. When you mix
it, you will use something like this to turn it, turn it until it is done. It's very easy to do.
In a back alley across from the Arab quarter, above a hair salon, behind an unmarked entrance,
there's Bangkok's best West African restaurant. It's run by a man named Andy, who invited us to
visit to show us his famous Jolof rice, and also how he makes fufu, the Nigerian staple,
not with the more common cassava, but instead using rice.
I don't measure, I don't measure, but I know exactly how, even if the water is too much,
you still add the rice flour. When you are turning it, because you have to put it on fire
so that it will be done. When you see that it's already thick,
because you have to make sure that it's a little bit thick, then you will keep the reserve water
standby. So this is the oil, you add it small, put it small, so that when the customer is eating,
because we normally eat with hand, so when you are eating, it will be just smooth and easy because
of the oil. Like before, if I have a big customer, I can make more. That is when I need somebody to
hold the pots for me. While I work in kitchens for long enough, my hands don't get hot,
I don't have any feeling in my hands anymore. You see, it's already smooth.
So it's already done.
Hi, Goosey. Second time we've shown it on the channel, but this version is just something else.
And this is why we are here. Every culture and country that has a history of farming rice,
you know, and in Nigeria, it goes back 3000, 4000 years. You know, it's such a versatile thing,
not necessarily in the climates where it grows, but in the uses of it. And to be able to substitute
the classic cassava for rice flour is just, you know, and to keep that textural integrity, it's
awesome. So you make yours a little bit spicy. I like that. If we thought we were starting to get full,
that hint of chili pepper is going to wake us right back up again. Fantastic.
Let's try the rice.
All right. So here, the texture of the rice is going to be a little bit different from what we saw,
for example, at Bondang, when we were kind of looking at the highway of making rice. And you go
to, you know, how rice is served in China where it's going to be a little bit lighter and fluffier.
And in this case, because of the tomato that it's stewed in,
this has almost a sticky texture. It's something that almost feels like it's like,
how would you describe this? It's more like a risotto than a bowl of Chinese rice.
Yeah, this is fantastic. And the cool thing is, again, such a completely different flavor
profile than anywhere else we've been today, which just shows the versatility of rice. And
the reasons why it's appreciated by people everywhere.
The ancient Nigerian rice is today almost extinct, increasingly replaced since the 1970s by the
Chinese varietal, for the primary reason that it's more cost-effective, since through genetic
engineering, it now yields a bigger harvest. But there's a massive legacy of the African culture
of rice, not least of which can be found throughout the Caribbean, where the first strains planted
in the 1560s were brought from Nigeria. As a matter of fact, more than half of all African slaves
were taken from the rice growing region, mainly because European slavers found that it was easy
to stock up on food supplies for the transatlantic journey, thanks to the abundance of local rice.
There are even stories in places like Jamaica that said that slaves held in bondage used to
hide grains of rice in their clothes and even in their hair, so that if they ever became free,
they could plant their own crop and build a new life. And to this day, rice is found in pretty
much every meal from Jamaica to Trinidad in the Dominican Republic, and of course on the continent
as well, in both North and South America. The story of rice in the New World isn't simple or
straightforward. There are many different points of origin from European trade to the arrival of
Indian plantation workers. There's even a theory, thus far not proven, but also worth observing,
that it's possible there could have even been a third domestication event in Brazil
around 5,000 years ago, using their own strains of wild rice that grew in the Amazon basin.
What we know for sure is that today, rice is a key component in the cuisine of Mexico,
where it arrived with the Spanish, which is why it's sometimes called Spanish rice.
In Peru, where it also came with the Spanish and where a common dish,
arroz chalfa, was introduced by the Chinese in the 1800s and takes its name from chalfan,
fried rice in Mandarin. And it's consumed in Brazil, maybe not their own native strains,
but there you can find white rice brought by the Portuguese, and also something called red rice,
which is the species from West Africa, maybe almost gone from its original home but thriving
in Brazilian cuisine. And of course, there's also the United States, and one more time,
this gets complicated. The most common version of the story is that rice was first cultivated in 1685
in South Carolina, using rice seed brought from Madagascar. Now that rice was the same that we
first find way back at the beginning of this story in China, which worked its way to Taiwan,
was brought to the Philippines by Austronesians around 5000 years ago, and then they would introduce
it to the islands across the Pacific, Madagascar included. And it is true that the so-called
Carolina rice would become a key crop in the colonial economy, helping drive the domestic
commerce that would finance the American Revolution. But there's more to it than that,
and somehow, our last story might be the craziest one of this entire video. This time,
for the first time ever on OTR, we start in my hometown, Charlottesville, Virginia,
in the year 1787 at a place called Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson,
who 11 years earlier had written the American Declaration of Independence.
Having played a role in uniting the colonies into one brand new country, Mr. Jefferson had a
conundrum, which is why America's main trading partner, France, refused to buy Carolina rice.
Maybe he thought it was because the American rice wouldn't grow in a more mountainous climate,
so Jefferson traveled to Italy, into the Alps to a region that was growing its own rice,
and despite an Italian law promising the death penalty to rice smugglers,
he made his way back to the coast with rice seed in his pockets. Planting this rice at Monticello,
he was disappointed to find out it was exactly the same plant as the varietal from South Carolina,
so that wasn't it. As fate would have it, he'd receive a copy of a travelogue written by a
missionary to Vietnam, who described finding rice of the most perfect color and quality.
So Jefferson decided that would be his next mission, to obtain a sample of Vietnamese rice.
Again, this led him back to Europe in hopes of enlisting the help of his friend,
the head of the French Navy, who often sailed to Vietnam. But what Jefferson found was even
more exciting. See, in Paris at the time was the son of the exiled Vietnamese king Nguyen An,
along with his guardian, Bishop Pierre Pignot, forced into hiding because of the Taison Rebellion,
literally the subject of our video two weeks ago. Anyway, Jefferson received an audience with the
prince who promised to send him a French ship full of rice on his return to his homeland.
But that would never happen, as shortly after Jefferson returned to Virginia,
the French pulled back their support of the Nguyen family, and anyway,
by the time Nguyen An would win his war on his own, his son had died of smallpox at the age of 21.
But Jefferson was now obsessed, and he would eventually receive his Asian rice,
not from Vietnam but from Sumatra, delivered by none other than Lieutenant William Bly,
deposed in the mutiny of the HMS Bounty and left stranded on the island of Timor.
Since Bly could no longer hope to show any success from his mission, which had been to
deliver breadfruit trees to England, he instead wanted to salvage something, so he scavenged
a small amount of local Indonesian rice. After his return to England, he'd present that rice to
the botanist Joseph Banks, who would eventually deliver it all to Jefferson, with a note informing
him that he'd just received the entirety of the ill-fated mission of the HMS Bounty. However,
sadly, this rice proved unsuccessful growing at Monticello and also at the home of Jefferson's
friend James Madison, the writer of the U.S. Constitution. But still, all was not lost.
In the end, the success of Jefferson's chaotic quest for rice started with a chance meeting in
1789 with a young Bostonian captain who'd heard about these struggles and offered to help,
this time by sailing for the west coast of Africa, where he said he'd heard of a rice that surpassed
all others in both quality and adaptability. The sailor returned a few months later with a 10-gallon
drum of rice purchased from a local farmer in what's now Guinea, the western edge of Africa's
ancient rice growing region, where he divided it into portions and sent them to growers he'd
involved in his quest, including, of course, none other than George Washington, who had just begun
his first term as the President of the United States. Now, long story slightly shorter, the
African rice didn't succeed in Virginia, but it did in the hills of Georgia. So successfully,
that it would soon spread across the entire southern region of the country. And in 1803,
after Jefferson himself negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, that land, including the Delta of the
Mississippi River, would be populated with the very same African slaves who, once they saw this
unique red rice, well, they knew exactly what to do with it. And thus, a new cuisine would develop,
a fusion of influences from the French and Spanish who had previously colonized Louisiana,
the new American settlers, and most of all, the cooks from West Africa.
All right. So this is not going to be a struggle for the last meal of the day,
as full as we are, because this is the taste of home. And I'm so excited for this. And it smells
great. Like, we've got the jambalaya with andouille sausage and pulp chicken. And we have the gumbo,
which is with seafood shrimp and crab meat, both rice-based dishes from New Orleans. And yeah,
so usually on the channel, when we film at a restaurant that has music playing like this,
we have to ask them to please turn it off for us while we film just because of copyright laws.
It really hurt to make that request here, because this is, again, like Dr. John playing in a New
Orleans-themed restaurant. Steve Miller-Ben was the last song that was just on. And I have to ask
them to please turn it off. But let's give the food a try and then stop talking and also
stop eating, because it's a lot of rice today.
New Orleans food is amazing.
Quite surprised to find a decent version of jambalaya
so far away from home. It's a little bit sweeter than I
would want it. But, you know, that's, I guess, what the local palate wants. It's delicious,
honestly. And the sausage is great.
As my initial excitement wears off, and I start to realize how much we've actually
eaten so far today and how much rice we've eaten so far today, I think there's about time
to wrap this up, both literally and figuratively. I'm going to take this away and bring it home for Daria.
All right, for our last bit of rice history, we return to where we started with that very
first origin story in Vietnam, except this time not in ancient history, but in the 20th century.
It's the last years of the colony of French Indochina, and in spite of what we all know now
was about to happen, there was no sign yet that the country was primed for a communist revolution.
Hell, even Ho Chi Minh was living overseas, where he'd been for almost 30 years. Back home,
the biggest concern wasn't one of politics, it was the much more urgent matter of starvation.
See, the French had realized there was a big market for exported rice, so they were sending
the local stock overseas. And at their factories, they even burned the Vietnamese rice for fuel.
When World War II broke out, things became dire. The Japanese sent an army to take control of
Vietnam, and to keep them at bay, the French signed a treaty, promising Japan a million tons of
Vietnamese rice per year. And then after the two countries entered a sort of shared occupation,
it got even worse, with the Japanese seizing even more food while at the same time forcing
subsistence farmers to switch to military production. Between 1944 and 1945, a catastrophic famine
gripped Vietnam, particularly in the north. And with Ho Chi Minh now back and trying to rally an
army, he found a winning cause in promising not political change, but rice. Back by legions of
rice farmers, his revolution would pick up support, gain steam, and eventually that would lead to
everything that came after. In other words, if the French had simply understood the life or death
importance of rice, the entire course of modern history might have unfolded differently, and it's
possible, maybe even likely, that the Vietnam War would never have happened. The truth is,
there are more stories like this from all throughout history. It was a rice shortage that led to the
fall of the Khmer. Rice riots brought down a Japanese government in 1918, and India and Pakistan
are embroiled in a bitter feud over Basmati, and that's just the tip of the rice bird.
If I have one takeaway from making this video, it's that there's no way to properly do it justice.
That's the thing about a subject like rice, which is so closely linked to everything from
history, commerce, and mythology in countries across the planet. The closer you look, the more
layers you find, from ancient China to India to, well, pretty much everywhere. Today, rice is the
most widely eaten food on earth. It's grown in 117 of the world's 195 countries, and its consumption
continues to increase every single year. It's thrown at newly married couples at weddings,
celebrated with festivals across Asia and Africa, and used in religious rituals in the Indian
subcontinent. It provides billions of people with sustenance and a source of income, and is both
affordable enough to feed a family, and diverse enough to please the best chefs from across the
planet. Rice tells the story of cultures, empires, and trade, and it's a story that we're still
uncovering, with new research continuing to broaden our understanding of just how important
this simple grain has been since the very beginning of time. This might not be a complete narrative,
there's so much more we could still cover, more rebellions and origin legends, and so many more
dishes out there for us to try. But for now, at the very least, we can say that this has been our
very best attempt at covering the most important story in the history of food, the story of rice.
