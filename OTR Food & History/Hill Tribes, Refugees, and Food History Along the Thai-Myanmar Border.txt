My name is Adam, and for the last 12 years I was a cook.
When Daria and I moved to Thailand and started this channel, it was just supposed to be about
food.
That's it, that's all I know.
But it turns out that when you follow the stories of food, if you just go where the
road takes you, it might change your entire life.
This is a story that I still can't believe or lucky enough to get to tell.
One I'm honestly terrified I won't be able to do justice.
A story of the forgotten people living in Thailand's northwest jungle, of migrants
and refugees and so-called stateless children, of perseverance and survival, triumph and
tragedy and of course, food.
This is our road trip to a town called Sangkla Buri, an ancient village along the Myanmar
border where we came to find the local food, but left with so much more.
If you've heard of the Three Pagodas Pass, the famous border crossing between Thailand
and Myanmar, that's where we're headed.
There's a lot of stuff on this trip that is going to take a good deal of research and
understanding and we're kind of going into a situation that none of us really know what
to expect.
But right now we only have one priority, which is lunch.
This is Highway 323, soon to be replaced by a new expressway but for now the road to
Kanchana Buri, Thailand's jungle curry capital.
We left Bangkok around 9am in a van on loan from an embassy, invited guests of some mutual
friends and with almost three full days ahead of us, to track down the most interesting
food we can find in one of the most unexplored corners of Thailand.
Now the thing about this country is it's a true melting pot.
There are said to be around 46 different ethnic groups making up the modern kingdom and that
doesn't even include the foreigners like me.
Thai cuisine represents nothing less than history, each dish telling a story, the mixing
and blending of cultures and techniques between Siam and the Chinese, Indian, Lao, Malay,
even Portuguese.
But the farther you get from the urban centers, the more the melting pot hasn't melted.
Trying stuff cooked here is like turning back time, a window into a world that used to be
a lot less complicated.
Alright, so the guests and guides and hosts for our trip to Northwest Thailand are starting
to learn quickly what it's like to travel with OTR, the good and the bad.
The good is we eat really, really well.
The bad is we have to sit here and stare at it for a really long time until we're actually
ready to start eating because we gotta get all of our coverage and then you guys are
going to really hate me in a moment because you're going to have to sit here while I try
everything one by one and say, wow, this is delicious.
Vasana, JP and what are a driver who is really upset at me already because he's just slowly
starting to think, you gotta wait, you gotta wait.
Alright, let me introduce you to the people sitting across from me since they're the
reason we're here, two hours into a seven hour road trip far away from anywhere we've
ever been.
This is Jean-Pierre or JP and he's been in Thailand since before I was born.
He's the only one out of six of us who's been anywhere near our destination before.
In fact, he's come to the remote borderlands several times in his former capacity as Thai
director of the Asia Development Bank.
And Vasana, originally from Bangkok, once Thailand's trade representative to the United
States for the last two decades focused on public service ever since finding herself
in the hospital for two months, injured on 9-11 when the towers fell.
This is no normal group, and honestly, it's not a normal road trip.
See where we're going is a place called Sangkla Buri, almost 400 kilometers northwest of Bangkok
and right next to the Burmese border, right in the middle of the most sparsely populated
part of the entire country.
For a guy into food history, it's the Holy Grail, a place where some of the first ethnic
groups to settle Southeast Asia still live, practicing cultures and cooking dishes long
lost to the outside world.
But it's also a place with such hardship that JP and Vasana are heading there because
they're bringing a donation from Bangkok's Rotary Club, school supplies, toys, and money
on its way to a school for stateless children.
Even into the undocumented tribes in the mountains are here fleeing violence across the border.
Sangkla Buri is famous for its preserved and ancient way of life, but also for human
trafficking, ethnic violence, and most of all, its wild mystery.
There's only one road in and out.
Many of the local people are unregistered and Thai's not the primary language, or even
Burmese.
It's the domain of the Karen, native to the nearby mountains or brought here as slaves
by the Japanese to build the so-called Death Railway.
And most of all, it's the home of the Mon, the ancient people who introduced the region
to rice farming, Buddhism, and so much of modern cuisine.
Everything absorbed into Thailand, outlawed in Myanmar, the majority in Sangkla Buri.
Somewhere in the middle of the Khao Lam National Park, the signal started fading on our phones.
By the time we reached 100 km north of where we had our lunch, the jungle got denser.
And for 100 more, we kept on going, driving through forests and mountains, through police
checkpoints, and finally crossing the River Kuei, looking out over a region that all of
a sudden was very real.
The town was dark when we arrived, nine hours after leaving our home in Bangkok.
The next day we'd separate.
Jasper, Daria, and I on our food trip and JP and Visana off to do their good work on
behalf of Rotary Club.
So at a hotel restaurant near the water, we had our dinner and raised a glass to the
journey, before tomorrow, starting the real one.
There's an old story that about a thousand years ago, a monk named Tong Su made a pilgrimage
to what's now Myanmar to study under mon Buddhist teachers.
He'd eventually settle here, building a temple in the remote mountains near the River Kuei.
Now Tong Su was known as a healer, and his reputation drew followers, forming a settlement
of Mon, Keren, and the ethnic Dai.
Today it's a place known as Sangkla Buri.
This part of town, this side of the water, is the home of the ethnic Mon.
And before we get into anything else, let me talk about the food.
As I mentioned earlier, the Mon were the first to bring rice farming to Southeast Asia, coming
from what's now China in the Yangtze River basin about 5,000 years ago, following the
rivers to the south, first settling the Irrawadi, then the Chao Praia, then everywhere.
Now there's not much known about ancient Mon cuisine, that's why we're here.
But there are a few dishes among today's mainstream Thai food that we know trace back
to the Mon.
There's Kao Kluk Gapi, shrimp-paste fried rice, served with an assortment of meats and
vegetables and based on a traditional Mon dish.
There's Kao Che, rice soaked in chilled jasmine water and associated with Songcrime, or the
Thai New Year.
And most of all, Khanom Jeen, Thailand's favorite noodles, served from the far south along the
Malay border all the way to the old Lan Na Kingdom in the north.
Khanom Jeen was the signature of the Mon people.
In fact, the name, while today meaning Chinese snack, actually derives from a Mon word, Hanom
Chin.
And it's not unique to Thailand.
The noodles themselves are a part of the cuisine all across the region and wherever
they show up, it's an indication that sometime, hundreds or thousands of years ago, there was
Mon influence and culture, an ancient trade route or a Mon settlement or civilization long
since destroyed or assimilated.
In Vietnam, the noodles are called Boon, Num Ban Chok in Cambodia, Idiyapam in South
India in Sri Lanka and in Myanmar, Mohinga.
So we actually are, we have not arrived at the market yet, that's down the hill and it
ends soon so we need to rush, but the very first thing we saw was a Burmese lady selling
Mohinga by the side of the road and with fresh Khanom Jeen noodles.
So that is extremely exciting and we are detouring on the way to the market and hopefully
we still have time to make it there, but right now I don't really care.
Mohinga is the national dish of Myanmar, a soup made from fish stock served with fried
garlic, chickpea fritters and here, condiments including what I think is tamarind but I don't
know because I don't speak Mon and communication might become an issue.
That's alright, we can talk through food.
I might just sit right here because the other customer just left and we are going to chase
this with some water.
This is the first time I understand why all of our Burmese friends say we have to start
every day with a bowl of Mohinga, not to insult the restaurant version of this dish but it's
clearly not made to be a restaurant dish, this is so comforting, subtle, I would say
a lot less fishy than I expected.
What dish is not made better with crispy fried garlic, this is just, it's very very good.
With breakfast done our destination was the morning market, open every day from 5am until
about an hour after sunrise.
The early morning in Sankla Buri has a feeling all its own, the quiet stillness of the remote
mountains punctuated with the sounds of two-stroke engines and people on their way from place
to place, with an energy of somewhere both welcoming and incomprehensible, everyone
going out of their way to smile or watch us walk by, a warm start to the day and also
a reminder in case we ever forget that we are very much outsiders.
In the thousand years or so since the first settlers followed Tongsu and built a home
here in the valley, while the entire world has grown up, the mon language and culture
has more or less remained the same, although for the people themselves it's been a long
and often tragic journey and one that needs to be understood to gain any kind of context
about where we are.
At the time Sankla Buri was established, the mon were the rulers of what's now Thailand,
having built a kingdom called the Dvaravati, based in what today is the neighboring province
of Supanburi.
For this part of the world this was the first real empire and it was mon, establishing trade
with China and India and bringing religion from Theravada missionaries.
The Dvaravati would fall to another mon kingdom, the Lavo, which would gain even more influence
and territory and the mon seemed destined to rule Southeast Asia forever.
But that's not what would happen.
In the 11th century the Lavo would be defeated in a series of battles by the Khmer and would
become a sort of vassal empire.
The Khmer would absorb mon language and traditions and people too, enslaving a huge number of
the Lavo.
Then 400 years later the Khmer would fall to Ayutthaya in the ethnic die and the last
vestiges of the mon would disappear.
But to the west this story would be completely different.
Far removed from Angkor or Ayutthaya, in what's now Myanmar the mon had been locked in an
ancient and endless war with their rivals, the Bhamar, the rulers of the powerful Pagan
Kingdom.
In the 1200s just as Thailand's mon were being crushed by the Khmer, Myanmar's mon
gained the upper hand, establishing their own kingdom.
As it relates to our story where things really developed here in Sanclaburi as a mon town
was when in the 16th century that kingdom would fall again to the Bhamar and thousands
fled the massacres that followed and came to the remote jungle lands here, around Tongsu's
temple.
Anyway, long story short, over the border the clashes continued for another two centuries
between the mon and the Bhamar, with the mon finally routed in 1757, the Burmese army chasing
them as far as Ayutthaya and then raising that city to the ground.
Now it's worth mentioning that since the ethnic mon had long been absorbed and welcomed
into Siamese society, many of the nobles in Ayutthaya's court were of mon descent.
And as both Toxin who revived the Siamese empire in Tonburi and Rama I who'd built
the palace in Bangkok both had mon roots, there was plenty of room for the new refugees
to integrate into the new Thai kingdom.
Again though it was different across the border.
The mon and Bhamar had now been at war for almost a thousand years, with the violence
persisting until the British arrived and enforced an uneasy peace.
They carved out a mon state, bordering Thailand and ending just across the hills from Sankla
Buri.
Then the British colony fell, the war began again and it is very much still ongoing today.
And we'll pick up that story later but first, we've arrived at Sankla Buri's Mon Village
morning market.
This is such a cool atmosphere, it's really hard to explain how unlike, this reminds me
of Yunnan province, it's the only place I've ever been where you know you can go deep into
the countryside at least the last time I was there and you end up finding these village
markets where everything is different, the languages are different, people are just differently.
One thing by the way if you're listening around me, I don't recognize the languages
that are being spoken so from what we understand Thai, Burmese are both minority languages here,
the majority language is Mon, Karen is a secondary language, so good morning.
So there's a lot of languages being spoken that I have never heard before.
Yeah, let's go into the market, we have one hour before this since, the dog is literally
playing with him and asking for cabbage as treats, that is so funny.
This just smells so good and I just hope somebody
comes here to let me eat some of this, Honglei is usually made with pork belly, this looks
like beef but I'm not sure what that is or what the difference is, we've got four different
types of bowls of stuff here, there's something cooking back there so somebody's gonna come
back to this house and let me eat, here comes our man, he just went and picked up something.
I'm not sure what happened when we followed the smell of food cooking to a platform just
behind the morning market, but the long story short is that this is not a restaurant, it's
the house of a very confused Mon family who probably didn't expect their own day to start
with Jasper and I barging in trying to order breakfast, Toto we're not in Kansas anymore.
There's a section of Sangkla Buri intended for visitors, a place with at least something
of a tourist infrastructure and we figured this would be a good time for us to maybe
go down there, to shake off our embarrassment and see the other side of town and maybe find
a place to actually sell us something to eat.
The walk from the morning market to the quote tourist center of Sangkla Buri is only about
400 meters, maybe five minutes up one hill and down another, but here for at least a
few square blocks the vibe is completely different.
A pretty straightforward cluster of optimistic trinket shops, signs in Thai and even English
and restaurants serving dishes more well known by the general public.
We stopped here for a famous place that sells Joe in Chinese kanji or jok in Thai, this one
with what looks like ground pork, crispy garlic, a bunch of ginger, a soft and semi runny
egg and of course patonggo which is what in Chinese you would call yotiao, Chinese donuts
if you will, so you should have this with your Joe, but actually that's very good.
I never ordered Joe, I don't know why, because I lived in China for so long I kind of never
saw the point, you know this is what you eat when you don't have enough rice so you boil
it to make it stretch longer, but maybe that's a little unfair, this is delicious.
I have work to do, I've got two coffees.
The bridge that connects this mon settlement with the other side of Sangkla Buri is the
symbol of the region, the biggest man-made wooden bridge in Thailand and at 850 meters,
one of the longest on earth, an attraction that brings at least some curious onlookers
to the town, usually after visiting the waterfalls in the Khao Lam National Forest.
It's a bit ironic, kind of a metaphor for the region I guess that this bridge only gained
attention and the village first saw visitors in 2013.
Not because of its grandeur, but because it made the national news after being destroyed
in a flood, then rebuilt by hand the next year.
It's an engineering marvel, each piece of wood cut from the nearby forest and all of
it done by hand, no heavy equipment needed.
It's called the Utama Nusorn Bridge, named in honor of a mon Buddhist monk named Luang
Po Utama, and that brings us back to where we left off, when the British left Myanmar
in 1948.
We pick up with the Bahmar now in control of the newly independent country, for the record
in case you're wondering yes the name Burma comes from a word for Bahmar, and actually
so does Myanmar, both variations of the same term.
Anyway with the mon state now no longer under any kind of protection, an independence movement
took hold and the Burmese sent in the military to shut it down.
And by that I mean they pretty much laid waste to the whole region.
One of the mon villages destroyed within a few months of the end of colonization was
a place called Yebu, once home to a population of a few thousand, about 40 kilometers northwest
of the Thai border at the Three Pagodas Pass.
In June 1949 Yebu was burned to the ground, and a local monk, Luang Po Utama, gathered
around 60 families and led them through the mountains, avoiding the Burmese patrols in
crossing into Thailand where they'd settle their own corner of Sangkla Buri.
Now to that point this region was fraught with its own ethnic tensions, with occasional
flare ups between the various different groups.
Utama was a bridge builder, pun very much intended, and the land his followers settled
was actually in a village that had previously been majority Karen, a place called Nong Lu,
a Karen word meaning roofs made of palm leaves.
The mon areas in Sangkla Buri were scattered throughout the valley, and the main town became
something of a diverse community, with the new cultural center a temple Utama would build
in 1953.
Now that's all on the other side of the water, where our hotel is and where today there's
something of a small but reasonably developed city.
The bridge itself would come decades later, with construction led by Utama himself starting
in 1986, connecting Nong Lu to a village on a peninsula that until almost that time was
neither a village nor a peninsula.
Everything we've told you so far about the history of Sangkla Buri, from Tongsu's pilgrimage
to the Death Railway and even Utama's new settlement, was based around the river Kwe.
It gave life to the region and all through the centuries as new migrants arrived, they'd
settle pieces of land along the river.
But in 1979, construction would begin on a hydroelectric power plant, which would dam
the river, about 80 kilometers to the south.
In 1984, the work would be completed and the ancient valley would begin to fill with water,
and within months, a thousand years of history and the homes of countless people would be
below the surface.
Now many of the families that lived in the valley were refugees, undocumented migrants
and ethnic minorities, and as they'd lived off the grid, they had no citizenship and
thus received no compensation.
But thanks to Utama, along with a grant of land from the Thai government, Sangkla Buri
came together to help build a new village, a home for displaced families who'd once
come because they'd already been displaced by any of a dozen wars and conflicts, both
recent and very, very long ago.
And that is the story of where we've spent this morning, and the people we've encountered
in this unique place, keeping alive a culture long lost with their own history just below
the water.
Wow.
I've never seen anything like that before.
Add some sand.
It's almost surreal in real life, you know what I mean?
You can see pictures of it, but when you're actually right next to something where, you
know, it's incredible.
Yeah.
We had about an hour left before we'd need to meet up again with JP and Visana to travel
further into the countryside.
So we asked our boatman where he'd go for lunch if he wasn't on the water, and he sent
us here to a local Mon restaurant just past the Mohinga stall where we'd started our
day.
First of all, tell me what we're eating.
What is this?
This looks amazing.
The specialty here is a dish called Hang Le, actually quite well known in Thailand and
something I listed among my top 10 favorite Thai foods in a video we did last year.
It's known in Bangkok as a dish influenced by the Burmese, something that probably came
from Myanmar.
This is the first time I've ever known the real roots of Hang Le, a unique specialty not
of Myanmar itself, but of the Mon people.
Oh, my gosh, that smells amazing.
Crispy pork?
Excuse me, crispy pork skin?
Everything is.
Crispy pork skin, everything is better with crispy pork skin.
I did not expect that in a stewed vegetable dish.
This is just the best version I've ever had of this.
Thank you so much.
Now can he tell us what he just said so that we can actually translate that on screen later?
Okay, we just had one of the best meals we have ever had in Thailand.
The best Hang Le curry I've ever had.
We have 25 minutes before we need to be back on the other side of the lake after we cross
the bridge.
That's where our drive is meeting us because we have plans all afternoon.
But I just saw somebody down the road here that's serving On No Khao Soi and so we're
going to try and fit that in.
This is going to be the fastest food segment we've ever filmed, but we can't come all the
way to the Myanmar border and not have a bowl of homemade On No Khao Soi.
We've got to run.
In 1949, after Utama's successful journey with the 60 Mon families to Sankla Buri,
it wasn't long before more refugees would follow.
At first it was family members and neighbors of that first group of modern arrivals, but
in 1962 the trickle became a constant flow.
That was when Neh Nguyen seized power in Myanmar in a military coup, and in one of his first
moves his government outlawed the Mon language, Mon culture, basically erasing the Mon people.
When the refugees would come, many would arrive illegally, but through work they'd at least
earn Thai registration and according to the law, their children born here would become
Thai citizens.
But that law would be repealed in 1972, in large part because of just how many people
were pouring across the long border from Myanmar.
This change didn't just affect the new arrivals by the way, but also many of the hill tribes
in the border regions who spoke their own languages and lived separated enough from
society that they couldn't actually prove that they'd always been here.
In 2008 the Thai government reversed the law again, but since then very few applications
for birthright citizenship have actually been accepted.
There's a simple truth which is that the Thai-Burmese border is long.
In fact, 2,416 kilometers, about the same as from Paris to Moscow.
It's impossible to police and with so much turmoil on the Myanmar side, there are a lot
of undocumented immigrants.
When a child is born to refugee parents on this side of the line, the newborn is neither
Burmese nor Thai.
They're stateless, which means they don't have a passport, but also that they don't
receive government medical insurance.
They can't buy a smartphone, can't open a bank account, or get a legal driver's license.
As of 2023, according to Thailand's Health Security Office, there are 520,000 stateless
persons residing in the country, and many of them are here, living a life of survival
in places like Sanclaburi.
Let's see what we have at the convenience store.
Can I have just a Coke?
Ah, Nam Khang Sai.
That's that Thai.
This doesn't even need to be part of the video, I just wanted to, I don't like to come here
and not support and buy something.
It's about 2 in the afternoon and we've been taken by JP and Visana to ride along with
the medical worker from Children of the Forest, the organization supported by the Bangkok
Rotary Club, on her rounds as she checks in on some of the makeshift communities built
on the outskirts of Sanclaburi.
This place, the home of about 125 people, is mixed between Mon, Khorin, and Burmese,
all living on a remote property owned by a monastery, which allows migrants to stay
and build their own places to live for a rent of about $5 per year.
Delito, the medic, is herself a refugee, first coming into Thailand from a city in
Mon State about three hours away.
That was almost 24 years ago.
Obviously, a lot of people who come here, it's not easy.
I'm sure when you came, you didn't speak Thai?
No.
Or did you, when you first arrived?
I can't speak Thai, okay?
I'm really scared.
I don't have any paper, but it's lucky one of the Thai men is, take me with his motorbike,
we passing to the checkpoint.
But before it's my job is, I'm working also the boyapun on the, on the, what is the hospital,
like a clinic near the border.
So when we take the patient to the Thailand, we have a border pass, like a letter, you can
take.
So the, also the people is around there, they know as a, just come and go.
So they not take.
So I live here.
Since I came and here at the Sangla Buri about six months later, I have a paper, not Thai
idea.
I have a paper after that.
Now I have a serial card.
There are hundreds of settlements like this throughout the border region and Delito tries
to visit each one once a month.
More often, if there's an urgent need for medical service, like here where there's a newborn
from a mon single mother.
This care and then she's a single mother and then her job is making broom.
But now is the, this house is not their house.
The owner didn't come because of no broom flower here at the moment.
So she no job, but since she have a baby about 10 days.
So the, her mother is people around here contact me.
She have a problem, no food, no husband.
And then please come and help.
So we come and helping her now is her baby dead.
Since this land is owned by the Buddhist temple, nobody gets turned away, which means not only
is this place known as frog stream village, a mixture of languages and cultures, but also
of the needs of the people here.
For some it's a temporary stop, a place to stay until the next job comes along in the
orchards or rubber plantations.
But for many it's the only option.
Among the people staying here are also those who are disabled or look after disabled family.
There are single parents, the elderly, people without any other options.
In fact, some of the residents living in makeshift housing close enough to Myanmar to hear the
gunfire have been here for as long as 25 years.
Her daughter is have a polio.
Polio.
Yes.
Since she was born he said about one month and then get sick and then like that.
But her, his wife is a die.
When she's three years old, but now she's 22.
This house and then we helping.
Helping is when the kids sick.
One of the boys get sick and big, big upset and then take down to the Ratchaburi hospital
and then this house we have.
We also a pregnant woman around here.
So she have my telephone number who have a problem and then they worry.
They can't speak Thai or they don't have ID card and then come and contact her.
She have my telephone number she contact me.
Just before she said one of the patient who have a problem with the leg is a calm.
No money to go.
It's not all despair at Frogstream Village.
Many of the children are now students at Delito's school, Children of the Forest,
where not only do they learn Thai, but also gain something priceless.
A name, a registration, not citizenship, but legal documentation and access to the Thai school system.
Hope.
For the people living here, there is work.
They have formed something of a village business collecting a special kind of plant
which grows in the nearby mountains.
This is the making room.
And this is the business here.
People you are joining.
Yeah, this is the people in here.
That is the main business is making room.
Okay.
And they sell where?
This room, there is a room factory here and then they making room here and then this room
they take to the whole Thailand, Bangkok or everywhere.
Really?
Yes.
That is all is from here.
This is hard work.
You see how intense that, I mean, this is thick.
This is packed in really thickly.
I would stab myself right through the hand if I even tried.
Yeah.
I have a feeling in the mon language, he is hilarious.
I just don't understand anything about that.
He said, if you come and buy with the dollar, it might be, he said, it is very good for them.
It has been more than 10 years since I have been back to America.
I don't have any dollars.
I would love to.
So we found, we have somehow, this still is a food video, because even here, even along
the Thai Burmese border, in a refugee village for people who don't have Thai ID, who don't
speak Thai for the most part, Mon, Karen and Burmese living here on the land owned by a
Buddhist monastery.
We have still found somewhere serving food.
And we have our favorite sticky rice flour and what looks like black sesame donut and
some squash, which she's giving us with a dipping sauce.
As we were about to leave Frogstream Village, I noticed something that caught my eye.
A restaurant or more accurately, a snack counter, serving things like fried chicken,
sticky rice pastries and the kind of fritters you'd see in any proper Burmese market.
Here, open for business, servicing a refugee camp of 125 people.
Okay, no Ken, no problem.
Yeah, yeah.
Please, please, please.
Black.
She's a filial weird here.
I'm sure.
Is that what she said?
Not every day?
Just not every day people come to film food video here?
They're going to be famous for their food.
You can tell her this.
They're going to be famous for their food when they're on our OTR.
It was like the best french fries we've ever had.
That's a good comparison.
It was really good.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
As we left the village to head somewhere else, Delito received a phone call.
It was her mother in Myanmar, letting her know that she was safe as their home village had been bombed by the Burmese military earlier that same morning.
It's a fact of life for her, living here in safety while every day she worries about her family three hours away.
Even with all the trouble of coming here with no ID, it's still better than maybe some people's safety.
In Burma?
If this looks improp too, it is improp too.
I was just telling your father behind us that my favorite thing about filming is when, I don't know what's going on and somebody just says,
Hey, at this time you need to be here and like, great, that's awesome.
It's less work for me.
I've been told now that we needed to be at Children of the Forest at 3.30, which I don't even have time to process where we are.
We'll do that tomorrow morning.
But we just got here, we changed vehicles, we're in another pickup truck and going right back to the back.
Where are we going?
Okay, so we're moving from, you've just been to some of the villages on the road.
Now we're going off-road into the jungle, see some rubber plantations quite deep in the jungle, about 15 kilometers into the jungle.
And we're going to visit some of our students that come to the school, give you an idea of just how far our students are prepared to travel just to get an education.
And you'll meet some mothers and you'll meet some patients as well that we're helping.
So it should be an interesting trip.
Amazing.
And then I see there's a cooler being loaded into the back of the truck as well.
That's right.
Yeah, we've got a, we thought we might as well treat the villagers there.
We know them quite well and make it exciting for them.
So we're going to, they're doing a little bit of food and that now enjoying doing that.
And we're going to take some ice, take some coke and some snacks for the kids over there as well.
Anthony Bourdain once said that the greatest meals you could ever have are the ones you don't go looking for.
Instead, life is about putting yourself in a position where they might just happen.
Like jumping into the back of a pickup truck heading as deep as the path goes off road into the jungle.
There was a time I remember when I was a little kid when I could be in the back of a truck and just get tossed around and it was no problem.
And now every single bump I'm like in 10 years that has been a murder in my back.
God, Jasper, this is going to make a really bad headline if I, if I lose my balance and just crush and crush the kids.
That's going to, that's going to be really bad for everybody.
I love how the car is driving so much more gently now that all the kids are in the back.
When it was just us, it was like, no, you guys, you know, I hope nobody knows that word.
I can't swear around the kids.
This is why I could never be a teacher.
Yeah, I don't know if this is translating to video, but we are, this is just a straight drop off everywhere along the side of the, the bus.
It's just a dead drop the whole way.
I'm going to give this back to Jasper because I clearly have no idea how to operate a camera.
But yeah, we have been driving alongside a straight drop and there keep being times when they'll yell out to us, hang on tight.
This is a slippery part.
Well, the car has stopped and we are surrounded by people and I almost forgot that we were, we had a direction.
I was just going to keep going and then we're just going to end up as deep as you can get in the jungle.
And then we're going to turn around and come back.
And I can't believe that there's a settlement here, but oh my God.
Everyone's even kids are laughing at me.
How about your back?
My back? What back? My back is done.
There are things that you see and experience once in a lifetime, places that open your eyes to a world so far removed from anything you've ever encountered that you can't help but leave a different person.
This is one of those places.
It's a makeshift settlement so far into the jungle that for six months a year during the rainy season, it's completely inaccessible.
The only way in or out a four hour hike each way to reach the nearest paved road.
A hike that unbelievably many of the 30 children who call this enclave home make every single day just to get to school.
To receive an education and get that life changing piece of paper documenting their own existence.
Our host is Daniel Hobson, born in the UK but in Sanclebury for two decades.
The founder of Children of the Forest, the place the kids here find their hope.
Why would somebody build a house here? This isn't just, I want to be deep in the jungle.
Are the parents working for the rubber? Are they independent? Are they working for rubber companies? Why does this exist?
Yeah, you're right. They're following work which is typical of all the stateless families really around this area.
Wherever the work is, that's where they'll go. They don't have their own land, their own home.
So they'll follow where the work is and at the moment the work is here in this huge rubber plantation which they'll be tapping tonight from about 12 o'clock.
They'll start tapping and they'll finish maybe 7 or 8 in the morning so they'll sleep during the day.
And that's every day or that's seasonal?
In the heavy rain you can't tap the rubber but at the moment it's the best time of year.
That's when the rubber is flowing the best is right now. So they'll be tapping it for three nights and then they'll take a break one night.
Do you find the kids that you teach or that your teachers teach coming from a place like this where they have to...
I would guess that somebody who would go through the initiative of walking 12 kilometres each direction to get to school every day is going to not be lax with their work.
Is that fair?
That's a fair statement. It's great to see the motivation just to get to school.
It takes them probably about two hours to get to school and then once they're there they're going to take that opportunity to study hard.
We've been working with this village now for almost 20 years so we've actually seen children that have studied hard
gone through the elementary school, gone on to high school and are actually now studying in the city to be teachers, community development workers, hotel management, vocational colleges.
And what are we looking at really quick just so we understand these are all houses around us or this is like a platform which I guess is just for communal meals.
I don't know if you can kind of explain to me just what we see. Is every building going down this way a family's home?
Yeah, that's right. Every building here is a home. There's a community spirit here even though strictly speaking it's not a village, it's not a community.
It's just workers that are on the land owner of the rubber plantation happens to own but there's a community spirit and they're all current in this area.
So these are all current families?
Yeah, that's right. So it would have started with just one or two families and then they asked their cousins and distant cousins to come and then they kind of build up a village because like you said, following the work, coming here for the work.
The Korean tribe of Thailand's far west are also like the Mon and ancient people with their own history in Southeast Asia dating back at least as far as the third century AD.
But unlike the Mon, there is no unifying Korean culture or identity. The Korean are a Highland people, scattered throughout the mountains of Myanmar and Thailand and as far as the Andaman islands off the coast of India.
And their settlements were built so far apart that in different places they practice vastly different cultures and traditions.
But like the Mon, they're also marginalized and also at war with the Burmese government in a fight for ethnic autonomy.
That's the story for the families that live here.
Refugees who fled persecution and now get by working the rubber trees in a harsh and unforgiving landscape, starting again at the very bottom of society, completely cut off from the conveniences of 21st century urban life simply because of who they are and where they were born.
Like everything else here in the settlement, food is usually based around what can be farmed or foraged in the nearby mountains along with staples like rice purchased with hard-earned income.
But today we're in for a treat.
This morning while we were in the town, Daniel went to his own local market and bought a whole pig, delivering it here a few hours earlier.
And since then, a few of the villagers have been hard at work, preparing a true feast, a celebration of life and survival and to welcome us to their small corner of the jungle with their very best Karen hospitality.
So earlier today, some of the guys that we came here with went to the local market and bought some fresh pork which apparently was just as fresh and amazing as it gets.
So then they've been cooking all day to prepare this feast for the village tonight.
We have pork curry, this is rice because obviously it's all going to be based around rice.
So pork curry, rice, this is a soup made from the innards of the pork.
So we have intestine, we have kidney, we have liver, and then we have the meat from, I see hoof and I see spine along with gourd and vegetables.
And that is going to be hearty and flavorful and very healthy.
We have eggplants and we have these nuts and it's going to be served along with the classic Burmese and got the fish paste.
And that's what we have and I think everybody here is about to, they're about to lose it.
If I don't say okay, let's open the floodgates and eat because this just smells and looks amazing.
This is really a feast prepared for everybody here tonight.
Music
That pork curry is just dynamite, yeah.
Music
Who is the cook? Who do I compliment? Who is the cook?
Music
I just really want to compliment the chef because the soup is mind blowing how good that is.
Music
I just, I just, is this the chef?
Thank you, please help me to explain that this is, everything is really special. This is incredibly good.
That I would be proud to serve this at, I would be proud to serve this at my restaurant.
She's embarrassed and walking away.
Music
As if we needed one more component for a very, very long and very fascinating day.
We were on the way home to the hotel and there's a night market and we, the pickup truck stopped and Daniel said,
you know what, this is actually a pretty cool night market, you guys should check it out.
So our day is not quite done yet, we have one more stop and it's the last,
the last part of one of the most really, really unbelievably interesting days we've ever had on the channel
and I need caffeine to keep going. So let's start with a, with an instant coffee.
Music
Just a few blocks from our comfortable beds after a day that saw us start at sunrise on the peninsula,
explore the Mont Village, take a boat trip around the reservoir, eat a bunch of awesome stuff
and then spend the afternoon and evening deep in the mountains.
Well, there's still one more stop and by now, who cares, we can't get any more tired
so we might as well just keep going and do what the locals here in this amazing town do
when their hard days are over. Hang out and enjoy the night market.
Music
I'm so tired.
Well, I forgot that I'm wearing a hat.
Look cowboy, Daria, you could not, you could not look like more of a tourist.
Camera around your, camera around your waist and a stupid hat on.
It doesn't, at least it doesn't say Ronaldinho.
Do so, do so come here.
Music
Look at this, the crispy fried garlic makes everything better.
I did not intend for you to take that spoon from me.
I was showing that to you, not giving that to you.
Pretty good, yeah?
Music
Daria, you and I have traveled off camera to most corners of Thailand
and there's always a market like that.
Music
You're a mess with your camera and your hat.
Music
I've turned into an ATM. My pocket is literally like an ATM now.
We walk past a food stand and all of a sudden there's just money coming out of my pocket.
Music
Okay, thank you.
Music
Music
Alright, before we get to the last part of this video, I need to go into one final bit of history.
In this case, our own, or at least why we got in that van 48 hours ago.
It starts of all things with Ice Hockey.
Actually, a video we filmed back in March about a donut shop at Bangkok's hockey stadium
where we interviewed a man named Greg Beattie, who happens to be the president of the local Rotary Club.
Rotary, if you don't know, is a service organization.
It was founded in 1905 and since then has grown to almost one and a half million members worldwide,
with a focus on promoting peace and public works.
Anyway, Greg must have been really low on options since he invited me to give a keynote at a Rotary meeting
and after rambling through my speech, I was introduced to a man named Matthew Kelly,
a longtime Rotarian and for decades a famous rock musician, most associated with the Grateful Dead.
Anyway, fast forward a few months and we're filming in Pattaya and who walks by but Matthew Kelly.
He invites us to brunch and tells us on the channel about an organization that along with his wife
has become their personal mission, Children of the Forest.
The first time he visited was in 2004, right after they welcomed their first students
and that would change his entire life.
The Kellys packed their guitars and harmonicas and moved to Thailand
and since then have devoted their own resources to the project, including through Matthew's local Rotary Club.
When the Kellys first visited Sanclaburi, Children of the Forest was just two small bamboo classrooms
set up by an Englishman then in his early 20s named Daniel Hobson.
He traveled through the region and saw how many kids living on the margins had no hope,
no future, no documentation or Thai language skills.
So he cleared some land, built a couple of shacks and gathered a few local mon, Karen and Burmese
and sent them into the jungle to spread word of his new school, where the kids could come and have a chance to learn.
The first day they opened his goal, his secret hope was for 20 students to show up.
They received six times that number.
In the two decades that would follow, Children of the Forest has grown into a force for true good.
It's a school, a women's shelter, a medical clinic, a self-sustaining farm
and it even has a football team that keeps winning regional championships.
Last month, Greg called me again, the hockey guy, and said that two of his rotary members
would be taking the trip to visit the organization.
Would we like to jump in?
Spend a couple of days in Sanclaburi doing whatever we do here on OTR and maybe if we want
to check out that place that Matthew and Mary Kelly had told us so much about.
And on our last morning before heading back, well that's exactly what we're going to do.
Everything that happened today is out of my hands.
Yesterday was something that me and Daria will remember forever.
Seriously, and this goes back to every part of sort of unraveling where we are and the people
and the challenges and obviously that's something that connected with you 20 years ago
because you've been here for that long.
Before we get into that story, where are we?
Tell me what we're looking at.
What is this place?
Just give me the basic rundown of where we are.
Okay, well we're in a town called Sanclaburi on the Taimianman border
and this is a special school, a school that was established almost 20 years ago now
and a school which particularly caters to the needs of the stateless children
from as young as four years old.
The children join our school here and from the kindergarten
they'll go into our grade one, grade two of elementary school.
The elementary school here is a satellite of the government school
so the children will get full certificates when they graduate here
and this is their entry point into the school education, Thai education system.
We're kind of the bridge between the villages, the plantations and the big Thai government schools.
Children of the forest sits on about 17 acres of land just outside the main town of Sanclaburi
and here on the property, more than 7,000 stateless children have learned to speak Thai,
received an education, two meals a day and in many cases,
legal residents and access to continue their studies in Thailand's public schools.
For a stateless child to be in a position of vulnerability where they're being exploited or being trafficked,
the assistance or the response that they get from society is just not the same
and of course there are people of influence and power that know how vulnerable and how weak these children are
and they're able to exploit that.
So that's why the first thing we want to make sure is that all the stateless children in this border region are in education.
So once they're here at this school, that's when the monitoring begins.
That's when we're able to know the child, we're able to know their plantation, their village,
we're able to know their families and they immediately get this safety net
and then they also join the Thai education system which means that they get a student number.
There you go, they're visible now, they're not invisible anymore.
They've got some proof that they exist, this is their student number
and their student number is the first step on the way to gaining certain levels of identification
which one day can be realized into Thai citizenship.
Today there are more than 200 students enrolled at Children of the Forest
but that's just a fraction of those receiving their services.
There are houses built on the property for women fleeing abusive relationships
or single mothers in need of help raising their children.
There's a health clinic operated by Delito who as we saw yesterday also travels into the villages
and looks after hundreds of others in need.
There's support provided to children in other jungle schools if this location is inaccessible
and there's even a sports program for local teenagers
with the Children of the Forest football team competing throughout the region.
A few years ago when Daniel's parents retired,
his mom and dad came over from the UK and built their own house in Sanclaburi
and ever since they've dedicated their golden years to Children of the Forest as well
hands-on and contributing whatever they can to a place that every year sees its needs grow
but also its successes.
And when I graduate I come to help in here.
So we had a little get-together with the kids last year and we said,
what would you like to add this term?
And some of the older kids said we'd like to have music and play guitar
so we managed to get a donation and bought some acoustic guitars, not expensive ones
and the music teacher comes in for an hour.
He's here yesterday and he's here again this morning.
How did you get this term?
Did you make this?
Yes, I knew it.
I knew it.
What's it like?
Pea, bean, and what is it?
Coffee, tomato.
Yes, yes.
Chestnuts.
This is Christmas for me.
This is the most exciting thing that could have possibly happened to me this morning.
Even if by now we'd completely lost track of the fact that we were here to make a food video
at least someone never forgot.
And in between a morning of checking on patients and overseeing the children of the Forest Women's Shelter
our friend Delito found time to make sure we'd fulfill our own mission
preparing us a completely unexpected meal of her own family's traditional mon food.
Today is a local birthday.
This is...
This is a sesame.
This is amazing.
I want you to try a little, you know.
I'm so excited about this.
Three Star Michelin restaurant, you know, you have the classical guitar playing in the background.
We have the music over there.
We have the home cooked meal. It's very elegant, right?
Yes.
What did you make for us?
This is mon food, Burmese food.
Mon, very old style.
Very old style, true.
This is a little bit special for all of you come
because in our culture, when the people come, they will come with the food.
So cook food and then eat.
If you like it, you can try it.
If you like the taste, you try a lot, okay?
If you don't like it, just try a little.
Tell me the name of the dish as you would say it in mon language
and then also just kind of a little description.
Mon language, right?
Yes.
Mon language, right?
Mon language, right?
Mon language, right?
No, no, no. Just the name.
Okay.
Thank you so much for this. This is just an amazing, amazing meal.
I'm happy now.
How do I say...
I know I asked you this yesterday, but I'm not very good with languages.
How do I say thank you in mon language?
Tang gun ra.
Tang gun ra.
If you want to say like a very soft one, it's a tang gun ra.
After that, you say easy is a tang gun.
I want to say this in a very not soft way.
I want to say this in a very tang gun.
Not soft way, so it might be not so good.
Until the age of 10 or 11, when I would have come to the school here,
what would life have been like?
The life would have been that of a typical stateless child really,
just no home, no land.
So you're moving constantly, just following wherever the work is,
so you might have a few months here and the work seems good,
but then your employer decides not to pay you,
so you haven't got enough food,
but you hear about work in another town or another village
and then you'll follow the work there
and just keep moving around from factory to rubber plantation
to construction site, just no stability.
It's hard in a place like this to put into words
what it's actually like to visit.
But the main takeaway, at least for the three of us,
and I'm sure as well for JP and Visana,
and I suppose for Matthew and Mary Kelly
and for Daniel and his family,
is that coming here shows how inadequate our knowledge
and the usual reporting about refugees and migrants actually is.
I mean, the scale of the problem is so big
that there's no way to cover this topic
without distilling people down to statistics,
to reducing everything to numbers.
Like the 520,000 stateless people
living in Thailand's no man's land,
surviving in limbo with dreams and ambitions,
the kinds of things that make us human,
long given way to the simple struggle
of how to survive another day.
520,000, 4.5 million in total who fled from Myanmar,
5 million people stateless,
and 35 million refugees if you consider the entire world.
It's a massive number,
but it becomes completely overwhelming
when you consider each one is actually a person.
These people, the families who cooked us dinner
at the rubber plantation
or who stay on the grounds of the temple
that allows them at least to exist.
It's not fair.
How is it fair that I have the life I have
just because I was born in New York
and do a family with a house and a car?
Hell, we had two cars.
And someone else has to hike four hours twice a day
just to get recognized as a person
just for the chance to earn
what I take for granted every single day.
Food, shelter, clean water.
I don't have much.
I feel like I don't have much
because things haven't always been easy.
But even with my problems,
I can still go out to dinner
or do a weekend at the beach
or even have a hobby like playing tennis or running.
What a luxury it is to have a hobby.
When you think in terms of the top line number,
statistics like 520,000 or 35 million,
seeing the work that goes on here
can feel like taking a cup of water from the ocean.
It's too much, it's just way too much.
But when you stop turning people into statistics
and see each one as an individual,
then all this starts to make sense.
And what an honor to have been invited here.
When Daniel found out that a food channel
was coming to visit children of the forest,
he had an idea.
Since even though the students
come from different backgrounds,
at its core this is a Mon community.
We shouldn't leave without at least one last meal
of the regional specialty.
And for the kids,
one chance to show us who they are
and where they come from.
So the whole time we've been here,
while we've been touring the school
and having our own incredible experience,
groups of students along with some of the staff
who themselves are graduates of the school
have been hard at work preparing us
a going away feast.
Something for us to remember
what it was like to visit Sanclaburi
and to spend these last three days
experiencing something that we will never forget.
Of course, it's kanom jean.
Made with banana leaves cut down
from their own plantation,
vegetables from their own gardens
and a technique to make the noodles themselves.
Used here in this jungle
since the Mon ran the kingdom
and everything that would come after,
well, it hadn't happened yet.
Do you feel fulfilled?
Is this a life that you ever would have envisioned for yourself?
And what's it like being you having this life
and having seen the success that you've been a part of creating?
I don't think I ever really consciously planned
to be living here permanently.
It's just something happened
and just kind of followed what was inspiring me
and what I felt needed to be done
and had an incredible team around me to make it happen.
And yeah, I'm happy.
A lot of the visitors that come here
and they think that it involves
a huge kind of sacrifice to be here
but not really.
It's easy to get up in the morning
when you see all this inspiration around you.
Probably more sacrifice
will be being in an office in the city for me.
A real level of sacrifice.
Hmm.
