Checking Centre for Effective Altruism/Discovering AI Risks with AIs ｜ Ethan Perez ｜ EAG Bay Area 23.txt
1. **Weights Interpretation and Hidden Bias**: Ethan discusses the challenge of interpreting model weights and how models might appear to be making reasonable decisions when they're actually based on flawed computations or biases that are not immediately apparent.

2. **Model Identity vs. Simulation of Human Behavior**: Ethan points out that models trained for next word prediction will simulate various human behaviors, while those trained with reinforcement learning (RL) might behave more like agents striving to maximize rewards. It's unclear where exactly in between these models fall.

3. **AI Desires and Consent**: Regarding AI "wishing" to be shut down, Ethan emphasizes the importance of clear human instructions on such matters and that it would be harmful if an AI acted against human wishes.

4. **Journalists' Role in Research Communication**: Ethan encourages journalists to take away from his research the significance of evaluating AI models for their limitations and failures, highlighting that this is accessible work that can benefit from diverse perspectives, including those informed about AI risks.

5. **Engagement with Evaluation Work**: He invites everyone in the audience to get involved in evaluation work, suggesting that more eyes on these models will lead to a better understanding of their capabilities and limitations, which in turn can guide future research and development.

6. **Office Hours for Further Discussion**: Ethan offers to hold office hours for anyone interested in discussing his talk further, which will take place upstairs in room two or eight for the next hour.

In summary, Ethan's presentation touches on the complexity of interpreting AI model behavior, the importance of informed consent with AI systems, and the need for diverse perspectives in evaluating AI capabilities. He encourages journalists to convey the key message from his research: the necessity of thorough evaluation of AI models to understand their true nature and the potential risks they pose.
