Welcome to Now You Talkin, a series of short videos on how to define key terms in the Utah
system.
Today we're actually defining two terms, ontology and epistemology.
The last video we define, metaphysics.
Ontology and epistemology are closely related, whereas metaphysics are about the concepts
and categories that then give rise to a worldview.
Epistemology is the concept that pertains to what one says is real or one's theories
about what is real, whereas epistemology is about what one knows and how one knows it
and whether one is justified in making those knowledge claims.
So what is real, how one knows and how one's justified in making those claims, or ontology
and epistemology.
Although these definitions clearly point to different things in the world, it's also
the case that they're actually tied together and create lots of different kinds of potential
confusions.
For example, the first article I wrote on the theoretical unification of psychology,
I argued that the field faced a problem of epistemology.
I've actually recently written a book that sort of changes the focus and says that the
actual core problem is one of ontology.
I share that to suggest that these things are really interconnected.
This shift over to the hard problem of consciousness.
The hard problem of consciousness refers to what is it like to be an organism or animal
and in particular, what are the neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to this phenomenon.
The neurobiological mechanisms are the refer to the real things in the world that give
rise to consciousness and therefore it's mostly an ontological problem.
And they call it the explanatory gap because we don't understand the mechanisms.
However, there's something really interesting about consciousness related to epistemology
and that is if we're talking about the subjective conscious experience of being, the only conscious
experience of being that one can observe is oneself from the inside.
You can never observe another.
So actually the hard problem of consciousness in terms of its mechanism is ontological,
but since we can never see it, there's a real epistemological problem that's associated
with consciousness also.
Indeed, I would argue that there are at least two different problems, one of ontology and
epistemology because we can't observe it when it's happening and especially if we ground
ourselves in the epistemology of science, which is based in observation.
Let me go back to psychology.
Remember I said that when I made the argument that I could theoretically unify the field,
I said there was a problem of epistemology.
What I meant was all those different schools of thought have different languages and use
different kinds of evidence to make their claims.
And so I was correct in saying there definitely is a problem of epistemology.
However, when we ask the question, what is it in the world that psychology is about, we
have now shifted and are now talking about ontology.
And basically I argue we've missed the dimension of mindedness, that mind animal dimension between
life organism and culture person.
And it's that gap in our ontology that we need to solve the problem of psychology.
So you can see that epistemology and ontology are both related, they're separate, at the
same time they're separate and they actually fit under the umbrella of metaphysics.
Utah really tries to tie these together in a coherent way.
In fact, one of the things that I argue is the concept of behavior connects to science
metaphysically, ontologically, and epistemologically.
How does it do that?
The argument is that science takes the perspective of organizing the world in terms of entities
and fields and change.
These are the metaphysical concepts.
It then uses this to map the world, the ontological world, and ultimately it does it through justifying
systematic empirical observation, measurement, logical analysis, and experimentation.
Those are all the epistemological structures that go into mapping the behaviors in nature.
So we can tie science to behavior metaphysically, ontologically, and epistemologically.
And when you do that, you see that we can understand ontology, hey those are the things
in the world that science maps, epistemology, that's the way science does it.
Utah helps us make sense of both of these terms and how they're interrelated.
