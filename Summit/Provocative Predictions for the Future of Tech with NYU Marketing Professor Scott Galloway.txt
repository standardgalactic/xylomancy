Welcome to the stage, Optimist, Author, and Founder of the Curve, Simon Sinek.
Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. So obviously you're all here for Scott Galloway.
Scott is one of those people who pushes you to see the world differently. It's one of the reasons I
love him and love his work. He also puts himself out there in a way that I think very, very few
others can or want to. He's so vulnerable and shares with us the struggles that he's going through
that we can relate to. But more important, his views on the world, his perspective on how it
works are different than everybody else, which is why we have to listen to Scott. He doesn't always
get his predictions right, but we have to listen. Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Galloway.
Thanks. Thank you. My name is Scott Galloway. I teach at NYU. I have 147 slides and
2400 seconds, so let's light this candle. So in the spirit of transparency,
I don't know Simon how well. I don't like him very much, but it's a power move to
have him introduce me. Okay. So I got home pretty late last night and decided to reorient the slides.
I fiddle with the slides up until the time I present them. And I thought given that we're on a
cruise ship and I met a lot of people last night who are in the business of travel that we would
try and talk about. Travel, I'll make some predictions around tech. It's kind of around the world
towards basically whatever I just wanted to talk about tonight. And then hopefully we'll leave
some time for my favorite part, Q and A. We have a pretty intimate crowd here tonight,
so I'm going to try and leave some time for Q and A. Okay. We're going to talk about the economy,
travel, transportation, what else? Because we didn't get enough of that today,
income inequality. I'm worried about the shit I've created after I've made tens of millions of dollars.
But I'm Dr. Frankenstein and I think Frank might have some violent tendencies. I'm concerned.
Yeah, fuck you. Figure out what we do. I'm going to talk about loneliness. And then I'm going to
try and wrap up with, quote unquote, some perspective. So if you weren't reading every day that we were
about to have a recession, where would the evidence of any recession be? I think that inflation is
going to come down as quickly as it went up. AI, the rider's stripe, which will end in tears for
the riders. For the first time, people are not as confident negotiating pet bereavement leave and
the growth economy. I think you're about to see wage pressure come way down, and you're about to see
inflation come way down back to historic or more normal levels. And I'm not sure. I studied economics,
but I don't consider myself an economist, but I don't see any signs of a recession. As I said,
inflation is coming way down. Unemployment is at historic lows. Now, some people would argue,
well, there's discouraged workers, you have the wrong denominator here, but we essentially have
historically low unemployment, retail sales are strong. We've ripped through about four of the
$5 trillion we handed out during the pandemic, and we're ripping through another $100 billion
a month. So there is some credence to the argument, I'm sorry, I'm just going to stand over here,
that in about 10 months, people are going to run out of money. But right now, it doesn't appear
unless you were looking at the media that you'd see any real signals that were going into a
recession. All of a sudden, we're starting to see people talk about earnings calls or in earnings
calls use the term soft landing as opposed to recession. They're even starting to soften their
tone. There's an effect that when you worry about something or the moment you really begin to start
worrying about something, the odds of it happening go way down, right? It's the shit you don't see
coming that gets you. None of us really saw the pandemic coming. Remember Greek sovereign debt
that was supposedly going to collapse and take down all of Europe or that all elevators were
going to start stop working New Year's 2000. It's a general survival instinct that if you worry about
something long enough, you unconsciously prepare for it and you avoid it. So we have been talking
so much about the recession that I wonder if we're probably not going to, it's not going
to register. Where we are seeing a recession is what I call the Patagonia vest recession.
I have two entries. I'm credited with two entries in the urban dictionary. The first is yoga babble,
which is how I describe the we work prospectus. And then I just got my second one and that is
the Patagonia vest recession. And that is the growth economy has had so many calories stuffed
down. It's esophagus that it's built up fatty deposits everywhere. And if you understand balance
sheet economics, essentially, if you have gross margins of 20%, which is great gross margins
or operating margins, excuse me, of 20%, you can either add $5 a new income of new revenue to your
company, or you can cut a dollar of expenses. And you have the same net effect on shareholder value.
So the most actionable or significant on the ground impact or strategy of 2023 is an AI.
It isn't supply chain. It's everybody in every boardroom has seen what Elon Musk has done.
Specifically, he's fired 80% of the staff. He's taken the step down from 7500 people to 1800.
He's going to 1000. And there really isn't from the consumer in any discernible impact on the product.
Now, he's lost about 80% of us or 60 to 80% of his advertising revenue, but people would argue
that's a self inflicted wound. So in every board, people are asking themselves, how do we have the
great taste of reduced costs without the calories of losing revenue? So the business strategy
circulating the majority of the growth economy is, could we lay off 10, 20, 30% of our employees,
but manage to hold on to the majority of our revenues? That is the easiest way to add shareholder
value and the markets like it. Every time a company announces layoffs, the stock goes up.
The majority of people in this room have never really seen that type of economy before. When I
graduated from business school, 40% of my class had a job. So in other words, 60%, two thirds
of the class did not have a single job. My kids now, when I say kids, I mean my students, on average
have between three and five job offers out of NYU Stern, average salary $212,000. Meaning if someone
goes to work for a nonprofit for a hundred grand, there's somebody who's accepted a job at 330 or
$350,000. That is much different. That is, no one ever feels overpaid. The majority of us in this
room right now are overpaid. Oh, I do have sound. If in the back, if you can hear this video, this
video does have sound. This is one of my favorite videos to kind of summarize the growth economy.
Can you imagine the fight over who would get to fire this person?
I have 300 kids in my class, about 30 or 40 of them go to work for Amazon, about 20 Google.
Literally big tech was coming in every year and hoovering up all human capital. It was a fight.
Like every manager's job usually at the end of the year, and I run growth companies, is how do we
keep the young people happy? It was just a constant question. How do we keep people
with us? How do we attract new people? That has flipped. I love these TikToks now of people
getting fired that day. My first piece of advice, because I don't think many of you have been fired
before, I've been fired from every job I've ever had. It's not about you. It's not a personal,
it's not a statement on your character. It's not about the condition of your soul.
It's usually about things outside of your control. I think the tech community and the labor force
was lying to you when they said, bring your full self to work. Don't bring your politics to work.
No one gives a shit about your politics. Corporations are a platform to build economic
security for you and your family. They might have pretended that they cared, but they don't.
Don't think that when you get fired or laid off, it's an assessment on you. No, it's not.
It's about what's happening at the time in the economy, almost always.
You got to put these layoffs in context, though. They make for great headlines.
Huge headlines. Amazon, Meta, lays off 8,000 people from Page. But this is how many people
they've hired since the beginning of the pandemic. So all these, quote, unquote,
mass firings are just taking them back to employment levels of 12 or 18 months ago.
This is still just a fraction of the people that human capital that they have brought into
their organizations in the last 36 months. The layoffs here, despite all the headlines,
represent about 1% of non-farm payroll employment. We're obsessed with big tech, but as it relates
to the economy in terms of market capitalization, it's big, but as employment, it actually doesn't
employ that many people. 2023, the year of experiences. So if you looked at most things,
most structural trends, whether it's e-commerce, even teen depression, and you did know the pandemic
had happened and it just maintained its current slope, teen depression has been going up steadily
since the introduction of social on mobile, e-commerce has been growing high, single,
low, double digits per year. They've all kind of returned to where they would have been around
the pandemic. The only thing that appears to be the enduring change is work from home.
That appears to be very, very sticky. That's kind of the enduring change coming out of COVID,
where if someone showed up and said, how is the world different? How do we know something happened
here? It would be remote work. And the really disappointing work, or the Gene Twanging and
Jonathan High just came out with, is that we've been blaming depression of kids on COVID.
And the reality is, if you look at the trends of teen depression, what they found is it wasn't
COVID, it was social media that was doing it. And some social distancing didn't create depression
among teens, social media did. A ton of revenge travel, right? One of the wonderful things about
coming out of COVID is people seem to have a renewed sense of what's important, the finite
nature of life, and people are going big in terms of travel. Travel sites traffic up dramatically,
new record for passports that have been issued in the United States. China's returning to the
tourism market, so that's new wind in the sails. And people are spending a greater proportion
of their disposable income on travel. And then we're seeing huge demand returning.
For the most part, the travel industry is taking advantage of this and using COVID as an excuse
not to restore previous service levels. I get to stay in very nice places, mostly because someone
else is paying, and the way I would describe luxury travel right now is six star prices with four star
service. And as a result, their margins have never been bigger. They're making up for the revenues
that they were, that they lost through COVID. It's a great time to be in the travel business.
Live entertainment is surging. People want to be around each other, which is a wonderful thing.
And also, people have a renewed sense of the value of time versus money.
Okay, so everything in its own way is retail. And I would argue that the worst retail experiences
are grocery stores, airports, and gas stations. Tesla didn't disrupt the auto industry, it disrupted
the gas station. If you spent 15 minutes a week in a gas station, that's 12 and a half hours a year
pulling in, smelling those carcinogens, worrying about getting shot. That is literally the worst
retail experience in America. How much would someone have to pay you to get up at six, get to the
gas station at seven in the morning, fill up, drive around the block and do that until 7.30 at night?
That's probably, you would probably pay a lot of money to avoid that. In addition, this industry
was so disruptible, mostly because of charging stations or mostly because of the gas stations.
I think disruption is more a function of how ripe an industry is to be disrupted as opposed to the
disrupting technology. It wasn't immediately obvious that Google was going to disrupt the
advertising industry, but the advertising industry had basically said, we're going to triple our
costs every 10 years, even despite the fact that our audiences are shrinking. More expensive for less
reach, and it stuck out its chin. Grocery stores and department stores really hadn't changed in
about 30 or 40 years, and the fist of stone of Amazon came for it. Ad-supported cable television
got worse and worse, but more and more expensive. Netflix came in at 12 bucks a month and disrupted
that industry. The question then becomes, what industry is most ripe for disruption? AI is
clearly the technology, but more important than the technology is what industry has an enormous
chin sticking out right now? I'll come back and try and answer that. Lines, we spent a lot of time
in lines. I think that essentially, if you want to build a company that's worth over $100 billion,
you've got to build a time machine. If you just let your kids watch Netflix and not broadcast
television, that kid say it's 12 days a year in commercials. Amazon has given you six days back at
a spending time in department stores and grocery stores. The majority of companies that get past
$100 billion have effectively built time machines. I love the company clear. I'm obsessed with
trying to expedite everything in terms of time. You get that way as you get older,
and most of these high-end luxury items are pretty much focused on saving time.
Peter Drucker, who's sort of my role model, an economist in the 60s, basically said that every
major business trend can be predicted by demographics. If you were to try and find a
demographic trend that's going to wag the tail, that it's a good thing to get behind, and I did
get behind this in 2010, I started a company doing business intelligence and analytics for
luxury brands, because what I saw was that income inequality was about to become income
insanity. History repeats itself. Essentially, you have an economy that starts off as a collective,
everybody wants to help each other, wealthy people weaponize government, become more productive,
leverage technology, and slowly but surely figure out a way to lower their taxes and figure out a
way to engage in massive tax avoidance, to create more and more power, and will wring their hands
and be very concerned about what's going on in the next year, the tax rate goes down.
Eventually, there's a revolution and it starts all over again, but we're at a point right now
where it's literally gone parabolic, and you've seen all this data about the 0.1%,
but if I were to say to people constantly coming and saying, what industry would you be in, I'm
like, if I were you just going to any industry serving the 0.1%, because the amount of disposable
income there, it's like that very basic adage that people used to tell young professionals,
get as close to the biggest pile of money, stand as close as you can to the biggest pile of money
and everything will work out, and that pile of money is increasingly accreting to fewer and fewer
people. So social clubs, the 1% is now sequestering from everybody else, right? We allow visitors in
based on being super interesting or super hot as tourists, we give them a day pass,
but mostly we've decided we no longer want to hang out with the other 99%, even when we're
socializing. Anyone done one of these private tours at Disney? Disney just announced pretty
terrible earnings, but they were saved by one thing, the parks. What they didn't publish was the
thing driving a ton of incremental spend there is these private VIP tours, where you pay somewhere
between I think seven and 900 bucks an hour, a minimum of five hours, so for about five to seven
grand, you and five friends get to cut the line. I did this for the first time last year, and it's
physically uncomfortable when you get to the Avatar ride, and they could hand out an iPad
when you get in the line, and you could watch Avatar before you actually get on the ride.
The wait time is three hours if you only paid 160 bucks, but if you paid 7,000,
you and your kids get to cut the line, it's about three minutes, and they give you a hand
signal in case you want to go on it a second or a third time, and this is the fastest growing part
of the park's business. Think about the profits there, a very high EQ, really nice young man
from Kansas shows you around, takes you to a golf cart behind the bowels of the three parks,
so you can go on the two or three best rides at each of the three parks.
It's getting worse, and most of you have probably seen this on TikTok,
but this is where this is socialism, right? You start off thinking everyone should be equal,
it doesn't work, right? People engage in their own self-interest, that's what capitalism is,
taps into one of the most powerful motivators, and that is our own self-interest.
What we want, most people agree that the most productive, hardest-working people should make
more money, and then it's just gone absolutely insane. People really don't recognize just how
insane it's gotten. By the way, wealthy people usually don't talk about money because they don't,
they see this uncouth, which is really nothing but an attempt to keep poor people down by ensuring
they don't know how much money they actually are making and have relative to them, so they've created
this social dogma around talking about money. I think everyone should talk about how much
money they make. I think it's healthy because you're going to find out just how outrageous it is
about how some people at a certain level in your company or in society how much money they're making.
So for every hundred dollars created in the past 10 years, 54 bucks went to the top 1%,
that's globally. It's actually much worse than that in G7 nations and even much worse
in the U.S. 70 cents of it went to the bottom half. So if a hundred dollars in incremental value
created over the last 10 years, 70 cents of it went to the bottom half.
It used to take 26 billionaires equal to bottom half of America. Now it takes, excuse me,
used to take 380 billionaires, now it takes 26. By the end of next year, there's probably going to
be three people in the United States that are worth more than the bottom half of America.
That's the bad news. The good news is that incremental quality is usually self-correcting.
More bad news is the means of self-correction are usually war, famine, or revolution.
Don't you find it unusual that all of these rich people have their go-bags and their bunkers in
New Zealand or in Sonoma? I find it so nihilistic and disappointing that the wealthiest, most
resource and arguably the most intelligent among us decide to devote their resources to
colonizing other planets or taking us into another universe as opposed to just trying to
break this place a little bit more fucking habitable. This is the wealthy weaponizing government.
These are tax rates. The greatest innovation in history wasn't the iPhone, wasn't chips,
it was the middle class. That is, we had 7 million men coming back from war and we decided to give
them money to buy houses and give them jobs, $500 billion infrastructure act, and that made them
more attractive to potential mates and we had the baby boom. The tax rate on the top 1% in 1945
was 92% because to sustain the middle class, the greatest innovation in history took a lot of money.
We recognized that if we wanted a really progressive tax structure, we would have to
tax people at a higher rate. In the spirit of transparency, just to give you a sense of how
ridiculous things have gotten, I start companies, I got very lucky, I sold one of my companies
a few years ago. The first $10 million to me, the founder, were tax-free.
I've invested $2.5 million in another company that just got purchased. The first $25 million to me
because of QSB will be tax-free. Zero tax rate on the first $10 million when you're an entrepreneur
or when you make a large capital investment in a small company. People will say, well, okay,
but you're a productive citizen. You wouldn't start companies unless you had these tax breaks.
No entrepreneur knows the tax rates when they start a business. My effective tax rate for the last
decade has been 17%. That's my effective tax rate, and I'm very public about that.
And there's another myth, and that is that lower and middle income people are paying all the taxes.
Actually, they're not. They pay a lot in consumption and sales tax, but they actually pay very little
federal income tax. The people who get most screwed by our tax code are what I refer to as the work
courses. And that is they make between $150,000 and a million a year. And it's all reportable.
It's all current income. And they usually, in order to make that kind of money, have to live in an
urban center that's usually a blue state, and they're usually paying an effective tax rate of
somewhere between 45% and 50%. And they make enough money to live well. No one feels sorry for them.
But until they have enough money to start making investments where they register capital gains,
they're paying tax rates of 45% or 50%. Now, if they really start to live large and make a lot of
money and can afford to put that money into investments, then they make the jump to light
speed. And their tax rate, once they get to about the 99th percentile, starts to plummet.
So we have effectively decided that if you win a gold medal, we're going to take the silver and
the bronze and give it to you too. Your tax rate goes parabolic. Once you go over six figures,
keeps going higher and higher until about a million, and then it absolutely plummets once you get into
the top 1%. Luxury is the best business in the world. Wealthiest man in the world didn't invent
a search engine or a social media network. He basically creates artificial scarcity.
And he creates desire. Wealthiest man in the world is, of course, Bernard Arnault.
And these three guys now have wealth greater than the GDP of the Munchin nations.
Private flight, private travel won't worry with this is up. This is an interesting stat,
and that private luxury usually gains some popularity before an economic crash because
people become self-conscious about their wealth. I'm obsessed with succession, and this kind of
defines sort of quiet luxury. No logos, just very expensive, beautifully crafted things that aren't
very flashy. Now you might say, well, where do billionaires come from? The industry that's created
the second most billionaires is actually luxury. Tech has created more. This is the best business
in the world, and that is creating artificial scarcity. And artificial scarcity is essentially
the strategy that, unfortunately, America has adopted. The strongest brands in the world aren't
Apple or Hermes or Nike or MIT and Stanford and Harvard. And every day, me and my colleagues wake
up and we ask ourselves one question. How can I increase my compensation while reducing my
accountability? And the way we do that is we've adopted the ultimate strategy. We target the
0.1% and we adopt this rejectionist, exclusionary luxury positioning. And despite the fact we sit
on endowments, again the size of some Latin American GDPs, we don't expand freshman seats.
So we can take admissions rates and take them way, way down and turn into a Birkenbag as opposed to
public servants. It makes alumni feel good. The value of your degree goes up when it gets harder
to get into your institution. The moment you have a house, you start taking an interest in the
local review board and basically come up with thoughtful ways to ensure that new housing never
gets built. Meaning that housing has accelerated, housing costs in the US have accelerated about
the same price as a luxury good. Once I have a tech company and it works, I'm going to weaponize
government to make sure new companies can't get born. Our entire economy has moved to a luxury
artificial scarcity economy, where we create artificial scarcity to drive up prices that drive
value to the incumbents and the entrenched. This is how I explain it. For most of history, our
species hasn't had access to sugary, salty or fatty foods, so diabetes, right? Our instincts
haven't caught up with industrial production. So if you can create something that feels scarce,
if you can convince people that a Panerai watch is scarce, right, they artificially choke supply.
So if I see one, I think, oh, I got to buy one because I want to signal masculinity and strength.
I'm dying soon. So I need to signal this type of success, right? And they do a great job of creating
art. This is not a difficult thing to produce. It's about 1500 bucks of movement, plastic,
glass and leather that they sell for about 12,000 bucks by creating this illusion of scarcity.
When there's a scarcity of food, a scarcity of mating opportunities and now a scarcity of luxury
items or scarcity of education at an elite university, you can raise prices faster than
inflation and aggregate a great deal of wealth. And this is the only video I could come up with
last night to explain it.
Three times last night, somebody here, that gets a plop.
Three times last night, someone offered me mushroom chocolates.
I don't know if that says something about you or something about me.
The third time I said yes, and I just went back to my room and I watched this video about 80 times.
It was a pretty nice way to spend the night. I opened the window,
opened the window, kept asking myself, how high am I now?
It was really nice. So you're out there and thank you.
It's the ultimate marketing strategy. Create artificial scarcity, right?
And luxury has outperformed every other industry, again, all footing back to a demographic shift,
and that is the .1% are aggregating more and more wealth. And you may not feel rich. Every person
in this room is probably in the top 10% in their G7 economy. And if you make more than $40,000,
you're in the top 1% globally in terms of income. Tremendous growth potential. This
stat just blew my mind. Hermes now has a larger market capitalization than Nike. Can you believe
that? Because most companies, if you can create artificial scarcity, you literally create a cash
picket. And I've worked with all of these companies that I'm talking about. I'm going to do a ton
of name-dropping because I'm deeply insecure and desperate for your affirmation. But essentially,
Hermes, go into an Hermes store and say, yeah, I'll take that back. And they're like, oh, sir,
that's a three-year waiting list. This shit is not hard to make. These bags are not hard to make,
but they have done a genius job of creating a sense of artificial scarcity. So as a result,
if the CFO walks into the COO's office in Hermes and says, I need another literally
billion dollars in revenue over the next three months, the COO can do it. No problem. Just
produce another $15,000 average price point bag. We'll produce another 600,000 bags there. So your
billion dollars, 80 points of gross margin, $800 million in gross margin, $400 million in EBITDA.
And the analysts know that. So they can perfectly predict and calibrate. They make their projections
because if they're about to miss their projections, they just turn on the tap. There's very few
companies that are able to establish that type of scarcity or create a cash tap where all they
need to do is just open or throttle the spigot. So we've gone from luxury to ultra-luxury.
I love to travel. I don't travel to cities or countries. I travel to hotels. I find hotels
that look great. And that's where I go on vacation. And you have seen basically the Ritz
Colton, the Four Seasons, which used to be sort of the top luxury brands, be bested. They were
sort of for the top 3% or 4%. But now 0.1% brands have come in because that's where a ton of incremental
income has happened. So you're seeing hotels where the average price point, the average price point
is $7,000 or $9,000 a night. And they're full. So you used to have the Four Seasons, the Mandarin
Oriental and the Ritz Carlton. And now you have Cheval and Blanc, Amen, Rosewood, Six Senses have
all come in and said no. The opportunity is in the 0.1%. So a weird prediction, but I'm obsessed
with football, you're going to see a massive increase in the value of sports teams over the
next 10 years. One, because we keep, as long as we're producing more and more billionaires who
happen to be in the midst of the midlife crisis, you're going to see a massive increase in the
value of these teams. And you're seeing it now. You're seeing an acceleration of the value of
sports teams. One, they actually benefit from some secular trends or structural trends. They're
the only content that doesn't look to be disrupted by, it's the only content we watch live now that
advertising still works. And it's also taps into people's emotions. You also have an entire region,
the Gulf, that has decided, okay, we need to improve our image. We have to pivot to a non-fossil fuels
based economy. We have 30 to 50 years to do that. We have infinite capital. So how do we do that?
How do we create a perception such that the most talented people in the world
want to come work, live, and be educated here? We have to upgrade our image. There's a smart
people they figured out, unlimited resources. So they used to advertise on Bloomberg and CNN and say,
invest in Malaysia, Qatar are a great place to live. And what they figured out is if they buy a
football team, they get some of that positive brand imagery. And they'll probably break even on a
cash flow basis, maybe lose some money. And then in 10, 20, or 30 years, the asset has increased
in terminal value. So this is the ultimate brand ROI expenditure, if you're trying to upgrade the
perception of a country. So we're going to start to see the Gulf nations come into every league,
by leagues, by teams, because it's as if they could run a commercial. But then in 10 years,
they get three times the cost of the commercial back.
It's also a fantastic way to cross over celebrity, media, and the value of these things. I would
imagine that Ryan Reynolds and Rob are probably going to make five to 10 X on their investment
just over 24 months on Wrexham.
Little awkward being on his boat.
It's the bottom line. Billionaires, as they, billionaire Republicans, as they realize they're
not going to live forever, start buying football teams and billionaire Democrats by media companies.
This is kind of the ultimate expression of like, you haven't wrapped your head around death yet.
I just like to slide.
And I'm here to announce that at some point, if I have another 30 or 40 exits, I'm going to buy
Rangers FC in Glasgow. I'm going to take my boys. I'm going to be really into the community and they
will love me. Okay. So the values of these sports teams is already accelerating. There's
going to be investor groups, SPACs. This is going to be kind of a new accelerating luxury item.
You're going to see all sorts of new investment opportunities. Someone in the
enterprising will put together a DAO and start buying teams and people like us will have the
opportunity to participate. And then I think you're especially going to see it in football.
Again, I'm biased here, but I think that these, this league or these teams appear to be global
brands or I think they're going to accelerate faster than any other global brands. You're going
to start hearing terms like, you know, Arsenal and Inter Milan that you didn't hear before,
that most people didn't hear before. These brands are going global. This is shocker. I'm really
going on a limb here. I said this a year ago. I have this kind of secret weapon for figuring
out if the technology is enduring. And that is I look at the amount of citations in academic journals.
And typically what you have is in academia, the whole academic research is really, it's a
wonderful thing. It sounds very basic, but it's really a wonderful thing. And that is you put out,
you publish something, you say, wow, I think I'm onto something about AI and you publish it and
you publish your thesis and your research. And then someone, a colleague from Carnegie Mellon
or Tulane says, this is where you got right. And this is where you got wrong. And I'm going to
refute it. And if they can refute it, we actually celebrate them as long as they add value to it.
And we congratulate them. We don't start shitposting each other on Twitter. We say, okay,
what you're saying is right. You've made my research better. And we have an enduring build
of intellectual property that ideally then floats into the private sector. And as you can see in
mobile and GPS, that build was slow and steady. And I would argue that mobile and GPS are probably
the most enduring technology of the last 30 years. Now, in contrast, let's look at the academic
research and citations of the metaverse and crypto, right? Me and my colleagues, oh, the metaverse is
hot, right? Oh, crypto, it's hot, right? And then this is what happens. It just dies.
Look at the curve in artificial intelligence. It's very similar to the curve of mobile and GPS.
And I can't find any other technology that has the same citations or the same curve
of this, the most enduring technology other than AI. So every academic journal entry
has been improved upon. We've been thinking and talking and writing about this for a long time
and researching it. And it continues to get better and better and better in this, in my view, is in
fact an enduring technology. Every year, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. I'm better at predicting
when technologies don't work. I have every year kind of the most ridiculous technology award two
years ago. It was the metaverse, right? 40% of people who put on that headset feel nauseous within
30 minutes. No one wants to go into an incel panic room. These things, I think big tech is a net
positive for the world. I do not believe that of meta. And I could not have invented a better
strategy than to convince a young man to spend $1.2 billion a month on his big gold
bio wasca dreams that people are going to want to go into a legless universe and hang out with him
and other people. I think we all have an obligation. If you like me think the people who run meta are
mendacious fox, I think that you have an obligation to talk up the metaverse. Because my fear is they
wake up from this consensual hallucination and start reducing the spend. So I think it has real
potential. Five days to one million users, right? The curve on adoption and AI is blowing away
everything. We're in the fear-mongering part of the cycle. I'm actually quite optimistic about AI
which stands out, I think. And by the way, I trust on who I adore and have a lot of respect for is
worried about this and I purposely wanted to go to his talk yesterday to get insight into why he's
worried about it. But what I see is that every new technology, it's easier to understand the
downsides. We knew that automation was going to fire a lot of people on the factory floor and it
did in the short term. But we didn't anticipate heated seats or car stereos and net employment in
the automobile industry actually went up. And so yeah, I think there's going to be some job
destruction. I think there'll be some security risks. But the amount of new businesses and
opportunities by feeding your health records or spending patterns into these LLMs, you're going
to come up with all sorts of new businesses and new ideas. Okay, let me skip this. Obviously we
hit kind of peak hype cycle. Everyone is talking about AI, right? It kind of reminds me of 99 when
you just said, Williamsonoma.com and your stock price went up. And everyone's trying to figure
out on the dark side here what industries it really destroys. So the Czech CEO made the mistake of
saying that he felt some pressure from chat GPT and the stock loss 40% of its value in five minutes
in the aftermarket. So investor relations has really now become a story of spin. The number of
journalists over the last 30 years has been cut in half. The number of corporate PR executives,
the number of comms people at companies has gone up six fold. So the ratio of bullshit to journalism
has gone the wrong way 12x. The reason why is that three out of four companies that went public 30
years ago were profitable. And we would assign a multiple within a fairly narrow range to get the
valuation. Now three and four companies that go public are not profitable, or at least over the
last 10 years, which means the narrative is more important than the numbers. So the core competence
of every CEO is to be a great storyteller and capture people's imagination, pull cheap capital
forward such that he or she can over invest and run away from the competition. So as a result,
the PR and comms people manicuring Zuckerberg's image at Facebook now outnumber the number of
journalists at the Washington Post. Think about that. There's more people trying to kind of
put wallpaper over these lies that delay an obfuscation that is meta than there are journalists at the
Washington Post. Typically technologies either create a bunch of new winners or they accrete to
the existing players, right? Search, socially commerce went to new players, mobile went to
existing players, you would argue cloud kind of went to existing players. So far it looks like
the big bursts of market capitalization are going to existing players because it requires
substantial infrastructure, specifically massive processing power.
Coming back to travel, I think there's enormous opportunities in travel and AI. I'm going to
the Eurofinals with my 12 year old and we're playing with AI to try and create the ultimate
weekend. But you can see how this would be a tremendous time savings, again going back to
time machines to plan a great weekend. Give me a great weekend with six of my friends,
all women in our 30s. We want to go to Mexico. This is our economic weight class. These are
our priorities and it comes back with an itinerary. And then a series of questions. What else can I
answer for you? Do you want me to make reservations? Confirm now. Do you want me to send emails out to
the six friends? I mean, you can just see this is going to get really exciting very fast in travel.
Okay. I had my first AI moment at LAX when I was coming in and I went to global entry and I started
putting my passport in and I heard Galloway and I'm a narcissist so I really thought, oh, it's a fan.
And it was a woman from TSA saying, you're good. And so they're doing facial recognition and
learning on AI such that you can get right through the airport. I think that's fantastic.
By the way, I'm all for privacy violation as long as we have strong courts and people to oversee or
punish companies when they abuse that data. But the notion that if you give a flying fuck about
privacy is hilarious. As you'll tell everybody exactly what you're doing everywhere. With a thin
layer of AI, if Uber gets hacked, we're going to know if you're having an affair, your HIV status,
and if you terminated a pregnancy. It is going to be, you have given up all privacy.
This is the industry that AI will disrupt. And it's because it's the most disruptible industry.
The way to describe American healthcare is expensive and bad. It's outpaced inflation.
It is now the largest industry in our economy and only 20% of healthcare consumers are happy
with their healthcare. Think about that. It's raised prices faster than inflation for 30 or 40
years, and only one in five consumers are happy with their healthcare. We spend $12,000 per person
on healthcare. Meaning about Australia spends less than five. And yet we die much earlier.
Think about that. Mostly through death of despair, opioid addiction, suicide.
But think about just how ridiculous it is and also obesity, but that we have a nation that
spends a lot more than anyone else and yet we're dying earlier. And again, terrible satisfaction.
So again, it's more about how disruptible an industry is than the technology itself.
And I think you're going to see if I just was an economic animal, strong certification, some decent
options professionally, and I thought, where is the most wind going to be in my sale?
I would try and position myself somewhere between AI and healthcare. Where you feed in
your workouts, your nutrition, here are just my grocery bills. Here's my fitness app. Here's my
amix receipts. And here's my blood work. And I want this AI model to start managing my healthcare
and making recommendations and take healthcare from a defensive on your heels, disease driven
application to an offensive health driven. And I think there's going to be all sorts of costs.
I don't have health insurance. And people hear that and they go, whoa, no health insurance.
Because health insurance for me and my family for the health insurance I want is $50,000 a year.
And because I have some economic security, I can absorb a big health scare. I can absorb almost
any health scare. And so I decided, all right, about 50% of our healthcare costs are not being
reimbursed. So I'm going to go without health insurance. I did that five years ago. A quarter
of a million dollars will buy a lot of healthcare. So what the healthcare industry has done,
especially the health insurance, the insurance part of the industry, which I think is the most
vulnerable, 45% of all insurance costs in healthcare go to profits and administration,
meaning if you spent $100 on health insurance, you're getting $55 back. If you're a younger person,
you don't get $55, you get more like 25 or 35, because you're subsidizing people my age and older.
But we scare you. You're irresponsible. And what if you get really sick?
So again, it's another example of a very elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people.
Under the same auspices of rejectionism or capital gains tax that rewards money more than sweat,
who makes money off money? People my age. Who makes money off sweat? People your age. Second
biggest tax deduction in America, mortgage interest. Who owns homes? People my age. Who rents? People
your age. People over the age of 70 are 72% wealthier than they were 40 years ago. People
under the age of 40 in America are 24% less wealthy. Almost everything we do in America
is an elegant transfer of wealth from young people to old people. And we wonder why there's a birth
birth. Birth rates are off 20% in the last five years. And everyone's staring at their navels
saying, why are young people having kids? It's because they can't afford them.
Want to see that again? All right.
We need a time machine in healthcare. Whoever builds it is going to make billions. Right now it takes
two hours for an in-person visit. A telehealth visit takes 13 to 15 minutes. This is an enormous
unlock. The mother of a child with diabetes, and let's be honest, it's always the mom, spends five
months of her year managing that child's healthcare. Think about that. You have a child with diabetes
between the referrals, the applications, the insurance. You spend five months of your year
managing that child's healthcare. The pandemic did bring an acceleration in remote healthcare.
Only about less than 3% of visits were remote. It went almost to 40% during the pandemic. It's
come down, but it's still an enduring part of our healthcare system remote visits. 38%.
It's a huge unlock in mental health. This is especially dominant or as seen as a real innovation
in the mental health sector. I think it's going to be big in fitness. I'm going to spend a lot of
time there. Ten minutes. I'm going to cut to the end. I just thought it'd be fun to talk about
space tourism being on a virgin boat. I think this is the most ridiculous business anywhere.
Virgin Galactic was nothing but an elegant transfer of wealth from retail investors
who wanted to participate in the FOMO tech economy such that Richard Branson could keep
this ship operating during COVID. We spent more time watching Jeff Bezos go up in a dildo
than talking about climate change in 2022. When Bob from accounting gets emulated on the launchpad,
this entire industry goes away. It is supposed to apply constraint and demand constraint. There
aren't that many people want to spend $400,000 to go three times as high as you'll go on your way
home. Space is really, really difficult. There's a reason they call it space. It doesn't want you
there. It immediately begins destroying material and basically attacking any organism. It's a
terrible business. Space exploration, another ridiculous business, ridiculous idea. You've got
to hand it to them. The view on Mars will take your breath away. Literally, it'll take your
breath away. You can't breathe there. This is the weather here. This is the weather on Mars.
Also, if you're a responsible person, you should absolutely take up base jumping before you go
into space. 550 people have gone into space, 11 have not come back. It has about 10 times the
mortality rate of base jumping. It's a very dangerous business. The part of space that does
make sense is space hauling, specifically space hacks. We need to get more defense and communication
equipment. It's essentially who can get things up reliably and cheaply. I think space hacks is
going to be more valuable than Tesla, mostly because Tesla's value will implode. It's a car
company, not a software or an energy company. Space hacks has figured out a way to get heavy
materials into orbit much more cost effectively. I'm going to skip through this. Loneliness. My
guess is you've heard a lot about this this weekend. I'm working with Surgeon General Vivek
Murti, who is a very impressive and lovely man. But anytime you take one substance and transfer
it or transition it to another, there's externalities. Anytime you take X and turn it into Y for
economic gain, you're going to get externalities. We turn plant-based calories into beef-based
calories. We get methane and deforestation. We take fossil fuels and we turn them into petroleum
and obviously we get externalities in the form of carbon. I do not believe that carbon emissions
and climate change are the most serious threat facing humanity. I think there's another externality
that has arisen because of the conversion of one substance to another that is a bigger threat.
And that is the conversion from advertising into dollars or specifically from attention
into advertising into dollars. Because what we figured out in the 50s, 60s and 70s, we thought
it was sex that would keep you glued to your screen. But what we have found out is that the
real sex that sells isn't sex, it's rage. And as a result, the companies that are now
building the most shareholder value are the ones that basically are in the business of
polarizing and dividing and depressing. And why do I think it's the most dangerous omission?
If we all hate each other, we're never going to figure out a way to come to any sort of agreement
or action plan around the other things that ale us because we don't trust each other.
The moment one group takes a position on something, there's reason for the other group to suspect them
and gas like them or basically not believe it. It doesn't matter what it is. We used to be
bipartisan around science. But I know the algorithms like it when I say mRNA vaccines
all to your DNA. Oh, we like that. Elevate that content because it pisses people off.
And we'll get more comments, more engagement, more enragement, more engagement, more Nissan ads.
The result is depression.
One in three teenage girls have contemplated suicide. One in five LGBTQ youth have attempted suicide.
So I went back to my old high school, university high school in West Los Angeles a few weeks ago,
2,000 kids, assuming somewhere between five and 10% identify as LGBTQ. It's 200. That means 40 kids
over the next three years are going to try and kill themselves.
When I was in high school, we had a memorial almost every weekend or every week we'd come in,
we'd go, oh no, we'd see a picture of somebody and a bunch of flowers. And it was from almost always
it was from drunk driving. When I grew up, I lived in LA. There was no public transportation,
huge alcohol abuse, no airbags, mothers against drunk driving really hadn't kicked in. And kids
would take to Sunset Avenue totally fucked up and get in an accident with no collapsible
steering wheel shaft or airbags and we had death all the time. Now it's no longer drunkenness,
or cars, it's depression.
The fear I do have around AI is that I worry that young people are entering into a series
of low risk, low payoff relationships. I'm going to convince myself I'm learning and that I'm
investing and I'm going to go on Coinbase. I'm going to convince myself I'm politically engaged
by going on Twitter. I'm going to convince myself I have friends, but I'm not really experiencing
friendship. And I think slowly but surely, especially young men who have very few mating
opportunities because online dating is kind of consolidated mating, where the top 5% of males
get 80% of the opportunities. They're going to engage in a low risk, easy, low barrier
relationships with sex bots and AI trained girlfriends. And I think this ultimately over
time makes us depressed that the reason we're happy, the reason we're joyous as we engage in
victory, we have obstacles that make the destination or the relationship more rewarding. There's a
reason the romantic comedies are 2 hours, not 10 minutes. Supposedly if you are, there's new
research showing if you smoked and had friends, right, or didn't smoke and had no friends, you
would live longer if you smoked a pack a day and had friends. And now 1 in 7 males don't have a
single friend. Now let me think about that. Think about the amount of joy, think about the
prosperity, just a sense of self-worth, the laughter you've experienced with friends and 1
in 7 males in America doesn't have a single friend. I'm not going to play the clip on her.
So I'm worried that slowly but surely we're going to start to replace human touch and what it means
to be a mammal and decide that, you know, trying to meet people is hard. Having the confidence
to approach someone and express romantic relationship while making them feel safe is a skill
that young men aren't establishing and so they'll turn to AI and slowly but surely they'll
sequester themselves from the rest of the world, which I think leads to depression.
There's a woman who's now turned herself into a scalable girlfriend and she expects to make
$5 million this month, charging a buck a minute. I love this quote, right? It kind of summarizes
it all. What is love if it's not grief, perseverance or varying? Most of my philosophy I get from Disney
Plus. Okay, this is my last thing. I'm a bit of a downer so let's try to end with some up note.
If you look at our catastrophizing and how down we become about the world and how bad things
become, a lot of it is the cadence of the news cycle. News used to be 22 minutes once a day,
then it turned into 20 hours and now that it's every 20 seconds on your phone with notifications,
the only way to keep you on your screen is to catastrophize, right? Things marginally better
today is not a good headline. That doesn't work, right? So we want to create, we have to create a
situation for the situation room. So we constantly catastrophize and make ourselves feel worse about
the world than each other. So if you looked and just took, if you just took the perspective back
and said, all right, last year here's were the biggest headlines. Any headline you get every
20 seconds is usually not a good headline. But what if you went back five years, still kind of bad?
Can anyone hear that or am I having a stroke? Is there like a rumbling? Thanks for that.
If you went, if you went back 50 years, if you went one, five, 10, the news, if you had to pick
headlines, the news gets progressively better the more perspective you have perspective is a
photographic term. And the more you create the angle wider, the better the news gets because
the reality is, if you're honest with yourself and you look at anything from a long term perspective,
the news just gets hard to hard to deny is pretty good. But would the news be if you had one headline
for the last 50 years, probably be unprecedented prosperity led by China in the US, or that abject
poverty has been cut by 80%. If you can only pick one or two headlines, you'd have no choice,
but probably to make them positive. And if you can only have one headline for the last 100 years,
what would it be? That's a very good one. Life expectancy in China, since the year I was born,
has gone from 46 to now 76. And 500 million people have been brought out of poverty in China over the
last 30 years. But still, I think that probably the headline for the last 100 years would be that
the West turned back fascism, which is a great headline. So as the cadence of news has increased,
our sentiment has gone further and further down. And we need some means of self-correcting around
all this negativity. Okay, I'm not going to talk about how great it is to be an American.
I think a lot about regrets in time and how fast it's barreling. The majority of our existence
as a species, we didn't live past 34. For about 99.9% of our time as Homo sapiens,
we lived to be about 30 or 34. We died in childbirth, died in war conflict, a broken bone or a bad
cut meant death. So our brains literally can't process us past the age of 35 or 40. By the way,
by the time you hit 38, you have trouble adapting to the way you look after that. Every day you're
looking at the mirror, you're like, shit, because you can't process it. Because you're not supposed
to be here. In addition, you can't get your mind around time and ask anyone in this audience over
the age of 40, time literally begins to fall off a cliff. Years become seasons. And I'm fascinated
with what are the biggest regrets at the end of your life. My colleague Adam Alter has done great
work on this, and I only got another minute or so here. And he spends a lot of time with people
at the end and palliative care. And their regrets basically boil down to three things. I wish I'd
lived the life I wanted to live, not the life that others wanted me to live. I wish I'd stayed in
touch with friends. And most importantly, I wish I'd been less hard on myself. I wish I'd forgiven
myself. I think about this a lot is I'm barreling towards the end. I'm an atheist. I think at some
point I'll look into my kid's eyes and know that our relationship is coming to an end. And I find
it a source of power. But if you're successful, you live a lot in the past. You call on your
credentials and your experience to try and inform your current actions. And if you're like me and
you suffer from depression and anger, you spend the majority of your waking hours in the past.
God, I can't believe what a fucking idiot I am. I can't believe I did that. I can't believe I said
that. You're constantly beating yourself up, right? Can't can't get past this immutable thing
called the past. You just can't get past it. And if you're successful, also also like me,
you're a lot in the future. You're constantly trading off the short term. You're constantly
planning. I got on this boat yesterday, because I was supposed to speak at 330. I don't like boats.
I've never been on one before. I'm a gorophobic. I don't like people much. And so when I saw the
boat was still docked, I thought, I'm going to do this talk and bomb to Miami airport, get home.
And I was already planning the Tottenham Spurs Brentford game with my sons and what I was going
to do with my free time. I was already in the future planning how to be more productive. And
chances are if I'd made that football game, I would have been on my phone virtue signaling
that I was with my son checking the amount of likes I got thinking about what I was going to do
the next day. Never really there, right? Never, you know, always in the future, always in the past,
never really there. I like what Sam Harris says, the past is the most immutable thing in the world.
The future is the most mutable thing. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of we don't have a lot of
control over it. But this is it. This is what we this is it is the only really the only thing we
have is the here and the now. And my biggest fear. And I think about this a lot is that I'll be at
the end. And I'll look back and I'll go, Oh my God, unbelievable blessings, staggering prosperity
that I didn't expect people I love and that love me immensely. Right? But I was never really there
for it. Did my life happen? So I leave us with a question. And it's something I asking myself
all the time now. Are you here? That's all I got.
