Processing Overview for BioNetwork
============================
Checking BioNetwork/Bioprocessing Part 1： Fermentation.txt
1. **Preparation Phase:**
   - Thaw and expand the seedstock of modified E. coli in a shaker flask to reach the target cell concentration.
   - Ensure all fermentation media ingredients, process equipment, and documentation are ready and verified.
   - Load and verify process control software.
   - Prepare the batch record (BPR) for guiding the process steps and documenting the entire process.

2. **Equipment Check:**
   - Perform a thorough check of all critical equipment, including valves, caps, lines, probes, and hoses in the fermentation area.
   - Add 10 kilograms of HPW to the bioreactor, check for leaks under process pressure for 30 minutes.

3. **Media Preparation:**
   - Mix media in the vessel by turning on the agitator and adding yeast extract, tryptic soy broth, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate monohydrate phosphate, and an anti-foam compound.
   - Add an additional 10 kilograms of HPW, complete sterilization in place (SIP) at 121°C for 30 minutes.

4. **Final Ingredient Addition:**
   - Attach the glucose hose and add the sterilized glucose antibiotic solution.
   - Take a manual pH reading, initiate the fermentation cycle, and inoculate the reactor with the expanded seedstock after steaming the inoculation line for 20 minutes.

5. **Fermentation Process:**
   - Monitor key parameters such as temperature, agitator RPMs, dissolved oxygen levels, pH, pressure, optical density, airflow rate, and glucose concentrations.
   - Document and graph these measurements.
   - Add IPTG to activate the expression of GFP when target levels are achieved.
   - Wait until the cells produce the desired amount of green fluorescent protein, typically an additional five hours.

6. **Final Readings and Broth Handling:**
   - Take final readings and draw a sample for cell solids percentage determination.
   - Cool down the batch, transfer it to a broth tank, label it with essential details like batch number, volume, time, and date.

7. **Downstream Process:**
   - The harvested broth will move on to the recovery process where cells are ruptured to release GFP.
   - The protein is then separated from other components using various downstream purification techniques.

Throughout the entire process, the Batch Process Record (BPR) is used as a guide and documentation tool, ensuring that all steps are followed correctly, and all critical data is recorded for quality control and traceability purposes.
