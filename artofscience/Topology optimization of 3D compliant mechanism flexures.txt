It's time for playing, laying with this road down
Gonna give my heart away, leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a Tetris too long
What am I doing here?
I've been afraid of what the fallen flowers could do
Move over and give us some
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just want to be a woman
