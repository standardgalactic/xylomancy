Mr. McDonald, let's talk chicken.
Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets to your chicken
muck nuggets by almost three to one?
No, sir.
And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the Colonel's secret blend of eleven herbs
and spices?
No, sir.
So how do you expect to sell chicken?
Toys!
Lots of toys!
It's our best.
A dollar and ninety-nine for the Colonel's chicken sandwich and fries or Kentucky nuggets
and fries.
Comes the time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change, you know what I'm
talking about, fellas?
Suddenly, wheels means cars instead of skateboards.
Look, let's broaden your horizons.
It's time to move on.
Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips, why not tear into a bag
of nacho cheese Doritos tortilla chips?
Bigger taste, bigger crunch.
Here's a snack chip that bites back.
Come on.
Nacho cheese Doritos.
You're a man now.
You're going to handle that.
Come on.
Aren't all you want.
We'll make more.
Dave, Dave, if you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.
They will?
If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.
It has to be boneless.
If you make it with lettuce and tomato.
And honey mustard.
And put it all together on a toasted bomb, they will come.
Call it Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich.
Dave, I told you they will come.
It's Wendy.
I just can't figure out how she's doing it.
For fun around here, me and the boys liked it, it was something a little bit crazy.
Put two kinds of cheese on a cheeseburger.
For a while, new taste headed the store for two kinds of cheese and lean ground beef.
Cheddar and monster.
Crazy.
Things do go bump in the night.
There are bogeymen.
Fortunately, Silly's exclusive post-yepidic sleep system is designed to support everyone

This isn't just about sex.
I don't know why not.
There's a little about sex though, isn't it?
It's sort of nice on the phone, it's a portable upbringing with me.
Things are really heating up, anything but love after Tuggy Hussein.
When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast, I didn't think I needed to say where.
It could only be one place.
Where else can you get this delicious bacon, egg and cheese biscuit?
So much for him.
Nice move, Jack.
The Prelude SI with four-wheel steering from Honda.
Grandpa, you think you could have a party every time you come out with a new product?
This is really nice.
You don't have a party like this every night.
This is big.
This is really big.
This new light microwave popcorn.
With one-third fewer calories and two-thirds less fat.
Then our regular microwave, and it pops up more than any other light microwave.
It's going to keep my figure just like it is today.
Well, you're pretty good looking, Grandpa, you know.
That's what grandma says too.
Yeah.
Not all of us can be as good looking as you, Grandpa.
That's true.
That's true.
Look what's new at McDonald's.
What is it, Dad?
Let's just wait and see, huh?
It's the stars of Walt Disney's classic movie, 101 Dalmatians and a Happy Meal for just $1.99.
There's Lucky or Pongo, the Colonel with Sargent Tibs, or Cruella De Phil.
It's a good toy each week when you buy your kids a $1.99 hamburger Happy Meal.
The movie is only at theaters.
The Happy Meal is only at McDonald's.
Does your man control you next time?
Now at Little Caesars, you can get picnic, picnic, two medium pizzas, two orders of crazy

It's picnic, picnic, two pizzas, two crazy breads, two soft drinks, all that food for
only $7.98, and it rains at floors, picnic, picnic, only at Little Caesars.
Pizza, pizza.
Why are beers that go down lightly, watered down so heavily?
Why?
Ask.
Why?
Turn off the water, and turn but dry.
It's smooth draft taste is dry brewed, not watered down, to drink light, yet satisfied
completely.
So why get soaked?
You can drink but dry.
Baby changes everything.
Safety takes on a whole new meaning when it's somebody you love in that car.
This is our family.
They're the most technically advanced and lifelike dummies in the world.
Only GM uses a family like this to develop safety technology because we know quality
cars, safe cars, should help protect everyone.
I look at my family and I want us to be thinking of everything.
GM safety, it's not one thing.
It's everything.
She's everything to me.
Dorothy, you marry me or is my ring a lifesaver?
It's beginning.
Don't worry.
I'll give it to my mother.
Lifesavers candy isn't life delicious.

Hey, first.
Did I just feel a drop?
Or are you drooling?
It's who's the boss, then.
She dumped me.
Paul snapped out of it.
She said I was suffocating her.
I thought she wanted to be suffocated.

It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.

But finally, it was ready.

Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.
They count on the same hot, fresh food at every McDonald's all over the world.
But imagine if there were only one McDonald's you could count on.
And 22 million people came in at the same time.
The whole restaurant would fill up, the city would fill up,
and all those people in one place would cause the earth to tilt off its axis
by spinning into space.
And that would make a real mess of everything.
That's why we make every McDonald's from Poughkeepsie to Pomona
just as good as every other McDonald's, thereby saving the universe.

You have to drive it to believe it, the new accord.
This is delicious, Danny.
What do you call it?
It's new ragu, fresh Italian pasta sauce.
So delicate.
What's it called?
Fresh Italian pasta sauce.
Yeah, it's really fresh, but what's the name?
See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste and twice the crushed tomatoes.
But what's the name of the sauce?
New ragu, fresh Italian pasta sauce.
More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.
Here's a jar.
Look, it has a name on it.

This morning, I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.
I see Sears trucks all the time.
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called superstores.
So before you make that next big buying decision,
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now,
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.

Alphabeta shoppers are finding
when the new sign went up,
the prices came down.
For the last year, I shopped at Alphabeta,
