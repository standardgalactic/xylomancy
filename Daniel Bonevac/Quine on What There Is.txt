Well, now let's start talking about Klein and his analysis of ontology.
Klein's way of thinking about Ozilothical matters has been hugely significant.
The thing starts, you might say, his project starts in the 1930s.
He goes to Vienna, he's working with Karnapp, takes a position at Harvard,
and stays at Harvard his entire career, ends up shaping the Harvard Department
in crucial ways, and turning it into one of the, well, for the entire time he was there,
really, one of the top two or three departments of philosophy in the United States.
Klein's influence was felt partly through the power of his work.
He's a great writer, and so has a lot of influence, partly because it is important philosophically,
partly because the stylistic excellence of this makes him fun to read.
And it's not often you encounter philosophy that's fun to read,
so I think a lot of people read Klein when they might have been tempted not to read a similar set of ideas
from another writer just because he's such a great writer.
But also because Klein's students end up having a huge amount of power in the profession,
and well-deserved power. He has many of the greatest philosophers of the next generation studying with him,
and so there are lots of people whose views he shapes.
Saul Kripke, David Lewis, a variety of other people are Klein students,
and end up shaping the world of philosophy in their own.
So, Klein's influence is both direct and indirect.
Now, last time we were examining Klein on autology,
and we saw there was something key that he develops.
It becomes known as Klein's criteria of logical commitment.
There are different ways of putting this, but the most famous formulation, as we saw, was just this.
To be is to be a value of a variable.
And last time we talked about what that meant.
The idea was really that we have some statement like this,
and what does that say? There is an x such that a holds true of x,
or in other words, in English, that says there are a's.
Now, understood in terms of its meaning,
what this really means is that there is some domain of objects,
and then we identify some of those as a's.
So there are some objects x in here, such that a is true of x,
and we might think, okay, so one way of looking at this is that
there is some non-empty subset of that domain consisting of a's.
And so you might think, yeah, that's the a's in our domain,
and that's what this means.
So we could either think of the English,
when we commit ourselves ontologically to something,
when we say there are such things.
To ontologically commit yourself to people is to say there are people,
to ontologically commit yourself to red things is to say there are red things.
Just ontologically commit yourself to numbers is to say there are numbers.
To ontologically commit yourself to attributes is to say there are attributes,
are attributes. And all of those could be put in logical terms, in this sort of way.
They could be put in English terms by just saying there are these things. We can think
of it in terms of model theory, which is what this way of interpreting the logic comes to.
These things are understood as models. There's a domain of objects and then properties and
relations that can be defined on that set of objects. And to say there are attributes
is just to say some of the things in our domain are attributes. To say there are red things,
some of the things in our domain are red. There are people, some of the things in the
domain are red. So we can think of this in sort of syntactic terms, either formally or
informally. We can think of it in semantic terms, as saying there are certain kinds of
things in our domain. And ultimately the domain is the domain of all things. That's right.
Well, yes. This can be understood as the domain of just everything, right? All things. On
the other hand, in a lot of contexts, we don't have in mind everything. So for example, suppose
I am thinking about the various people in this class and how you're doing on your papers,
that actually the domain that's relevant to that are the people in the class and the papers,
right? And I'm not worried about the rest of the world. If somebody says, but what about
Vladimir Putin? I don't think. Oh yeah, Vladimir Putin is in our domain. I better think about
him too. No, I'm just going to say, yeah, the domain of objects that's relevant to this
particular context is one involving students and papers, and that's it. So frequently in
language what happens is we don't focus on this entire domain of everything. If I say
everyone's here, I don't mean everyone in the universe here. I mean everyone in the
class, for example, is here. So often in language we really are talking about a much more restricted
domain. But yes, in the abstract, we could be talking about everything. And indeed, when
we're thinking about ontology in the broadest sense, that's what we want to do. Think about
the way Klein opens his famous essay on what there is. A curious thing about the ontological
problem is its simplicity. It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables. What is there?
It can be answered moreover in a word. Everything. And everyone will accept this answer as true.
So in a sense, if we're asking that basic ontological question, what is there, then
the answer is everything. And so we do want this domain to include everything for those
purposes. However, this is merely a saying that there is what there is. There remains
room for disagreement over bases, and so the issue is stabilized down the centuries. And
so that tells us when we're doing metaphysics, we typically have in mind a domain that just
consists of everything. Well, okay, so this looks like a very simple picture, but it's
actually not quite so simple. Because even in his essay from 1939, a logistical approach
to the ontological problem, after saying that to be is to be a value of a variable, he says,
well, of course, sometimes we speak as if certain synchro-categorical expressions were
names of entities. We talked last time over the roundness of the clock. And you might
think, actually, roundness is something I don't want to recognize. Admittedly, it looks
like I'm quantifying over that. If I say pebbles have roundness, so pebbles have something.
But I might want to think, no, that's an avoidable way of speaking. And there might be other
things that it looks like I'm committed to by my use of a noun that I want to retreat
and say there's no such thing. Actually, one of Klein's favorite examples is to say
for the sake of something. You know, I did it for her sake. Does that mean there is
an x such that I did it for her x? No, I mean, sakes aren't things, right? That's something
we'd want to paraphrase in some other way. If I did that for my wife's sake, then I
want to be ontologically committed to my wife, but I don't want to be ontologically committed
to her sake. I don't know what that would even be, right? So sometimes he says we speak
as if these things are actually names of entities. But we hold that these are merely
matters of speaking, that the expressions are not actually names, that the alleged entities
are convenient fictions. This notion of fiction can be given a clear meaning from the point
of view of the present developments to speak as if certain expressions were names is to
allow those expressions to replace and be replaced by variables according to the laws
of quantification. But this is, if this is to be merely a convenient and theoretically
avoidable manner of speaking, we must be able to translate such usage into another idiom,
which does not require the expressions in question to replace and be replaced by variables.
So there is another possibility that emerges here. This is, you might say, the basic way
to be committed. But now we can also say sometimes these things are avoidable. So we could say
here's a criteria of being committed to something. To be is to be a value of a variable. It's
for us to include it in the domain. But then we can say, well, all right, there's another
way of looking at this. Sometimes we do that, and yet we think, nevertheless, the term is
really synchro-grammatic. We're not really committed. Okay? And so when do we really
have commitment, when we can't avoid this? So sometimes Quine just puts it this way.
But sometimes he puts it in a different way. And we'll see an exact formulation of that
in his essay on what there is. It's really, to be is to be something that has to be in
the domain for what we're saying to be true. And it might be that it has to be in the domain
directly because we're saying there are a's and there are a's in the domain. But sometimes
it's the case in this very indirect fashion. We say there are a's, but really that's an
avoidable way of speaking. And in the end, what we are quantifying over in our final
domain is just the things we have to recognize, some things we translate. So in short, there's
this possibility of, well, reduction of translation, of eliminating certain ways of speaking. And
before we formulate that in official terms, I want to give us some examples and see how
he thinks about this. So let's turn back to on what there is. Because here he formulates
a nice puzzle right at the outset. Suppose there are two philosophers, Mikhex and I,
differing over ontology. Suppose Mikhex maintains there is something which I maintain, there
is not. Mikhex can, quite consistently with his own point of view, describe our difference
of opinion by saying, I refuse to recognize certain entities. I should protest, of course,
that he's wrong in his formulation of our disagreement, for I maintain there are no entities
of the kind which he alleges for me to recognize. But by finding him wrong in his formulation
of our disagreement is not important, for I'm committed to considering him wrong in
his ontology anyway. When I try to formulate our difference of opinion, on the other hand,
I seem to be in a predicament. I can't admit that there are some things which Mikhex countens
and I do not, for in admitting that there are such things I should be contradicting
my own rejection of them. Now notice what he can't say. Yeah, there's some things that
Mikhex countens that I don't. Because if I'm saying that, look what I'm saying. There are
things that he recognizes that I don't. And it sounds like I'm saying there are things
that I don't believe in. But wait a minute. If I confess that there are things that I
don't think there aren't, it sounds like I'm contradicting myself, right? Or at least
I'm saying that my own beliefs are false. I'm saying, yeah, you know, there are these things
that I don't think there are. And so it looks like I'm in trouble. Now, he says, it looks
like if this reason can sound that anybody in the logical dispute who's denying the existence
of anything is a severe disadvantage. Because the moment you try to say, yeah, there are
these things that I don't accept, it looks like you're actually committing yourself to
the things and undermining your own position. Well, this, he says, is the old platonic riddle
of non-being. Non-being must, in some sense, be. Otherwise, what is it that there is not?
This tangled doctrine might be the name Plato's beard. Historically, it's proved tough, frequently
dulling the edge of Occam's reason. That's some of that great writing that I was mentioning.
So he says, consider Pegasus. We want to say something like this. Does Pegasus insist
no? No, right? Pegasus is supposedly a winged horse. But there are no winged horses, so
we might say yes. Pegasus does not exist. But now you might think, well, this is a problem.
What does our logic do with constants, with names? Well, they have to stand for things
in the domain. So you might think, ah, okay, so I see what's happening here. This is like
saying, gosh, my shirt is not blue. And what's going on there? Well, I'm referring to the
shirt. And then I'm saying something about it, right, that it is not blue. So I might
think, okay, so similarly here, I'm saying something about Pegasus. This winged horse.
Oh, yeah, horses have manes, they have eyes. So there we go. Pegasus. Okay, and I'm saying
it doesn't exist. Like saying my shirt is not blue, there's Pegasus and Pegasus doesn't
exist. But now that's weird, right? For one thing to say it doesn't exist, that's a
bad thing to predicate an object. But secondly, it looks like they have to have an object.
So my domain has Pegasus in it. And then I'm saying, but Pegasus doesn't exist. And so
I'm in trouble. Now, gosh, what do I do about that? It's a problem with all of these names
that don't denote anything. How should I in general deal with those things? It becomes
a problem in logic. And so there are various ways of dealing with it. Quiet outlines one
in this essay. There's an entire branch of logic called free logic that tries to accept
that there are terms like Pegasus that don't denote anything and to allow them in the logic.
But then what do you do? You can't allow yourself to go from Pegasus doesn't exist to, okay,
there are things that don't exist. And in fact, that's a good test case. Suppose I say
there are things that don't exist. Does that make sense? Or is that somehow self-contradictory?
Self-contradictory. Okay, Klein wants you to think, yes, that's self-contradictory. There
are things that don't exist. What do you mean? You're saying there are things that there
aren't? That's absurd, okay? And so he's trying to get that intuition going. Now there are
other philosophers who think it makes perfectly good sense. Terrence Parsons writes a book
on non-existent objects, in fact. And one of the things he says right at the start is
there are some things that don't exist. Like Pegasus, for example. And he thinks that's
just fine and we can say that without any problem. In fact, it's great. His dedication
is to my parents, without whom I might have been one. And non-existent object. So anyway,
not something that you could say is up for dispute, whether you can say intelligently
there are things that don't exist. But many of them, let's get back to Pegasus. Pegasus
doesn't exist. We don't want that model of what's going on here. But what can we do?
Well, our philosopher, Meg X, is thinking about this and says, well, actually, I don't
want to say there are winged horses, right? In fact, it looks like I've got a problem.
Because if I've now got Pegasus in my domain, and I've got this, like Pegasus is a horse,
that seems true. Pegasus is white. Pegasus is winged. Now I've got white winged horses
in my domain. And so we can actually get Pegasus out there to say, look, some horses have wings.
And it will turn out to be true, right? But I don't want to say that's true. And it doesn't
help to say, of course, some horses have wings. Pegasus, for example, you still want to think
that, no, Pegasus isn't real. And so what can you do? Well, one way to do it is to try
to turn Pegasus into something else. So, Meg X here, for example, says, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, yeah, of course I don't want to say there's an actual horse that is white and
has wings and is written by Balerophon and so on, as in the medical stories. No, instead,
I'm saying there is something like the idea of Pegasus. The idea, the concept of Pegasus.
So maybe this exists in the realm of ideas or concepts or something like that. And indeed,
we can say, yeah, a fellow doesn't really exist, but a fellow exists in the realm of
characters from Shakespeare. And so we could have realms of ideas, of concepts, of characters,
of fictions, and so forth, where we want to say the object exists, but in that special
world. So maybe this is ideas, maybe this is a realm of fictions, maybe it's a realm
of characters, or mythological creatures, whatever we want to say about this, we find
some way of putting it in a place where it doesn't do any harm and where we don't have
to admit that it's a real horse. Well, Klein doesn't like that option of saying it's just
an idea. And so when I say Pegasus doesn't exist, I'm referring to an idea or a fiction
or a character or a mythological creature and saying that it doesn't exist. Now, why doesn't
he like that option? What's wrong with that? Does he talk about meaning and means? Is that
where he goes with this? Well, eventually, yes. But the outset, there's something wrong
with just the idea part. Think about something that does exist. Is that a claim about an
idea too? Suppose I say that Harvey Friedman exists. Okay? There really is a person named
Harvey Friedman. He's giving a talk at four o'clock today. And so there really is that
guy. And now if I say Harvey Friedman exists, am I saying that, oh, am I talking about the
idea of Harvey Friedman? Or a mythological creature or Harvey Friedman? Or a character
or a fiction? No, right? I'm actually talking about this person, this mathematician. And
it looks as if, in that case, you say, well, gee, you know, it's very clear, right? I've
got this here I am, let's say, and here's my mind. And I've got this idea of Harvey
Friedman. But then here's Harvey Friedman. Wow, that's a great picture of him. Where's
classes? That's ridiculous. But anyway, I'm not tempted to confuse Harvey Friedman with
my idea of Harvey Friedman. My idea of Harvey Friedman is mental, but Harvey Friedman isn't
mental. He's an actual guy. He's an actual mathematician. And so you might say, look,
I mean, no danger with that. His example in the essay is the Parthenon. I'm not going
to confuse the Parthenon, which is on the Acropolis, from my idea of the Parthenon, which is in
my head. And so it's very clear there when I'm talking about the Parthenon or Harvey
Friedman and when I'm talking about my idea of the Parthenon or my idea of Harvey Friedman.
And yet, if I look at Pegasus, well, now it looks like I'm getting confused. Pegasus doesn't
exist. I'm talking about the horse, right? I'm saying it doesn't exist. I'm talking about
my idea. Yeah? How does this relate to, like, idealism? Is this kind of what gave rise to
the idea of everything not just in your head? Or, because this seems to presuppose some
sort of realism, right? That there is a Harvey Friedman in the real world, not just in the
mind. Well, Coyne is thinking of realistic terms. He's framing this in realistic terms.
MacEx historically probably stands for MacTigert, who is an idealist. And so one way to interpret
what's going on in this essay is that it is an attack on idealism. On the other hand,
I'm not sure that's the best way to look at it, because everything, and in fact I think
it's part of the reason that Coyne refers to fictional philosophy or rather than actually
engaging specific people. It's because even the idealist is going to have to draw a distinction
between the things that are mind dependent in this way and the things that are mind dependent
in that way. So the Parthenon will be mind dependent if I'm an idealist, holding that
everything is mind dependent. But I can also then refer to my idea of the Parthenon. I'm
not identifying it as an idealist. Moreover, I still want to draw the distinction between
Pegasus and the Parthenon. The Parthenon really exists. And Pegasus doesn't. They both are
in a sense mental projections or constructions from an idealist's point of view. But they
have a really different character. You can actually go to see the Parthenon. But you
can't go see Pegasus. And so there's something fundamental. You can go hear Harvey Friedman
talk. But if I say Santa Claus is going to be on campus on December 25th, you can't
wait around and go here and talk by Santa Claus. So something different is going on
even from an idealist's point of view. So.
Idealists would distinguish between their idea of the Parthenon and the actual Parthenon?
Sure. I think they have to. Now, there's going to be an intimate relationship between
them. What is that going to look like? Suppose we took the following idea. We thought, and
Russell thinks this at a certain stage. So does John Stuart Mill. They are in this stage
of their thinking phenomenalist. And so they're in a sense saying, what we call a physical
object is really just a collection of actual and possible sensations. Now, since sensations
are mental, this is a way of being an idealist. And if you take that view, then what's the
difference between Pegasus, for example, and the Parthenon? Well, in both cases, you're
identifying the object with these actual and possible sensations of them. But now, yeah,
so how can you, what does existence come to for an idealist? How do we distinguish that
actual and possible, that I should say the collection of actual and possible sensations
of a real thing as opposed to a collection of actual and possible sensations of the fictional?
Presumably all of those are possible, right, but not actual. These are, well, there are
some actual ones, but possible ones. On the other hand, they're real things that nobody
is seeing. And so I don't want to just say, oh, it's the difference between actuality
and possibility, because there might be something we've had no actual sensations of that we
hope to gain sensations of. So how could we do it before I do this? Now, somebody, yeah,
somebody wrote, right? So that, there's one, I mean, it's a problem that any idealist needs
to face. And interestingly enough, if you think about classic ideals, what would Barclay
say about this? For example, what would Kant say about this? My answer is, I have no idea,
because they don't address this question at all. What's Kant's account of fictional
entities or Barclay's account? This is not a problem they ever talk about. And so in
a certain sense, you could say, gosh, have idealists recognized that they actually have
a task to perform here? But let's help them out. What could you say? Kant, I believe,
collective belief? Collective belief? Well, how would that help? I don't know, if multiple,
well, I guess if you have some kind of threshold problem, people believe in something and then
that threshold is fulfilled, and you can turn that into like an actual thing that exists.
Oh, well, you could say, okay, look, here's the difference. Not many people believe in
Pegasus. Lots of people believe in the Parthenon. That's what it comes down to. But gosh, that
means if a religious revival sweeps through and everybody starts believing in God, God
exists now, right? Or if people give up on religion, then God no longer exists. But that
seems silly, right? Whether there's a God or not, doesn't depend on how many people
believe it. So that's one thing that's problematic. Secondly, it looks like it's going to wreak
havoc with science, because suppose scientists become convinced that there is such a thing
as phlogiston, for example. And then our physical theory changes. Well, now, what do we say?
Oh, yeah, you know, there used to be this stuff called phlogiston. And when you burn
something, it was an escape of phlogiston. And it had negative weight and stuff, which
is why it went up to the air. But, you know, then it stopped existing. And all of a sudden
things started oxidizing. Gosh. Before oxidation wasn't a thing. No, it's a thing. Phlogiston
used to be a thing. Found it all over the medieval world. But then throughout 1750, phlogiston
just went out of existence. And that seems ridiculous, right? That's not a thing. So it
isn't entirely easy to figure out what to say. We might say, look, it's a question of
systematic, predictable collections of actual and possible sensations. So then if I go and
visit the Parthenon, I'm there on the Acropolis, I'm looking at it, I close my eyes, open the
window again, it's still there. I walk around to this side, it's still there. Whereas Pegasus,
you know, that's not necessarily the case. Suppose I'm imagining Pegasus. And then I
stop imagining Pegasus. Do I suddenly then start imagining Pegasus again? No, right?
It's not nearly so systematic. So you might say there's a kind of patterning to actual
and possible sensations of the Parthenon that there isn't the case of Pegasus. Yeah.
Why can't the idealist just say that the Parthenon is an idea in the mind and Pegasus
is an idea of an idea? Parthenon is an idea and the Pegasus is an idea of an idea. And
that's basically what Pegasus is. Well, but then how do we explain that Pegasus is a
horse seems true? We'll just say, no, Pegasus is an idea of a horse. I say, no, no, no,
but Valerophon wrote Pegasus. No, you're saying the idea of Valerophon wrote the idea of Pegasus.
Anyway, of all horses, yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's an appealing thought there
that it feels like there's some sort of difference in level. And yet as soon as you start trying
to think about how then we talk about these things, it's going to get really weird fast.
So that's not to say we can't deal with that weirdness. Maybe we can and find a translation
pattern that makes it make sense but it's at least gonna be an obstacle to that
approach. Yeah. I mean it seems like I don't know if this is even helpful at all
but when I'm talking about my idea of Parthenon and my idea of Pegasus they
can interact very easily in my ideas. I can talk about Pegasus landing on the
Parthenon and that's not problematic that they go together very well. So that
you have ideas that could be fictional of real things just like you have
ideas a fictional thing. Well okay good good yes this this turns out to be a
mess because of exactly what you're pointing out. There are all sorts of
mixtures of real things and fictional things right. Often stories that are
fictional stories include some real things. Now maybe not maybe in a science
fiction universe you're dealing with something where everything is really
strictly imaginary but often fiction isn't like that it's based on something
real. So Sherlock Holmes lives in London. London is a real place it's not just
fiction but Sherlock Holmes is fictional and so you've got this mixture of the
fictional and the non-fictional. Similarly you might have what is this landing on the Parthenon.
Well Pegasus in the story is a mythological creature but on the other
hand the Parthenon is not mythological and we mix them together in certain ways
and so if we've suddenly got some big difference in level that's like whoa an
idea landed on this right and that's gonna be bizarre how can idea land on a
building. So there's something very strange about those mixtures and that's
gonna make it super hard to really sustain the difference in levels
throughout. We want fictional things and non-fictional things to interact at
least in the fictions. So oh gosh maybe a case that's extreme in this instance is
a historical novel. When I was a kid I used to love these books called You Were
There. You were there at the Battle of Hastings. You were there at you know the
Battle of Guadalcanal or something and it's written as if you're actually there.
It's like wow in fact if I were really there at the Battle of Guadalcanal or
something that'd be terrifying right but all of a sudden it's like yes you're
nine years old and you're really there watching all the battle take place and
they were very effective fictions written for elementary school kids putting
you there in that situation. But of course now what's going on is partly
actual events from the battle but it's partly you're not really there and
there are other characters you meet who are fictional characters but inserted
into this real historical situation and so in historical novels this sort of
thing is going on all the time. Now if all of that's true you might think well
yes we're gonna have trouble actually referring to Pegasus in a way that
separates these levels and keeps that distinction of levels going throughout.
Intuitively speaking there's something that feels right about it. We think but
wait Pegasus is something like a character, is a fiction, is a mythological
preacher and yet to say well that just makes Pegasus mental in a certain way
but that other things are not looks like it's going to be puzzled not only for
an idealist point of view but for anybody's point of view. So what if we
took another strategy? He says oh yes now we have another philosopher, why? Who
says here's the way to think about this and by the way it's not just sort of a
hypothetical approach this is something taken by many people in free logic this
was the approach taken by Leblanc and Thomas in 1968 and it has a lot of
intuitive appeal. The idea is really that we should think about a domain of
possible objects and then some of those are the actual objects. So if I say that
Harvey Friedman exists or the Parthenon exists I'm putting Harvey Friedman or
the Parthenon in the realm of actual objects but Pegasus, if I say Pegasus
doesn't exist what I mean is Pegasus is out here in the realm of merely
possible objects. So here's Harvey Friedman, here's the Parthenon, there
inside there but now Pegasus or Sherlock Holmes they are out here in the
realm of merely possible objects and then I can say exists I understand what
that means it just refers to that subset of things. Okay so just as we said here
ah these are the things that are a's that some subset of our domain the things
that exist are some subset of the domain of possible objects. Now actually there
is something intuitively plausible about that. Why does Quine object to that?
The bald man in the doorway. Okay good there are really two arguments he gives
and one of them is precisely that one the bald man in the doorway. The other one
is concerning the round square cupola of Berkeley College. Okay so the first
difficulty is now contradictory descriptions. The round square cupola.
And then the second one is this thing about identity. It becomes one of Quine's
main themes no entity without identity. For me to say there are such things as
a's for example I not only have to postulate their existence I have to
give you some identity criteria. At least if a is a count now there's an
distinction between count nouns and mass nouns. Mass nouns things like water
gold and to say there there is water that that would be just say to treat this as
a master how do you deal how you understand those is complicated but
count man like there is a person there is a piece of chalk there is a flying
horse etc those things seem to require not only that we say these things exist
but to give us some idea of what makes for there being one or two or three of
these we seem to need criteria of identification in the individuation how
do I tell one piece of chalk for another how do I re-identify something as the
same piece of chalk well those questions my identity are crucial for
actually talking about objects of a certain kind and we need that he says
for these so let's take the first argument contradictory descriptions what
do we do with the round square cupola do we put it the realm of possible objects
that's going to trouble right because then we're saying it's possible that
there's something it's both round and square could anything be both round and
square no so the difficulty here is that it looks like that's impossible but now
I could either take the description or I could give it a name I could say oh yes
Franklin that beautiful round square cupola on Berkeley College and now you
might say wait a minute Franklin is now denoting an impossible object so I seem
to have a choice I can either say something that is false right that
something could be could be both round and square and I'm gonna get
contradictions out of that or I say well actually I need a broader realm now
out here of impossible objects and quite doesn't really go into that deep in
detail but now I've got a realm of things that are both round and square I'm
gonna have a realm of things that have both two and three parts I'm gonna have
a realm of things that are both white and black and red all over and so I'm
gonna have all sorts of trouble if I introduced those you might think at
least you might think by the way quine does not actually deduce a contradiction
from this right he says all sorts of embarrassing questions could be raised
about those he doesn't actually go through and raise those questions and
attack this however he catches why I'm and saying actually I think something
like this is meaningless and that's very strange to say is white points out
something that is white and red and black all over is different from something
is both round and square we can understand the meaning of both in fact
it's by virtue of understanding the meaning that we realize there could be
no such thing so that won't fly at all so it looks like this is problematic what
about the identity conditions this is perhaps the most famous passage in the
essay so when he's saying that no that's not meaningless because it has it has
meaning is that sort of does that go back to sort of what Karna was doing is
like the logical are saying all these things have no meaning because they
can't be there okay yes we are here putting around that same question of
significance what has meaning what doesn't have meaning can we draw a
distinction and there are going to be several things that are difficult about
this one one that he points out is a purely logical problem church's
theorem implies that in the Rommel first-order logic validity is
undecidable there is no decision procedure for validity that means there is no
decision procedure for contradictoryness so if whether something is possible
consistent or contradictory is an issue that's an undecidable question but it's
weird to think that it's undecidable whether something has meaning or not
we'd like to have not only some criterion but some way of deciding in
principle in a finite time whether this is meaningful slave or not and and so he
wants to say look if you turn out if it turns out that contradictions are
meaningless you're already basically saying the distinction between the
meaningful the meaningless is undecidable and that's a creepy thing to say so
there's that problem but in addition to that you might think there is a
difficulty about well you might let's relate it to Hepple's criterion remember
he said there's a criterion of accuracy and one of the things that was a
corollary from that is that a should be meaningful if and only if not a is
meaningful if I understand a sentence putting in a not should preserve meaning
or taking a not away preserved meaning but what happens here is basically
something that is a contradiction the negation of that will be a logical truth
if I've got something that comes down to P and not P but then I negate that I've
got a logical truth and so if it turns out the contradictions are meaningless
it's also got a turnout if Hepple's right that logical truths are meaningless
and so actually we won't just say the round square oh meaningless we're gonna
have to say the claim that nothing could be both rounded square is meaningless
and some philosophers are willing to do that Wittgenstein in the tractotis
actually thinks about x equals x actually is it in the I'm sorry I've
forgotten now whether it's in the tractotis or the investigation but
Wittgenstein at some point thinks about x equals x and he says that has no use it
has no function so actually the claim that x is equal to x is meaningless and
that's a very strange thing to say but you can see maybe why somebody would be
lit to think it because a should be meaningful if and only if not a not a
is meaningful so to say x equals x is meaningful is basically to say that x
is not equal to x is meaningful which it is it is meaningful but but anyway it's
gonna turn out not only contradictions have to be meaningless on this
criterion so would logical truths and that's a hard thing I think to swallow
but now let's get back to the identity conditions argument why it's over
populated universes in many ways of lovely it offends the aesthetic sense of
us but a taste for desert landscapes but this is not the worst of it why I'm
in slum of possibles is a breeding ground for disorderly elements take for
instance the possible fat man in that doorway and again the possible bald man
in that doorway are they the same possible matter to possible men how do we
decide how many possible manner of that in that doorway are there more possible
thin ones than fat ones how many of them are alike or would there be a like make
them one are no two possible things alike is this the same as saying it's
impossible for two things to be alike or finally is the concept of identity
since simply inapplicable to unactualized possibles but what sense can be found
in talking of entities which cannot meaningfully be said to be identical
with themselves and distinct from one another these elements are well-nigh
incorrigible by fregian therapy of individual concept some members might
be made of rehabilitation but I feel we'd do better simply to clear why I'm in
slum and be done with it no is there an argument there and if so what kind of
argument is it
well let's look at the doorway is there a possible fat man in that doorway yes
okay if we're going with this way of thinking about these sure sure right all
that is to say it that could be a fat man in that doorway now presumably it
wouldn't be too fat or you couldn't get it to the doorway but but that's sure
there there could be a fat man in that door could there be a bald man in that
doorway sure so there's a possible bald man are they the same
well good I guess like yeah there are some possible men in that doorway that
are both bald and fat there's some that fat not bald some that are bald not fat
right how many of them are what should why I'm and say
well I think why would say there was infinitely many yeah they're infinitely
many right infinitely many possible bald man in the doorway infinitely many
possible fat men in the doorway infinitely many that are both bald and
fat and so on okay so I think Wyman would actually be able to answer one
question now how many of them are alike could there be two qualitatively
indiscernible fat bald possible sure they could be identical twins sure they
is this are no two possible things I'm like well sure some of them are like right
and in fact I could say yeah there could be a fat man in the doorway who goes
away and then reappears same possible fact and so it doesn't seem as if these
questions are really unanswerable if we go seriously about this and say yeah
look I'm talking about this domain to say there is a possible object here is to
just say there could be an object such that blah blah blah and I can say
there could be the same object in that doorway etc so all of that can go out
here would seem insured I don't myself find this a very powerful argument it
seems to me easy for somebody who has Wyman's view to respond to these
arguments now the first one is more serious because what do I do about things
like the round square cupola and if I'm doing it with respect to that whatever I
do why don't I do the same thing with pastes and the detective in such and
such a story and blah blah blah blah blah so I think this is in a way a more
serious problem just because a viable way of solving it why can't I use it
across the board but this one seems to me a bit fishy anyway whatever you think
about that client doesn't like this approach either he wants to clear the
slum and be done so what does he do how can we solve the problem
Russell exactly we rustling I've spoken disparagingly of Plato's beard and
hinted that it's tangled I've to also length on the inconveniences of putting
up with it it's time to think about taking steps and so the answer is Russell
now who's Russell help us well we can think about Pegasus not existing and
say let's think about this in a slightly different way let's think about what we
do with something like the present king of France's ball we don't say aha so
there is a present king of France but of course he's just mythological he's
fictional he's just an idea or he's a merely possible object instead what
Russell taught us is that we don't have to do any of that we don't commit
ourselves to a present king of France we just say that saying there is one and
only one king of France and that person is bald but there isn't one and only one
king of France so false okay and we're never committed there to there being a
present king of France so do the same thing with Pegasus now we have to turn
the name into some kind of description and so we do have Pegasus as a name well
directly speaking Russell's theory of descriptions doesn't apply to it but
even Russell proper names of this kind should be translated really into
descriptions and so it could be like the winged horse ridden by Balerophon it
could be just the thing that Pegasus sizes and so quite says you could just
turn this into a verb and so it could be the Pegasus either you can also just
say the thing called Pegasus which might seem a little bit less peculiar than
the Pegasizer in any case what do we do if we do it that way then Pegasus
doesn't exist becomes something like this there is well actually yeah Pegasus
let's start with Pegasus is a horse there is one and only one Pegasizer the
thing called Pegasus and it's a horse now is that true or false
it's false right there is no such things Pegasus there's no nothing Pegasus
in the actual universe and so we end up saying it that's false so the strategy
was that Pegasus of course false what about Pegasus doesn't exist what's gonna
happen it looks like we have to say there is one and only one Pegasizer and
it doesn't exist but that sounds self-contradictory that sounds like we're
saying there's one and only one thing and there is no such thing and so it
looks like that's not just false but like logically false so this becomes
logically false so actually if we just try this strategy for selling in
descriptions and apply it literally to this we get trouble because it looks
like actually now mcx can say hi hi don't you it turns out this is actually
contradiction contradiction or contradictory and so we're in trouble now
what can we do well remember Russell had this distinction between primary and
secondary occurrences so we can say ah wait this is like this is the same
thing as with the president of France that's not the way to do it the way to do
it is to say this not that there is one and only one thing and it doesn't exist
but to say it's not the case that there is one and only one Pegasizer and it
exists and then that's true it's not the case that there is one and only one
Pegasizer and now the it exists part is actually irrelevant so now we get
something that's true but notice what this means it means that actually
something like Pegasus doesn't exist is it is ambiguous between a statement
that's contradictory and a statement that is true now why doesn't exactly bring
that out and yes partly because he doesn't like this as a president doesn't
really want to think that it should be understood that way but now the same
thing is going to rise with attributes we'll have to postpone until next time
our talk of roundness and other sorts of attributes like redness but what
happens when we apply the strategy to it well Friday we'll figure out how that
all goes
