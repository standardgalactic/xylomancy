Last time we were talking about Klein's attack on analyticity and I want to
return to that there's one last argument we have to consider before we move on
to the second dogma of empiricism. However before even doing that I think I
should say a little bit about what motivates Klein's attack. Why does he
care about this anyway? We began last time by thinking about empiricism and
thinking it was pretty important to be empiricist to screen off a certain set
of sentences as things that were well verbally true that didn't concern
experience. Otherwise you have to fake the claim that our knowledge even that one
plus one is two or that every duck is a duck and so on is actually something we
have to learn from experience. However the reason goes deeper than that in a
sense why someone would care. After all Kant is the one who actually framed the
analytic synthetic distinction in the form we have it today more or less.
You introduce those terms and why did he do it? Not because he was an empiricist
but because he was able to identify a mission for philosophy. Philosophy was
the thing that would discover the grounds and the extent of synthetic
inferiority truth. So from that point of view, Kant has a way of distinguishing
philosophy from empirical science from other sorts of things. Philosophy is the
thing that uncovers the synthetic inferiority truths. Hume and other
empiricists have tended to find a role for philosophy in doing an analysis of
concepts and so I'm covering certain analytic truths especially those that
aren't just lookable up in the dictionary but ones that are more
theoretical, ones that are more illuminated, ones that explicate a
concept as opposed to just giving you a definition of courage as being courageous.
I can only imagine what Socrates would have said. He said, what is courage? It's
being courageous. It's like, yeah, that's not going to satisfy him, right? He wants
something more and so there's a task there too. When Quine is challenging this
distinction then, what is he doing? He's challenging the claim that philosophy
actually has any distinctive task in itself and so in the end Quine's
motivation for challenging the analytic synthetic distinction is not to attack
empiricism, it's to defend naturalism. The idea that there is no way to
distinguish philosophy or some other discipline from natural science. In a
sense, it all becomes one big project of understanding the world and any
distinction we draw between philosophical analysis and actual
investigation of the world between an attempt to discover the transcendental
grounds of synthetic inferiority truths or any other type of thing as opposed to
disciplines of psychology or physics or anything like that. All of that is bound
to failure, he thinks. In the end, it's all the same thing. Philosophy is just
part of natural science. Or to put it another way, you might say, all branches
of knowledge are really just part of the same thing. Our distinction between
philosophy and anything else is really arbitrary. In the end, it doesn't
reflect a deep difference of discipline, it's just a matter of levels of
generality. And so what he's going to do by the end of this essay is draw us a
picture that's like this. He says in the end, think of our beliefs not as resting
on some foundation of observation and analytic truth, but instead as being
something like a spider web connected to experience at the ends, but then
containing lots of things in between. So here I will draw a spider web. That
makes a crappy spider. But this is something he ends up calling the web
of belief. And the point, in a sense, of the attack on analyticity is to say,
look, it's all in there together. Yes, some things are closer to experience and
some aren't. So some look kind of empirical. Some are very far here in the
center and might look either analytic or very abstractly theoretical. But all of
that is just a matter of degree. In the end, there's nothing that is sort of
directly tied to experience in the way that an observation sentence is supposed
to be in logical empiricism. There's nothing that is sort of off limits to
revision as part of natural science as an analytic truth might be. So it's all
sort of hanging in there together. What's physics and what's math? In the end,
they're going to be sort of mixed together and we draw certain pragmatic
distinctions between them. But there's no really principled distinction to be
drawn between. So that's what this attack on analyticity is really about. Now,
we identified a couple of attacks before. So let's return to this question of
analyticity. And remember, we had thought of a variety of ways of thinking about it.
One was based on meanings and synonymy. But Khoi doesn't like thinking of
meanings as entities, number one. And secondly, we could say, well, okay, a
bachelor is an unmarried man. That's an analytic truth if it's only a bachelor
and an unmarried man are synonymous. But how do we tell whether it's those
things are synonymous? In the end, well, that's just a question of whether that
sentence is an analytic truth. So synonymy and analyticity can be defined in terms
of each other, but neither really helps you. It's as if we just have two
synonymous sentences. Or it's like pig and swine or brave and courageous. If I
say, what is it to be courageous to be brave? You might think that that doesn't
help me a lot. What is it to be brave to be courageous? And so in the end, that
doesn't help. If we think about definability, we've got all sorts of
definitions. But the ones that are interesting from our point of view, and
aren't just stipulations, all involve some prior sense of synonymy. We write in
the dictionary that this is the definition of that term because we're trying
to capture something about usage and something about identity of meaning or
synonymy. So we just get thrown back into the same problem. And then we talk
about interchangeability and ended up finding that problematic and basically
saying, look, in the end, that doesn't seem either necessary or submission for
understanding analyticity. Well, the last thing he considers before moving on to
the second problem is a different approach to this. And it's an approach based
on the idea of a semantical rule. So this is what Karnat does. He gives us a
language and he characterizes the language in terms of its syntax. So he
defines a vocabulary and that set of grammatical rules. And then he said,
here are the semantic rules for actually interpreting my language. Okay. What is
an analytic statement? It's something that is true on the basis of the
semantical rules. So it's something you can derive from the semantical rules
alone. So we've got a syntax that gives us a vocabulary and a grammar that
defines the well-formed expressions of our language. And then we've got
semantical rules. The semantics tells us how to interpret those expressions. And
it generally does that in a compositional way. We start out with the simple parts
and it tells us how to interpret the simple parts and then how to combine
those into more complex parts. And so we've got a way of interpreting the
well-formed expressions. And in particular that semantics consists of rules. Rules for
the basic expressions and then the ways of combining them. And those rules are
going to imply certain things. And indeed, what Karnat lays out here is what
linguists do all the time. If you look up an average paper in linguistics and
philosophy, you will find a sort of toy language frequently with a simple
vocabulary, simple set of grammatical rules, and then some semantical rules
that tell you how to interpret all of that. And so something is analytic if it
just follows from the semantical rules. So I can show you a little example of
that if you're interested. Yeah. Okay. This is something from a paper by
Bar-Wise and Perry in 1981. It's a very simple thing. Suppose we have a
sentence like this. John sees Mary run. How would we interpret that sentence?
Well, they say the basic idea here, you've got something strange going on in
the sentence. Look at Mary run. That's called a naked infinitive. That is to
say an infinitive, but without the two. And so it could be like an ordinary
infinitive. It would be something like John once married to run. This, however,
leaves out the two. And so there's something a little bit surprising about
that. These constructions are a little unusual. What do they mean? Well, the idea
in Bar-Wise and Perry is that this is really a situation. It's a scene. So John
sees a scene here. And so let's call that scene S. We want to say there is such
a scene that John sees, basically. So the truth conditions will be something
like this. There is an S such that, well, what? John sees us. And now S supports
the truth of Mary runs. So one way to put that is like this. Where that thing just
means, well, that's sort of a set of situations now in which Mary runs. So in
other words, John sees some situation in which Mary runs. And that would be, well,
actually, this is a simplified version of a semantic rule for that kind of
construction involving these oddball infinitives. So what does it mean to see
Mary run, let's say, or to see, let's say, Fred trip and fall? It's going to mean
something like that. John would see a scene, and that scene would support the
truth of, in that case, Fred trips and falls. And then we could actually see that
there are some things that follow from that. For example, when would a situation
support Fred tripping and falling when it supports Fred tripping and also is
falling, right? And so we'd be able to say, ah, John sees Fred trip and fall. So
John sees Fred fall. That should be a legitimate inference. And that's
something that would follow from the semantical rules. Well, all right, but
that's just a simple example of the kind of things that people do in semantics.
And indeed, there are things that count as semantical rules. Ones that you're
much more likely to have seen are ones in basic logic. So for example, we could
say, ah, what is the meaning of something like A and B? Well, think of that as
something like the set of possible worlds supporting the truth of A and B. And
what would that be? Well, it would be the set of possible worlds in which A is
true, intersected with the set of possible worlds in which B is true. And so
that would be another form that a semantical rule could take. Some of you
are nodding appreciatively, others are hating my guts right now. Yes. This
makes sense, but can you relate a little bit to the analyticity? Oh, yeah. Okay,
good. So, right, here's a semantical rule, let's say in our logic. And now I
say, aha, okay, here's an analytic sentence there. If Fred tripped and fell, Fred fell.
Now, actually, I'd have to tell you about if then, in order to really make this
full, because it's going to follow from this together with something about if
then. But that's going to end up analytic, because after all, if Fred tripped and
fell, that means our situation is one in which, well, this happened. But what is
that? It's the intersection of those two things. That means this happened there
and this happened. So it's going to follow that if Fred tripped and fell,
Fred fell. And that would be that analytic because it's derivable from our
semantical rules just using logic. Well, what's wrong with that? Why can't we do
this and have a good account of analyticity? Klein does think Carnap's come
closer than anyone else to capturing what analyticity really is. And so, suppose
we tried this strategy and say, that's what an analytic statement is, it's
something that follows from our semantical rules. After all, what Klein is worried
about are the things, not really so much the logical things, strictly speaking,
as the other things. So presumably, we're going to have not only these things, well,
yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves. But we're going to have to have semantical
rules over a variety of times, right, to get something like bachelor's or unmarried men.
No. Why does he object to this strategy? Why isn't that perfectly good? Imagine
somebody studying linguistics now who says, what do you mean? I'm taking
semantics. We write down semantical rules all the time. And we think things follow
from those and are true just by virtue of meanings. And that means we think they're
analytic. And so, gosh, linguists use this sort of thing all the time. What's wrong with it?
Well, problem A, which isn't actually stressed by Klein, if you think about all
bachelor's or unmarried, what kind of semantical rule is going to give you that?
That depends on the lexical meanings of terms like bachelor, right? And so, we're
actually going to have to have, that's part of the semantical rules here, lexicon. So
one objection that he doesn't really stress, but he could, is to say, wait a minute,
a lot of this is going to require a lexicon that's going to actually specify
meanings. But now we're back into the same problem of definition. Now we're going to
have some fictionary that's basically going to give us a bunch of definitions. But
why don't we give us those definitions? Because it's trying to match
identities of meaning already. And as we've seen, that just gets tied up with
analyticity. So we're back to the same problem we had before. Yeah.
So just to confirm, vocab is just a list of words and lexicon times the means of the
words?
Yeah, exactly. So here we might have, you know, in the syntax we have a vocabulary
and that might include bachelor. So that'll just tell us sentences involving
bachelor in the noun position are well-formed. But then here it'll be
something like, ah, bachelor, you know, noun, unmarried man. So we're going to, in
a sense, be back to the same problem we have. But that's not actually his main
objection. The main objection is this. What's a semantical rule? Why don't we just
start writing down every true sentence and calling the semantical rule? Okay. So gosh,
John sees very wrong. We have this account. Why don't we just keep going? After all,
here we've got something that goes beyond the bounds of ordinary logic. We're
talking about basically seeing with respect to this kind of construction. What
about running? Should we have a logic of runs and start writing down semantical
rules for this? We actually had a PhD in philosophy a number of years ago. We've
had several who have gotten jobs at a software company here in Austin. And their
job is to sort of write down axioms in a database that will allow it to
interpret things it reads, things that people say, and so forth. It's this huge
database, actually, that's sort of an encyclopedia of all sorts of things. And
at one point I asked this guy, so what are you working on? Because you have a
little business card and said ontological engineer. I thought, all right, that's
sort of awesome. What is an ontological engineer? And he said, well, you know,
it's basically we tried, we try to systematize everything that's in your
head and put it into a computer. So the artificial intelligence system can
actually converse with you as if it were human. And I said, okay, well, what, like
for example, what, what are you working on right now? He said, right now, I'm
working on the ontology of beds. I said, wait, beds? Yeah, beds. Okay. What do
you mean? There are beds, right? I thought that was the ontology of beds. No, no,
no, you know, for example, Joe walks into a room and sees a bed. Now, what do you
have to know about that bed to figure out what might happen next or to
understand the subsequent discourse? Well, there's a head of a bed and a foot
of a bed. There's usually space under a bed. You can either sit or lie down on
top of the bed. Beds have flat surfaces. And then, you know, they often have
headboards and things like this. They often have pillows, they have blankets.
Now, it was important to notice because suppose the story goes, you know,
John got to his hotel. He walked into the room. He saw the bed. He put his, yeah,
what, what could we have happened? Okay, he sat down on the foot. He said, what
is this foot? His own foot? Did he sit on his own foot? No, the foot of the bed,
you have to understand. Was there somebody else in the room? He sat down on
the foot. No. And so in short, you have to sort of have the computer already have
a huge amount of world knowledge that we have already. But now, here's the
significance of this. How do we decide what of the entry entries into that huge
database counts as a semantic rule about beds? And what is just a fact about
beds? How do we divide the semantics from the world knowledge? Beds are, I mean,
suppose I asked you, what is the definition of a bed?
It's hard to say, right? A surface to sleep on. A surface to sleep on. Yeah, but
now, what about, how is that different from a cot or a house? Or, yeah, a couch.
People can sleep on a couch. Gosh, I've slept on floors. Actually, it's really good
for my back to sleep on. Ever I get a sore back. Could you possibly describe it as
a complex comprising of symbols like the mattress in that comprise it for the
function? Oh, you could start saying, all right, yeah, I mean, a bed consists of a
mattress. Evidently, Austin is big into beds, by the way. I mean, everywhere I go,
there are these mattress firm stores. That, and it's very close to where I live.
There are two right across the street from each other. It's like, what? How many mattresses
does Austin need? But anyway, yeah, okay, you could define it in terms of its parts.
You could say, no, it's just its function, something to sleep on. You could start
describing it in terms of its typical shape, maybe. You could, anyway, all the
point is, I don't know how to give you a definition and how to separate the
definition of bed from all these other things that are true of beds. And bed
isn't pretty unusual here. We would do the same thing if we talked about chairs or
tables or all sorts of things, actually, that we began to think about that are
in common usage. There are all these things that we commonly assume about them,
and which of those are actually part of the meaning, which are just commonly
known facts, if you would want to put it in a database so that it can help the
computer understand the story, for example. Gosh, I don't know. And in effect,
Quine's saying it's an arbitrary choice. Some of those things, we designate as
semantical rules. Some we treat as world knowledge. But what really, ultimately, is
the difference between things that are true by virtue of meaning and things
that are just commonly known, he thinks it's impossible to tell. In the end,
in word and object, in some later words, he does define an ocean of stimulus
analyticity. But that's just something someone will immediately accept to a
thing of language. And he says, yes, that will include things like bachelors
are unmarried, but it will also include things like there are dogs. So it's not
going to give you, actually, a very good approximation to what philosophers have
wanted by this notion of analyticity. And so the basic objection to this is
something like our objection to certain kinds of definitions. Then again, it
feels arbitrary or circular. Either we do have some sense of what really meaning
is, but then we're back into the problem of meaning and sonotomy and all of that.
Or we're just arbitrarily designating some of these as part of the definition of
say, bad, as opposed to a commonly known fact about bad. But there's really no
way to draw that distinction that is not ultimately arbitrary. Yeah. What is where
the line falls between synthetic analytic statements actually tell us about the
world? Why is it so important for ontology? Right. Why is it important? Well, one
reason is that if we have a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic,
we can say there are certain disciplines that fall on one side and certain
disciplines that fall on the other. So for example, if we're, logic says, for
example, I'm very, I'm Russell and we say mathematics ultimately reduces the logic.
We can put logic and math on this side. We can put semantics on this side. And then
over here we get physics and psychology and biology and other natural sciences and
so forth. And then the question is, what do we do with philosophy? Well, we could,
if we have this sharp distinction, think, oh, you know, philosophy is a form of
analysis. In fact, why is analytic philosophy called analytic philosophy?
Because it arises in the context of a sort of empiricism that says we can draw
that distinction. And over here, we can put philosophy, because philosophy really
consists in analysis. It's a matter of analyzing concepts, serving as something
like the logic of science, understanding what we mean when we debate about whether
people have free will. In short, the kind of thing that Air does in language
truth and logic. Or we could be caught and say, no, no, no, philosophy concerns
itself with the synthetic. But it's not just one more science, alongside physics and
biology and chemistry and psychology and so on. No, instead, philosophy appears over
here. But what is it doing that's distinctive? Well, it's really engaged in this
transcendental enterprise. And that transcendental enterprise is actually
capable of giving us synthetic a priori truths. So on both sides, you end up
saying there's something a priori about philosophy. Something that philosophy is
doing just through reflection that isn't dependent on experience. But what kind of
truth is it giving you? Well, maybe it's this, and so here we get human, Air and
Russell and Carnab. Or it's doing this kind of thing. And if we're over here,
maybe we have Kant or Heidegger. It's involved in this sort of transcendental
enterprise. Actually, I think it's not just these guys, but many rationalists
would put it over here too. So maybe Descartes, Leibniz, I think Plato. And so
in a certain sense, part of the reason Klein cares is that he sees philosophy
as his own concept is often tied up with this distinction in the final terms of
it. And if that distinction goes away, not only then is there no really
principal distinction on this sort of discipline, that sort of discipline, but
also then this way of understanding philosophy goes away. So what is
philosophy now? That's why he says there's a shift toward pragmatism in this
result. Because in the end, there's no way to really distinguish in principle what
is philosophical. And I think that's what Klein thinks. What's the difference
between philosophy and physics or philosophy and psychology or philosophy
and linguistics? It's more or less that just philosophy is somewhat more
general. But whenever physicists start reflecting generally on the nature of
reality or the nature of physical law, whenever a psychologist says, So what
does this really tell us about the mind? They're really engaging in
philosophical reflection and it's really just kind of degrees of
generality. So the difference between philosophy and everything else is just a
matter of degree. More or less philosophers are just constantly involved in
these reflective, extremely abstract, rather vague enterprises. And as soon as
you get more specific about it, you turn into a scientist. Yeah. So why did he say
that he preferred logical, positive, and positivism over pragmatism in the
office if this is? That's a great question. So if that's really the story in
the end, why isn't Klein, somebody who really doesn't engage so much with
Russell and Karnap and so on, but is writing about Dewey and James and
Perse and so on, why doesn't he see himself clearly in that pragmatic
tradition? I think that is a really good question. You might think in the end
he forced to choose, he opts with these guys, right? So what's going on there? I
think partly it's that he looks at this older pragmatist tradition and he
thinks it's just not precise enough to actually give you any real information.
So there's a way of denying this distinction being a pragmatist that in
a sense he thinks is going in the right direction, but he doesn't really have
much sympathy with that way of doing philosophy. And he sees it in people like
Perse, James, and Dewey, where it's sort of suggestive, but on the other hand,
not worked out. There are places in Klein, especially in his 1969 book,
Ontological Relativity and Other Essays, where he talks directly about Dewey and
he says, I'm trying to give you a theory of language that's very similar to Dewey's
in a certain way. Dewey was hostile to this sort of picture of language where,
I think in a language he's a name of something, it's a sort of museum metaphor.
We take a term and we go off looking in the museum for the thing that we can
attach that label to. And he says, yeah, that's not the right way to see language,
so Dewey was right about that. But then he sort of forgets about Dewey. And why?
I think because in the end he thinks, Dewey gives you a good sort of picture of
the way things go, but gives you no real argument in favor of that. And in fact,
the picture is so sketchy that there's not that much to be learned from it.
So in the end, I think he thinks analytic philosophy does a better job and
logical empiricism even does a better job, because at least it formulates
precise questions and allows you to frame precise arguments. He thinks in the end,
some of its presuppositions are wrong. And those are things the pragmatists are
right about. But the pragmatists also are not in a position to do anything very
interesting with that. It's sort of like, let's say a great philosopher with
brilliant ideas brings up a child to have that perspective on the world, but not to
actually have any of the arguments be able to formulate anything precisely. And so
this little kid kind of has, let's say, the right philosophical ideas, but can't
defend them, can't articulate them very clearly. Quine almost sees the pragmatists
as being like that child. And so I think in the end that's why. Here at least is a
method that he thinks is a useful method. Whereas he doesn't think the pragmatists
historically had a very useful method, even though their views were in the end
closer to the truth. Yeah.
I don't understand why the John C's Mary Run rule that you introduced. Why would he
say that that's arbitrary?
All right, good question. It's not just a rule of like seeing. You could substitute
other than like, John, here is Mary saying or whatever.
Oh right, exactly. It's a more general rule than that. Yes, that's right. And in
practice linguists do this kind of thing all the time. And if you said, well gosh,
is it part of personal medical rules that people see with their eyes? The linguists
would typically say, no, that's not really part of my theory. Why not?
Well, gosh, why not exactly? I think the linguists would typically say because that
doesn't really fit into this compositional structure. That's not something that has to
be built into the theory of meaning. That's just an additional fact about seeing. And
there is a kind of rough and ready intuition that supports that thought, I think. So one
of the things that lurks underneath this and forms the foundation of a number of people
like Bryson Strauss and I'm projecting to what Kwan does, is the thought that, look,
actually in practice linguists don't have any proof figuring out what they should write
down as a semantical rule and what they would actually count as a bit of world knowledge
about things. There's huge agreement in the linguistic community about that. And the same
thing is true about logic. We don't have any problem writing down things about and or
even about knows that and things like that. And so why, if nobody seems that confused
about this, we should re-attack the distinction. There must be something that we're all responding
to here. Now, in the end, is the analysis is going to be, well, we're responding to distance
from the edge of experience or something like that. And so the analytic truths are going
to be the ones here that are pretty far from empirical dependency. And so they're going
to be way in the center of the web of belief. But in the end, it's a matter of degree. And
this is why there will be vague cases in the boundaries and blah, blah, blah. I think
to get a better answer than that, though, what we really need to do is think, what exactly
is Kwan objecting to? Is he saying there's no way to draw the distinction? Because you
might think, what we're doing, giving you a semantic, there is drawing the distinction.
So what do you mean we can't do it? That's like saying we can't do semantics. But people
do semantics all the time. So we've got to distinguish, I think, several questions. One
is what Kwan's really done. And let me see where I can put this. Let me get rid of this.
What Kwan has really done, in a sense, is say analytic is part of a set of concepts. Meaning,
synonym, definition, substitution. So what we're going to do here is we're going to
do a semantic rule. So it's the trutability. So it's the trutability. And semantic rule.
Oh, I could put a certain kind of necessity in here, too. And in the end, we've got this
whole set of concepts. And we can characterize them in terms of one another. And we do, to
a surprising degree, agree about how to use these things. But here's the thing. He thinks
they're all, in a sense, ill-founded. He wants to find some way of making sense of them from
outside that circle. Now one response is to say, why? The circle is fine as it is. If
I say I define courage in terms of bravery and bravery in terms of courage, that's not
very illuminating. But you might still say, but I'm right, right? And it would be very
strange to say, so there's no such thing as courage as a result of that. So why is he
really concerned about that? To some extent, I think this is developing within the context
of logical empiricism. And he's thinking, okay, what is logical empiricism all about
in the end? Observation, right? Bringing things back to observation. And so he's thinking,
I don't know how to give an observational account of any of these. How do I explain
in terms of observation what any single one of those is? You might think, oh, I observe
definitions in the dictionary. Yeah, but they're putting them in the dictionary because of some
identity of meanings that nobody lets say. But how do I characterize that in terms of
observation? The closest I could come, maybe, is that terms are used in exactly the same
way. And so something like a criterion of substitutability. But we saw that doesn't really
work either. That's neither necessary nor sufficient. And so in short, he ends up saying,
this whole structure is something that we would really like to find a foundation with
respect to observation, with respect to usage, with respect to behavior, something we can
actually pin down from the perspective of a logical empiricism. And it's all sort of
floating up there. And it's something we can't find any observational content to. So
one way of looking at it is to say, within the project of logical empiricism, he can't
find any way of making sense of all of this. Now, if you frame it in that way, you've got
a reason why this is an objection to people like A or Russell and Karnan. You don't have
much of a reason why anyone on the other side should care about this, because you can have
Codd or Heidegger or Descartes or whatever saying. But I don't start with those purposes.
I don't care about resting this on observation. Why should I care? So that's at best an answer
that will explain why these people are going to be in trouble here. Because on their own
lights, they can't really assign any of this and any of that.
Yeah. Sorry. It's been a long week. And so this was just to explain the why semantic
rules are considered for surgery?
Well, no. Really, now I'm trying to respond to the question of what's to be your picture
here? What's the real objection come to? And I think it comes down to the fact that these
concepts can all be defined in terms of one another, but there's no way to define any
of them in terms that are outside of that. And in particular, that would rest on something
like observation or behavior or usage or something we could tie these down to in ways that don't
already involve something that's in that circle. Yeah.
On the analytic synthetic kind of way of looking at things, where would art be?
Where would art be? Well, art isn't really giving us truths, you might think. And so it
doesn't really have propositional content that would allow us to classify them one way
or another. For example, suppose I say, ah, you want to work at artwork, I will now give
you an artwork. This is Bonnevac's logical empiricism, defined. So we've constructed
on logical symbols. Oh, I should put a lamp this morning. There. Now, there's no propositional
content to that. I haven't said anything. I haven't asserted anything. So if you say,
is that analytic or synthetic? It's kind of like, yeah, there's nothing there to be
analytic or synthetic. Now, as soon as I say things about it on the other hand, so art
criticism or that sort of thing will have to find a place somewhere. If I say, ah, that's
a terrible work of art, right? Where do I put aesthetic judgments like that? Presumably,
it's not through my definition that it's a bad work of art. That's something that would
require, you know, some content. So presumably something like that would be synthetic. Now,
insofar as it's a value, it raises special philosophical questions, because what about
all value judgments? Like, that's a bad work of art, or that was a bad action or something.
Presumably, those are typically going to be synthetic claims, though they might have a
special status and make us worry about things. But most normative claims are going to end
up being over here on the synthetic side. Things like murder is wrong or that's a bad
work of art. My drawing teacher would be very happy because it was very fast.
Oh yes, the faster you draw it, the more you get the essence of the object.
Do you actually see some of the face in the middle a little bit?
Oh, you sort of can. Yeah. Yeah, there's a little bit like a bit inside.
And it's on a blackboard, like that famous portrait of Wittgenstein in front of the
blindboard. So see, there's a, it not only is a nice work of art in there, it just
contains illusions to other works of art. You see, you just see more and more levels
as you come. This is the kind of thing that got me in A and R. See what's going on?
Oh, that's great. Okay, well, never mind that.
Yes. Oh yes, we've got five minutes left and we haven't even moved on to the second
dogma. So, and by after spring break we'll have forgotten what the second dogma even is.
So let's talk about the second dogma. It's one about reduction. And it turns out to be,
well, we can take it as really reduction in something like the sense that Frege and
Russell were concerned with, the reducibility of mathematics for logic. But in a certain
sense, I think we can characterize what Klein's doing here much more simply without
going into the details of that. So suppose we just thought of it this way. For any
sentence, S, let's say, there are sets of observations that would confirm or
disconfirm S. And let's call these, oh, I don't know, like O plus and O minus. Okay?
O plus here would be the set of observations that would tend to confirm set and sense.
And O minus the set of observations that would tend to disconfirm S. So now, if we
actually could do that, if we could associate with any sentence, whether we call that
its meaning or not, presumably people like A or S, that is the meaning of S. But whether
or not we say that, we could say, all right, if we can characterize sentences in terms
of pairs of sets of observations that would confirm them or disconfirm them, then we
could say, aha, then we can define analyticity. S is analytic if and only if every
observation is in that O plus for S. Yes, we should make that specific to that sentence.
Okay, so everything confirms it. Then we'll make it an analytic truth. Yeah.
Oh, well, I've been thinking, and this has popped up before in a class where, like, this
sentence is false. Like, as, how do we apply that?
Good point. What will happen if we have a paradoxical sentence? This sentence is false.
What confirms that? Ooh, you might think nothing confirms that, right? Suppose there
were an observation that confirmed it. Well, then it would imply that it was false, but
that would disconfirm it. And so, what if something disconfirmed it? Well, it says it's
false, so that would actually confirm it. And so, you could be thinking, oh gosh, I got
every observation both confirms and disconfirms it, or maybe you could think, actually, nothing
is up really confirming it or disconfirming it. I haven't said anything about what the
relationship between these would be, but if we say, assume these are disjoint sets and
nothing both confirms and disconfirms the sentence, then we would end up saying, gosh, yeah,
maybe a paradoxical sentence is one, which is going to look actually very much like a
meaningless sentence the way the logical empiricists understand it. No observation would confirm
or disconfirmed. And so, you might say, if S has no empirical content, if and only if
O plus S and O minus S are just the empty set, nothing confirms it, nothing disconfirms
it. And paradoxical sentences would probably end up being in that sort of thing. So, we
would end up saying, yeah, this sentence is false, that has no empirical content. But
admittedly, that's a trickier problem and it might give us headaches for other reasons
as soon as we think about what truth means more broadly. But anyway, this at least has
some hope. So, suppose we were able to do this, what's quite subjection to that? This is
actually, in a sense, what Carnap is trying to do ultimately at a certain stage of his
thought. What? What's wrong with that?
Wrong time! But I'm not going to say the answer comes next time, because actually next time
we won't have class and your offer spring break and no one will remember the question.
So, what we're going to do is just, look, it's one answer, do head, okay? These things
don't face the Tribunal of Experience one-on-one. We have to do our examination of what confirms
or disconfirms in the context of a broader theory. And so, in the end, he says it's really
all of science together that confronts the Tribunal of Experience, not each sentence
together. So, in short, he says there's really no way to define O plus and O minus here,
because we only know what confirms or disconfirms something in the context of a background theory.
