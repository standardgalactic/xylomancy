Hi. I'm going to talk to you today about Hume's method. Hume is an empiricist par excellence.
Locke, you might say, is one of those philosophers who has an idea, in theory of knowledge, empiricism.
But he's trying to combine that with all sorts of other insights, and so he, for example,
tries to prove the existence of God. He talks unapologetically about powers, about capacities,
about causation. He does a variety of other things that later empiricists have thought
are dubious things to do. He develops an extensive political philosophy in other works where he
talks about obligations and rights, and a variety of other things that it's rather hard to reconcile
with his empiricist foundations. Hume is not like that. If Locke is somebody who is combining a
bunch of different insights about a bunch of different areas and trying to make them fit
together in a complex philosophical framework, Hume is somebody who has one idea. He takes over
that idea from Locke of empiricism, and he says, I'm going to pursue that to the bitter end,
and that's what he does. So he finds out that all sorts of things have to be rethought. He doesn't
take anything like our common sense conception of causation, or obligation, or rights, or anything
else really, and say, somehow we have to build that into the empiricist framework. That's Locke's
mission. Hume instead develops a method and says, it either fits or it doesn't, and if it doesn't
fit, I'm with it. So Hume is going to interpret empiricism rather differently, even though you
might say, look, his method is basically just Locke's. Yes, but used in a rather different way.
So his classic work is a treatise of human nature. And there is my well-loved copy of it.
Hume wrote that when he was only 23 years old. It's a remarkable masterpiece for someone who was
so young. Later he wrote a small book, The Enquiry, which was meant to summarize and publicize this.
He wrote it with great expectations of having produced a great philosophical work. But then,
as he put it later, it fell stillborn from the press. It didn't attract much attention. Nobody
paid any real attention to it at all, even to refute it. And it took a long time for Hume to be
recognized as a great philosopher. Even throughout the 19th century, he would have been viewed as
somebody notable, but not one of the true philosophical greats. Whereas in the contemporary
scene in England and the United States, Australia, New Zealand, in short, in the English-speaking
world, he's viewed as one of the most important philosophers in history. And a treatise of human
nature is now viewed as one of the greatest philosophical classics.
Well, Hume outlines his method there. And we've talked about some of the basic elements. So I'm
going to review them here just to remind you, because they're crucial to understanding where
that method is coming from and how it's being used. They're simple and complex ideas. The complex
ideas are built out of the simple ideas, and they come from simple impressions. Moreover,
they represent them exactly. We build more complex ideas. Often we stray very far from experience
and maybe from any content at all. But at the level of the simple ideas, we've got a direct
and exact match to simple impressions. So Hume says all our simple ideas in their first appearance
have derived from simple impressions, which are correspondent to them and which they exactly
represent. Those simple impressions are things that Locke would have referred to as sensations or
reflections, that is to say, awarenesses of our own mental states. Locke's method, as we've seen,
is to take things we think we know, but might just turn out to be faith or opinion or even
superstition, and try to figure out whether those beliefs count as knowledge by tracing them back
to their origins. We trace the ideas that are part of that knowledge or belief and go back
to where we got those ideas. We trace them to the origins and experience to find out
whether this really counts as knowledge, whether we have good evidence for our beliefs, whether
any of those would count as certain, and so on. We want to understand which ones are really just
opinion and which ones are knowledge. Well, the empiricist method in general is inspired by that.
We take complex ideas, we examine the simple ideas they're made of, we find the origins of
those simple ideas and the simple impressions and experience that they come from. And here's the idea,
the content of the idea lies in those simple impressions from which it comes. So we trace
things back to what it, well, what gave rise to it, what it popped out of in experience.
But there is a complication, even at that basic level. It's partly because we abstract, combine,
negate, disjoin, and do all sorts of other things with our ideas that we can diverge far from reality.
But it's not only that, there are other problems as well, because our ideas are weak in comparison
with impressions. Even the simple ideas are weak in comparison with the impression itself,
even though there's the same content, the content matches exactly, but the force and
the vacity, as Hume puts it, are very different. He says all ideas, especially abstract ones,
are naturally faint and obscure. The mind has but a slender hold of them. They're
up to be confounded with other resembling ideas. And when we have often employed any term,
though without a distinct meaning, we're up to imagine it has a determined idea next to it.
So ideas are relatively faint, obscure, or weak. And that's true even at the relatively simple
level. If we think about ideas of colors, those ideas are fairly weak. If I show you the impressions,
it's easy to tell them apart, I might show you two different shades of paint I'm considering.
And when I hold the paint patches up, you can very clearly discern the difference between them.
And the impression, the sensation is very strong, it's very vivid, you see that they're different.
But now, you forget their names, you go back to the paint store, and you say, well, I know I like
that one better than the other. But which one was it? And you go and you look at the chart now.
Maybe you have, luckily, the same thought, but maybe there's no chart. Maybe the guy at the
paint store says, well, I'm sorry, we're all out of charts. But what was the name of the paint?
And you suddenly go, I don't remember. And you try to call it up your mind.
He says, well, was it this one? I don't know. I have the idea, right, of that color. Maybe I
didn't do remember the name or something like it. But the problem is, I can't now distinguish it.
If somebody says, yeah, all these things got mixed up, and they're all mislabeled. So is it
this or is it that? You may not know. And maybe you've seen it, but maybe you no longer remember it.
The idea is weak in comparison with the impression. The content's the same,
but it lacks the same force. It lacks the same vivacity. Well, impressions, in contrast, are
strong. When you're right there looking at the chip of paint, it's very prominent to you, right?
It's very strong. It hits you hard, as a word, mentally. Whereas the idea, the memory of it,
and so on, that's much weaker. So Hume says, all impressions, all sensations,
either outward or inward are strong and vivid. The limits between them are more exactly determined,
nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake in regard to them. I can tell the difference
between the paint chips when I'm looking at them directly, but trying to remember them later or
just saying, okay, I remember one was called Belgian chocolate and the other was called German
chocolate and which was which and which one did I like better and what exactly did that German
chocolate thing look like? I may not be able to remember that. Well, Hume's method, then, is to
say, if I want to understand the content of my ideas, I have to go back to the impressions. I have
to go back to what they come from in experience. Now, in the case of a paint color, all right,
that's not too hard. I know what impression that came from. And so I can go back to that. I know
the idea of the content. I'm not worried. Yeah, you're just making up that German chocolate thing.
No, no, no, I saw the chip. I know I saw it. I may not remember now exactly what it looks like,
but I know I saw it. But a lot of more abstract ideas are not like that. A few years ago, somebody
came and gave a talk in the English department. And the main concept of their talk was the concept
of hegemony. There was an older professor in the audience who heard the talk and stood up at the
end to ask a question and said, I have a very simple basic question. What is hegemony? And the
speaker didn't know how to answer that, didn't know how to give a definition. And that's one of
those things where you might say, well, okay, a lot of academic discourse is like that. A lot of
things that go on at a university involve terms that are very abstract, very far removed from
experience. It's not at all like, oh, that German chocolate color I saw at the Sherwin-Williams store.
No, it's like something else. It is much more abstract. And you might think, wait, what is the
content? I don't know. Here's somebody who had written a doctoral dissertation on it and couldn't
give a definition. And so you might think, well, wait a minute. I mean, if that person doesn't
know what the content is, how am I supposed to know what the content is? Now, that's not to say
that particular concept or any other particular concept is meaningless or contradictory or absurd
or anything. But Hume is saying, look, it's super easy in that kind of abstract discourse
to start talking about things without really having a clear idea of what you're talking about,
to use terms without any idea or ideas that are so vague, we have no idea what their content is.
So to understand this kind of thing, we have to trace it back. Now, a lot of early analytic
philosophers inspired by Hume thought that philosophers of their era, and often they were
idealists, personalists, for example, around the turn of the century, or people like Heidegger,
they attacked us using all sorts of meaningless concepts. And indeed, a lot of those philosophers
say things that are rather bizarre, absolute idealists around the turn of the century were
fond of talking about a world soul, a soul of a person that's already hard enough, but a soul of
the world, what does that mean? What content could that possibly have? Or Heidegger talks about
nothingness, the nothing, as if that's an object. What do you mean the nothing? That's very strange.
Heidegger talks about the horizon. Well, I think that actually does have a precise meaning,
but it's not obvious what it is. And so the analytic philosophers, what is this? Look,
I have a shirt, I might have a personality, but do I have a horizon? I don't know. And
he didn't mean, by the way, the physical horizon of where the earth meets the sky. He meant something
much more abstract. So in short, you might say, I don't know what content these things have,
if they do have a content, I want to trace that back to experience. So Hume often entertains a
suspicion that people don't know what they're talking about. And he says, when that happens,
when we entertain any suspicion that a philosophical term is employed, without any
meaning or idea, as is but too frequent, we need but inquire from what impression is that supposed
idea derived? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion.
By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute,
which may arise concerning their nature and reality. So if somebody starts talking about some
abstract idea, whether it's the nothing, or the horizon, or hegemony, or the world soul,
Hume says, all right, look, from what impression is this derived? Okay, tell me what an experience
generates this. You've got an idea of a world soul? Well, what do you mean? Where'd you get that idea?
So maybe, well, I studied Neoplatonism. Well, where'd the Neoplatonists get that idea? Come on,
I mean, what do you mean? It's hard enough to figure out what a soul of a human being would be.
I don't know what this even means. So where's the impression? What are you talking about in the end?
And later, pragmatists will adapt this to their own purposes, as we'll see,
and start talking about the cash value of an idea. What difference does it make to practice?
Say there is a world soul, or say there isn't, who cares? What difference does it make?
And you might say something similar here, but Hume means something more specific,
not just what differences it make in practical terms. He means trace it back. Where in experience
did this come from? And if you just made it up out of thin air without an experience to back it
up to give it content, I'm going to say it has no content. Maybe, of course, it will turn out it
has a content that's very different from what you think it is. You've lost the thread. And so,
yeah, it did mean something, but you know what? That makes everything you're saying absurd,
if that's the meaning of it. So we've got to watch out for both things. Maybe it doesn't mean
anything. Maybe it means something really different, and you're misusing it.
Well, Hume's method, then, is this. We take our ideas, and we're trying to figure out which
ones are adequate, which ones actually match experience. So we trace them back to their
simple impressions from which they're derived. That's their real content. Sometimes it will
turn out we can't do it. There is no real impression underlying this. And so we end up saying,
this is just, you know, and maybe with world soul, that's what's going on. There just is no
content to that. There is no impression underlying it. We say meaningless. It doesn't mean anything
at all. Sometimes maybe it's contradictory. We take apart the idea and we find out in the end,
it's not that it doesn't have any corresponding impression. It's that it has corresponding
impressions that clash. So in the end, it looks like, gosh, it has a content, but the content is
sort of like round square. It's something that is itself contradictory. It makes no sense.
Sometimes it will turn out it does have a content, but it's not what we thought. And so much of what
we're saying about it turns out to be false. So Hume will say, look at things like this,
especially when you start entertaining this suspicion that people don't know what they're
talking about. Say, look, what are you talking about? Sometimes it's going to turn out to be
nothing. Sometimes it will be, well, something, but completely incoherent and contradictory.
Sometimes it just will be something surprising that isn't what they seem to be talking about
at all. I want to go back to remind us quickly of what an empiricist thinks, because it brings
out another aspect of the method. The question between judgment empiricists and judgment rationalists
is the question of synthetic a priori judgment. Those other three categories everybody agrees
about. There are things that are analytic and a priori, synthetic and a posteriori. Nobody thinks
there's anything that's analytic and a posteriori. The question is whether there can be anything that
is synthetic a priori. Something that's synthetic truly about the world and not just about language,
but on the other hand a priori, knowable independently of experience of the world.
The empiricist says, well, obviously not. How could you know what the world without having
experience of the world? But the rationalist says, you can. You can through reason alone,
through reflection, through thought experiments, through things like that.
So the judgment empiricist says, yeah, I'm not going to believe that I can get anywhere purely
by examining my own mind, purely through this idea of thought experiments and so on. All that
does is tell me about the relations of ideas inside my mind. It doesn't take me outside my mind to
the world. Well, that implies that from an empiricist point of view, there are only two kinds of
knowledge. All knowledge, assuming that there is any content at all to what somebody claims to know,
it's got to go back to one of those two categories. It's got to be either analytic and a priori
or synthetic and a posteriori. Either it's an empirical truth about the world as natural sciences,
that's the synthetic a posteriori part, or it's analytic a priori in the sense that it is purely
verbal, purely a matter of logic. But in that way, it doesn't tell us anything directly about the
world, but still it's something knowable independently of experience. Lots of things are
like that from an empiricist point of view, at least from the point of view of Hume and many
other empiricists. Logic is like that, knowledge on the basis of definitions is like that,
mathematics is like that. So I can know that a bachelor is a bachelor, or that a bachelor is
unmarried, or that one plus one is two, purely on the basis of definitions. I don't need experience
of the world because they're not really about the world. But anything that really is about the
world, like there are more than a dozen chairs in this room, that requires experience. I can't
know that just by reflecting on chairs and rooms. I have to actually have experience of the room.
And that means that synthetic and a posteriori. I need experience to gain that knowledge of the
world. So there are two kinds of knowledge. Basically, there's a kind of knowledge you find
in logic, in definitions, in mathematics, in dictionaries. There's the kind of knowledge you
find in natural science, history, and other things that are really describing the world
on the basis of experience. That's it, there's nothing else. So what does that exclude? Well,
we might take a look at various things that rationalists have called synthetic a priori truths.
We've looked at this list before, so I'll just remind you a little bit of the kind of thing here.
Avicenna talks about the whole being greater than the parts, or things equal to the same
thing being equal to each other. For Descartes, I think, I am. Nothing's made from nothing.
What's been done can't be undone. Nothing could be and not be at the same time,
could exist and not exist at the same time, but also, for example, could not be red and green
all over at the same time. Leibniz, no fact without a sufficient reason why it should be so and not
otherwise. Kant, every event has a cause. Seven plus five is twelve, and every other mathematical
truth, including the truths of geometry, like between any two points, lies one and only one line.
All of those are examples of synthetic a priori truths, and of course philosophers have had
their candidates too. Things like God exists, the soul is immortal, the world consists of
substances and attributes, the will is free, every substance has an essence, you ought to seek the
good, happiness is intrinsically good, courage is a virtue, and so on. Well, if we take a look at
all of these, Hume says, and examine them and try to understand where they're coming from
and whether they're legitimate, we only have a few choices. So he gives us a test for nonsense.
Hume says, when we run over libraries persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make?
If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance,
let us ask, does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain
any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Committed then to the
flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. So Hume is saying something rather
remarkable here, committed to the flames. Either it's got abstract reasoning concerning quantity
or number, in other words it's got logic and mathematics in it, in which case its knowledge,
its analytic, it's not really knowledge of the world, but it may be highly useful anyway,
or what about experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?
That's highly useful, that's what natural science is. In a different way, it's what history is,
political sciences, economics is, and so on. All of those are really expressing truths about the
world. Don't think of experimental here as just within a laboratory. Really, it's a question of
matters of fact about the world. That's fine too, but there are all sorts of other things
that aren't like that. So let's run down that list and find out what we do with them.
Everything has to be classified as either analytic or synthetic, or as utterly meaningless.
So we look through. As empiricists, the whole is greater than its parts. Almost certainly
Hume would say that's analytic. It's just a question of the meaning of whole in part.
Things equal to the same thing or equal to each other. He said that's part of the meaning of
equality, analytic. Nothing's made from nothing. Now that seems to be a claim about the world.
Nothing just pops into existence. Nothing is made out of nothing. Things have to be made
out of other things. If I'm going to have a factory that is going to produce some object,
I've got to have inputs to my factory. I can't just say, out of Kazam, and poof, it goes out of
nothing. But that seems like a claim about the world, right? There's no conceptual absurdity
about a magician or a wizard suddenly creating something out of thin air. Could happen. It's
not incoherent in the sense of being logically contradictory. So it's not an analytic truth
that nothing is made from nothing. It's a claim about the world. So Hume would say, well, but look,
it's pretty darn well established, right? It's on the basis of experience. We say that things don't
just pop out of thin air. Things are made out of other things. It's impossible for anything to be
and not be at the same time. Well, be and not be, it's part of the meaning of negation. That's
true, Hume would say. What's been done can't be undone. That seems to be a claim about the world.
After all, I can erase what I've written on a page. Here we mean really go back into the past.
It's something like saying time travel is impossible. Well, that's a claim about the world.
That's not just an analytic truth, and it can't be anything else. It's a factual claim about the
world. It might turn out to be true. It might turn out to be false. Kurt Girdel showed that there
are actually circular time loops that are consistent with the axioms of general relativity,
so who knows? Every event has a cause. Similarly, that's a claim about the world. It might turn out
to be true. It might turn out to be false if there are truly random events in quantum mechanics,
for example. But then we turn to the philosophical ones, and now Hume says, look,
a lot of these might turn out to be meaningless. God exists. That's surely not analytic. It's a
claim about the world. It might be true or false about the world, and does it even have a meaning?
We have to inquire into the content of the concept God and trace that back to its origin
and experience. Maybe we can do that. Maybe we can't. And so some empiricists have said we can.
Some others have said we can't. Controversial. So it might be a synthetic claim. It might on the other
hand be meaningless if you think that your concept of God is one that can't be tied back to any kind
of impression. What about the soul is immortal? Well, depends on this question of the soul, right?
I mean, mortal, that we can find the origins for an experience. People experience death,
they see things die. So that's not a problem. We can negate the concept of being mortal and get
immortal. But what about soul? Here we have to say, well, I don't know. So that's why that
was also controversial. Maybe it's a factual claim about the world that there are such things as
souls in the world and that those things can survive death. But on the other hand, maybe
it's really meaningless if it turns out that we can't make any sense of the idea of soul.
So once again, there's a place where we may or may not be able to use the empiricist method
to trace back the content of our concept of a soul. What about the freedom of the will? Well,
it's the same thing in a way. It's similarly controversial. What do we mean by the will?
What do we mean by freedom? Maybe we can make good sense of that. But if we can,
that seems to be a claim about the world and about this thing called the will. But maybe we
can't, in which case that's really a meaningless claim. Every substance has an essence. Again,
this idea of a substance, well, Locke thinks we can trace that back to experience.
Hume and Barkley think we can't. What about an essence? Actually, all of these
empiricists after Locke tend to be suspicious of that notion. Locke thinks we can make good
sense of the concept of an essence. Barkley and Hume deny it. So we're going to see a sharp divide
among empiricists on that one. You ought to seek the good. Well, we might worry that obligation
or the good actually turns out to be meaningless and we can't trace it back to experience in the
right way. So maybe that turns out to be meaningless. Or maybe it's simply analytic. That's how the good
is defined. That which is worth seeking. And then finally courage is a virtue. Maybe that's just part
of the definition of courage. But maybe it's a synthetic claim about the world that in general
it's a good thing to be courageous. Or maybe we end up saying courage or more likely virtue.
We don't know how to make sense of that in purely experiential terms. So with all of these we apply
Hume's method. And sometimes we say that's not synthetic a priori. That's not a real truth
about the world that we can only discover through reason alone. But that, well I shouldn't say
only discover, that we can discover through reason only without experience of the world.
Instead, we say either it's analytic, like holes are greater than their parts,
or it's a synthetic claim about the world like you can't go back and change the past,
or it's something that's utterly meaningless. So what if it's utterly meaningless? Well Hume says
quite figuratively I hope. Commit it to the flames. Or more rationally you might say don't pay any
attention to it. You can gain nothing from it. It's meaningless. In the end it has no content.
So you will learn nothing from it. You can gain no knowledge from it. And lots of people talk
nonsense. Hume would say look this isn't a problem if people didn't talk nonsense all the time. But
they do. And so hang around the university for a while. You'll find all sorts of people talking
nonsense. And it's not just in universities. Tune into the media. A lot of people are talking
nonsense. It happens all around you. And it happens day to day. It happens in almost every
setting. You encounter people. They start talking about things. Sometimes those things are really
things about the world. You understand their content. Maybe they're true. Maybe they're false.
But sometimes they don't mean anything at all. So Hume says be on your guard.
And even though I am not going to tell you. Commit anything to the flames. I think that's
a really bad idea. I will tell you there are things that you really should ignore. And you
should simply say yeah I'm going to learn nothing out of this. Nothing good can come from this.
