In this session, Donald Davidson talks philosophy with his teacher and long-standing friend,
W. V. Quine.
The discussion focuses on two broad areas of philosophy, empiricism in which Quine is
mainly interviewed by Davidson and truth where Quine conducts the questioning.
In these important discussions, major differences between these two highly influential philosophers
are highlighted and some of their differences are brought to an apparent resolution.
In response to Quine's opening question, Davidson clearly states his chief criticism
of Quine's approach to philosophy.
He charges that Quine, like all empiricists, is committed to an undesirable third dogma
of empiricism.
This is the view that all our empirical knowledge is based upon something non-propositional,
that is, given to us by the senses.
As this criticism is elaborated, we see the extent to which Quine's views about the source
of empirical knowledge have changed, from his famous paper Two Dogmas of Empiricism
through Word and Object, and up to his most recent writings.
Quine suggests that he no longer holds a third dogma of empiricism, but he maintains,
nonetheless, that he is still an empiricist.
The discussion ends with a dispute about what it is to be an empiricist, and Davidson's
exclamation, and I quote, we're in agreement, completely, it only took 50 years.
In the second part of the program, Quine questions Davidson on his views about truth.
Both philosophers agree that truth is always relative to a language, but Quine holds that
it is also relative to a chosen manual of translation.
This leads to a lively discussion encompassing both the connections between truth and translation
and the importance of a Tarski-style definition of truth.
The program ends with questions from the invited audience, from David Papineau of King's
College London, from the philosopher and broadcaster Brian McGee, and from Colin Hausen of the London
School of Economics.
We join the discussion now at the London School of Economics.
I'm delighted to introduce my next discussant on the session, on the work of Donald Davidson.
He, I can't say is an old friend of mine, which I'm sure Donald can say with his hand
on his heart, but I've had the pleasure of knowing and working with him now.
It's over a period of a few years since the project that we worked on together in conversation
with Willard Van Orman Quine as it was, and I'm absolutely delighted that he's come here
today.
He's made a special trip from his planned itinerary to come here for his great, close friend and
pupil, Donald Davidson.
So without dragging any of this off since the time is valuable, and I'm sure you want
to hear our honored guest, I'd like to give you Professor Quine, emeritus professor at
Harvard University, and our guest today.
It's a privilege and I want to get out of the way and let him get close to his friend.
Can you sit here?
Okay.
Be careful on the wires.
Well, along the middle of the century, I came out against what I called two dogmas of empiricism.
One was the dichotomy, the basic dichotomy, professively of truths into the analytic,
or ones that depended only on meanings of the words, and the synthetic ones which had some
factual content.
And the other dogma was the dogma of reductionism in the sense of there being separable empirical
content to any meaningful synthetic statement, which could be isolated independently of surrounding
statements.
And then, more recently, Don, you came out against an alleged third dogma, and it's
not altogether clear to me what that is.
Good.
I'll do my best.
I think I heard about the first two dogmas in about 1940, and I've never deviated from
the straight path with respect to them.
The third one, I learned or thought I learned when I was a graduate student to be against
not only reductionism, but the idea that all of our empirical knowledge, anyway, is that
based on something which is not itself propositional in character, something that's given by the
senses, call it what you will, experience, percepts, impressions, sense data, they're
all these different things.
The search for something of this kind is easy to understand.
If we just start out with beliefs, we wonder how they're attached or get attached to the
world, so we want something that lies behind them that will justify them.
Nevertheless, I became convinced then, I guess partly anyway by Sellers' article on
the myth of the given, that there was nothing we could find that satisfied these two conditions.
On the one hand, it would justify our empirical beliefs, and on the other hand, it wouldn't
be propositional in character, because if it wasn't propositional in character, then
it couldn't stand in a relation of justification.
I remember reading some of the logical positivists that seemed to me to be having trouble with
this very issue.
One of my teachers was C.I. Lewis, and he certainly had something like sense data.
There was the school of sense data and the like on the one hand, and those who were against
it and had to try to come up with something different.
The third dogma of empiricism I've just described, that is, it's the idea that somehow in experience
we are given something which is not propositional, but which nevertheless justifies our empirical
beliefs.
Now, U-Van were very cagey about this.
You gave up on sense data and any of these other things, and had an alternative approach,
which in the end I decided nevertheless had the seeds of the same mistake or confusion.
It's perhaps not too long a story to say how it seemed to me this was still there.
Of course there were phrases in, well let's start with two dogmas, in two dogmas there
was the totality of our beliefs on the one hand, and on the other hand there was experience
of pressing in from the outside, and the relationship was holistic so that you couldn't track down
the empirical content, especially to more theoretical sentences to any particular place
on the periphery as it was then metaphorically described, but nevertheless there was the tribunal
of experience.
I remember way back then, because you may not remember this, but I actually read the manuscript
of two dogmas in 1950 before you gave it when you came to the south of France and stayed
with me and my then wife during that summer, you had it with you, I read it, and I worried
about that tribunal of experience, does it speak up, if it speaks up then it's got propositional
content, but no, propositions started one stage further in, so the question is what
exactly is the relationship between the tribunal of experience and observation sentences which
lie right there on the periphery.
Now all of that was a metaphor and in fact it only came in at the very end as a kind
of way of summing up an attitude rather than a doctrine, and we're in an object, this
got cashed out to a certain extent, although we still were often regaled with phrases like
the totality of our data come from the stimulations of our senses, all of the evidence that we
have, and I remember stewing really for years about what exactly is the evidence in this
theory, it isn't the actual firings of the nerve endings, that's not the evidence.
If we start with observation sentences and say they are the evidence, not that they express
the evidence, but that they are the evidence, that doesn't seem to be the right category
for something to be evidence, and I remember writing at some point there, as far as I can
see Quine doesn't have anything that really should be called the ultimate evidence, he
has no theory of evidence, and he agreed with this, I hope he still do.
Yes, I certainly don't speak of experience anymore, if I'm on my guard.
I think my attitude here is closer to Popper in the sense of stressing refutation rather
than evidence and support, and the refutation comes in predicting something which is describable
in an observation sentence, a sentence that would be agreed to by all the observers who
are familiar with the language, these are the ultimate checkpoints, as I see it, and
that's where the empirical content comes into our theory of nature. The term evidence
itself plays an essential role, I don't think it's a supporting member of the structure
anymore for me, if it ever was really, it certainly would seem so in that last page
of two documents, but certainly from a naturalistic point of view, we need to find out what the
mechanism is of finding out about the world, this is simply a causal matter which involves
the neural receptors and the internal neural hookup, but as far as there is an empirical
content, it operates at these checkpoints which are just here and there, that's what
keeps our theory honest, of what to call evidence in the sense of what we would observe first
and then leads us to make a conjecture, is less easy to say, we are guided partly by
observations, partly by canons of simplicity, symmetry, the sort of thing that makes a theory
appeal to us and to what extent that is dependable, well I think there's still some unsolved
problems there, I'm wondering in view of all this, whether I still hold the third dogma
or not, well I think it's a good question, because one of the ways in which I thought
I could show that you did, you've given up, I think, and that has to do with how do we
determine the content of observation sentences, and at one time it was determined by patterns
of stimulation at the skin or wherever, and so there's more to the story which I can tell
if necessary, you've partly given that up, that is the patterns of stimulation, the actual
patterns, I have only a very remote connection with the actual contents, which are geared
to distal objects and so forth, now that in itself is to give up in that area anyway what
I call the dogma of empiricism, well yes let's see in what sense I give that up, I would
see it as in this sense of recognizing, which was a problem back in Word and Object, recognizing
that there need be and probably is no substantial homology between one individual's receptors
and that neural hookup and another's, and in fact it's in one of the earliest pages
of Darwin's Origin of Species that he says regarding insects, he says even these simple
creatures have decidedly, unlike neural patterns, neural hookups, one from another, and yet
we do somehow agree in our responses, we learn to agree in our responses to distal objects
as if those distal objects were flashed on us with pretty much identical projections,
which they're presumably not. Well in Word and Object faced with this problem, I assumed
the homology but I was uncomfortable with it, and then finally in fact on your urging,
I gave it up but it left that question then hanging, hanging fire and it wasn't until
some years later that I began to see my way through that, namely in terms of a pre-established
harmony to borrow Leibniz's race, but to a pre-established harmony which unlike Leibniz's
was explicable causally without divine intervention, and namely through natural selection and adaptation
of our standards of similarity with the environment quite independently of whether there was a
neural matching to any appreciable degree between one individual's intake and another.
So, well perhaps that is the conclusion that the third dogma, that I don't hold that dogma
myself. Well you've said that now that the third dogma is gone, really empiricism itself
is gone, and I certainly haven't viewed it that way as I continue to view myself as an empiricist,
but where I have this lingering empiricism, which I think is vital, is with respect to these
checkpoints, that we don't have an out and out coherence of epistemology, a way of knowing,
but our procedure is tied to nature, just in that now and then we can derive something from our
theory which we can check to our satisfaction, at least we can be fairly sure that it's wrong
that the cluster of hypotheses which together have implied this experimental setup is wrong,
has some false hypotheses in it, and if we don't find that conflict then things are all right
up to the next inquiry, next test. I'm not persuaded even that the negative result is
conclusive, that's a point where I certainly have eased up, but that the conclusiveness of the
observation sentences themselves grades off, and it's a matter of the degree to which theory has
infused into these sentences, but there is simply observably and a tendency to firm agreement
among observers on certain reports and not of this, an immediate agreement among those who
command the language, and well I would say this was a lingering trace of empiricism.
Well I don't disagree with any of that, so if that's empiricism I'm an empiricist too. I was
counting somebody as an empiricist only if in effect they thought there was some epistemically
significant intermediary between the world and beliefs about it, and let's just take
observation sentences however exactly, we pick them out in a graded classification anyway,
but is there something that happens in between that is what we really use as evidence for
what's beyond, something that's somehow given by the senses all right, that's what I was calling
the dogma of empiricism, the third dogma, and I thought you were originally stuck with something
that was like that when you were counting the contents of observation sentences as being given
by, that is defined by the patterns of stimulation that caused them, and therefore something personal,
not public at all, but something personal. So that's my idea of old-fashioned empiricism,
and I remember once a long ago quizzing you about this and saying, but aren't your, isn't
your notion of stimulus meaning just doing the same sort of work that sense data did before?
You said yes, that's the whole idea. Let's find something that's scientifically respectable,
namely sense organs being stimulated in place of sense data, but you wanted them to do the same
work that is to serve as somehow allowing us to introduce something that would count as data
evidence or something of that sort for our beliefs. Now you've removed that, or let's say you've
moved it to the outside world, and now it seems to me, it's not like old-fashioned empiricism
anymore, it's naturalism, and that seems to me fine. Good. In word and object, already in my
discussion of translation, for instance, and even in my concept of observation sentences,
it was always distal, it was always about the external world, the observation sentences themselves,
it's raining, it's mama, and so on. But there was the problem of the meaning of minds,
and at that point in word and object, this lame device for accommodating it, namely assuming
that there must be, in a central respects, physiological homology between the receptors
of one person and those of another, and giving that up, first just giving it up and wondering,
all right, how do we count for agreement, and then seeing finally how we do in terms of
ultimately of natural selection. That runs out that picture, but I think a good part of this
transition was in the 50s between word and object 1950, and I mean, two dogmas 1950, and word and
object 1960. I found much of roots of reference was rather going back and forth between using
stimulus meanings still as an important complex, and really just explaining the contents of
observation sentences in terms of distal stimuli, and some passages did it one way,
and some did it another way, and I always tried to encourage the distal one.
I even found it, in roots of reference, a page where I come very close to what I now
view as the solution, namely the harmony of subjective standards of
perceptual similarity between individuals, an intersubjective harmony of the subjective
standards, and finally that gets explained by natural selection, the environment being
the shared thing rather than the receptors, the environment that is to say, shared by
our ancestors, far enough back so that natural selection could do its work.
Well, all that seems to be exactly right, and indeed, I thought that was the right way to go
for a long time. Just the thing that needs emphasis, from my point of view anyway,
is we don't have any way of pulling together the various things that go into
stimulus, the old idea of stimulus meaning. We don't have any way of pulling that together
except by talking about the distal objects. I mean, that's where the convergence comes,
as you're now saying. So it's not as though there's some way in which as philosophers,
we can study how it is that the different patterns of stimulation, nevertheless,
the particular class of stimulation that do prompt us to give similar responses as table,
glass, pitcher, and so forth. We just say, well, that's how it came out.
And much of that, of course, can be partially explained, or maybe a great deal can be explained
by people who know much more neurology and wiring of the brain and that sort of thing
than we do. But our explanation of what patterns go together, so to speak,
to produce the same response, we just say, well, what brings them together is the same as the
response. Not only the sameness of my responses, because I respond to the very different patterns
in somewhat the same way. Never mind what the lighting is, never mind the perspective,
never mind the distance. People get a person's response under all these different conditions,
but furthermore, you do the same thing. And all of this has a natural explanation,
but it doesn't seem to me to be empiricism anymore in one of its most characteristic
phases, namely somehow there's a subjective or personal thing from which I build up the whole
picture of the world. Here the picture of the world is being built up on the basis of something
that we share with each other. Yes, good. The divergence from an overwhelming empiricism,
perhaps, is that within the scope of the checkpoints, there can be such a tremendous
variation in all the superstructure, all the theory, all the natural science that
systematizes and brings together our observations. And this, in fact, is the sort of thing that made me
make the conjecture anyway of the indeterminacy of translation of theoretical sentences.
Then there's this recent short article of yours in the Journal of Philosophy
in which you announce the discovery of the distal object.
And you say, all right, now this goes for understanding another person,
for our theory of meanings. But you say, with respect to epistemology,
I'm still for working with the proximal stimulus. And now I wonder what you meant by that at this
because you've always insisted, and it seems to me absolutely rightly,
that theory of meaning and epistemology have to go hand in hand. It's a major theme of roots of
reference, but it's all popped up again and again and again. Now it looks as if they're going in
two different directions. And I wonder if that, I mean, you said so little about it that I'd like
to get that straight, or let me say, I'll urge you to bring the two back together again.
Yes, now what did I have in mind there? The causal account of learning and of projecting a theory.
And this I viewed as a naturalization of epistemology. And I think of myself then as a
naturalized empiricist. And so I think of the causal account as an essential part of
naturalized epistemology. Well, certainly the senses play a causal role in our
learning or knowing anything about the outside world. But do they play an epistemic
part? That is, can we say at some particular stage in this causal process, which begins with
the world and ends up with beliefs, is there some intermediate stage where we can say something
about, here's an epistemologically ventor or a layer that's in between out there and out
belief. I don't see where it would be, you know.
Now we can stop because we're in agreement completely. It only took 50 years.
Yes, another point I'd like to clear it up is
in what sense your view of truth is transcendent rather than imminent?
Well, these aren't my words. Transcendent. Heaven's not. The word never crossed my lips.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
No, it's imminent. Of course, if we're talking about language, truth is relative to
language, even relative to the individual's language. That's the imminent. But not,
I would say in any sense that I understand, relative to something like a conceptual scheme.
Given what our sentences mean on occasion, they're just true or false or anyway they have
fixed truth conditions and is that transcendent? It's non-relative. The truth of our beliefs
is non-relative. I mean, they just are true or at least they have truth conditions. I mean,
I don't want to insist that they're always either true or false. Maybe some of them are neither,
but that's just a side issue. But they're truth conditions. We know what it would be
for our beliefs to be true. And if they are true, they're simply true. There's nothing relative
about that. You regard the content of the notion of truth as given completely by
disquotation in one sense. Well, there's a lot that that doesn't give us.
Disquotation only works where the language we're referring to is the same language that we're
using. And in many cases anyway, we can't take that for granted. I mean, if I'm talking about
the truth of something you said, a disquotation can't be taken for granted. Maybe you meant the
same thing that I mean. And so I can say, well, that sentence of yours is true if and only if,
but I'm talking about your, talking about your language, I'm using mine. And it's an empirical
assumption that that your sentence meant the same thing that mine does. Quite so. And so I think
of the truth of a foreign sentence as dependent on a parameter, which is the chosen manual of
translation. And given the conjecture of the indeterminacy of translation,
that the choice becomes an essential parameter. So, yes, well, that
relativity to translation certainly is clear. There's another respect which
gives truth, the feeling of transcendence certainly. And I've wondered whether this is the whole
the whole thing. Namely, when science takes a turn and something that had been
accepted by the scientists is rejected in view of some unexpected observations and
regard that comes to be rated as false, we don't say that even we naturalists who think of science
as the last arbiter insofar as there is one don't say that it used to be true, but turned out to be
it used to be true, but turned out to be false. We say rather that we used to think it was true,
but it was always false. And that again is subject to what happens next time around.
Now, here is a respect in which truth does go, even truth within the language,
beyond mere disquotation. And a respect in which it might be regarded as transcendent
rather than imminent than if one continues to speak in those terms. But on the other hand,
since I can see it only as a peculiarity of the idiom, it seems a little shallow compared to what
we have to think of as truth, uncritically.
Let me pick up on the idea of truth relative to a translation manual. Does that mean that
when we're talking about the truth of something somebody else says, that it's relative to two
things, to the language and to the translation manual, or just one thing? I mean, my view would be
there's just one thing. And what's that one thing? The one thing is the language. I mean, we can name
it as we please. I think what we want to understand is a person, and there isn't a thing called a
language in addition. We have a way of interpreting. If we have one way, we've got other ways.
That we could have used. Whether we count a given utterance as having these truth
conditions or those depends upon what language we interpret them as speaking.
And that's it. I mean, that's a relativity. Okay. But there's in the second one now.
And we always knew that's truth was relative to a language. So that we take for granted.
So I don't think there are two different things that's relative to just one.
Well, yes, this is the way I view it. Also, what would these two be?
On the one hand, there's this quotation. That's for the language itself. Then if you're going to
speak of a sentence in another language as true, that's going to be relative to your translation
of that language or that, ultimately, that individual's into your own.
There's that one. Well, the two things that it's relative to as I've been bringing it down is one,
one's own language via this quotation. Second, the manual of translation in the case of
this being in another language. Good, good. I think that's exactly right.
Disquotation, though, isn't really doing all that much work because it's from my own Italy.
I like it right now, and that's the best it can do.
But here I have this notion of truth, which I certainly am applying to somebody else. In fact,
I can't really make anything out of what they're talking about if I can't
decide one way or another what the truth conditions of their utterances are.
So that has to be a notion of truth that transcends of what disquotation is giving.
It's disquotation, if you want to think of it this way, plus interpretation.
I mean, we don't have two different notions of truth.
Well, so we're saying of this foreigner who's uttered something.
We quote that in his land. Put quotation marks around just a transcription
direct in his language, and we're saying that's true, if and only if,
and then comes his sentence again. But then we have the further question,
so what? What does that mean? Then we translate. There are those two steps.
Well, yes, you can, another way of thinking of it, which seems to be equivalent in many ways,
anyway, is I want to understand this person. I say, well, here's my theory, or here's what I assume
I know. If he utters that sentence, then it's true, if and only if, so and so.
And that's what I believe. I'm not translating. If I write down that piece of wisdom, of course,
it's going to concern to Idi Alec's mind and his. But my knowledge is just what the truth
conditions or my view is, what the truth conditions of what he said are these. That's the content of
my belief or my knowledge. And I agree with you, if there's one total interpretive scheme
that works, there'll be lots of others. And they may differ to the extent of actually
counting certain of his utterances true on one of the accounts that holds on another,
where I would have made up the slack with other sentences and his beliefs and so forth.
Yes, the parameter has to be, strictly speaking, has to be the Idi Alec at the moment.
But let's see. I'll try to find a difference here between us, because so far I think we're in agreement.
If you think of a theory about what somebody else means as taking a fairly comprehensive form,
I mean, I'm not just have a theory about what one utterance means, but about what a lot of other
instances do mean or would mean. I put this in terms of sentences. If he were to utter such
and such a sentence, it would have these truth conditions. I can specify all of this
only by using something like a Tarski scheme. I mean, if I want to cover all his sentences
and say what the truth conditions for all of them are, I need some way of organizing all that.
And Tarski is showing us how to organize that. Yes, well, yes, what is Tarski's
contribution here? Of course, he brings out this point of
this quotation to begin with, that there's a contribution in itself, although
not involving nothing in the way of the logical mathematical finesse that comes into his
truth definition. But what does that add? Only the, well, two things I'd say. For one thing,
it makes for a finite definition of the class of true sentences rather than this,
simply this plan, this formula of this quotation, which you can apply anywhere.
Also, of course, it has the virtue of, since it does give a straightforward definition,
the virtue of avoiding the paradoxes, the paradox of the liar,
and bringing out the hierarchical structure of truth.
What does that give us? Well, I see two other virtues.
One of them is it brings out a feature of language, which isn't brought out by this
quotation, and that is how it is that you could understand a potential infinity of sentences
given just a finite amount of information. And this quotation gives you no clue to that.
And at the same time, of course, it brings out the relations between the truth and conditions
of different sentences. Seeing that this sentence is true under these conditions,
this sentence under these conditions, you can then see, well, then, if this sentence is true,
this one has to be true. So those relations are organized, let's say, made explicit by a truth
definition of Tarski's sword, whereas this quotation does none of that to you.
May I add one more thing? If, unlike Tarski, we think of one of his definitions
as attempting to be a definition for some actual language, I mean, for what somebody is doing,
right? I mean, he's not worried about that, but I'm going to worry about it. I'm thinking of
trying to organize what I know about somebody else's speech by giving a Tarski-type definition,
or let's say just a theory, leave out the last step. And now it's an empirical theory, right?
If he says so-and-so, it's going to be true if and only if so-and-so. That itself is true or false.
Now, according to Tarski, the totality of the T sentences is the test of the correctness of a
truth definition. Let me now say the test of my, the correctness of my theory about what somebody
else means is whether my T sentences are right. But how can I tell whether they're right? Well,
you've made a lot of wonderful suggestions. I'll take the observation sentences. I can tell what
I've got them right up to a point by seeing under what circumstances he's inclined to
assent to or dissent from these sentences and so forth. And we have a way with the
logical constants, and then there's some hand-waving of a good sort when it comes to the theoretical
ones. Now, that's how I test my empirical theory about somebody else. Whether I've got it right.
Now, it seems to me all of that, since what I'm testing is a theory of truth or
for them, all of this is relevant to what I mean by the word true. It's this kind of information
which can be tested in this way. It's how I apply the concept of truth to people.
Yes. It gives you the whole grammatical structure of the language, and it pairs off the
basic lexicon insofar as one can think of the language as having a limited basic lexicon.
And if we put it that way, it goes forward without even the predicate true.
That's what's coming out of Tarski's actual constructions. He's got the
simple predicates, and he's got the modes of combination into a longer context.
First, we can get rid of the word true for any particular language, but we can't get
rid of it in general. We want what we do for different people to be the same sort of thing.
We don't want to say, here's this, we can eliminate for each language,
but I don't know if there's anything in common between these.
Does this say more than that we can carry out parallel analyses in terms of
recursion over grammatical structures of one language and another, any languages relative to
our own? We find out how to translate this and that mode of combination, and we're just translating.
But our standard then of whether each of these steps is right will depend on truth
and the sense of it depending on whether we would affirm the one sentence when we affirm the other.
Well, it seems to me we're doing something. You say just translating, but not any old way.
We're doing it by connecting their utterances with things we observe in the world.
And it's what you're doing in your
radical interpretation. Sure, but we don't do it any old way. We do it so as to get
truth conditions. What I can see there that makes a difference is that yes, we're doing it
extensionally rather than assisting with these sentences each step, not only
be both true or both false, but necessarily so. And of course I'm all for that. We're bypassing
the modalities. Yeah, right. I'm just trying to
put the case for the idea that we understand the concept of truth independent of
disquotation. And that comes out, it seems to me, in what it is we think we're doing or
are trying to do when we translate. Put it in the context of the way you're thinking of it.
Why do we translate one way rather than another? We look to, we want to translate
their sense, has these truth conditions with one of our own that has these truth conditions,
give or take the kind of slack that indeterminacy introduces. The question is,
do we have a lot of different concepts which come under the word true or do we have one
which we're applying in many cases? It seems to me quite clear that Tarski thought there's
just one. Yes, I would. Okay, but that's transcendence for you. Yes, sure, sure.
Okay, then I'd like to open these questions. In this instance, first one's up. David,
follow by Brian. I want to go back to the happy agreement to reject a certain conception of
empiricism. And I don't think any of us want to resuscitate the same state or the bit of the
given or anything like that, but I was a bit uneasy about the way you characterized what you
both agreed you wanted to reject. Because it seemed to me you were in danger of denying
something that was true. You characterize what you want to reject as an intermediary between
belief and outside world that might play some kind of epistemological role. But it seemed to
be clear that there are such things, despite what you said, not sex data perhaps, but think of the
case where somebody knowing the experiences and the illusion, somebody looks at the Mullah
lines and the errors are pointing outwards and inwards. And there's two lines at the same
length, and you look at them and you judge that they're different lengths. In a sense,
you percentually judge the different lengths, even though you know, because you've seen the
trick a number of times before, that they're the same length. So there seems to be a case
that there is something in between my belief that they're the same length, namely my perceptual
judgment, that they're different lengths. And perhaps that perceptual judgment played a
justification for your role, not an infeasible wonder, because in this kind of case, of course,
we override it, but in the normal case, we do form beliefs. It seems on the basis of just such
perceptual judgments. So I wanted to know what either or both of you would say about that given
what you wanted to reject, the same sex and the myth of the given.
Well, I don't understand this use of the phrase judgment. Can I judge something to be the case,
but think it's not? I was just looking for a neutral word to capture
what seems to be true. In some sense, it seems to me it strikes me that these lines are different
names. Well, of course, you can judge that it looks that way. One looks longer than the other,
but I don't think it is. Those are two judgments, both caused by looking.
But what's the intermediary? Our senses are stimulated and we arrive at beliefs.
I don't see any epistemic intermediary there.
That's my very opinion. Professor, can I do it the same way I wanted?
Yes, I think it's the same thing.
Our immediate, unconsidered reaction is typical of our immediate perceptual judgments,
but then it happens occasionally, and that's the special interest of this illusion, I think,
that there can be, in pretty short order, a conflict between perceptual judgments.
This conflict is theoretical at a very low level of theory, and the whole thing can
happen, of course, in the space of a manager, too.
But one way or another, of course, a certain amount of inference goes into our perceptions
anyway, as some of it is undoubtedly instinctive. It's where instinct gives us a head start on our
thinking, and in other cases, there's some rudimentary thinking involved.
This certainly shows how the perception itself isn't as raw as one would be inclined to suppose it.
My name is Brian McGee, and I'd like to ask Dr. Davidson, what's wrong with the following?
If I'm having an experience, which I would normally describe as looking at a green disc,
and somebody says to me, you are looking at a red disc, I know, I feel justified in asserting
that the statement is false, and I think I know that the statement is false.
The relationship between the experience and the statement isn't a logical one, because logical
relationships contain only between formulations in a symbolism. So here I have justification,
justification for knowledge claim, justification of a statement, but it's not logical justification.
Well, what is the justification?
Well, that is of course one of the fundamental questions of philosophy, but I think that my
question implies an exemplification of what the relationship is between experience and knowledge
claims, or can be. Well, I think that sounds all right. The trouble has always been to make sense
of the idea that the experience, which has no propositional content in itself,
justifies the belief that you arrive at. And I don't know of anybody who has ever succeeded in
giving an account of that, because it requires this epistemic intermediary that we can't
really, it's neither fission or foul. And so I think, sure, we're justified, but we're justified
because most of our direct perceptual judgments are true. And the explanation for that is not
because they're based upon something else, it's rather based upon an account of how they come
to have the contents they do. I would say that we're not justified in saying that we haven't
got justification because we can't give an account of it. We have got justification,
and we know we've got it, but we can't give an account of it.
Well, I think we can. But the justification is not of the sort of finding some little element or
some magic thing in experience, which does the justifying. The justification comes in the explanation
for why our perceptual beliefs, the ones that are most immediately caused by the world,
why they tend overwhelmingly to be true. So the justification isn't of that particular belief
in terms of something else, it's rather that kind of judgment is usually right. And now we need to
know why, and I think we can say why. I'm not trying now because that's another story, but I think
justification doesn't always carry you back one further step to something more basic.
Yes, Colin House. Both of our distinguished speakers credit Tarski with a fundamental role
in the analysis of truth, presumably for natural language as well as for formalized languages.
I wonder what they would think to the following consideration that the person who said
to say of what is, that it is, is true. To say of what it is, that it is, is true. To say of what
is, that it is not, is false. And then the other two variations has given in that a quite precise
and clear account of truth for natural languages. And that what Tarski did was to do something for,
to give an account of truth for languages, unlike natural languages, which were capable of variable
interpretations. So the Tarski definition is an account of how you take a semantics and then
give the truth conditions under a whole class of different interpretations of that particular
syntax. And that doesn't seem to me to add anything to the notion of truth as far as it's
concerned with natural language. I'd like to know their opinion.
The dissertation matter, Tarski certainly wouldn't feel particularly creative about that.
I think the value of that is just that he brings out emphatically in the open, the sort
of thing that does cover the whole ground.
But where his prowess comes in is in setting up a recursive definition that covers the
ground in a finite space, whereas if we left it at the level of discotation, there's infinitely
many sentences that could be discoded, and so a finite definition wouldn't be forthcoming.
I see Tarski's definition of truth as having the virtue of putting the truth, putting the
predicate into explicit, finite and limitable form.
And of course, incidentally, because of the paradoxes, Tarski's definition shows that
you have to take truth in a hierarchical way, and that there are more and more comprehensive
truth predicates, but no limit, no most comprehensive short of contradiction.
This is where I admire Tarski's result.
Maybe I could say something about that.
Tarski himself gives a number of extremely informal characterizations of the ordinary
notion of truth, and among others he quotes Aristotle as you just did.
I recently wrote a piece in which I said, I think Aristotle's characterization is better
than Tarski's other informal characterizations for quite explicit reasons.
Tarski's informal ones include ones which make it sound as though he thinks there's
something that corresponds to a sentence that makes it true, the fact or something like
that.
One of the merits of his actual constructions is that of course there are no entities that
correspond to sentences as a whole, except his infinite sequences, the satisfiers, so
to speak, and they turn out not to be anything like facts, because if one sequence satisfies
a closed sentence, so do they all.
So there's no way of picking out the right facts, so to speak, in that way anyway.
And Aristotle's characterization also doesn't talk about something that corresponds to a
sentence, and it's more like Tarski's actual work than Tarski's informal characterizations.
But the informal characterization, of course, doesn't begin to do all the work for one thing.
It only covers sentences of certain forms, curiously though, that is, you could say it
covers just those that start with an existential quantifier or the negation of an existential
quantifier.
Now, actually the main example that Tarski gives is of languages that do all start that
way, because he doesn't have any proper names and so forth.
But of course it tells us, I mean the Aristotelian characterization tells us nothing about how
truth is passed around, so to speak, in a language, even given the sentential connectives.
Maybe negation would be the only one.
It tells us a little bit about negation, but not much.
But nothing about conjunction, alternation, and so forth.
None of the work, so to speak, that a Tarski-type truth definition does in telling us how the
truth, given finite information about a few cases, we can extend that now to an infinite
number of cases, which tells us the kind of articulation that not only artificial languages
of the kind he was talking about have, but so do natural languages.
They have all those devices, and he's given us a systematic way of thinking about them
and coping with them.
Yes, I took a different attitude towards that informal part of the Tarski thing.
I took that as his generously ministering to the vulgar mind before doing the kind of
thing that he sought to be really needed, namely not recognizing such entities as facts.
Well, good, but I think he also, it's quite clear, I think, was trying to persuade people
that what he was going to go on to define was what they were interested in when they talked
about truth.
Good.
Yeah, you understand.
Let Colin come back on that, and then I think we'll wrap it up, OK?
Yes, I slightly worried about Professor Klein talking about one of the virtues being recursion
in the definition of truth, because it's very difficult to think of how you would have a
recursive definition for a natural language, because you just simply don't have the atomic
versus molecular structure that's given in a natural language.
I also wonder about the unequivocal nature of the Tarski theorem that says you have a
hierarchical structure of truth.
After all, there have been people, for example, Kripke, who, as were brought down, even for
a formalized language, the truth predicates into the language and showed how you could
do that consistently simply by having truth value gaps.
So it doesn't seem to me, as I say, an unequivocal verdict that Tarski showed that there was
a hierarchy of truth predicates.
No, I think not, and I don't think that Tarski would have said so either.
I certainly prefer Tarski's.
It's more elegant.
It enables us to adhere to our standard, you might say, neoclassical logic, which has
the virtue of simplicity and being so thoroughly understood.
But certainly truth value gaps could accomplish the same thing.
And I think Kripke's proposal comes out rather less convenient by a good deal.
And yes, and I don't want to, but I would expect Tarski to say substantially the same.
