Processing Overview for Aaron Hertzmann
============================
Checking Aaron Hertzmann/Human Visual Perception of Art as Computation, talk by Aaron Hertzmann.txt
1. Aaron Courville presented his research on the perception of line drawings, emphasizing the role of V1 neurons in edge and border detection. He highlighted that while V1 is crucial for this aspect of visual perception, understanding line drawings also involves higher-level visual processes beyond V1.

2. His work involves a joint network that integrates both geometric processing (contours) and CNN image translation to improve line drawing quality without relying on high-level semantic information. The goal is to understand the low-level visual perception of shape, focusing on object identity rather than ambiguous or conceptual elements.

3. There was a discussion about the importance of considering the entire visual system when studying perception, as top-down effects and higher-level processing play significant roles in understanding complex visual stimuli like line drawings.

4. The work presented at CVPR on converting two line drawings uses a CNN that has been trained to choose between two given line drawings, which suggests that there's potential for machine learning models to emphasize semantically important features, similar to how humans might focus attention on certain parts of an image. However, this aspect was not the focus of the current work.

5. The conversation touched upon the broader implications of understanding visual perception, noting that while V1 has been extensively studied, a complete explanation for our ability to perceive shapes and scenes likely requires considering the entire visual system and its interactions.

6. Aaron acknowledged the complexity of explaining visual perception solely through neural processing and suggested that theoretical frameworks are necessary to comprehend the full scope of the visual system's capabilities.

In summary, Aaron Courville's research is aimed at understanding the low-level visual processes involved in perceiving line drawings and improving the quality of line drawings using a combination of geometric and machine learning techniques. The discussion also underscored the importance of considering the entire visual system for a comprehensive understanding of how we perceive images.
