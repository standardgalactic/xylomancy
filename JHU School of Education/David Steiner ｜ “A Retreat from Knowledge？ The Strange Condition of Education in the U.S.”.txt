in je tudi nekaj poslednji v rovnih,
ki je nekaj stručen, nekaj hodnji tudi v traditijnih.
Kaj je tudi v traditijnih tudi tako vštih,
kaj je tudi vštih vštih.
Arendt vštih vštih vštih,
nekaj vštih vštih vštih,
nekaj vštih vštih vštih,
nekaj vštih vštih vštih.
All the rules of sound human reasoning, she writes, are cast aside.
Her criticism of progressivism has three parts.
First, child-centered education,
in trust's authority in education to those who by nature
cannot exercise it, namely children.
She stresses the helplessness of every child
that instinctively seeks authority to guide her or him
into the world in which he or she is still a stranger,
in which she cannot orient herself by her own judgment.
Second, we adults in choosing to give power to children
to shape their own education have devaluved our own knowledge.
If teachers abandon the teaching of their knowledge,
then teachers remove, they sacrifice the one source of authority
that should be theirs.
Finally, constructivism rests on the belief
that a child can only understand what they have, quote,
discovered by themselves, close quote.
But that's not true, it's simply not true.
Think about learning to read, it's not a natural process,
it must be taught.
But Arendt says the incorrect belief
that children can only learn by self-discovery
leads to a substitution of doing for learning,
a damaging replacement, she writes, of thoughtful work
by labor without direction.
Our progressivist impulse to make sacred,
to make autonomous, the world of the child
is, in Hannah Arendt's view, a symptom of something more serious,
more fundamental.
The adults give up authority because we refuse,
she writes, to assume responsibility for the world
into which we have brought our children.
What does Arendt mean by giving up responsibility
for our world, and why does she believe
that doing so destroys our capacity to educate children?
Her answer, to simplify if I may,
is that when we educate, we must take responsibility
for which stories, which information,
which picture about our world
we are going to pass on to our children.
But today Arendt argues we are estranged,
alienated from our own histories.
There is no coherent narrative,
no shared set of stories about our world
of which we are willing to say this story,
these stories are worthy of teaching to our children.
We live in a culture, Arendt argues,
in which there is a crisis in our attitude
towards the realm of the past.
We are no longer prepared to introduce children
into the unfolding stories of which they are a part,
and in the context of which children can, one day,
remake their world.
Without a shared, valued narrative about the world,
children will remain ignorant of how to act.
They will be like bats without a cave.
They will have no way in which to find
and then judge the limits of their world.
Arendt insists, quote,
that exactly for the sake of what is new
and revolutionary in every child,
education must be conservative.
It must preserve the newness
and introduce the world as a new thing to the child.
Paradoxically, Arendt reminds us,
that in its most creative, revolutionary period,
American education was most conservative.
Today, she writes, educational experiments
have struck a very revolutionary pose.
But that pose, she says,
will leave children without the ability to act radically.
Today, an insistence on selecting and teaching
a particular cultural content to our children
is under deep suspicion,
especially from the political left.
Thus, Arendt's argument,
that choosing a particular content,
a curriculum for our children's education,
her argument that doing so is not conservative
requires support.
To use America as our example,
I would remind us that the most important figures
of protest in the struggle for civil rights,
Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King,
and Malcolm X,
each affirmed the centrality of classical learning
in their resistance, in their voice of resistance.
You may remember that Malcolm X
dropped out of school when he was 13,
but when imprisoned for robbery,
he taught himself to read Tolstoy, Dostoevski,
and Nietzsche, among many others.
To the American list,
I would add one more powerful example,
that of Nelson Mandela.
When he was imprisoned in South Africa in Robin Island,
he chose to play both the role of Creon and Antigone
in Sophocles' play of that name.
He recalled later that he found the experience
of studying that play,
and indeed classical literature more generally
as, quote, enormously elevating, close quote.
Sophocles, he said,
had much to teach him about power,
despotism, politics, courage, and faith.
To repeat her central claim,
the authority of the teacher then rests
on the assumption of responsibility for our world.
Our intellectual irresponsibility,
when it comes to education,
lies in our unwillingness to select
to be responsible for content worth teaching.
We betray ourselves as parents and educators
in pretending, pretending
that children can be made the authors of their world.
In what our rent bluntly calls our disgust for our world,
we wash our hands of our authority,
our responsibility,
and our love both for our children and for our world.
Our rent ties the surrender
of the core responsibility of the teacher,
our unwillingness to be responsible for choosing
the content of education,
to our unwillingness to judge
what is of value in human experience.
I now want to stress that the unwillingness
to say this content is worth teaching
is not a theoretical issue alone.
In the United States, at least,
the flight from responsibility
is powerfully and destructively evident
in our preference for skills
over curricula content.
We do not have in our nation as a whole
or in any one of our 50 states
a single shared curriculum in any subject.
No defined content in literature,
or history, or science, or even mathematics.
Because there is no set curriculum,
because we do not require students
to read a list of books.
Our state tests,
our state tests of reading, for example,
cannot test knowledge of any specific text.
We cannot ask questions about Moby Dick
or the Great Gatsby or the Bluest Eye, for example.
Instead, our tests present students
with a paragraph or two
from a very obscure source
that no student has ever read before,
so no student has an advantage.
We then ask students to, quote,
find the main idea in the paragraph.
Of course, this ability depends on understanding
what the text is about.
And it turns out that wealthy or richer students
do much better in finding the main idea
because they have more knowledge about the world.
So the reading test in America
becomes a test of family wealth.
We can predict quite well
a student's results on a test
if we know their parent's wealth.
Because poor students do badly,
we try to train them on finding the main idea
instead of teaching them content,
and as a result, every year,
they do worse and worse.
You know, a shift over the last 100 years
from content to skill,
America is following, unfortunately.
The example said in France
when it passed the loge au span,
when it abandoned, gave up the national curriculum
for a shift to child-centered progressive pedagogy.
Here is what happened to the performance of children
in reading in France.
These lines represent the reading skills
of children from different economic groups,
the wealthiest children at the top,
the poorest children at the bottom,
from the time the law was passed in 1987
to 20 years later in 2007.
What you can see is that the shift to child-centered education
damaged the reading of every group of students,
but what is most tragic
is that it damaged the reading of poorer students the most.
That is the bottom line.
Sadly, it has become fashionable
to follow Jo Span's example.
For example, Finland,
where excellent educational achievements were built
on a strong content-rich national curriculum,
this was given up.
As a result, just like in France,
there has in the last few years been a steady decline
in educational results.
England went through the same thing
before it went back to a content-rich curriculum.
The United States has done the same thing,
but in the United States we have gone further.
Not only have we embraced empty skills instead of content,
we have in the last ten years become enchanted
with the idea that even teaching academic skills
may be very old-fashioned.
Instead, an ever-increasing number of teachers
supported by a very thin research base
have been embracing a very different agenda.
The following slide summarizes the new pedagogy in America.
I'll give you a moment to look at these wonderful examples.
As I lay out in my recent book,
there is very little serious research
to support any of these ideas.
To take one example, it should be obvious,
but apparently it is not,
that one cannot think critically about nothing in particular.
We need to have some knowledge to think critically about,
or take the 21st-century skills.
It sounds very relevant, very sexy.
Well, it turns out that 21st-century skills
are a long, long list of everything that you want in a human being.
Reliability, capacity to motivate,
capacity to work in teams, information literacy,
communication skills, cross-cultural sensitivity,
flexibility, accountability, maybe clean socks.
It is an endless list.
The United States has invested hundreds of millions of dollars,
hundreds of millions of dollars,
in the collective search to do something,
anything, other, in the collective search
to do something, other than teach core academic content.
But the impact has been deeply negative.
After some real progress in the 1980s and the 1990s,
progress especially for the poorest students has stopped.
Here are the math results for our high school students.
As you can see,
the United States has made exactly zero progress since 1992.
Zero.
This is despite the fact that we have spent more dollars
in real dollars after inflation,
far more than we did in 1992.
But the situation, while it's bad in mathematics,
is much worse when it comes to students' knowledge
of history and civics.
In this, as you see on the slide, in 2018,
just 25% of 13-year-olds in America passed the civics test.
This is the lowest result in the United States
of any subject matter test.
It's worse than reading, worse than math, worse than science.
In other words, the result is bad across the board.
For African-American and Hispanic students,
it's a disaster.
The pass rate is 10% and 13% for those two groups.
Now, this is, again, not just a theoretical problem.
As you can see in the second paragraph,
the Center for Civic Education found in a major survey
that just 30% of Americans born since 1980s,
in the younger generation,
believe it's essential to live in a democracy.
I just want that to sink in for a moment.
So 70% of our younger Americans
do not think it's particularly important
to live in a democracy.
We may see the results in the next presidential election.
One might think that confronted by these results,
we may see widespread distress
over our educational outcomes in the United States.
After all, in math and science,
America's international results are very embarrassing.
We do worse, for example, in mathematics than Vietnam,
a country we left in ruins.
But instead, America has discovered a deeply
and deeply sophisticated way to handle bad news.
America reports bad news as good news.
What do I mean?
Remember that the exam results
of American high school students
has been flat since 1990 or so.
Now, if you have flat results,
you would assume that the grades we give
to American students, A, B, C, D,
would be flat, right?
Flat results, flat grades.
Oh, no.
No, in America, while the results have been flat,
we have given ever higher grades
to our American students.
That's those lines going upwards.
There's a very strange thing if you think about it.
Why should we give higher and higher grades
to the same result?
Not only have we done this in high school,
we've also done it in university.
We have grade inflation in the United States.
What does grade inflation actually mean?
Grade inflation means simply that we call today
success, what 20 years ago we called failure.
We have gone up a complete grade in the United States.
It's a fiction.
It's a complete myth.
It's a mythology.
We can't take bad news, so we simply call it good.
It's beyond embarrassing, it's a lie
that damages children, because much later in life
they find out that they don't have the knowledge they need.
To summarize our argument so far,
America's decision to embrace skills over content
has damaged student learning.
Sympathetic to Arendt's argument I have been
for some time, a critic of this flight,
this retreat from content, this refusal to make judgments
about what is worth learning.
But where does this flight from educational responsibility,
this unwillingness to make judgments about content come from?
Arendt locates this inability to judge this refusal
to act in judgment, in thinking itself,
in the retreat from thinking.
She writes, the precondition for judging
is the disposition, the habit to live explicitly
or consciously with oneself, to have dialogue
with oneself, to be engaged in that silent dialogue
between me and myself, which she says,
since Socrates and Plato we call thinking.
To illustrate this silent dialogue,
Arendt cites Plato's gorgeous,
when Socrates says his deepest fear is,
quote, that I, being one, should be out of tune
with myself and contradict myself.
The meaning is clear.
Even though I am one person,
I am not simply one person.
I have a self and I am related to myself.
This self is not an illusion.
It makes itself heard by talking.
I talk to myself, that is what thinking is.
If I do wrong, this is Arendt and Plato,
the key point is not that somebody else will find me guilty,
that somebody else will scold me.
The point is, I have to live with that wrongdoer.
I have to be in this, and this is Arendt's phrase,
unbearable intimacy.
I can never get rid of myself.
Invited by thought into a lifelong dialogue with myself,
thinking is done in solitude.
This is not loneliness, this is solitude.
It is the responsibility of the educator
to judge which content to teach a child,
so that the child's developing internal dialogue
of self with self is not empty, random,
or filled with noise,
but is supplied with what is worth,
worth something, the content of thought.
But please note too that we have slipped
almost without noticing into the realm of ethics.
If the content of my thought is unworthy,
if it is trash, my habits of thought are thus debased.
I am condemned to be in that unbearable intimacy
with my own emptiness, my own worthlessness.
Once again, the United States offers us a vivid
and disturbing model.
The average teenager in the United States today
is on social media for almost eight hours every day.
That's the most recent data.
That's longer than they are in a school setting.
It means they're coming home,
and they're right on the machine,
and they stay on the machine.
While school is focused in America
on offering often content empty skills,
it is social media that supplies the content of thought,
unsupervised by adults.
There are no boundaries for the content
that floods the smartphone or the computer.
Once upon a time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau
wrote in The Emile
that children needed to experience limits,
called them walls of bronze.
Today, those walls have collapsed,
and the child is flooded by the chaos,
the cacophony, the noise of the world.
The internal space,
the dialogue of the child with herself,
collapses under this avalanč.
The result, unsurprisingly,
is the rapid growth in the United States
in the childhood depression,
and an increasing unwillingness
made worse by COVID to attend school at all.
Today in Baltimore, where I live,
some 65% of high school students
are chronically absent from school,
meaning they miss more than 10% of school days.
In the beginning, with the content of the Internet,
the schools, the skills-based education,
cannot compete.
It is too boring, too fragmented, too empty.
It does not create ideas that are worth holding in mind.
Above all, with some exceptions,
especially if students are lucky enough
to have strong science teachers,
it does not provide material for serious thinking.
Other animals reproduce, hunt, build homes,
communicate, remember, experience emotions as we do,
but human beings alone can evaluate in language
our own actions and those of others,
appreciate beauty, acquire facilities
in different fields of knowledge,
be they literate, mathematical, historical,
scientific, or those expressed in musical
or other artistic or physical forms.
Only human beings can think reflectively
about the direction, the unfolding trajectory of our lives.
Without a well-developed capacity for such thoughtfulness,
life becomes a matter of chance.
A life lived at the mercy of instinct,
built in emotion, is the life of a human puppet
directed by forces of chance and circumstance
in his work Plato famously compares
such human beings to puppets,
whose strings are pulled by the gods.
The most fundamental purpose of education
is thus to nurture our capacity to think.
Education is the means by which our most human capabilities
are transformed from just potential to a life
in which we can interrogate our experience
so as to learn and integrate our experience
into future action.
Michael Oakshott, philosopher and political theorist,
put it this way, I quote,
the price of the intelligent activity
which constitutes being human is learning.
When the human condition is said to be burdensome, heavy,
what is being pointed out is not the mere necessity
of having to think, to speak, and to act
instead of merely being like a stone or growing like a tree,
but the impossibility of thinking or feeling
without having slowly and often painfully
learned to think something.
While the need for a good education
can be defended for many reasons,
including both economic and civic,
our most essential responsibility as educators
involves the guiding, the careful nurturing
of children's learning to think.
The argument of my recent book
is that there are three crucial elements
in the education of thought.
Learning academic content, we've talked about this
in literature, history, math, and science at least,
and education in ethics and in education in aesthetics.
Our schools need to nurture the capacity
for academic learning, ethical reflection,
and aesthetic sensibility
because they are crucial to forging a fulfilling life.
I can only sketch that argument today.
We've already discussed our refusal
to take responsibility for the rich content of education,
the core of academic learning.
We now briefly will consider ethics
and then turn to aesthetics.
The founding American hope, now exported to the world,
is that our lives might enable the pursuit of happiness.
But what exactly does that mean?
Surely not that we do anything at all without thought.
24 centuries ago Aristotle coined the term eudaimonio,
human flourishing, to describe the concept of happiness.
Eudaimonio, Aristotle argued,
is the highest, the most important of human ends,
the purpose of our existence.
A well-lived life is one in which the aim of happiness
or human flourishing is our north star,
guiding our choice, our values, our hopes, our dreams.
A well-lived life, an ethical life,
Aristotle insists, is about making wise choices.
If they are well educated in ethics,
human beings will have learned to weigh the consequences
of their choices in terms of how the outcomes
will affect the pathway, the life of their life story,
the values that they will embrace.
Aristotle argues that in making choices
that will shape the future direction of our life,
well educated humans will seek out opportunities
to be involved in actions that are courageous, generous
and aren't honorable.
As you know, Aristotle calls the act of choosing
or reasoning about one's actions, fronasis,
usually translated as intellectual virtue
of exercising practical wisdom.
When we exercise it, we combine the careful consideration
of the pathway of our life and a commitment
to understanding the virtuous course of actions
in reaching our goals.
Education worthy of the name is crucial to fronasis
because it is through education that children,
through repetition that becomes habit,
come to enjoy virtuous actions.
They will want to forge paths of living
so that they can enjoy what a virtuous life can offer.
In other words, they will have learned to desire
and thus seek to make the opportunities for a good life.
Aristotle's key point is this.
If adults are one day to successfully deliberate,
think about what is good,
they must already have come to enjoy doing
what is just courageous, honest as children.
In šort, they will have developed a moral compass.
In Aristotle's words,
a good upbringing makes the noble a part,
perhaps the chief part of what is good in us.
How do we acquire this enjoyment of ethical choice making?
First through lived experience.
This is why, to cite him once again,
in Rousseau's A Meal,
the tutor of the boy organizes the experience of the child,
so that a meal experiences the connection
between wise actions and their positive consequences.
But secondly, ethical choice making
is developed through more formal education,
through stories, myths, history that enable children
to inhabit multiple worlds beyond their own horizons,
to derive thoughtful lessons from those stories,
which will serve their own developing capacities
for phronasis as they mature.
The curriculum we devise for our young children,
the tales we tell them,
or we read to them before they think for themselves,
are not simply devices to enable them
to master the mechanics of reading,
important though that is.
But a key reference point for an education in ethics,
through their capacity to imagine,
children place themselves in previously unimagined
and unexpected worlds.
They associate with characters in the stories they read
and it take their experiences to heart.
The resulting lessons are ethically crucial.
Children in that imaginative space
rehearse the consequences of fictional
or historical characters that they read about.
Learning about the consequences of decisions
made with too little thought
or wise choices that lead to well-lived lives.
That is what phronasis consists in,
a conscious effort to slow down,
to rehearse various pathways,
to ask tough questions of oneself,
to enable the imagination to draw on multiple possibilities,
to deepen one's awareness in short, to be thoughtful.
Tudi, particular in the United States,
we've given up on ethical education.
We tried something called character education
in the 1980s, early 90s.
We've let that go.
We've simply turned our back
on one of the most essential tasks of education
to provide an ethical compass.
And now aesthetics.
A life lived without an educated attunement
to the beautiful
will be as if the very colors
of one's life's experiences are washed out.
Children deserve opportunities
to nourish their imagination,
to respond to the beautiful in the outside world
or a museum, playing a musical instrument,
crafting a sculpture, mastering a dance
or perspective in painting.
To have to argue for an education in aesthetics
is surprising,
given its fundamental value to human sensibility.
But it is also vital,
since today it has so little standing
in so many of our schools,
at least in the United States.
We have in America created
a class system of subjects.
Math and reading somehow is first class.
Science and history, second class.
We sometimes test them, we sometimes don't.
Everything else is third class.
Everything from philosophy to arts
to physical education to computer,
it's all third class.
Immanuel Kant is compelling
on the topic of aesthetics.
In making aesthetic judgments,
Kant as Kant sees it,
we are in the realm of free choice.
We cannot appeal to some scientific principle
or proof that something is worthy
of being called beautiful.
We are just on our own
with our experiences to rely on.
This is because he says
when we make aesthetic judgments
that this painting is beautiful,
nothing is given.
Thinking doesn't determine in advance
our own experience.
We are free to act, to react
to the painting as we please.
But that produces a major problem.
Our aesthetic judgments
just a matter of private opinion,
like I like chocolate ice cream,
you like vanilla.
Kant rejects this view.
He claims that when we make aesthetic judgments,
we are doing something very, very different.
We are responding to something deep in human nature
and that response is so strong
that we find we want to share our response
with other people, with each other.
When I say this is beautiful,
I make a claim not just for myself,
but for all humanity.
As we encounter the objects,
our thoughts about it come together
in a positive and powerful urge
to share with others.
We are convinced that they too should be struck
by the quality of what has been created.
Don't you see, don't you hear
how beautiful this is?
What occurs inside our mind
when we are moved by the beauty of an object,
when it evokes this powerful urge to celebrate,
retain and communicate our experience?
Kant suggests that at that moment
both our facilities of imagination
and understanding are equally active.
If an object creates an experience
of what Kant calls the harmony
of understanding and imagination,
we feel that unity as a deep pleasure
and experience of beauty.
A vast literature suggests
that in his discussion of how imagination
and cognition or thought come together
in a moment of appreciation of beauty,
these account is not without problems.
In fact, in one point in his famous third critique,
which is talking about aesthetic judgment,
I'm not sure I understand what I'm writing,
so maybe we too.
But as he describes this aesthetic experience,
he is also talking about something
very familiar to us.
A piece of music or art startles us
out of indifference, out of complacency.
We are drawn to it powerfully.
We may make some effort to describe it,
but we may before the just the experience
of the painting.
We are amazed, delighted, horrified.
The British philosopher Peter de Bola
describes an example
of this aesthetic experience
as he stands in front of Bonnet Newman's abstract painting
The Heroic or Sublimus, Man Heroic and Sublime.
He writes as follows,
The image seems to compose me
to generate a sense of well-being.
Here de Bola describes both an emotional response
and a sense that the painting
was offering him new forms of thought.
The painting creates the feeling
like one is knowing something,
a heightened sense of the self being well composed.
That is aesthetic knowing feeling
in which de Bola places
between pure emotion and thinking
or in plain English between thinking and thought
is very powerful,
even if we cannot fully understand or define it.
De Bola's experience in front of this painting
bears witness to what Kant described
as an encounter with the truly beautiful.
De Bola invites us to see the painting
as he does so, he is recalling something
very personal, his reaction to looking at the painting
but his claim is that all of us
can have that experience.
Compared to the exercise of simply reporting facts
about the canvas,
an exercise in which my engagement is quite weak,
the effort of evoking an aesthetic claim
is searching and demanding.
It involves translating something very private
into a shareable language
into what de Bola calls a mutual terrain.
The experience of sharing can be a powerful
invitation to community,
to inclusivity.
These aren't just theoretical claims.
In 2021, researchers from the United States
and Germany examined the reaction
of many hundreds of students
from the US, the UK and India
while looking at an image
or listening to music or recalling
a personal experience of beauty.
The results of the research closely echo
Kant's philosophical model.
I quote, top-rated beauty experiences
are strongly characterized by intense pleasure,
an impression of universality,
the wish to continue the experience,
exceeding expectation
and harmony in the variety and meaning
of the experience.
As Kant suggests, the language of thought
and emotions are not separated but together at once.
A child becomes conscious
of what is in front of her, trying to produce
in a violin, she struggles knowing it's not there yet.
She experiences her own knowing
struggle as frustration, but she wants
to succeed to communicate the sound
to us all. Or to take another example
from the visual arts, imagine a student in front
of a Rothko painting in a museum.
There's no immediate meaning to the painting
and the tendency of a student particularly
today is just to keep walking.
The teacher has to stop the student,
place the student in front of the painting
and enable the process of imagination
and thought.
Aesthetic education is above all an exhilarating experience
of losing the self in an encounter,
only to return to an enlarged
and deepened self.
Aesthetic education can be seen every day
in the 94th aphorism of Nietzsche's
Beyond Good and Evil. He calls it the seriousness.
Another translation is the intensity
of a child at play.
You've all seen it. The intensity, the energy,
the loss and recovery of a self
comes from this energy that is fed
by engagement with the experience.
To offer students a rich set of such aesthetic
experiences is a core value of education.
Martin Heidegger, German philosopher
emphasizes the interaction between
aesthetic judgment and thinking.
Writing that our encounters with objects that are beautiful
is not merely a matter of feeling,
but are, I quote, amongst the most thought-provoking
of all encounters.
Aesthetic experiences also have ethical dimensions.
As the cultural critic Roger Kimball
reminds us, when we share aesthetic responses
with one another, we are reminded
powerfully of our common humanity,
of our capacity to share freely
a sense of beauty that elevates us
as human beings. Or in the words of Dante
from the Purgatorio canto 18,
Beauty awakens the soul to act.
Thought, ethics and beauty
were so, I would argue,
are three intertwined and crucial elements
of an education worthy of the name.
To give up on making judgments about
and then teaching a challenging
content-rich curriculum.
To leave ethical development to chance.
To turn one's back on an education in beauty
is to betray what it means
to be a teacher. This three-part surrender
because knowledge, ethics
and aesthetics are intertwined
is not a beautiful gift we give
to the freedom of our children. It is simply
to announce the loss of our role
as teachers.
In the United States today
we have developed a habit of teaching
that's very different.
And I want to re-enter as we move towards
our close this contemporary educational
politics.
We have turned our back on knowledge
of the canon, of essential texts
and I have argued with Hannah Arendt
that this is not in any way a radical move
it is in fact to give up
on enabling children to prepare
for radical action.
Today in the United States the argument is
we must focus on teaching multiculturalism.
Face with students from all over the world
for many national ethnic religious
and racial origins.
Education and you've heard this a thousand times
must respect their differences
must respect their differences.
But a moment's thought should tell us
that this has become educationally impossible.
We were once told that we are
to be very respectful, sensitive
to Hispanic culture.
Sounded reasonable. 22 million Hispanic students.
We are now reminded however
of the deep differences correctly
between Jamaicans and Hispanics
or Hispanics and Latinos
we should realize that Cubans and Dominicans
cannot be regarded as sharing the same identity
and so the list goes on
more and more differences
with the logical conclusion that perhaps every child
in cultural content
the result would be a complete fragmentation
of the curriculum.
The word humanity should remind us
of our essential task, the education
of human beings. Some 60 years ago
President Kennedy reminded Americans
that quote, we all breathe the same air
we are all mortal and we all cherish
If we no longer believe that texts can speak
to all of us, if I cannot read Dante
because I am not Italian and not Christian
if I cannot teach Dante to children
because they are African American or Cuban
then I have turned my back on humanity
on an education in what is most essential
most beautiful, most instructive
to leading a considered life.
Education is not about flattering
not about flattering
the color of my skin
or about celebrating the personality
I happen to be
or ensuring that my sense of self
is never upset or angered.
We seem to have discovered a new right
in the United States Constitution
and we do not find it in the document.
To educate does not close one's eyes
to the sufferings of people
or of nations. Evil too
is woven into the human condition.
Education's most essential task however
is to draw myself out of myself
edukare to tell me the story
of the human condition
and to transcend the self
I was as an ignorant child.
An argument grounded in the humanities
should perhaps come towards a close in poetry.
In Canto 115
one of the most troubled, most gifted poets
of the last century, writing in his 80s
and imprisoned for treason
provided four lines that demand
the education I've tried today to summon.
The academic preparation
to hear the core metaphor
to trace in his language
the echoes of Homer and Dante
an ethical sensibility
to hear the harsh self condemnation
of the poet and to forgive his madness
an aesthetic response to hear the beauty
to education that still believes
in the future of humanities
for which the dying, anguished, sick
Ezra Pound still has hope.
A blown husk that is finished
but the light sings eternal
a pale flare over marshes
where the salt hay whispers
to tides change.
The edge of the ocean

Čakaj.
Čakaj, David, for such inspiring speech.
They are in a few minutes for some brief question
if someone wants to start a brief dialogue.
Sarah as a microphone over that.
Thank you, Sarah.
Just raise your hand if you want a brief question to David.
Ok.
V prvi roj,
maybe we collect 3 or 4
questions for David.
As you wish.
David, thank you very much
for this inspiring
presentation.
I'm Erika Kopp
from Budapest, Hungary.
And I was really happy
when I heard that you
start with Hannah Aran's work
because she is from
this region,
from this European
region, and it's very
important for us,
her souls.
My question
is the following because
related to your
statements about this
knowledge, the missing knowledge
in American,
in the education of the United
States.
We have got a totally different
experience, and I would like
to go with my question
from this experience, expressing
my experience, and I think
most of those, they are from
posts of yet countries here,
they have got a totally
different experience
because as I see
all education systems
although they are
at rhetorical level
this topic that we have to
decrease the content
volume, and in education
it didn't
happen after this communist
times, it's still there
overloaded, we have got
enough knowledge, I think
I have to say
what you mentioned can't, we learned
it in a secondary school, what you
mentioned socrates, we learned it in
a secondary school, so everything
is there, but still
we have got such a bad results
on reading
on mathematics, on everything
and we feel
that for students
the knowledge
what we
submit, this knowledge for
students, they are not relevant
for them, and my question
is, now I arrived
to the question
so what do you think
how can we deal
because I agree with you that this
knowledge question is crucial
when we are thinking about
education, how can
we deal with this power issue
related to, who choose
the knowledge?
Thank you so much, excellent
question, first
I want to start with the most
powerful criticism
which is this question
of relevance, this
drives me up the wall
as it won't surprise you
to hear, if
children were only interested in
what was relevant, they would
never read Harry Potter, they would
never read the Lord of the Rings
children love to escape
they love to be in imagined
worlds, we
in America seem to believe
that education should be a mirror
that we should only see ourselves
whoever we happen to be
but that's to be imprisoned
in the self, it is
the irrelevant that takes us out
of ourselves, that is what
the great books
sounds very conservative
but the great books are the great books
because they were disturbing
because they pushed you, remember
a meal was burnt
Rousseau's a meal was burnt
Socrates was put to death
Nietzsche was regarded as insane
before he even went insane
these great books
take us out of ourselves
that's the point, second
on the exam results
it is true
that we have to teach children to read
this cannot be an accident
finally the one
place America has made progress
the one place is that we
now take seriously teaching
phonics, phonemic awareness
the mechanics of reading
the problem is
we often do it with meaningless
texts, texts about nothing
so we sacrifice the opportunity
to learn content
while we're teaching reading
but we've managed to fragment
that knowledge base
so they learn the mechanics
of reading but
by the time they are 12, 13
years old their reading results
begin to decline
because the knowledge isn't there
in mathematics there's a huge
war going on
how to teach math
the Chinese have one way
it's a dispute
Japanese start
by being quite constructivist
but then very old fashioned
in the high school it's a complicated story
so I would say
on your question there are
technical answers to how
to teach the basic fundamental skill
but they do not undermine
the greater argument
for content and by the way
in Russia and Hungary
before the revolution
math
education was very strong
Russia did
compared to America the results were much better
so nothing is perfect
but it was
the United States
would be envious of Soviet
Russian mathematics
other questions please
don't be shy
yes, there's a question over there
so
good morning
thank you for your talk
my name is Marjan
I am from the Philippines
but I am now doing my PhD in Italy
and I would like to ask about
I grew up learning the canon
primarily in American educational system
so we grew up very Anglo-American
how do you reconcile this
learning canon, learning Dante
Shakespeare is very important
in developing the sensibility
this idea of ethics and aesthetics
but how do we also reconcile
this colonial legacy
and we
do not replicate colonial
forms of imperialism
or cognitive imperialism
in my view
if a text is a slave
to its context
it's not worth reading
the reason Nelson Mandela
chose Sophocles
is not of course because Sophocles
was dead or white or male
he chose Sophocles
because he could have chosen anything
he was in prison, he was facing
what he thought would be a lifetime in prison
and the question was
what would be the play that he would
put on with his fellow inmates
in the jail in South Africa
he could have chosen
a story by a South African
African American
he could have chosen anything
he chose Sophocles
because he found in that text
more
difficult
powerful, truthful
disturbing, thinking
about what mattered
about power, families
despotism, nations
religious faith, courage
so
I believe that
there are great texts from
many many places, many traditions
many languages
it is a great
shame in the United States that we almost never
read things in translation
if it's not in English, oh my god
as if
most of the world's literature doesn't exist
so I think the test
of reading a text
is it
overwhelmed by its political
context
is it a work of imperialism
first and last
then why read it, right?
if it is a work worth
reading, it is
innerly liberating for all humanity
because it asks universal
questions, that's my point about
Kennedy, right?
if you do not think that there are books
poems, art, music
that speak to all of us
all of us
then you have given up on the humanities
you've given up on the idea
of humanitas, of the idea
that we are all finally
more
in common than we are
different
the American metaphor used to be
the melting pot, right? we would all become
American
today it's called the salad bowl
this is a Californian
idiocy
because if you think about it
the idea of the salad bowl is somehow
that you both are yourself
and not yourself
it makes no sense
in fact in educational terms
so I think
the best answer to your question
is simply
are you educated
by reading this text
or is it simply
an affirmation of an ideology
of a political point of view
of a piece of race
in which case, no
it does not pass and it should not be read
in school
other questions?
question, one more
thank you
good morning
good morning
Balbona Natanayli from Albania
thank you for you
I have finally a little difficult to
now
good morning again
my name is Balbona Natanayli
from Albania, thank you for
your great speech
very
very wonderful, fantastic
I have a question
one of the most
sentences that I
took with myself
is education is not about
flattering different cultures
and I agree
this
means that we need to have
some values
that we have to keep strong
in our education
and as a teacher we have to
specify
what these values are
but at the gate of the schools
we have everyday different
groups with different values
that knock at our doors
and ask to
introduce in the curriculum
their values
and I found very difficult to resist
especially if the education
has not enough money
is not enough strong
to make this resistance
so any
comments or suggestions
thank you
first of all not all values are valuable
not all values are valuable
just because I
think well of myself
does not mean that I should be
bettered
just because I am Jewish
does not mean
that I should only read Jewish texts
or texts written by Jewish authors
I would be
very angry
if a teacher said to me
you're only going to read texts
about Jewish identity
this would seem to me to be
a fundamental betrayal
the director of schools
that I live in is African American
Sonja Sontalisis
and she said to me
the challenge of education
is that it must be
both mirrors and windows
mirror yes
of the identity
of African American children
in Baltimore
because in the case of
those African Americans
in Baltimore there has been a history
of racism and suffering
which they are entitled
to learn about
this has impacted their lives
but her important point
is if you stop there
it's hopeless
then you simply reproduce
the image of suffering
on the contrary they must be
introduced to the world
to the horizon beyond Baltimore
to the texts that come
from far away places
and distant worlds and different imaginations
so
we have to be very careful
of the narcissism
of individual differences
very careful about the idea
that because all of us
look different and we come from different places
that the education
has to be about each one differently
no
we have differences, we live
with our families, with our friends
we can live those differences
but education
in the humanities
is about what it means to be human
and that education
is for everybody
or it is nothing at all
thank you
