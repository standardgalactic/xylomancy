Hello and welcome to the Bigger Picture podcast.
Today I have with me Helen Joyce, a journalist and the author of Trans When Ideology Meets
Reality.
Helen, welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me on.
It's a pleasure to have you here.
This is a big topic and one that I've been thinking about quite a bit over the past
years, so it's great to get a chance to finally talk about it on the show and with someone
who has done such amazing work uncovering the reality behind the trans movement and
its ideology.
And just as a comment, you know, I talk quite a bit about sex differences here on the podcast,
mostly in the context of personal development and relationships and evolution behind these
differences because as far as I can tell, men and women are quite different in important
and somewhat predictable ways.
And I feel that the more we know about these differences, the better our lives will be
and the better our relationships will be.
But I haven't officially entered the trans debate, so I'm looking forward to this.
I will, good luck.
Oh yes, exactly.
Here be dragons.
I'm ready for it, I'm ready for it.
So in your book, you make the distinction between biological sex and gender identity.
And people listening might be thinking, what's the harm in letting people identify however
they please?
Live and let live.
And I understand how that would appeal to our internalized liberalism, but you have
so beautifully shown that there are serious consequences when we try to bend reality and
pretend that someone's gender identity equals their biological sex.
So tell us Helen, why is a trans woman not in fact a woman?
Right, big question.
The whole question really, isn't it?
And the terminology is incredibly confusing and I think that's deliberate, but it's whether
or not it's deliberate, it's true.
So just for your listeners, a trans woman is a man who identifies as a woman.
About a quarter of people tend to think it's the other way around.
They think it's a woman who identifies as a man.
So when they hear trans women are women, they think to themselves, of course, trans women
are women because your identity doesn't change what you actually are.
But the claim is the reverse, that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman.
So that's the first thing.
And the second thing is, it's right that we start from this liberal point of view.
I mean, I think all well-meaning people do.
We start with this position that, you know, other people have the right to feel how they
like, identify how they like, do what they like, as long as it doesn't hurt other people.
And the thing about gender self-id, which is the short way of saying you are who you
say you are when it comes to which category you fall into, man or woman, is that it does
affect other people.
People often have this false analogy in their mind with, for example, gay rights and they
think a gay person can tell you that they're gay and you wouldn't say, no, you're not,
you're straight or well-proved to me that you're gay.
And there's two reasons for that one is because there is actually an objective reality behind
being gay, like in the end, it does mean that you're going to fancy and end up with people
who are the same sex as you.
But the other reason is that apart from that person, who does it really affect?
It doesn't affect me as a straight woman in terms of my own relationships, that I have
one straight son and one gay son.
They'll end up with whoever they end up with and I fully expect that at some point I will
welcome a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law into my life, although I only have two boys.
So that's fine.
But this is different because in lots of places we have single sex spaces and a person of
the wrong sex in a single sex space, it's a bit like, I don't know what the American
equivalent is, I don't know, I know you don't call petrol, I think you call petrol gasoline.
But anyway, the two types of fuel for your car, we call them petrol and diesel, right?
And if you put petrol in a diesel engine, even a tiny bit of it, you destroy the whole tank
of petrol and you're gonna have to go and get your car engine cleaned out and same the
other way round.
And the person of the wrong sex in a single sex space is like that, they break the single
sex space, just one of them.
So if one man claims that he identifies as a woman and uses that claim to go into a space
that's meant only for women, it's like a tiny little bit of petrol in a diesel engine, you've
destroyed the whole thing.
And that's not to say that men are bad and women are good or vice versa, it's the same
as there are two types of fuel and they're both fine, it just depends which engine you
have.
So the statement that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman, if he's just
saying it at home himself in his own mind, who cares?
But actually he's saying something that wrecks things for half of the population, because
he's saying something that would entitle him to come into spaces that he ruins by his
presence in the same way that petrol would ruin a diesel engine.
I mean, it's a sort of homely analogy, but I hope people see what I mean because I'm
not saying that men are bad.
People think you're saying, oh, this person's bad, they're a rapist, they're perverted,
I don't see any of those things, they're perfectly nice people, they're just not in
the right place.
So to sum all of that up, a person's identity claim can't override the physical reality
when it comes to other people's needs and perceptions and so on.
And I skimmed right past there, what's the difference between sex and gender?
So sex is that those two of them were mammals, we evolved, we're like every other mammal
and we only come in two types, male and female, and it's not possible to change which one
you are.
The question of which one you are is an absolutely solely physical one, it's to do which type
of body, with which type of body you have.
Again, not one better than the other, they're just R2 and that's the way it is.
Gender is this like kind of multi-meaning word that different people mean different
things by, like maybe it means your masculinity and femininity, maybe it means something that
you feel inside yourself, like religious people feel that they have a soul or a connection
with God or that they've had a revealed truth about something like being born again or living
after death or something like that, you know, there are claims that matter a lot to people
but don't matter really to other people.
So to the extent that gender is a word that's even worth using, I don't because it's just
got too many different meanings, it's very personal and not something that should be imposed
on other people at all, it's our sex that matters when it comes to other people's perceptions
and needs.
I think this term, gender, understanding the history of it can help clear this issue up.
Can you tell us a little bit about where did this term come from and what made it so popular?
Yeah, I mean lots of different bits to that story really.
It wasn't a word that was often used for people's sex until relatively recently and
I really think that the main reason it got picked up was that people didn't want to
say the word sex.
Americans more than Europeans because Americans tend to be more pretty about your language
than we are but also it's actually an ambiguous word sometimes sex in that we also say sex
for sexual intercourse.
So for example, in the context of a school, it would be a very bad idea to have a questionnaire
that you handed out that said what sex are you or just sex and then the kids write in
yes please or lots of it or something like that, like you're just asking for trouble
if you put sex in some questionnaires.
So people tend to use the word gender when they mean sex and that's still the most common
use of the word gender but the word gender is also used by feminists and has been for
over half a century to describe the sort of impositions on the two sexes.
So there are, I mean as you said at the beginning, quite right of course there are on average
differences between men as a group and women as a group in terms of interests, some strengths
and weaknesses in psychological profiles and those things have very obvious evolutionary
roots.
They are again just you know on average and men and women overlap a lot.
You could call that gender if you wanted or you could say that gender is the thing that's
imposed on us by things like oh pink as a girl, blue as a boy, color and men are leaders,
women are handmaidens to those leaders, those sorts of things like the prison, the prison
actually that the two sexes get put in and that makes it so hard to be so-called gender
non-conforming if you end up being a boy who cries easily and likes hugging and doesn't
want to play rugby and would like to play the harp or you're a girl who absolutely hates
wearing bows and frilly dresses and thinks rugby looks like a great sport for you you
know.
So that's another meaning of gender, like the sort of imposition on the two sexes and
actually the imposition that positions men is better than women, like superior.
And then one more meaning would be what you think you are yourself and that's a meaning
that was only really started and I think about the 1980s, 90s in fringe parts of academia,
the idea that what made you, like that everybody had this inner sense of whether they were
a man or a woman which might or might not be the same as actually the fact of them being
a man or a woman and that you could think of that as an identity.
And since then we've only accelerated on this path towards what you might call identitarianism,
the idea that the most important thing about us is our self-chosen labels, whether you
label yourself as being a person of color, like which is sort of you know it's a factual
thing but it's also a self-chosen label if you're a mixed race to some extent at least.
Whether you label yourself as being of a certain religion, how you think about your national
identity, you know people tend to think about things like autism or ASD now as identitarian
labels like whether you think of yourself as a member of the ASD community but in particular
your gender identity as another self-chosen label.
And you could think of that as a part of a very long run shift away from identity factors
that are and have a lot of connection to other people, things like the membership of your
church, the membership of a local community that you were born in, grew up in and would
expect to die in, your family, your larger family ties, a workplace that you expected
to stay in for decades, a profession that you had for your entire adult life.
Those sorts of identities as we become more fluid and mobile globally are taking second
or even third place behind very self-chosen labels as I say like things to do with mental
illness or neurological differences as well as sexuality, gender, maybe attachment to
some slightly fringe ideas that you can find online about religion like not just mainstream
church that you actually go to every week and that you work in but slightly cultish
on occasion ideas.
Right, right.
So there's a few problems here that I'm hearing.
One of them is this very subjective sense of identity, the fact that we think that our
identity has to do only with our internal subjective feeling and in reality we are very
social animals, we cannot exist without others and our identity needs to somewhat be negotiated
with our tribe and with other people.
So this shift into the entirely subjective I find problematic and the second thing that
I'm hearing is there is this paradox with gender and what people call gender stereotypes
and gender roles.
On the one hand we're hearing that gender is completely fluid, right?
There are no two genders we can identify however we want, you know, on a whim depending on
the day but trans people really try to emulate the gender stereotype of their choosing.
They are trying to be and embody that gender stereotype.
So there's this contradiction in the ideology itself and I'll just mention I love that you
added in your book a Jungian friend that you have a Jungian therapist where she says that
it is very problematic to turn the abstract into concrete and yes there are elements of
our personalities that we might find masculine or we might find feminine.
As you have mentioned in other interviews you have a PhD in mathematics which is something
that might be considered typically masculine.
I know that I am a pretty disagreeable person which is also masculine trait but that doesn't
affect my gender in the slightest.
So tell us a little bit about this paradox around gender and stereotypes.
Yeah, I mean this whole topic is filled with contradictions.
I mean for example you're told that gender is fluid and that there is no characteristic
that you can point to that tells you what somebody's gender is except that they just
told it to you and this is related by the way to a sort of post-truth ideology where
everyone creates their own truths.
And anything that is imposed on you is seen as an imposition like a bad thing but I mean
lots of things are just irreducibly true.
I mean I would love to be immortal but the reality of human life is that I am going to
die.
I think a lot of this is actually a sort of childish almost toddlerish tantrum against
the fact that there are many things that are given and that we can't change.
Well said.
Yeah, so that's not good for any of us.
Lisa Marchano is the name of the therapist you're thinking about.
She's a Jungian psychotherapist who's extremely knowledgeable about gender and gender identity
and she said to me when I talked to her she's a wonderful woman and I really highly recommend
people looking into her work generally but also specifically on gender.
She said to me that when she found out about this first like a lot of people it was around
2015 and she noticed it with friends saying you know such and such is coming out as trans
and like a lot of us she thought oh you know this is this is lovely this is wonderful these
kids are playing with something and she also if I remember correctly she has studied history
and trained as a social worker in her past so she has three really relevant bits of information
here.
So one is she knows something about psychic contagions because that's a Jungian concept
but also it's something that's happened through the history of medicine.
Two she's quite alert to the fact that children are very suggestible and need grown-ups to
set boundaries to help them to be safe and to understand the world and to navigate the
path to adulthood and three she's a Jungian so she thinks a lot about the power of the
symbolic and how important symbols can be as the first part of the furniture of our
mind.
So she thought that when and in particular sorry Jung also talked about the animus and
the anima which are like male and the female animating soul type concepts it's not something
I've thought about much in my own life or that I would regard as particularly helpful
but for her it's a way of thinking about dark and light masculine and feminine you know
as constant balancing things that play and shift and in any one person you're going to
have bits of both and maybe more of one than the other but you could also in therapy think
in a very playful way about how you as a woman might think about your masculine side or
you know vice versa and that that might change over time and so she thought that's what
these kids were doing she thought oh how lovely they're playing and then she found out they
were getting mastectomies and to her that was immediately oh you're concrete concretizing
the symbolic and Jung understood that in a very profound way to be extremely dangerous
that somebody would would take these playful symbolic concepts that you know are so useful
when you're thinking about growing as a human being and then draw them on your body in the
same way that you know an anorexic turns self-hatred or fear of adulthood or um I just
wanted to take a blessed space in the world or something on their bodies that acted out there
that's what these kids are doing they're acting something out on their bodies and so she flipped
in a second when she said that when she heard that whereas for most of us it takes a bit longer I
think to think through it but so then you've got this person who is expressing something very real
to them which is that in some sense they don't feel like their own sex talk about what those
feelings might be where their origin is how they would differ between men and women girls and boys
but anyway you've got a person who is saying to you I'm not really a girl or I'm not really a boy
I'm the opposite sex or I don't have sex this is a very meaningful statement it's not a true
statement in the concrete world where our mammalian bodies live but it may be a true psychological
statement that you then need to unpack and that distinction between the two is the problem
but you've also got a person who is trying to express that to everybody else and this this
comes to your stereotypes question like first of all the stereotype may be the reason why they've
got this idea in their heads if they feel they aren't living up to a stereotype that they think
is very important like if a boy thinks he's not going to be manly enough or a girl thinks that
you know girls are giggling creatures you know like wearing push-up brows and having
nail extensions and ironing their waist length hair every morning and you know actually is the
sort of person that you see in the really grotesque porn that's very common in schools now like boys
show girls porn you know as a way of bullying them for example so if you're a girl who thinks that
you can't live up to the feminine stereotype which is an impossible stereotype incredibly thin with
big tits you know very virginal but at the same time puts out all of those things that we've
always known about femininity how impossible it is then you think you must be masculine but now
you're going to have to try and show that to other people now an actual boy doesn't have to act very
masculine to show people that he's a boy because everyone can see he's a boy but a girl who wants
other people to think that she's a boy is going to have to act in stereotypically masculine ways
otherwise they just won't know what she's going on about and vice versa so I mean I'm a middle-aged
woman and you know feminine am I masculine at this point I don't care as long as I get my HRT
I'm happy you know but I do some feminine things like I don't bother cutting my hair I grow it long
I'm wearing a floral top um I'm a mother that's a pretty feminine thing to be I suppose as you say
other PhD in mathematics but anyway I don't have to do anything because the fact that my face was
shaped by estrogen and my body was shaped by estrogen do it all for me I could go out in a
paper bag and people would know that I'm a one but if I had been along the male developmental
pathway nobody would know that I thought I was a woman so you're going to have to wear the signs
outward signs of being a woman to try to override the the fact that you're just not and that people
can see that and this leads people to very stereotyped self-presentation and performance
and then the final thing which I hope we do get to talk on in more detail is that sometimes the
stereotype is the appeal like a lot of the middle-aged men who identify as women it
cause they get turned on by acting feminine stereotypes yeah so we will get we will get
into that that is an interesting one absolutely absolutely so this this I think does help clarify
why they are so married to the stereotype and just as an aside you know I do very much like Carl
Jung in his thinking and I don't buy the fact that gender stereotypes are stereotypes I think
they're archetypes I think they're evolved just like estrogen evolved females and testosterone
evolved males and the fact that certain things we perceive automatically it's almost like a heuristic
as masculine or feminine I think that's also evolved and obviously there are cultural flavors
and you know one culture might consider dancing as very feminine and another cultural only men do
that but still there are certain things that for instance thinking that nurturing is something
feminine that is not made up and that is not a patriarchal lie that is because women bear
children and they breastfeed and they have this built in maternal instinct so also changing some
of the language around stereotypes we do have a lot of freedom in how we express our roles today
which I think is amazing but understanding what femininity and masculinity is in our psyches
these built-in features I think is also important because pretending like nothing is feminine nothing
is masculine we can be whatever we want and then playing out the stereotypes I think gets us into
such confusion and it's just not helpful that's just if I could if I could come back on that at
this I agree with everything you said and that is why I don't count myself as what some in particular
some radical feminists so for listeners radical in radical feminist does not mean extreme it means
going back to the root radical is a word that comes from root so it's a specific school of
feminism and I don't count myself as a member of that because radical feminists are also gender
abolitionists they believe that in a world where women weren't oppressed there would be
no gender stereotypes of any sort I completely agree with you that many things that we call
stereotypes are archetypes and that these are things that clearly evolved and obviously women
are going to be more interested in babies than men this just like how could that not be evolution
does not leave there's a famous joke about an an economist to somebody who would walk past a dollar
bill left on the sidewalk and not pick it up and if you asked him why he'd say you know no dollar
bills get left on sidewalks someone must already have picked it up so evolution evolution is like
that evolution doesn't leave dollar bills on sidewalks anyway and what I would say though is
that what is harmful and very destructive about gender and not a given is the and is hierarchy
in it and this is a point that was made to me beautifully some years ago by jen clear jones
who's a philosopher here in the UK and she was the person who showed me that in a lot of these
things the bad isn't in difference the bad is in um turning that difference first into a binary so
it's very extreme rather than thinking that people are mixtures and they vary and it's overlapping
and then saying that one is better than the other so if you think of masculine and feminine and you
think of words to pair with that you will he will hear that masculine is light and feminine is dark
masculine is the sun feminine is the moon uh masculine is yin feminine is yang and in every
case the masculine is the animation force the active force and the feminine is the is the passive
force and those linked binaries need to be unpicked if women are to be full human beings it
doesn't mean that we don't we can't be feminine but to the extent that feminine means being
object rather than subject and being passive rather than active being the servant rather than the
master and being the follower rather than the leader you know women want to do all of those
things too we want to live full and full and actualized lives too while we're more interested
in babies while we speak more maybe while we're better communicators maybe while we don't have
such good 3d vision you know why we probably don't make good firefighters in the main but
are better nurses in the main than men you know so because we've done this stupid thing of over
exaggerating what masculine and feminine are lying to ourselves about the fact that we have put a
value judgment on how the two of them relate to each other and then pretend that it's all
stereotype and none of it is real we haven't even started the work of unpicking any of this that we
could have done absolutely absolutely i think that is so beautifully said because it really is that
superiority and inferiority complex right the fact that we perceive masculinity as positive
and the fact that feminists their solution to that was to become more like men instead of
raising the value of feminine virtues and things like you know raising children or you know being
nurturing of valuing that as you said there are value judgments here and yes we have evolved
in a somewhat patriarchal world but unpicking these gender archetypes doesn't mean that we
need to abolish gender so i really really loved how you put that so let's talk a little bit about
gender dysphoria what has the research shown about kids who have gender dysphoria and we're
left alone it's a gender dysphoria the word dysphoria just means discomfort or misery so it's a
discomfort or misery with either the fact of which sex you are or the stacks of the sexed body that
you have and the diagnostic tools have changed over time and the labels have changed but basically
it's a boy who's deeply unhappy in more than just a passing sense the fact that he's a boy
perhaps he hates his penis perhaps he hates the role that he's supposed to play as a boy
whatever you know and the same for girl like the reverse so this is something that to some
extent probably through recent history most girls have felt because most girls find puberty really
very difficult bleeding is starting to bleed is tough when you have your period breasts are the
most visible outer remarker of being an adult woman and as soon as your breasts start to develop
which is usually when you're only in your early teens that's when you start to get cat called
and men give them you unwanted attention so you could say that gender dysphoria is an incredibly
natural thing at mild to moderate and you know lots of boys like if you're going to grow 18
inches in about half a second and your voice breaks and you become very very spotty that's also
deeply depressing so puberty is perhaps the time that a lot of people feel some element of gender
dysphoria but what you didn't ever really see until very recently was significant numbers of
younger kids strongly expressing that they didn't want to be their sex or teenagers who said much
more than just you know it's so unfair that I have to bleed or why do I have to stay at home
while boys get up to go out and play like why do I have to help with housework you know to go beyond
that into saying I feel like I'm a member of the opposite sex I was meant to be a member of the
opposite sex I really am a member of the opposite sex that's not an idea that spontaneously occurs
to many people so at that long preamble it has occurred to some children in history and there
are I think 13 studies that I know all before the big change that happened in the last decade or so
which will come to that have looked at those kids and they're in different countries some of them
are boys only some of them mix sex some of them are rather small all of them show that those kids
outgrow their gender dysphoria if you don't concretize it so if the family are kind to the
child try to understand what it is the kid is saying when they say I'm not really a boy or
I'm not really a girl give them time don't lie to them about their bodies don't lie to other people
about what sex they are they grow out of it and interestingly a very large share of them turn
out to be gay so the fixed understanding by say 2010 among those who knew the research was that
little children who expressed spontaneously the idea that they were meant to be members of the
opposite sex in whatever language they used were highly likely to grow up to be gay but would also
grow out of their gender dysphoria and this is connected with an idea we all used to know which
is that gay people are by far the most gender non-conforming people and that gender non-conformity
often comes way before puberty so before the gay person knows they're going to be gay before they
feel any you know feelings of sexual attraction they are unusual they are different you can spot
these little fey boys sometimes and these incredibly rough and tumble girls of course some of them
grow up to be straight but just the odds chain when a kid is like that right right so that's what we
knew in about 2010 and there've been some studies since that have confirmed that but what has happened
since then two things one is that we are creating gender dysphoria and the other is taking that
gender dysphoria to mean that you are trans and that you should do quite extreme things in terms of
yourself presentation and medical treatment so by telling people that if you feel that if you don't
identify with the most extreme and rigid and un-nuanced description of what it is to be a boy or a
girl then you probably aren't a boy or a girl and that's basically what's being taught right
across the angiosphere and increasing numbers of non-english-speaking european countries as well
that they're literally telling girls and boys in school from quite little that it's possible
to look like a boy but really be a girl or vice versa and that there are people who have a gender
identity that doesn't match their body how are you going to know what your gender identity is
when you self-examine and you do so by reference to just incredibly regressive stereotypes so I
mean I'm not talking about you know it's unsurprising that girls like babies more than boys do
I'm talking about girls like cooking and pink and knitting and shopping and gossiping and boys like
trucks and rugby and like they literally write these lists down and they tell children to look at
them and self-examine so we're so that zen a kid looks at things oh you know I don't really fit in
that and actually it sounds a bit shit maybe I'm non-binary or I like to look at the other lists
better or whatever and then they're told that makes them trans and so now you've got a kid who's
thinking about something that a child wasn't thinking about in previous eras like they just
weren't encouraged to think about it and encouraging people to ruminate about something creates a chain
in how they think and how they feel it's a feedback loop and over time you know pretty much
anyone can convince themselves that their gender is foric if they give it a really good go and then
the next thing that you're told is you're given a cultural meaning for what it is to be trans
that says you must declare your pronouns anyone who won't use your pronoun hates you and wants you
dead I mean imagine a more wicked thing to tell a child than that anyone who slips up and looks at
an obvious girl and forgets that that girl calls herself a boy that that person is hateful and
wants them dead and then that child gets paranoid about it they ruminate they're afraid they close
in they go into their bubble of people who agree with this incredibly extreme ideology
and then they may self-medicate or they may seek medication or they go and see a gender
affirmative therapist who tells them this is the right interpretation and if they're very unlucky
they end up on drugs and that the can't be undone you know what you take changes your body
permanently and maybe even on the way to surgery whereas in a culture that understood gender
non-conformity something wrong with it gender non-conforming some people are a lot gender
non-conforming that's fine we can accommodate all sorts here you know what do you mean when
you say you're really a girl then you know jimmy do you mean you want to go to ballet because you
can go to ballet you know that sort of approach yeah in that culture jimmy would just have gone
to ballet it would have been fine and he might have grown up gay or he might have given up ballet
who knows in our culture jimmy is unfortunately being pushed down a much more dangerous and harmful
path and so it's hard to say what the research shows as something that it should know because
the research dates from a time that we weren't creating gender dysphoria and we weren't putting
children on this pathway now that we are creating gender dysphoria and we are putting children on
this pathway we're probably creating a lot of children who will grow up to be adults who continue
just to identify as trans and we don't know what happens next will they be happy for the rest of
their lives with these changes will they will they live a happier life for spending their whole
lives trying to tell everybody else they're not really the sex they clearly are how will they
feel about the fact that if they've undergone these physical these hormonal and surgical changes
they'll be sterile and probably an orgasmic as well you know it's a huge uncontrolled not even
experiment because we're not tracking the outcomes right right i want to zoom in here because i think
it's so important for people to understand what actually goes on in these gender clinics when
we talk about gender affirmation i just want people to understand that that is the accepted
policy today if you're in a progressive state uh in america i know in the uk and in ireland
this is very much the case in many places gender affirmation is the way to go and i've heard this
very cruel phrase that is being thrown at parents would you rather have a trans child or a dead child
and i cannot think of anything more cruel to say to a parent who is confused once their child to be
happy sees that their child is suffering and seeking the advice of a clinician of someone who is
uh certified and has worked and researched this field and what they are being fed is a very very
dangerous ideology that distorts reality it's a collective social delusion and the consequences
the physical consequences are dire and recently had a conversation you know talking about these
problems what what happens what do you do when you have a child four years old five years old
who's gender non-conforming i think understanding that you know we live in a very liberal world
and if you want to go to ballet jimmy go to ballet i love that you know i was in karate
and kung fu classes for years because i could not stand the girls in ballet class and you know
nothing no gender dysphoria here but i i liked i liked you know rough and tumble play with the
boys and there was nothing wrong with that and i think that this idea that we are telling children
that they can change their sex is wrong it is false because what they really can do is they can
sterilize themselves they can turn themselves into asexual beings you know if you take puberty
blockers you're not your reproductive system isn't going to develop and even your your sexual desire
isn't going to develop a lot of these people are asexual have experienced sexual dysfunction
and these surgeries are i can't i can't find another word other than they create a disabled
person they have a high risk of infection of complications you need to take hormones for
the rest of your life you don't actually change into the other sex you undergo this this you know
genital mutilation this really really awful process so tell us a little bit about what happens
in these gender clinics i mean everything you say is true and as you were saying as i was
thinking about little jimmy and him saying that he wants to go to ballet and it comes back to the
point i made earlier about the hierarchy between masculine and feminine because you were doing
a high status thing as a little girl doing karate you were rejecting the low status thing
namely the girl thing whereas a boy who wants to do ballet is very counter cultural so that's a
much harder task for parents to find space for little jimmy who wants to do ballet without him
starting to internalize the fact he's not a real boy that the other boys are going to mock him
they're going to say that's a girl thing to do your girly you're a sissy you know all of those
things and i mean it depends where you are you know if you're in a liberal city if you live in
brighton or new york you probably you know there's space for that kid but you're going to have to
make that space for them as a parent and that's a really important thing to do and if you think we
can't do it then ask yourself what homophobia you are still harboring because we all know that
little jimmy who wants to do ballet is more likely to grow up gay and people who don't want them to
do ballet because they know that they wrongly think that they can change jimmy's or suppress jimmy's
future sexual orientation by forcing jimmy to go and do some much more manly things instead
all they can do is make jimmy very unhappy okay right so so that's a harder task finding you know
holding space for those useful little fey little special boys may grow up to be straight and fabulous
and that's fine but let's all face it they're more likely to be gay right so what happens
when you go to a gender affirming clinic which in more and more countries is the only sort of
way that a therapist is allowed to practice because of laws again they call conversion
therapy is that as soon as a child says i understand myself to be trans in any form of
words you might imagine i feel on gender queer i feel on gender fluid i think i'm non-binary i
know that i was really meant to be a boy any of those words all they hear is you're right it's
back to this thin identity that is just self created and self stated rather than being something
that's actually about the connection that you have with other people and then that is affirmed
you know a good therapist affirms the situation that their client feels themselves to be in affirms
their feelings by saying i can i hear that you can feel that you're feeling that i hear this is
important to you let's unpack it gender affirmation is no you really are a boy that's right you know
a girl who says she's a boy really is a boy no questioning and then that just sort of pushes
the child down a certain pathway and anyone who disagrees with them including the parents
is positioned as somebody who hates that child wants that child dead and i've heard too many
stories to repeat now about therapists meeting a child for the first time and saying to that child
in front of the parents you know yes you are what you say you are and anyone who disagrees with you
in union puberty blockers or else you'll kill yourself like telling the children coaching them
and suicide this really is happening and so instead of helping they're harming i mean i would not
under any circumstances bring a child that i've had anything to do with it anywhere near any of these
people because they will only make it worse which of course leaves you on your own and on your own
against a culture that is telling your child lies in school curricula in reading materials online
in government edicts um so you're really on your own i think more than parents have ever been before
about trying to deal with a societally created problem it's worth talking a little bit about
the way that this gender affirmation has become standard i mean really until 10 years ago any
reputable therapist knew very well that you know you don't just affirm as in blindly say it's true
to things that your clients say you don't tell them it's false necessarily either it's generally a
you know what does this mean to you let's talk about it let's get to the root of this
and it's been by a false analogy with conversion therapy practiced on gay people
a half century ago so the theory used to be that being gay was something that had gone wrong in
your development i was always blamed on the mother i mean mothers are the you know universal punching
bag for everything that goes wrong with children since friday and the idea was yeah yeah so the
idea was that the mother had been too clingy or the father had been too absent and therefore
the mother had been too present and that she had imposed femininity on her son
and that the boy had somehow become had flipped somehow he was an invert he had
gone down the wrong pathway and that you could maybe put him back on the right pathway and the
the ways in which they tried to do this that by the way completely false but also the way they
tried to do it was very cruel which was that you would try to get a gay person so a teenager or even
a little boy i've heard it's been done a little boys who were just very gender non-conforming
and you would try to get them to feel shame about anything that was gender non-conforming
like you would throw out the the little boys and dress up clothes you would and get the adult to
and shame themselves about their feelings if it was an adult you might get them to what
opposite sex porn and masturbate at the same time you would get them to watch a bit same sex images
like you know handsome man if it was a gay man you're trying to convert and give them at the same
time electric shocks or give him and drugs that would make him feel sick and vomit and all you
can do by doing this sort of thing is internalize a great deal of shame and also make the person
associate their natural feelings of desire for an older person with revulsion it is actually
possible to suppress people temporarily to suppress people's natural desires once you
can do is create the desire that they don't have you know all you can do is really make them very
very miserable so that was conversion therapy and no therapist has done it for a decade it was
recognized to be abusive all the psychological associations and similar worldwide put out
statements apologizing for ever having suggested that this was a good idea saying it didn't work
saying that doing anything remotely like this would get you struck off the only place that
anything even remotely similar still happens is in sort of fringe and religious groups
and there you might get shamed in front of other people or prayed over or be subjected to sort of
hours of haranguing and this again is really fringe like really really fringe and anything
that heads into that you might be hit or anything like that would of course fall under and assault
laws like it would be illegal without having to say you need to have a specialist law about it
but anyway in the last few years activists have managed to get laws they call bans on conversion
therapy passed around the world we're fighting to try to stop one here in the UK and and what they
say is conversion therapy for and this is the big bait and switch sexual orientation and gender
identity now if it was just sexual orientation it would be a law banning something that basically
isn't happening and that's annoying and bad but anyway you know it's relatively minor because
it's not really happening but gender identity as I said it's not this fixed thing most people
don't feel themselves to have to have a gender identity they just know that they're male or female
and people who think of themselves as having a cross gender identity at least in childhood
we know that tends to vanish if you just let it alone so there isn't a fixed thing gender identity
that you would be trying to convert somebody from the way there is with sexual orientation
and what this plays out as is that anybody who tries to make any sort of effort to convince
somebody that they're not whatever they say they are at risks of criminal prosecution it depends on
the law the specific law if they're a therapist they might get struck off and they might get sued
by somebody if it's even a parent in some places I mean there have been parents who've had children
taken away from them in both Canada and in the US right for refusing to allow the child to go on
puberty blockers because that's seen as a conversion effort so this law is an absolute
wolf in sheep's clothing it's an attempt to stop anybody from saying to a child you know hang on
what do you actually mean when you say you're not actually a girl and to it just railroad this child
straight through this entirely ideologically driven non-reality based model of whatever you
say you are you are this is so sinister you know putting this into a law and taking a parents right
away from them to to be a parent to deal with their children however they see fit and to protect them
from these ideologies it's absolutely absurd and I think the problem is that most people just
don't have the time to follow you know these policies these laws and it's really important
to know the facts behind this it sounds so nice as well you know it sounds so great
banconversion therapy yeah I know and then you look at it and it's not what it says it is
exactly exactly a wolf in sheep's clothing as you said it's really well put I want us to talk a
little bit about the types of transgender isms because we like to think of it as one big category
but really there are types and there has been good research showing that there are types
so tell us a little bit about these categories sure so the very first people who ever had any
idea that somebody could be a man but really a woman were in about 1920s and it was very linked
to their understanding of homosexuality by these early researchers I'm going back a little bit
earlier than that about 30 years earlier than that on homosexuality their idea of what a homosexual
man was was a man with a woman's soul that's what they really thought that you were inside you were
really a woman and but by about 1920s in Berlin specifically there were just a couple of doctors
who felt that it was possible not just to be a man with a woman's soul who wanted to sleep with men
but that you might be a man with a woman's soul in a way that made you want to present as a woman
so they saw it as a type of cross dressing and if you look at the early work they're early writing
about it they understood that it was different whether the man wanted to sleep with men or wanted
to sleep with women so they understood right from the beginning that there were two types of men
who might think of themselves as women or want to sleep like take the woman's role in sex you might
call it and that was the gay ones and the straight ones so those are the two types still that we
think of um if you're a if you're any sort of serious sexologist who isn't entirely had your
brain eaten by um identity and identity politics and queer theory you still understand that there
are these two types of men who feel that they're women and there's entirely different paths to it
so for the gay men it'll be um somebody who was a really gender nonconforming little boy and it was
established really 20 years ago by in a research paper that looked at all the previous research
about how gender dysphoria developed in children and what it concluded was you started with the
gender nonconformity child didn't typically feel gender dysphoric shame followed because of the way
that the gender nonconformity was responded to by the people around you so a dad who tried to
toughen you up um you know classmates bullying you and leaving you out and calling you a sissy
and so on that creates enormous shame in a boy who is different and that shame becomes
self-patriot and then at some point the question occurs to the little boy was I really meant to be
a girl and that's the origin of that sort of gender dysphoria and somebody who goes along that classic
pathway um ideally what'll happen when they hit puberty is sexual desire rears its head and they
finally understand themselves to be gay and then you know this is not an easy path to adulthood
when you're shamed with who you are and you maybe live in a homophobic society but anyway a load of
gay men of my generation and above have had to navigate that path and they understand themselves
to be gay and they have done a lot of work on themselves to get rid of the shame but some haven't
and some can't and in the end they feel that they just be happier and more natural they present as
women and so they these people typically tend to be very feminine in their presentation and style
and always have been passed quite well often and are quite realistic actually they know they're not
women and they don't tend to want to impose on women um I don't think any man belongs in women's
spaces but these men because they're gay are not actually a massive threat to women and that's what
most people think that all trans men are like all trans identified men all trans women they think
that they think that it's a gay man who's had a lot of surgery and is really unusually you know
feminine but they're probably the minority who've been seen in gender clinics over the last number
of decades the majority come in older they're heterosexual they've often been married and have
kids and they're often very notably not very feminine in their self presentation they're
quite hard charging men typically they've done things like engineering computer science there's a
lot of them in the military and these men have something more complicated which is that they
get aroused at the idea of being a woman so they like women not men but the woman they like best
is the imaginary woman that they are and those men have typically been cross dressings as they
were teens it often starts by stealing your sisters or your mother's underwear and masturbating in it
and those men often conceal the fact that that's how they get their thrills they get married
and they get they have kids maybe and then at some point their wife finds out that
that their husband is wearing their dresses like and you know this is a big part of his life and
often what happens is this man makes it in his 40s or 50s and by this point you know he's conquered
everything else he's maybe cruising towards retirement and it's time for the woman inside
to come out and play right like this Caitlyn Jenner is a great example of this yeah I mean I don't
want to diagnose somebody that I don't know but I mean it's it it does look pretty typical so if
you imagine Caitlyn Jenner you're probably imagining the right thing but I don't know
Caitlyn Jenner and I'm not a psychological professional so that person is often somebody
who like their dearest wish is to really be a woman and the thing that's different about this
from homosexual orientation is that it requires other people to play along so the gay man says to
me I'm gay and I say no you're not like oh yes I am but I don't care what you think if a man who
says he's a woman says to me he's a woman and I say no you're not I'm destroying his deepest
fantasy right and if I say to him no you can't come into the space because this space is women only
I'm stopping him from living out something that he's been fantasizing about possibly for decades
and remember he's a man he's got male entitlement he's somebody who thinks that he gets what he
wants and this is the latest thing that he wants and so these men are hyper aggressive so if you
want to think about the nastiest and most entitled aggressive woman hating and just horrible trans activists
and of course there are plenty of trans people who are not like this but if you want to think about
the ones who cause the most problem it's these men and that is because the one word they will
not hear from women is and I'll say one more thing about these men it's that part of the fantasy
for them is that they would have been much happier if they hadn't gone through male puberty because
they don't pass they've you know they're in their 40s they're trying to transition now they've got
deep voices they've got big jaws they've big hands and feet they're tall they've got the whole body
of a man it's too late to send them down the other pathway and it's a source of grace grief to them
that they can't pass and it's a big part of what they fantasize about so they project that fantasy
boys and they think that they often sort of you know retrofit their history they'll say things to
you like I knew I was a girl right from when I was little and you're like well I mean there wasn't
any evidence of at the time you didn't act very feminine and you did get grow up and get married
and have two kids or whatever um so but the fact they they project that on little boys and they are
biggest cheerleaders for very early medicalization of gender dysphoric kids and they are not interested
in the fact that most of those kids will grow out of this they want those kids put on puberty
blockers before puberty starts they want those they want to lower the ages the kids can get
cross-sex hormones they want surgery done even before 18 because it's part of their own sexual
fantasy and they don't care about the fact that actually the biggest group seen in gender clinics
and our girls who aren't even part of this damn profile and we didn't even start talking about
the girls like we just talked about the boys the girls the girls is a whole other issue and
just to give people a little context this is new transgenderism has usually been seen in men with
androphilic men who are homosexual and do want to be women but with men and the autogynophilia men
who are attracted almost to themselves really as women and have this fantasy as you said of being
women but teenage girls being gender dysphoric is completely new and we we hinted at it at the
beginning with this social contagion so give us a little context what is happening to teenage girls
today? So Abigail Shire wrote a book that was very specifically about these girls called Irreversible
Damage and in it she said that she had tried to find papers the earliest papers academic papers
that covered gender dysphoria in teenage girls and she couldn't find a single one before 2010
it literally wasn't a phenomenon there were there was none almost no children were seen
in gender clinics and when they were it was really invariably boys or nearly invariably boys
you did see some women in gender clinics early but they were variably like really hyper butch
lesbians who just found that they just wanted to be taken from men they wanted rid of their breasts
they wanted to marry a woman they wanted to live in first commas live like men like they just they
just didn't want anyone to think of them as women and often they could pass because if you
testosterone is like a one-way gage it's like you know it's like they say easily in but not easily
out so the mobster in the lobster pot you know testosterone testosterone is that so someone
who's gone through male puberty is never going to pass as a woman without extensive surgery
including on their face and probably not even then but a woman even a woman who's gone through
female puberty if she takes testosterone she'll grow facial hair she'll bulk up on her muscles
she may hem looser hair if she carries the gene from ill patterned baldness
she's got a much better chance of passing as a man so that was what they used to see in gender
clinics the occasional lesbian woman who came in and wanted testosterone and to have her breasts
removed never saw teenage girls and never saw gender conforming women either so what happened
i mean you could say the internet happened tumblr happened and teenage girls have always been the
group most susceptible to social contagion right i mean i generally am on the fence about to what
extent that's something real about teenage girls psychology or to what extent it is the fact that
female puberty is really hard to navigate when our ideas of what a girl is are so unattainable
but it's girls who got anorexia much more than boys it's girls who sell who sell harm who cut
who do bulimia like vomit it's girls now who are on tiktok and identifying as having multiple
personalities these things just really spread through groups of girls in a way that they don't
groups of boys or mixed sex groups and the sad fact is that since 2010 the cultural contagion
among girls has been trans identification and what really facilitated this and made it the
cultural contagion of time is the internet and specifically internet sites where children
congregate without adults so this is unprecedented in human history that there has been a very serious
and large social space where only children are and where there are no adults and we have let our
children raise themselves and each other in places like tumblr and now tiktok and children are more
volatile less experienced worse weighing risks obviously much more naive because they have much
less life experience and and if you leave them in places where there's nobody older and more
experienced i'm willing to say no they really spiral off into oddities and so you start to see
around by 2013 to 2015 on tumblr these questionnaires about you know identify your gender and it would
be like it was like it was like buddy tamagotchi or pokemon you know like gotta catch them all lists
random you know unicorn gender and very febrile and there were no adults so um i think it was
lisa litman who is the the woman who wrote who coined the phrase rapid onset gender dysphoria
for these girls she she found out about it the way that many people did by friends telling her
about trans issues or seeing things on facebook and at first she thought like everybody else
oh you know how lovely they must be accepted and then she had a training a background in
epidemiology so she was used to thinking about rates of things and after she saw like the third
or fourth child all teenage girls come out in her relatively small community she thought this is
realistic like i'm told that the rate of trans identification in girls is 120 000
so i'm not going to see four of them in rapid succession in one community
so she started to look into it and she went and she looked on tumblr and she said what she saw
horrified her it was children giving the worst possible advice to each other girls saying things
like if you think you might be trans you really are and if you tell your parents and they say anything
that's not affirmative they hate you they want you dead you should cut yourself off immediately
you'll find better advice here than you find if you go to the doctor doctors are ignorant
you know really awfully damaging things and we've never ever created a space like that
before it's as if we've got the worst possible thing that these teenage girls could do and
tell each other and we put them in a gated community where no adults come in and we've
let them go for many years on this sort of thing like tumblr cracked down on sites glorifying
and posts glorifying anorexia and self-harming they were really bad and suicide as well but it
never cracked down on the gender stuff and it you know it spawned an entire generation's contagion
and now it's all moved to tick tock where honestly the amount of gender-related bullshit and if you
try to say anything sense you lose your account wow wow no that is incredible I want to give people
a little glimpse into the psychology here of the teenage girl because I find it really fascinating
first of all in puberty puberty is it easy for anybody but girls definitely have a harder time
society's expectations period all of these things are difficult but women also have a rise in
eroticism during those years so that heightened negative emotion also sets the stage and I heard
an interview with a girl who transitioned and then detransitioned I forget her name it's I think
it's something Cole she was on Chloe Cole that big Chloe Cole yes yes yes wonderful wonderful
interview with Jordan Peterson I really recommend it and what you find out there is that she
had fantasies of becoming a woman a vivacious voluptuous Kim Kardashian type woman and she
found later on that she she's a bit autistic she's on the spectrum so that also clues us into the
fact that she wasn't good at reading social cues and she didn't get along with girls because of that
she had a harder time with with girls and and feminine typical things and people who are autistic
do tend to like things more than people so you have this gender non-conforming kind of till
and you have these fantasies of becoming a woman and you have this awkward stage of puberty and
God I remember it you know everything grows at the wrong pace and the wrong rate and you see all
of these Victoria's Secret models and you know I'm never gonna be like that and her solution then
reading Tumblr was maybe I need to be a boy and I won't I won't go into too much detail about the
horrific things she underwent and the consequences and the symptoms but it really is devastating
and when you realize that at the heart of it was was truly a fantasy of of being a woman
and her only solution was this trans ideology that she was fed so definitely needs more thought
and more care and get your teenage girls away from social media
and something that I should say and I haven't heard other people say this so maybe it's a
good time to discuss it I think I think anyone who is immersed in this topic knows how dangerous
Tumblr was and that TikTok is an absolute cesspit at the moment what you may not know is that
fanfiction websites are a big inculcator of this stuff interesting so yeah so there's two big fanfic
websites that I know about and I'm just really interested in them as a there are a window into
the mind of teenage girls and young women of a sort we don't have anywhere else because the
way they work is they're unmediated and as long as you don't make copyright claims pretty much
anything goes and there's literally millions of stories on the two big ones archive of our own
and fanfiction.net there are other ones as well but literally millions I think there's more than
10 million on archive of our own and they tend to start from a story that pre-exists although
there are some that are original Harry Potter is very very popular because Harry Potter was
started at the right stage the kids who grew up with Harry Potter arrived at the right age
to want to write fanfic and you start by saying to yourself like what happened next what happened
after Voldemort was defeated and there's I think more than a million stories that follow on from
Harry Potter just alone but there's thousands of fandoms anyway so these are not edited and they are
not gate kept in the way that say erotic fiction or romance fiction or adventure fiction or anything
you're an adult is like somebody has to publish that stuff this stuff is just by girls for girls
or young women and some of it's extremely good but you can you can study it because you can sort
things and you can search by tags and I've done a fair bit of that and I wrote an article about
it just more than five years ago and then I went back to it to see what had changed very much more
porny was one of the big ones porn related tags like slapping choking spitting anal you know
gangbang you know those things had really become much more common so there's a horrible feedback
loop between the the porn the boys watch and the erotic stuff that girls write but there's a lot
of what's called slash fiction there so the slash is the punctuation sign and it goes back decades
to the fan fiction that was written before the internet and published in fanzines about Star Trek
and it started with being women writing about Captain Kirk and Spock getting together and so
it was Kirk slash Spock k slash s just slash so slash fiction is any fan fiction that is written
about two characters who in the original are heterosexual men getting it together and this I
think is the female equivalent of men watching so-called lesbian porn right and so lesbian
point isn't about lesbians it's about the sort of woman who appeals to men but there's two of them
and men will commonly say well you know you get rid of it I don't like watching which is the man I
don't like seeing men they're getting in the way they're ruining my view two women are better than
one you know those sorts of things so why do women like slash I don't by the way myself I find it
incredibly irritating but lots and lots of women do and they write stories so and when I was writing
about this I think in 2017 or 18 the most popular pairing in the harry fiction at harry potter
category on archive of our own was draco and harry getting together
wow I know it's now I think that's second now and the most common is Hermione and harry so
that's overtaken us but anyway so girls write a lot of fiction that gets two boys together
but then you look at what they write and yes they are using porn tropes and you know they learn from
each other and so you know things that are seen in gay porn do creep in but you as you read it if
you do look at it they don't read like men these men don't read like men and they don't really
read like gay men either and if you ask a gay man to read it he thinks it's hysterical these men are
kind of womanly and the best way I can describe them is that they're like a Korean boy band
so they're kind of huge and they and they hold hands and they talk about their feelings and
they may have sex that's written in a lot of detail but they're kind of girls and I genuinely
think that these bloody sites are selling girls an idea of what it is to be a gay boy that they
really like the lookal because it used to be that it was only the very gender non-conforming girls
who were going you know going to grow up lesbian they were the ones who transitioned and I mean
that's bad enough but you kind of see where they're coming from like it's the wrong solution but you
see what they're saying yeah but now it's these very feminine girls and like how what does a feminine
girl think she's like how and she's so she wants to be a gay boy and I said I have a gay son like
this is not this is a non-starter gay men aren't interested in women they really aren't even in
women who have taken testosterone but they're imagining themselves to be this sort of Korean
boy band aesthetic and so they're I don't know it's very strange it's like a self-coaching into a
weird cultish belief and lots of girls are doing this it's a really a collective delusion what it
sounds like yes it is inverting reality completely and allowing these girls to entertain you know
the reality of oh I can I can be a boy and have that romance that I really want yeah just be this
yeah and be this like holding hands type of boy and I'm not saying that gay boys don't hold hands
but you do know what I mean if you picture those Korean boy band boys there's an expression in
French that gets used in English in crimes which is fully other which means like a madness of two
and it's crimes that are committed by partners that you think would probably not be committed by
only one of them they egg each other on and they end up committing even a murder together so I think
whatever the collective equivalent of fully other is this is a madness that gets created by large
numbers and again it's this unmediated space where there aren't adults there isn't reality there's no
gay keeping and in some ways that's brilliant it's super creative like there's incredibly brilliant
ideas on these sites you know you could lose yourself there for years if you wanted but one
of the things that happens there is that significant numbers of girls develop gender dysphoria create
an idea of what it would be to be a gay boy or this they sweet kind of girly variety and then
catastrophically take steps that can't be undone it doesn't end up just being a phase like being a
goth would have been a phase you know like this was just got 2.0 I wouldn't care right right I think
they they almost think that they can solve the problems that they're facing as girls as developing
women and get to enjoy you know all the good parts in this exact location incredible incredible I've
never heard of that and you know I do I know about kind of fanfiction and fantasy from euphoria the
tv show there's one character who's like really heavily into that kind of erotica but I have not
heard about this like weird boy on boy but imagined in a girl's mind kind of romance stories
incredible oh my jaw dropped when I heard about it first like I actually I was why did I hear about
it I can't actually remember where I heard about it first I had to go off and look it up and I
actually sat there I could feel my mouth go what but you know and when I wrote this article like I
looked into it and you know there's been some scholarly work done on early fiction and I talked
to a woman who had written a short book on Kirk slash Spock and it was she was really interesting
talking to her about it and when she decided she wanted to research it she reached out to
famous evolutionary psychologist who was retired and she quoted from his letter and
replied to her in the foreword to her book and he said the same thing he said he got her letter
he he she wrote what this this was she said that I want to do some research on this you know would
you consider supervising I think was a master's degree on it or something and he said he sat there
he said my jaw dropped and I had to rewrite reread what she had written several times to
make sure that I hadn't misunderstood it so if you are not one of the people who finds like
I promise you some of your listeners right now are thinking oh that sounds nice yeah
they haven't heard about it before but they're gonna go and look yeah yeah so there are whatever
floats your boat whatever floats your boat yeah but these girls madness of large numbers
and crazy crazy crazy I again keep your teenage daughters away from social media the best you
can have them rooted in reality in real friendships and relationships I think that's a good course
I do want us to touch upon this issue that you have spoken about as well which is
trans rights impinging on women's rights and we see that in these extreme cases of women sports
and women's prisons so tell us about what is going on so I always try and unpack that statement
because I asked what you know what are trans rights if by trans rights we meet the human
rights that everybody has you know to freedom of belief freedom of expression safety dignity to be
able to work without prejudice and so on absolutely trans identified people have exactly the same
rights as everybody else and so they should you should not be able to fire somebody or refuse to
rent them or kick them out of a bar or any of those things like that what the trans rights are human
rights and something is meant to me is that unless you go along with a trans identified persons
identity rather than their actual sex you are denying their human rights and they will often
say you're denying my right to exist right so a man who identifies as a woman is like what I said
at the beginning of this show you know he's petrol she's diesel they're both lovely they're great
when you put them in the right tanks fantastic when you put them in the wrong tank they cause a big
problem so if a man who identifies as a woman takes that as being that he can come into women
only spaces he destroys the women only spaces like just that's just a logical statement he's a man
so he comes into a woman's face it's no longer a woman only space and that doesn't change if he
calls himself a woman because we can't actually turn men into women like he thinks of himself as a
woman but he's not so it's a problem for all women only spaces actually like even the ordinary ones
you have to ask yourself why we have women only spaces in the first place and it's always basically
comfort safety privacy privacy and dignity most people really do feel more comfortable in awkward
situations with only people their own sex there so you've got to go and have a prostate exam or
you've got to go and had your cervical smear test called a pap smear in america you probably want
somebody of the same sex as you if you are a muslim woman and you want to adjust your head covering
or you want to wash you're going to have to do that in the presence of other women and for orthodox
Jewish women there will also be rules about that and you know if you're a rape victim or you are
very shy or you were a domestic abuse survivor or you were abused as a child you may have very
strong feelings about not wanting to be vulnerable or visible in mixed sex spaces but just most
women like even women with none of these special characteristics if you're going to have to undress
from the waist down which we do in order to just have a pee you want only other women around like
even if there's a door just feels better that men are outside two doors that's why we have single
sex spaces and if men can say I'm a woman and come into them they're no longer single sex
so it's a problem in all those spaces but the two really high profile situations where it matters
are sport and prisons now I think there are things that are more important than sport
but sport is just so visible right and also you know when I talk about how men commit most crimes
and commit most sex crimes men get cross they say not all men and they hear this is a criticism of
men and that's why I say men are great I'm married to one I have two sons I have five brothers
they're all fantastic loads of my friends are men they just don't belong in women only spaces
and the fact is that most people who commit crimes physical crimes violent sexual crimes they're
men so we need to keep them out all of them but men get pissed off when you say that what they don't
get pissed off when you say is men are bigger and stronger and faster because that is also true
and so we have single sex sports in order that exceptional women can be recognised and can
compete quite non-exceptional men can defeat all women there's a site called boysvwomen.com
if I remember correctly and it compares the performance of under 18 American boys with
world record holder women wow and in pretty much every athletic um sport of any sort
uh so not equestrian basically is almost the only um exception American under 18 boys
defeat the world record holder Olympic winner woman and meant often it's thousands of boys do
it every year so you know you're you're and those boys are good like obviously they're
they're at national standard in the US which is a very big country very good sports but they're
not exceptional they're not the world's best so if you compete if you allow men and women to
compete in the same competitions there won't be any professional women there won't be any women
who win um you'll have women ranking you know I mean if you're in a club like a running club
you might be able to imagine that the person who um you might think of as actually something
you might go to the Olympics for your country if that's a woman when she was running as a man she
might be a decent second rang small club runner and running isn't even one of the things biggest
difference in running it's about 10 to 12 percent in weightlifting it's 50 percent or more and if you
have weight in matched sizes so if you say the person is the same weight a woman of the same
physical body weight as a man will lift 30 less at the top ranks so that's why we have different
sports and if you allow men to identify as women you get just immediate absurdities so
Laurel Hubbard who is a New Zealander a man who um had been you know relatively decent weight
lifter in his youth and injured his shoulder incredibly badly some years ago like you know
really just showed his elbow nearly off you know he went to the Olympics in Tokyo for
New Zealand which has a joint team with the Pacific Islands and it's one of the sports
the Pacific Islanders do very well in his weightlifting because they have a particular body
and so the world's best women do tend to come from there and so he displaced a woman from
the Pacific Islands an 18 year old girl to go on to be on the team and the other two were
and the other two went were and from the same area he didn't he didn't get placed but there was a
young woman from a poor country who had survived domestic violence as it happened for a child who
missed out her one and only chance probably of going to the Olympics and presenting her country
bigger the man who was in his 40s who had suffered a career ending nearly injury who really wasn't
very good as a man like he wasn't even lifting a national level in New Zealand went instead
so that just shows you the incredible difference that there is between men and women and the things
it's very visible like Laurel Hubbard doesn't look like a woman of course he doesn't look like a woman
he's not a woman and he's standing there as this rather out of shape man on a podium in a local
competition and there's these girls who are two of the world's strongest women on either side
and second per place so sport gets there because men get it they don't feel like attacking them
it's so visible so absurd so absurd we are we are living in the age of the absurd i feel like
i sort of feel like we went into a parallel universe sometime around 2015 and i wish we could get
out of it again like like i used to do sensible things i used to talk about actual genuine policy
problems like this isn't a real policy problem like if the first person the first man who ever
said i feel like i'm a woman and i want to compete in women's sports have been told no no no again
no because it's so stupid don't be ridiculous go and compete with your own sex and we had never
started it would all have been fine but now all of us are having to work so hard to regain ground
that should never have been lost yeah and again these are just that these are just the high profile
examples i'm very sorry for those girls from the pacific island at least they're not locked up with
a rapist which is happening in women's prisons right now that is horrific the fact that a man
who has a criminal record can just say i feel like a woman and you know heaven is moved just so he
can be transferred into a woman's prison to be put with women who he then rapes and i understand
that there is a man who identifies as a woman he was transferred into a women's prison
and he got two women pregnant by raping them and well i mean who knows whether it was consensual
but i mean what does consensual mean in prison like they can't get away from her you know
like these are very vulnerable women i mean people often don't know this if they haven't ever looked
at it i mean i often say that the place that you see sex differences most clearly is obviously in
the labor ward um but the second place behind that where you see sex differences most clearly
is in crime or in prison right so i i know the figures for the uk and and i did look up the
figures for the us and they're not massively different i mean you imprison a whole lot more
people than we do but as a share of men and women what i'm saying for the uk holds roughly for the
us so about seven percent of people who get admitted to prison every year in this country
are women and 93 percent are men now the women overwhelmingly commit nonviolent crimes and get
short sentences so at any given time about four percent of prison are women and the rest are men
of the women i think it's about four percent again have committed any sort of violent crime of the
men it's it's god it's i think it's twenty percent or forty percent i now can't remember which
of the women it's less than a hundred committed sexual crime and overwhelmingly that's non-contact
crimes so terrible things like helping to create child porn but it's not things that make you
physically dangerous to the other people in prison with you of the men it's nineteen percent
committed sexual crimes and they were violent crimes and mostly against women so you've got
thousands and thousands of men in men's prisons who are there because they committed violent crimes
against women and a hundred women who committed nonviolent crimes not against the sort of people
who are locked up at all so you just need a few of those men to identify as women and i mean the
incentive is high like if you're going to get transferred and you're a rapist and then on top
of that you remember that almost no rapes are even reported to the police like plausibly at most one
rape in a hundred even gets as far as a trial let alone a conviction so if you look at the men who
were in prison to have proven that you know they are willing to do antisocial and illegal things
a lot of them are going to be rapists but not actually in there for rape like they raped somebody
and nobody knows so even if you say i'll keep the rapists out if you transfer any men there's a
good chance you're transferring a rapist or you're going to transfer somebody who hasn't raped yet
but given the opportunity he will and then the last thing that's worth saying about people who are
in prison is that the women are nearly all people have been victimized and far worse than the crime
they committed themselves so most women who were in prison have experienced at least one or domestic
violence sexual crime child abuse and they've been in coercive relationships with men and like often
all of those things and they are deeply vulnerable people you know they're often obviously they're
also criminals so they can be nightmares as well as very vulnerable people but they are they're very
very very vulnerable people they find the presence of men often very triggering and then you've got
these men of whom literally at any one time you know cut back i don't know 20 000 of them
already committed a serious sexual crime against a woman and a whole load more use their fists to
solve problems and that's who you think you can transfer into women's prisons insane insane and
wicked it's actually wicked it's worse than insane i agree i agree there's something really sinister
about this movement and these policies that you know trans activists are pushing and i hope
i hope that people come away from this conversation with a little bit more understanding about the
ideology that's being pushed i hope they understand that you and i are in no way homophobic we're in
no way against people living good lives but we want to be connected to reality we cannot keep
distorting reality in order to appease some fringe minority that's very aggressive and uncomfortable
to deal with and that is difficult people are facing this in all sorts of fields you know in
their workplace in all sorts of places but i think having the facts is important and i
think remembering that there is such a thing as objective reality and we need to keep ourselves
oriented to it because if we don't it could be very very dangerous and even if people think
like you know what's the harm in a bit of delusion i mean i don't think i think there's a lot of
harm and delusion actually but even if you are someone who thinks that one of the trans activists
slogans is be kind like they think that people like me are very unkind well listen to what i said
about what they're doing to children and listen to what i said about what they're doing to deeply
vulnerable women in prison moving rapists and potential rapists and unknown rapists very violent
feeling with them and ask yourself what's kind it isn't kind to go along with an ideology that
causes so much harm and that causes so much harm to very vulnerable people and that ends up with gay
kids thinking that they're meant to be the opposite sex and therefore getting sterilized
like that's a that's a human rights abuse at a major scale major medical scandal it's not
none of this is kind so i know that i sound unkind to people who desperately want reality to not be
as it is but when you lie to people about what's real you end up being deeply deeply unkind i
agree i agree and i look at it in the sense of if i'm dealing with a child sometimes you
need to be a little unkind to the child to keep them safe and that's okay in the long run that
is the kind thing to do so it's not kind to duck the difficult conversation it's very unkind like
if a child says to you you know i want to eat ice cream for every meal but be deeply unkind to let
them do it and this is so much more serious the harms are so much worse absolutely absolutely
helen where can people find your work so i have a website the helenjoice.com and i also tweet more
than i probably should at joys gender and anyone who wants to look at the critic magazine website
i have a column there it's a month magazine here in the uk and but basically if you search for me
you'll find me and i've got a lot of i've done a lot of podcast interviews by this time and you
know what i always learn from them so thank you for the concepts that you raised in this conversation
but if people want to listen to more i do have a list on my own website but anyway you can just
search for me wonderful wonderful i really recommend people check out your book i think it
really sheds a lot of light and clarity on this topic and i just want to say thank you for all
the work you are doing because it takes a lot of bravery and i really really respect that thank you
very much
