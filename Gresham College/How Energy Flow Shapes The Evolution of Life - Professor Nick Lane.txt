of life from the point of view of a bacterium. We start four billion years ago when we see
the first fossils of bacteria and they're equivocal. Are they really fossil bacteria? They look a lot
like bacteria but you could argue all afternoon about whether they really are or whether they're
just funny shapes in the rock that look like bacteria. But there's quite a lot of evidence
that suggests that there were things that were basically bacteria four billion years ago and
it's basically because they look an awful lot like bacteria today. So they've had four
billion years and they haven't really changed. They've been flatlining this whole time.
Except for one moment when we see fairly abrupt appearance of complex life. I'm not talking
about the Cambrian explosion here. I'm talking about probably a billion years before the Cambrian
explosion where we suddenly see large cells. They're called eukaryotic cells. So plants, animals,
fungi but also things like amoeba are eukaryotes. So a lot of the variation within the eukaryotic
part of the tree is at the level of single celled algae and fungi and so on. And they apparently
arose just once in four billion years and I will talk about why that might be the case
and towards the end I shall give a possible suggestion as to why it might be the case.
But the questions that I'd like to address are what kind of forces constrain the evolution of
bacteria. They appear to be constrained by something. It's not information, it's something else. It's
something perhaps to do with the structure of cells. How did complex eukaryotic cells escape
from that just once? And can we say anything from looking at life on earth about how life might be
on other planets as well? I think we probably can. So really I think perhaps the intellectual
godfather of any questions about what life is is Erwin Schrodinger, the great physicist who wrote
a famous book 75 years ago this year in fact called What is Life and really there were two
questions that he framed in that book. One of them is very familiar to most people.
It's he was the first person who talked about information really in biology. He referred to
the genome as a code script. He didn't know what it was. He didn't know it. It was even DNA. He thought
it was proteins. But he talked about a code script encoding the entire pattern of an individual's
future development and its functioning in the mature state. So it was genes that he really was
referring to even though he didn't know what they were at the time. And his book was a direct
inspiration to Watson and Crick and Rosalind Franklin and the discovery of the DNA double helix.
The other thing he talked about though was energy or specifically entropy or what he called
negative entropy or neg entropy, which is really a measure of disorder. And obviously living cells
are appear at least to be a pretty ordered state. And so he wondered, well, how do they get to be
ordered? And he realized that the genes control the order in some way. But how do they do it? In
the broadest terms, he said, well, cells are continually sucking order from the environment,
which to a biologist today is a very peculiar way of seeing the question. But he had a footnote
which helped me to understand what he was talking about. He said, if I'd been catering for physicists
alone, I should have let the discussion turn on free energy instead. Now free energy just means
energy which can do work. So it's not just heating up the environment or something. It can physically
power the kind of contractions of muscles or all kinds of things at the level of cells where your
enzymes are operating and doing a continuous powered job. So really he's saying that the
essence of biology is information and energy flow. That's putting it in more modern terms.
And energy flow, everybody has been obsessed with genes ever since Watson and Crick,
understandably so, and they provide a tremendous power of insight into biology. But they don't
provide necessarily all the answers, as I showed you with the Tree of Life. Something else is constraining
what evolution can do, which is not just in information alone. So how do cells actually work
in terms of their energy? These are mitochondria. So mitochondrias will hear later on. They were
bacteria once, and we have thousands of them in our own cells. So altogether in the human body
in the order of, well, hundreds if not thousands of trillions, whatever that number works out at,
millions of billions. These are what's called the Christi membranes. So this is where respiration
is taking place. So when we're burning food in oxygen, it's happening in these membranes deep
down inside cells. And these are around about 1 micron in diameter, and a micron is a
thousandth of a millimeter. So this is what's happening. We're stripping electrons from food,
and we're passing them to oxygen. So we have a current of electrons passing down. This is the
membrane. So this is my cheap cartoon attempt at drawing one of the Christi membranes. It's a barrier
anyway, and it's insulated. And there are various large complex proteins sitting in this, and they're
passing these electrons down, hopping down from centre to centre within these proteins. We have
what amounts to an electrical current, which is flowing from food to oxygen. And that electrical
current is powering the extrusion. These proteins are pumping protons. So protons are the charged
nuclei of hydrogen atoms. So they're very small particles across this membrane. And we end up
with what amounts to a reservoir of protons on one side of the membrane. And this is a kind of a
turbine, which is generating energy for cells. It's called the ATP synthase. So the situation
is a whole, really. It's very much like a hydroelectric dam. In concept, it's very similar. So
the protons are equivalent to the reservoir itself. The membrane is equivalent to the dam.
And the turbine, the electrical turbine, is equivalent to one of these proteins like this.
This is the ATP synthase. And it is one of the most mesmerising, unbelievable proteins, really.
I mean, it is a rotating motor. And when you start to wonder about how this kind of machinery
evolved in the first place, it does your head in. It's a marvellous thing. And I do worry about
how these things arose in the first place. And I'm going to try and give you some sense of how it
might have happened, not specifically for this protein, but the context in which it might have
arisen. But this is the ATP synthase. This is the turbine, which is driving it. So ATP,
if you're not familiar with this, is usually called the universal energy currency. You can think
of it as a kind of coin that goes in the slot machine. And the slot machine does its things.
That is an enzyme. It does a particular job. You put the coin in, it does its job, you put
another coin in, it does its job again. So this is how cells work. They're powered by machines
using effectively the currency, the ATP. So this idea that it's kind of like a hydroelectric
power scheme came from one of the most brilliant and eccentric Englishmen of the 20th century
scientists, Peter Mitchell. And he put these ideas forward initially in 1961. This is
somewhat before that. That's in the late 1940s, when he was in Cambridge, with Jennifer Moyle,
who was a lifelong collaborator. She was, in fact, a brilliant experimentalist. Mitchell
was a brilliant thinker and rather cack-handed in the lab, I'm told. And so it was Jennifer Moyle
who really did all the experiments and Mitchell who did a lot of the thinking. And Moyle herself was
brilliant. She was one of the first women to get a, actually she was not awarded a degree
in Cambridge. She didn't award degrees to women in the 1940s. But an equivalent, I don't recall
what the term is. She had been involved in cracking codes in the war and had been head of
some division, which again was very unusual for a woman to be in that position at that time.
The Nobel Prize went to Mitchell in the end by himself. There's always arguments about how these
things should be apportioned. I don't know enough about it, but I think if it were today it would
have gone to both of them. And science is really about experiments as much as it is about thinking.
It's the combination of the two. If it hadn't been for her, experiments, Mitchell's ideas would
have really come to nothing. Anyway, but Mitchell was a great thinker and he came at these questions
about how cell respiration works. From thinking about bacteria, his real question on bacteria was
how do they keep their insides different to their outsides? It's a very simple basic question
and one of those great questions that takes decades to answer. And he gave a talk in Moscow
in 1957 on the origin of life. There was a whole conference on the origin of life.
And a lot of the people who were interested in that kind of question at the time
were there, so JD Bernal and JBS Haldane. They're all communists, actually,
and they all went to Moscow and they were interested in Moscow in a materialist explanation
for the world, which is why a lot of the people who were working on those questions shared this
materialist conception. Mitchell was there and he was far from being a materialist. He was
quite kind of almost spiritualist in his outlook, but he said, I cannot consider the organism without
its environment. From a formal point of view, the two may be regarded as equivalent phases between
which dynamic contact is maintained by the membranes that separate and link them. Now,
virtually every definition of life that you will ever see is going to say, this is what an organism
is and the environment is something different. And Mitchell really here is saying that the
environment in the organism are two equivalent phases separated by a membrane. It's a very different
perception of what life is. And if you're thinking about the origin of life, then you're beginning
to think about compartments and phases and things. This kind of conception makes, to me, a lot more
sense. So it's not a satisfying definition of life, but it certainly gives you a different
perspective that on opposite sides of a membrane, which is a millionth of a millimeter in thickness,
you have two phases. One is the inside of the cell, the other is the outside of the cell. They are
different. And the only way they can be different is if you actively pumping things out or bringing
things in. And that costs energy. So how do the first cells do it? Well, you can see it.
The clue is in methane. So the cows produce massive amounts of methane. They do it because
they harvest particular types of archaea. So this represents this domain of life called
methanogens. We all have methanogens as well, especially those of you who can light your own
ffarts. So these are methanogens. And what they're doing is they're taking carbon dioxide and hydrogen
and reacting them together to make methane. And they're getting all the energy and all the carbon
that they need to grow from that reaction alone. So the methane is the waste product and it's just
farted out, I suppose. But you'll all probably be aware that if you, if we could make hydrogen
and CO2 react easily, we could solve a lot of problems in the world. So we already can split
water. We can effectively mimic photosynthesis, split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen,
which is what photosynthesis does. We can forget about the oxygen or reacted directly with the
hydrogen, but nobody's particularly interested in the hydrogen economy. It's a difficult thing
to do. If you could react the hydrogen with CO2 and make synthetic gasoline, that would solve a lot
of problems. You can strip the CO2 out of the atmosphere or at least remain a neutral state.
And you can make the entire plastics industry and all the energy and so on can be done from this
reaction. To my knowledge, nobody has succeeded in doing it in an economic way. Perhaps they have
and they're not telling us. But the cells, these methanogens, they grow from that without any energy
input at the door. So they can make it work economically. And it's interesting to wonder
how they do it. Well, the way they actually do it is they need a proton gradient across a membrane.
That's to say they're doing exactly the same thing that we do in our mitochondria. They're pumping
protons across a membrane. So on one side, they've got a high proton concentration. The other side,
they don't. And they use that not to make ATP. They do use it to make ATP, but more importantly,
they use it to power the reaction between hydrogen and carbon dioxide. And this is roughly what the
issue is. Don't worry about this. If it's going uphill, you have to put energy in. If it's going
downhill, you're getting energy out. That's really all you need to take home from this. But there's
two lines on there. And right at the top, you can see it says H-C-H-O. That's formaldehyde.
So to go from carbon dioxide to methane, you have to put energy in for the first couple of steps
to get up to formaldehyde. And then it's energetically downhill all the way. So that's the
problem. That uphill bit is the difficulty with making hydrogen react with CO2. There's a barrier
to their reaction, an energetic barrier. And what the methanogens do is they lower that barrier
and they lower it by using a proton gradient. So how do they actually do it? Well,
to think about it is a very good way to think about the origin of life.
Because these same conditions, you find them in a particular type of hydrothermal vent,
we see natural proton gradients, barriers between compartments, lots of hydrogen gas,
and CO2. And those cells live in that kind of environment even today. And so you can begin
to think, well, how would the structure of this environment begin to help? And it gives us an
insight into how they might do it and also how we might do it. So this particular type of vent,
we're only discovered about 10, 15 years ago or so. Let me just go back to that. They don't
look much like the familiar black smokers that most people have seen, belching black smoke out of
the top. I suppose you could call them white nonsmokers. There's no smoke coming out and
they carbonate limestone rocks, really, aragonite, in fact. But they are very active.
And there's no animal life around it in particular, a few fish every now and then, but they're full
of bacteria and archaea and the kind of cells that live there. And this kind of environment,
we're fairly sure, would have existed on the earlier earth as well. So the black smokers
were not so certain about, but these type of vents would certainly have been present
four billion years ago on the early earth. And they were first pointed out by this guy,
Mike Russell, who's a kind of mad geologist. He's a brilliant scientist, but he enjoys winding
people up, I think. And some of his ideas, the origin of life is a really fractured field and
people come in from the background with chemistry, for example, or a background of geology, or a
background of biology, or a background of genetics, or, you know, people come from very
different places and converge on these questions about the origin of life. So it's not surprising
that we don't agree with each other very much. Often we don't even speak the same language.
I think most people are trying to learn to speak the same language, but we can't agree
even then what the real question is, because it's a long way to go from simple chemical reactions to
a replicating cell with all of this machinery, which bit are you going to focus on? You know,
we're all interested in different aspects of really different problems, all of which goes under
this term origin of life. So Mike Russell was talking about these kind of vents 10 years before
they were actually discovered. And the language he used was the language of geochemistry.
And it was really an unfamiliar language to most chemists working on the subject,
or to the biologists. And, you know, I struggled a lot with his terms to begin with.
And then they discovered, Deb Kelly, in fact, discovered this lost city vent that I just
showed you the picture of, 10 years after he'd been talking about these vents as the best setting
for the origin of life. And suddenly he became famous, almost overnight he became famous. And
this was a photoshop job that nature did. So nature is one of the great science journals.
And they had a feature article on Mike's work and dressed him up as Erasmus, as the renaissance man.
And they called him nasance man, nasance as in the birth of life. And he built a reactor at NASA,
JPL, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to try and study these conditions. And here's a little bit
of lost city vent in the background. He made a number of predictions as to what the important
conditions were. And the key ones, really, is that they should be very rich in hydrogen gas,
which is true. And that there should be the walls of the ancient vents, not the modern ones,
but the ancient ones should have contained catalytic iron sulfur minerals. That also seems to be
true. But the main point that he was talking about is there were natural proton gradients,
because you have alkaline fluids, which really don't have many protons, they're deficient in
protons, and a relatively acidic early ocean, lots of carbon dioxide, full of protons. And so
the two were mingling inside these vents. And you would have very steep proton gradients within
the vents. We don't really know how steep, we don't know a great deal about these vents. But you
can at least imagine how it might work. Essentially what the methanogens are doing and how,
in essence, the proton concentration changes the reactivity of both hydrogen and CO2.
In alkaline fluids, hydrogen's more reactive. It wants to offload its electrons onto something else.
And in acidic conditions, CO2 is more reactive. It's going to accept the electrons because it can
accept protons to balance the charges as well. And so if you've got two channels next to each other,
the CO2 in acid conditions is going to be more receptive to picking up
electrons and protons and becoming an organic molecule. And if you have hydrogen in an alkaline
channel, it really wants to be rid of its electrons and the protons will react with the hydroxide
ions to make water, which is thermodynamically very favoured. But if they mix, then of course
you've lost that, you've lost the structure, you've lost the barrier, you don't have a pH difference
anymore and so you've lost everything. It's the structure that really matters. And it's the structure
that we have here. And these minerals that we think you would have found in these ancient vents
in which you find today in methanogens are the ion sulfur minerals. And they're semiconducting.
So you could imagine at least that the hydrogen would pass electrons onto this barrier and across the barrier
onto CO2 and that it's equivalent to a cell membrane and it's the same structure as a cell membrane
and this is how methanogens might do it. Well, you could call that a wild bit of imagination or you
could call it a hypothesis. A hypothesis I think Peter Meddewa said is a rash leap into the unknown,
but at least it's testable. That's what makes it science. And so we built a little reactor. It's a
very humble reactor really and it doesn't work very well. But we've been playing with this for a few
years now and we've decided that we need to build a better one. We need to make it smaller. We're
actually now building a microfluidic version of this, but I'm only showing you this version
for two reasons. One of them we can precipitate the right kind of minerals inside these little vent
structures here and the second one is we're trying to simulate the conditions where we have hydrogen
and alkaline fluids on the inside with a semiconducting barrier and CO2 in acidic fluids on the other
side and that that should drive the formation of organic matter. And this is formaldehyde which is
the top of that curve that I showed you a few minutes ago. This is the hard point so we're not
especially interested in formaldehyde, but if you can make that you can make anything.
And this is only two hours. So under those conditions we're seeing a substantial rise
in formaldehyde. The trouble with this is trying to keep the conditions under any form of control
and so we're trying to do it better. We've not even published that yet. So I'm not going to talk
about that, but I'd like to think what are the consequences if, big if, what I'm telling you
is true, that life started in these hydrothermal vents and they started there because the structure
of these vents favours the reaction between hydrogen and CO2, the proton gradients across
membranes or across barriers, because that's still how cells work and cells now get their hydrogen
from almost anywhere. So in photosynthesis it splits water and the hydrogen is extracted from
water and it's cobbled onto CO2 to make organic molecules, but the basic reaction is hydrogen reacting
with CO2 in oxygenic photosynthesis where the waste product is oxygen. But there's other types
of photosynthesis. You can use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor, you take the hydrogen out of it,
you leave the sulfur behind, you cobble it onto CO2 or you're growing like a methanogen in the vent,
the hydrogen is bubbling out of the ground, you simply cobble it onto CO2. Life all across
earth is based on the reaction between hydrogen and CO2. We go round eating things but we're entirely
dependent on the primary producers, the plants and the bacteria which are basically reacting
hydrogen with CO2. Hydrogen and CO2 don't react except under these rather careful conditions
where you have structure, the same kind of structure that we see in cells. So how common are
those conditions likely to be? On the early earth we think that they would have been basically all
the way across the sea floor because it's a reaction between rock and water. So this is
if you imagine this is the sea floor and then down beneath in the crust underneath the sea floor
is green rocks here of rich in minerals like olivine. So olivine is iron magnesium rich rock
mostly found in the mantle of the earth today which is why you don't see so many reactions like
this anymore but four billion years ago there wasn't really such a difference between the mantle
and the crust and so we think these reactions would happen almost everywhere. The water percolates
down to depths of five or six kilometres beneath the crust and will react with these rocks. So if
you were to take a lump of olivine and put it in a bucket of water you'd probably get one bubble
in about a week's time. It's not something you know it's not an experiment you want to do for the kids.
But at the higher temperatures and pressures down at the bottom of the sea floor it really is
bubbling with hydrogen gas. It's a pretty vigorous reaction and that's really all it takes. It's
the reaction between water and rock to produce strongly alkaline fluids rich in hydrogen gas.
It's an exothermic reaction which means it's producing heat and so these are buoyant warm
fluids which percolate back up and when they get to the sea floor they react with the waters of the
ocean and minerals in the ocean to precipitate as these vents. So the reaction between rock and water
is down below the sea floor but the vents themselves are up at the sea floor. So they should happen on
any wet rocky planet and there's actually quite a lot of lovely suggestions from across our own
solar system that they do happen. So Mars there's traces of methane thought to be traces of
methane on Mars. Where does it come from? The wishful thinkers hope it comes from life. It's possible it does
but it's more likely that it comes from exactly this same process of rocks reacting with water.
There is water on Mars still mostly frozen and mostly beneath the surface
but you're likely to produce hydrogen and methane for exactly the same reasons.
And we see on Enceladus for example or Europa which are moons, icy moons with frozen oceans but
underneath the frozen ocean on Enceladus and on Europa it seems that there is a rather large ocean,
larger than the earth's oceans and these plumes that you can see here are escaping from the surface
of Enceladus and they are very alkaline pH 10 or thereabouts and rich in hydrogen gas and methane
and so the only thing that we know of, the only geological process we know of that could produce
an ocean that was that alkaline and that rich in hydrogen would be this same process. It's called
serpentinisation but it's the reaction between olivine and water to produce a mineral called
serpentinite which is why it's called serpentinisation. So even in our own solar system there are at
least three worlds where this process is actively going on and this is really one of the places
that NASA would most like to go to, me too and it is actually also means because of the politics
of these situations that I said nobody can agree about where life actually started on earth or
what conditions so I'm giving you my partial view. NASA like this partial view because NASA
want to fly rockets to Enceladus and they need a reason why they would want to do that, a reason
that they can give I suppose rather than we just like flying rockets and that's their maybe life
on Enceladus but that means that these reasons, these ideas on the origin of life talking about
serpentinisation and hydrogen and these particular reactions is appealing at the moment to NASA.
I hope that means they might fund me but probably not. Anyway so that's within our own
that's within our own solar system. If we go further afield
there's been a real drive to discover exoplanets, planets circulating, sorry orbiting distant stars
and you know there have been projections now that there should be something in the order of tens of
billions of earth-like wet rocky planets in the Milky Way alone. So if that's true
all of these earth-like wet rocky planets should be producing the same kind of vents. Water is
basically ubiquitous. Olivene is we can detect olivene in interstellar dust it's again it's very
very common so most rocky planets would have a certain amount of fair amount of olivene in them
and CO2 again is common as a gas an atmospheric gas it's certainly in our own solar system.
So you could imagine that these same conditions would apply really on a very very wide scale
and so life starting elsewhere may be constrained by the same reasons. It may also require proton
gradients across membranes to get going because the reaction between hydrogen and CO2 is difficult
and this is a a probably probabilistically simple way of doing it. So if you were to find say a
thousand life forms in the universe you know would it be carbon based or not? Probably it would
mostly be carbon based because carbon is ubiquitous it's extremely good at the kind of complex
chemistry that needs to be done and it comes in a convenient Lego brick CO2 so you can build
large complex molecules by adding on one brick at a time. If you start with silicon you're starting
with silicon oxide sand you know don't try and build with sand you want to build with Lego so
and carbon dioxide is a Lego brick and so if you were to find a thousand different life forms I
would wager a bet that it's going to be carbon based let's say 995 times out of a thousand and
something wild and funky perhaps the rest of the times but carbon is so common so good at what
it does and so convenient in the forms in which it comes that it would be very surprising if it
wasn't carbon based but then we've already run into this constraint how do you make carbon dioxide
react with CO2? I would say we're likely to find bacteria many places throughout the universe
but what about more complex things than bacteria? I don't know how many people in this room would get
very excited if there were bacteria discovered on Mars most scientists probably would get pretty
excited about that. I don't I really honestly can we have a show of hands just out of curiosity
how many people here would be excited to find bacteria on another planet? Pretty much all of you great
would we find anything more complex than bacteria? We need to look back though and I've established
what I'm suggesting is a set of constraints that cells anywhere are going to be based on
reacting hydrogen with CO2 and to do it they're going to need proton gradients across membranes
and bacteria have remained constrained and haven't changed for four billion years in their morphology
neither have archaea so could it be that they are constrained by the way that they generate
their energy? Well I think that's probably the case and it really is John Maynard Smith was one
of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century and he was at UCL for a period
where I am so I'm I'm I think a lot of it's a great place UCL in at least in one sense
in the sense that some of the greatest thinkers and biologists of the 20th century worked there for
a while they all left and went to Cambridge or somewhere after a bit but for a while they were
all there at UCL and I think a lot of us walk around these corridors and think oh JVS Haldane
used to walk down here I'd better do something good today. So Maynard Smith was one of the great
evolutionary biologists of the 20th century and he liked calling things that shouldn't happen
an evolutionary scandal, scandalised by sex, sex really shouldn't happen, why wouldn't people not
just make clones of themselves instead and he spent a lot of his career trying to work out why sex
does happen and why most things that make clones of themselves just fall extinct after a period
and I'd like to think he never actually said that the eukaryotes were were an evolutionary
scandal but I think he would have seen it in those terms. The problem is that all complex life is
composed of this one cell type this eukaryotic cell and we I mean the fact that we all obviously
share a common ancestor because the plants and the animals if you look at their cells under a
microscope they're almost indistinguishable in the sense that they all have a nucleus they all
have lots of membrane systems called the endoplasmic reticulum for example all lysosomes they all
have mitochondria they you know you could write page after page in a textbook of things that plants
and animals have in common at the level of cells but fungi have the same things in common as well
and so does an amoeba or single celled algae and so on it's a shockingly long list and it's
quite baffling as to why that would be the case so traits like sex as well you know lots of lots
of amoeba in fact pretty much all of them are sexual it turns out for a long time we assume
they weren't because you never really caught two of them together but but but but now we know
their genomes it's funnily enough it's the genomes that give insight into these things we can see
that all the genes that are required for meiosis which is to say the the recombination part of
of sex and the cell division we find them all in amoeba we find them all in very ancient looking
cells and and there's plenty of evidence again from the genomes that they've been recombining
genes and changing the structure of the genome continuously so we know that they're sexual
even if we've never caught them at it so this is the scandal then all eukaryotic cells cells
share this long list of traits bacteria and archaea just don't do it they don't do sex for
example they they pass genes around a bit they do some recombination but they don't fuse cells
together line up whole genomes cross across genes and then separate up and you know they bacteria
just don't do that so the scandal if all of these traits and there's hundreds and hundreds of them
evolve by natural selection step by step and there's no reason to imagine that that didn't happen
and each of these small steps offered some kind of an advantage and then again there's no reason
to assume that that's not true then why is it that none of them evolve in the bacteria or the
archaea for the same reasons they really ought to but they don't so you could think of eyes as a
nice example lots of creationists say what use is half an eye but you know evolution is full of
things that most people would say was half an eye and it's exactly as natural selection would predict
there are at least 60 or 70 separate origins of morphologically complex eyes that's not quite
true as i'm putting it because a lot of them in animals share a common ancestor on some kind
of a worm that had a light sensitive spot but it's partly true in the sense that the octopus eye
for example was over here somewhere and the human eye have arrived with a camera eye essentially
independently it's convergent evolution they started from a light sensitive spot and independently
they ended up with a camera type eye there are one or two regulatory genes in common
but they independently recruited all the rest of the genes but then there are I think this is
this is eudlina an alga it's got an eye spot it's got the the same proteins light sensitive proteins
rhodopsins in that eye spot that we have in our own eyes this is even more amazing this is a
camera type eye which you can see the lens you can see the retina you can see a cornea that's in a
single cell that's a single protist eukaryotic protist the retina is composed of chloroplasts
just reused for a different purpose the lens i'm not sure what the lens is made of but the
cornea is made of mitochondria again they've just been cobbled together and used for a different
purpose but it's a camera eye inside a single cell so you know that my point is this is what
natural selection will predict that there should be multiple different types of eye in different
environments different ecological contexts different types of eye with different functioning
and we don't see the evolutionary intermediates but we see ecologically all the different types
and so we would expect to see something similar in bacteria we would expect to see some bacteria that
have something that's a bit like a nucleus or some that do something a bit like sex or that
can do phagocytosis go around and engulf cells and eat them you know these are all valuable traits
for us so why don't the bacteria do it it's not like the eye there's a there's a big difference
there in what we see around us so it really boils down to this question that i raised earlier on
what was happening down this branch of the tree of life that wasn't happening over here and it's not
to do with information because these guys trawl through all the information and and still didn't
come out with the answer and i want to make the point that it's not at the level of large plants
and animals the the real difference the real void is at the level of single cells so this is a bog
standard alga the kind of thing you'd find in any pond in in in london or anywhere else
uglina and over here is a relatively complex bacterium is actually even got a little compartment
inside it which some people have said is a bit like a nucleus it's not really the reason you can't
see it well is it's roughly to scale and so you don't need to know what most of these things are
in here to realise that this is a lot bigger and more complicated so these are the mitochondria
this is actually a chloroplast you can see the nucleus there but it's just you know it's on a different
scale the level of complexity in a single cell has gone out by orders of magnitude compared to a
relatively complex bacterium not in the biochemistry but in the in this morphological complexity
and it's kind of interesting that if you were to compare two different eukaryotic cells they
look rather similar so so this is paramecium which is a single cell protist and this is a
pancreatic asinase cell a human one again they're roughly to the same scale and you know most people
would look at them and say well they're they're kind of similar in terms of the amount of complexity
going on in them they're not a world apart but this is a single cell protist and this is part
of a multicellular organism and it's out of curiosity anyone got any idea how many genes by
genes i mean protein coding genes paramecium has any thoughts exactly twice the amount of humans
40 000 genes uh now maybe we do lots of additional regulation or maybe we're just not very much
more complicated than paramecium but the point is in by most objective measures of complexity
there is not a great world of difference between these two types of cell in terms of the number
of genes in terms of the amount of morphological complexity in terms of the basically the hard
wiring of it the real difference is between bacteria and single cell eukaryotes rather than
between single cell eukaryotes and and large multicellular organisms
so i'm going to have to rather than exploring all the possible options i'm going to tell you
what i think the answer is um otherwise we don't have we could be here all the rest of the week
um here's a group of cells that are pretty simple as eukaryotes go this is jardia jardia
causes explosive diarrhea that anybody who's been walking in the mountains in america may have
had jodial poisoning um i never had it but i i i used to when i used to go walking in the mountains
in places like that i used to be terrified that when i drank from the mountain streams i would get it
but it doesn't have any mitochondria and people thought it didn't do sex either until quite recently
when it turns out it is sexual and it turns out that it does have mitochondria too just not as we
know them uh it has uh uh organelles which derive from mitochondria called mitostomes took
this is a typical of science as well it took 25 years of probably about at least 15 research groups
around the world um not just with jardia but with with these others as well microscopyria,
trichomonas, entomebo, monocircumenoïdes these are uh cells that don't have mitochondria
and for a long time they were thought to be a kind of an evolutionary intermediate a living
fossil from very early in eukaryotic evolution that were given insight into how complex cells
evolved well it turns out they're not they're all derived they all had more or rather far more
complex ancestors in the past and they they kind of evolved down in complexity to become more
like bacteria um and so they all have mitochondria and it took 25 years of these research groups
around the world to to nail that the reason it was done in part is because half of them are parasites
and so they're a medical interest and as soon as things become a medical interest then people
are going to fund you if if people went to the funders and said these are really interesting
living fossils that might give us an insight into the early evolution of complexity uh you know
they're not going to get funded unfortunately if you say it causes explosive diarrhea where's the
checkbook um so so that's what they said they said it causes explosive diarrhea and they
they had 20 years of funding and they spent it very wisely on the early evolution of complexity
and we now know that these are actually not living fossils but highly derived and the one
thing that we can take away from it is they all had mitochondria in the past and that's
important it's important in part because mitochondria as I said at the beginning
were bacteria once and this was made famous by Lynn Margulis Margulis I should say
she she died of a stroke a couple of years ago I only met her once and and I admired her enormously
but but but she had a knack of disagreeing with everybody about everything including me
yes well that man is she was married to Carl Sagan um and they they divorced after a while
they after before she wrote her famous paper in 1967 they'd already divorced I'd love to
have heard their breakfast conversations between those two but anyway she was the person who really
nailed the idea that mitochondria were bacteria once she nailed the idea that chloroplast derived
from bacteria as well and she also argued for a long time that there were lots of other symbioses
for example with spirochetes bacteria giving rise to the cytoskeleton and the flagella and so on
nobody agrees with her about that um and she was she was you know she was very strong willed and
disagreed with most people about most things but she was bang on for these central ideas on the
origin of the eukaryotic cell and the amount of uh I suppose you call it hate mail now that she
got if you read the literature from after her paper in 1967 through into the early 70s people
did not like these ideas at all and and they wrote really unpleasant diatribes in the literature
you can understand why she became very hardened to abuse and eventually basically believed everybody
else was wrong apart from her she was asked once why uh why is she does she enjoy being
so controversial and her answer was I don't think I'm controversial I think I'm right
I'm not even sure she used the word think
so so that's Lynn Margulis and she nailed that that that that mitochondria derived from bacteria
and we still can't really agree about exactly which kind of bacteria were they but probably
something like rhodobacter that we're we're seeing there so something acquired these bacteria that
went on to become the mitochondria and again there's been no agreement about what kind of
a cell that was until quite recently and this is this is a place called Loki's castle which is
just off the coast of Norway and and a Swedish group have been trawling around in the muds underneath
there to and sequencing everything that they found in those muds so we've never even now seen what
these cells actually looked like this is what's called metagenomic reconstruction so you sequence
everything you try and piece together genomes by effectively matching the ends up uh and eventually
you you you put together the genome of these cells there's a certain amount of debate about
whether there's contamination in there but it looks broadly true and the thing which is really
surprising about it is eukaryotes are here this is another tree and right next to them
to all these so we started out with a Loki archaeota they were discovered at Loki's castle
and and since then various others have been found and they've kept going with this Norse theme so
now we've got all the Norse gods down there we've got the Odin archaeota and the Thor archaeota
and the Heimdall archaeota and so on um but the thing which is really plain is that eukaryotes
are branching right in the middle of those groups so whatever the host cell was that acquired
mitochondria was something pretty similar to this and the irony is we don't know what this looks
like we don't know what kind of a cell it was some people say it was a primitive phagocyte that
kind of tried to eat things uh other people including me say oh no it wasn't it was an autotrofe
it it used hydrogen gas i don't think we can really be very sure yet what kind of a cell it was
but it was probably basically a fairly simple cell um and so this is a this is another tree
which i think is beautiful this is from one of the most i think brilliant biologists
operating today a guy called Bill Martin he also has a knack of of winding people up
and this tree goes back to 1998 and it's remarkable for several reasons
one of them is that it's now more right than it was then so in 1998 when he put this forward
i think most people must have thought he was bonkers look down here we have two separate
origins from a hydrothermal vent these are the bacteria and the archaea um i i haven't really
gone into the details of that when i first heard him say that in 2002 i thought he was completely
bonkers i now think he was he was absolutely right i haven't really had time to go into why
they would so they share a common ancestor but down inside the vents the other thing which
is really clear on here is he has a kind of genomic merger going on um so genes from the
archaea and genes from the bacteria are fusing together here to form the eukaryotes
and this is a singular endosymbiosis this one is the chloroplasts so this is not really the
same as Lynn Margulis who had lots of these things going on in all kinds of different cell lines
this was a singular event that gave rise to eukaryotic cells and later on the acquisition
of chloroplast gave rise to plants but it didn't change anything really about the big structure
of eukaryotic evolution plants are the same type of cells that we have except with chloroplasts
added in and a vacuol but you know we're basically the same so bill has this singular origin
of complex life now a lot of people really hate this idea um and i think it's in part because
we don't really like the idea of freak accidents in science it kind of almost puts itself beyond
science you can't study statistically an accident a singularity isn't it but you can think about
it in a very productive way if this was the origin of the eukaryotic cell then it started
something like this this is the only example that we know of a bacteria living inside another
bacterial cell so there's plenty of bacteria living inside our own type of cell eukaryotic
cells but it's really rare for bacteria to be inside another bacterial cell this is not a
phagosite it didn't engulf the cell to get in there it's got a cell wall around it it's actually
a cyanobacterium and you can see the photosynthetic membranes here so we don't know what they're
doing there this actually is an old discovery this is from 1979 when they were still called
blue green algae in those days and blue green algae really refers to eukaryotes so everybody
ignored that paper for 20 years until it turned out they were actually bacteria with bacteria
inside and so this speaks more about the the whole sweep of evolution why would that make
a difference well the cells that are living inside uh they are bacteria they are cells they've
got their own agenda they want to grow they want to divide they want to there's a lovely quote from
from uh was it jack mono who who said that the dream of every cell is to become two cells
and and so that's what these guys are dreaming about in here they're thinking how am i going to
double and the way that they do it if you imagine a population of bacteria and they're all growing
frantically um and the speed at which they grow depends on the speed at which they can copy
their genome as much as anything else and so the smaller the genome is the faster they can grow
and cells that you know if they if there's something about the environment that means they
don't need this gene now it's not useful and they lose it they delete it um then they can
probably grow a little bit faster because their genome is just a little bit smaller and over a
couple of days bacteria their growth rate does depend on that kind of factor but then the
environment changes again and and and whatever it was that that gene did you need it again now and so
they they pick it up what bacteria do is they pick up genes by what's called lateral gene transfer
it's like passing loose change around they acquire it again and before you know it you're back
where you were but if you've got a same population of bacteria living inside another cell
they do the same thing they throw away genes that they don't need imagine that those genes are for
making a cell wall and you're living inside another cell and you know you don't need a cell wall for
protection inside another cell or for prevent yourself exploding with the with the difference
in pressure between the outside and inside so you lose those genes you grow a little bit faster
you come to dominate the population but so long as the cell doesn't die that you're living in you
will be all right you never need those genes again and so there's a tendency for bacterial parasites
to lose genes and to become simpler and not just not just bacterial parasites we see the same thing
with Jardier and so on and a very nice example is is Rickettsia which a few years ago people thought
were was very closely related to mitochondria it's probably not so closely related but it's still
a beautiful example it was the cause of time that wiped out the armies of Napoleon on his retreat
from Moscow and it's it's spread by these ticks and it's a bacterium here it is invading a large
eukaryotic cell I think it's actually a kidney cell and the one thing about it which stands out
is it's not a tiny genome it's around about one megabase genome and that's true for all of these
things I'm not just hand waving here this is the the range of genome sizes of free living bacteria
it goes up to around about 12 megabases now this guy T. Ryan Gregory did a lot of work on genome
sizes and down at this other end these are the the parasites and the endosymbiants and
obligate symbiants they're pretty much down at less than one megabase of DNA so just for comparison
sake we have 3000 megabases of DNA the largest bacterial genome is 12 megabases of DNA and some
large algae like eudlina are you know up to a hundred thousand megabases of DNA so we have you
know quite constrained genomes in comparison with some single cell the largest one is a thing called
amibadw which I it was mis countered it was originally 670 000 megabases it's come down to
150 000 last count but still you know it's it's very very substantially bigger than our own genome
but what happens with these bacteria that live in other cells they lose genes they become simpler
they whittle away and that's what ended up with the mitochondria all these mitochondria
that we have in millions of billions of copies they all have genomes of their own and they're passed
on down the maternal line from mother to daughter and mother to son but you know my my kids don't have
my mitochondria they have my wife's mitochondria it's a very strange arrangement that it won't go into
now what it means is that if you want to be bigger more complex and spend more energy it's not
just a case of having a larger surface area you've got a whole unit here that unit has some
genes which in some way control respiration it's got the protein building factories the ribosomes
it's a it's a unit and if you want to expand you just make more units you have more mitochondria
but it's not just that you're increasing the surface area you've got genomes with each one
and that allows you to expand up on a massive scale and the person who's I think done more on
this I again going back to to the early 1990s John Allen has been arguing that they require
genes to control respiration and you know still I would say the majority of the field is not
persuaded that he's correct he is correct I'm sure of that but you know it takes an awful long
time in science for sometimes the simplest ideas to catch on most people just don't really care
very much I'm afraid but it's the it's the difference that they can to become a very large
cell you just scale up mitochondria so this is a giant bacterium and there are a few around
and these little white dots here are the copies of the complete genome so the giant bacteria
that do exist it seems that they also need genes to control respiration and this this is the edge
of the cell and this is the plasma membrane where respiration is taking place and they have
as many as 200 000 copies of the complete genome and each genome is a normal sized bacterial genome
with three megabases of DNA in it and this is a eukaryotic cell the blue is the nucleus where
it's the main gene depot and all these little the the green spots here are the mitochondrial DNA
um so there are hundreds or thousands of copies of mitochondrial DNA so the difference between
these two cells is not that this cell has an awful lot more DNA than that cell they actually
have a similar amount it's that in that case it's got a kind of genomic symmetry there's thousands
of copies of the same genome exactly the same genome whereas here we've got one massive nuclear
genome which is supported energetically by this kind of endpoint thousands of mitochondrial
genomes which have whittled down and become smaller and smaller and more and more streamlined
so all the mitochondria effectively it gives us multi bacterial power without the bacterial overheads
and that's what allows all those overheads can go into supporting a massive nucleus with full of
genes at least it's the raw material for natural selection to operate on and so we have a kind
of genomic asymmetry and to me that's the real difference between bacteria and large complex
cells it's we've got two genomes there isn't such a thing as the human genome there are human
genomes the mitochondrial genome and the nuclear genome this is the last slide why then is complex
life so rare why did it only happen once on earth and would it only happen rarely elsewhere in the
universe there's a double there's a double bottleneck here one of them we have to get
bacterium into another bacterial type cell to break down this issue with with membranes and
scaling so you've got to have cells within cells to be able to scale up um but those cells have
their own agenda you have what's called conflict levels of selection conflict that the bacteria
inside want to grow fast and perhaps make their host cell fuse with other cells or whatever they
want to do the host cell itself wants to keep them under control and bleed off the energy but
they don't want them replicating at any old speed chances a bit going wrong is really high
and maybe this is why we don't see any surviving intermediates maybe they all died because it
was a pretty dodgy situation for a long period of time or even a short period of time it's just
that this is a long evolutionary distance and regardless of whether what i'm telling you is
right or not this long evolutionary distance there are no evolutionary intermediates that have
ever been found and so all of this complexity in this type of cell and i would like to leave you
with this thought we have no idea yet at least the difference between ideas and serious scientific
knowledge where we can say that there have been experiments done and real data how any of this
complexity of eukaryotic cells arose and if we want to understand medicine and what goes wrong in
our own bodies and we don't understand the why these parts arose in the first place what were
the evolutionary driving forces that made them evolve how can we really understand ourselves
and and medicine and if this starts out with mitochondria in a very simple cell with none of
that complexity the nice thing from my point of view is that perhaps all of this complexity arose
and the reason that we share such similar cells with with plants and with algae is not that we
were all adapting to different external environments but we all were adapting to the same
internal environment the problem of having cells living inside us and it's that that drove all of
this complexity and once it became a stable system then eukaryotes could spread out and take over
the rest of the world and with that i'd like to say thank you very much this work has been done by
many people and it's great fun having a lab with so many bright young people coming through it it's
an inspiration for me thank you very much
