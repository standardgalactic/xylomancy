LIDAR works in a similar way to radar.
It scans the ground by sending out a million laser points every four seconds
and analyzing the information reflected back.
The time it takes for each pass to break through the trees,
hit the ground and return, is measured.
The results are then mapped.
The LIDAR data renders an outline of everything on the surface of the land.
The glory of Angkor Wat becomes a ghostly outline of digital points.
But LIDAR also reveals subtle indentations on the ground,
and these reveal the shape of the original city.
Angkor Wat is shown to be surrounded by the ghostly outline of a vast metropolis.
And we can use this data to rebuild the city of Angkor,
as it would have looked over 900 years ago.
