Hello everybody. Welcome.
It's funny from up high here on
Strawberry Hill in
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
I can look down on the surface of the waters
and I can see the fishes.
Extheos.
And I need to...
I'm basically going to start this recording by making some corrections
to things I
misheard.
I'm verbal Monde de Greens if you will
listening to Amon Hillman
DC
Amon Hillman
who I was listening to just a moment ago on
Gnostic and Former Podcast.
There's so many things that
Hillman isn't saying directly
but is rather indirectly
implying and that indirection is a sign
of nuanced sophistication in my view.
Because when you just out and out declare something
part of our mind naturally recoils
from this explicit conceptual
equivalence.
And note that word equa valence.
Equivalence.
And you know I think of myself
as a little bit of a cunning linguist. A slightly cunning linguist.
And I have some
familiarity with Hebrew which introduces to me the idea
of roots and their
primacy beneath the surface
of the languages that emerge
from the strange
almost pharmacological mixing
of ideas.
Eidolon. Eidolon. Eidols.
Images.
I. Mage. Is.
Now that's the schizophrenic linguism.
The schizophrenic linguism sees that
library begins with lie and thinks it means falsehood
and probably doesn't know what brary means.
And I don't actually have any
background for that.
And a truly intelligent
person who is
suffering from and or enjoying
the schizogenesis of their
consciousness. Sometimes produced
or enhanced by drugs.
The truly intelligent
broken freeings.
What are these freeings?
They are like perhaps sheaves
or skeins.
They are
Well you know this I think was one of the Greek hypostasis
and I know enough to be dangerous but not enough
to be accurate. Ator or the belly, the
cardio or the heart.
The freeings.
What are the rest of them?
Namosini, aid me
come to my aid.
My real mother.
Freeings.
The hypostasis are a crucially important
topic introduced to me by Julian
Janes.
In his sygenic text.
Right when I say that
somebody starts playing bagpipes.
And it's the specific song
that is played in the Monty Python
skit.
Yeah with the skirted bagpipers.
What are the other hypostasis?
cardio or the freeings.
Julian Janes' sygenic book, the origins of
consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral
mind. Which title actually suggests
a kind of schizogenic
a multi-threaded
disunification
of consciousness and thought
over epochs of human history.
And in that book he argues
that our distant ancestors
and once again this is brilliant in terms of theoria, it is good for seeing
we don't have to decide whether it's factual
we can take the insight
we can filter off
the profound
iridescent
surface of the liquid
and taste it in the eye of the mind
and we will know if it is good for seeing.
Janes has a variety of theses
and brilliantly introduces
theologisms
to show us how consciousness works
after bemoaning his attempts to understand it by testing animals
and not finding what he was looking for there
in his early education.
And he certainly got some things about the hemispheres wrong but neuroscience was
early and he wasn't a neuroscientist. Really he was
a kind of a linguist and a philosopher who was
examining Homer particularly and the Greek
which Hillman likens to an instrument
that liberates you from both lies
and modernity.
He likens it to a sort of linguistic
I was going to use the term hypodermic but no he would use this other term
that I will refrain from using
which means a sexual implement
that can be used to introduce certain elixirs or dotes
poisons, antidotes
to the human body via orifices.
I need to correct something before I get too lost here
and that is that in previous videos
I spoke of
heima as if it were related to the word
hymen
and this turns out to be almost certainly
incorrect as my friend
Nate Guimont explains
and he says
which I'm sure he's copying some stuff here
but
okay
hymen joining in heima, heat, blood or technically not related
hymen means to join together hence the goddess of marriage from the proto and the European root
syomen to sew together, joiner
is also recorded in greek as I can't read the greek word
heima
he also shows the greek word blood
comes from the passive present perfect of
atho, Esmae
from proto-halenaic
I though
proto-indo-european, Hyed, Burn or Fire
cognate with Latin, Aestis
Estius and Aedis
and Sanskrit, Indhe to light
set on fire
I'm sure let's break down the etymology and meaning of hymen and heima or heima
to understand technically why they're not related hymen
meaning an origin hymen refers to a membrane specifically the vaginal membrane
or the greek god of marriage
the term comes from the greek word hymen associated with the greek god of marriage and weddings
the root of the word is traced back to proto-indo-european syomen
meaning to sew together or joiner
now I think Hillman would object and say
now you've fallen under the 19th century British
trance right P.I.E
hyma means blood in greek etymology the greek word
hyma comes from the passive present perfect of atho
meaning to burn or to be on fire this is really important
I think Hillman
would tell us amazing things about this
because whenever he speaks about burning
he's actually talking about substances
found around the orifices of initiates
and or medusae
medicine women
related concepts
the connection between fire and blood might be metaphorical relating
to the color of blood and the idea of life force
okay so these words have different roots
they have different meanings there's no overlapping concepts
between joining sewing and blood fire indicating the words developed
independently in terms of meaning and usage
in conclusion hymen and hyma are not related because they stem
from entirely different P.I.E. roots have different meanings and evolved
in different contexts within the greek language
the sound is purely coincidental this does not reflect any linguistic or etymological
connection now this is my friend
Nate
my new friend and I don't know
it looks to me like he actually composed that
this long text that he sent me regarding this
which I am deeply appreciative of because unlike an ideologue
idiot I want to be corrected when I get things wrong I want to see better
and so in this video I will announce the mistake that I made
which was a natural
mistake I spoke briefly in my video yesterday of such
linguistic mondagrens
which word usually
is a neologism referring to misheard lyrics
most famously
in the song
blinded by life
as if this weren't sophisticatedly related to the topics at hand
manfred manned earth band
has a lyric
there that is really hard to understand
but it sounds like
wrapped up like a douche into the runner in the night
blinded
and this is so Christos
in hillman's linguistic
etymological
philological
philological
traipsings
so I misheard
what hillman was saying
with these words heima
and given my
absolute fascination
here's the underlying psychic and cognitive
origins of my mondagreen
because in the labyrinthine understructure
of consciousness and particularly linguistic consciousness
there's a paris schizophrenic roiling turbulence
that
can lead us
toward insight but also
can lead us to insanity or
confusion with fusion meaning mixing unlike
things like heima and hymen
and for me there's so much here because
hillman is talking of the power
of virginal youths
in the ancient world and particularly
Greece and various
countries in what we now think of as Europe
including
Georgia, the black sea area
Italy, Sicily
perhaps though he rarely mentions it specifically
in this way, areas in the Middle East and so forth
and how there's this incredible
confusion going on between
mystery traditions, languages
pharmacon, pharmacological understanding
medicine, all sort of
really swirling around so in my own mind what's going on is
I'm thinking ah the women
who use the venoms were the origin of medicine
Medea, Medea, this med
which is actually the MD is what is important here and notice that we
omit the vowel in our own nomenclature MD
which we think means medical doctor but I think hillman would
smirk and say and you know call him a madman
be my guest, he would smirk and say nabra
these are the masters of the purple
the oysters, the dipsis
dips, what the snake venom
and it's just an
accident that medical doctor uses the two
incidences that are the root that come to us he would
claim from Medea and
who was a youth
obviously she became a woman but there were
many apparently in ancient times there were many
children
like late phase children and early phase
teens who had magical or
divinatory powers who were possessed
who inherited medical knowledge
because someone taught Medea
someone
and I don't really know where she comes from though
hillman makes some noises about this so what happened to
me is I'm thinking all these things I'm thinking
hem, blood, venoms
making drugs in the human body
with various
exudates, right, secretions of the body
the capacity to turn the body into
a pharmacy by making cuts
on the surface of the skin and wrapping these in
medicated claws containing venoms
and botanicals and the one thing I haven't
heard hillman directly say
but I think is nonetheless very likely dusts
soils
these are fundamental to many ancient cultures
ceremonies and rites
specific dusts
when I was transferred
by my friend
Ryan first diver
he gave me dust, he gave me the paint
and you know when
I was speaking about and maybe there's no evidence for this in
what he calls the primary sources but this is crucially
important because we're not talking about something that's 3 or 5
thousand years old we're talking about something that's 10
15, 30, 50,000 years old
these soils, specific soils
in the beaver bundle in the black foot
way of life there are 7
soils, there's a purple soil
there's a purple soil
and he's talking about
hillman is talking about texts
where there's purple markings
on people's faces around their eyes and so forth
he's thinking paint, he's thinking drug
he's thinking stain like wine stains the lips
and this is what probably any reference to purple
is being interpreted as because of the
bizarre and confused
inclination of moderns and christians and muslims and so forth
actually I can't speak for Islam particularly I don't know
but to reject
any idea having to do with
pharmacon the word that I usually use is
pharmacopoia which means to make
poias to make though I don't
know the actual roots so what's happening to me when I hear these words
Heima and Heiman I'm thinking of
the power, the spiritual power
of the as yet un
unsexualized youths
and as Hillman you know Hillman says that the
Greeks talk at great length particularly in Galen and perhaps in
knownness about secretions from the bodies
of youths and
the mixture of these secretions with various botanicals and poisons
but he overlooks dusts or
there's no mention in the primary sources and what I'm trying to say is
it's blatantly obvious that the paints
were absolutely crucial
in ancient indigenous cultures
and these are soils almost invariably although
the purple paint is said to come
if I recall correctly is said to come from
it might be blue but I think it's purple
I literally do to come from a specific
the feces of a specific waterfowl
which is baked and possibly mixed with other substances
so you know
Hillman loves to regale us with
the vocal music of the purple bra
the purple was in his eyes
he had he had taken the medicine
and given him the medicine
and he talks about
ocular administration he at least implies
ocular administration of substances
but you know when transfers
occur which are crucial ceremonial
initiations in Blackfoot
there's a few in the Blackfoot culture and probably in many other indigenous cultures
which I know I have no first hand knowledge of
but in the Blackfoot there are a few things that are important
that are obvious the first is
it can't be secret
it can't be entirely secret someone
has to witness the transfer has to be an observer
witness and
the second is
the paint
the stain is made in
the palm of the one who will
transfer
and then the third is the singing
now there are other things going on which are not
obvious in the superficial level
of description
and
this is very important because clearly
these ceremonies these initiatory rituals
that bring someone into a family
they are filial bondings
a person to an ancestral lineage
you can imagine like an amphitheater
but particularly
where the backside of the amphitheater is the ancestral beings
and the progenitive beings the progenitors
and the other half of the amphitheater is the future the children
the progeny now this doesn't come from Blackfoot this is my own
but also my experience because
after receiving the transfer
and I poorly you know because I'm stupid
and naive and somewhat confused and lazy
didn't understand I mean how can you understand the first time
I won't even talk about what happened to me the first time
I engaged in actual sex I'll leave that right out
but because of my incredible naivete
I didn't immediately
continue with the process
of
securing this
gift and this bond
but what happened were dreams
I will not say the specifics of the dream because I think those are sacred
and should not be spoken of but I will say that it was very clear
that ancient ancestors
were coming to check me out
they wanted to smell my sweat
they wanted to know who is this
are they worthy and what's interesting about this
when I began to study Tai Chi
very similar
thing happened right old I would have dreams where
old asian men would come in a group
in a pod and they would check me out and they would tell me straight up
we're here we heard about you you know
it was a transfer
and Tai Chi is very similar
and so the thing that I want to make clear here is this idea of transfer
is very important and exists regardless of which
culture we're looking at right that the Chinese have anything to do
with the ancient Greeks I can't answer the question
but I'm going to guess that
you know seeing okay so look this is what polymaths do
we integrate between
otherwise seemingly distinct ways of knowing
we sew them together
right as in the definition
of
hymen joining
right no who would think
hymen has a relationship to transfer
but to join families together
is a kind of sewing
in the sense of SEW rather than SOW although again
you know this SW thing is really the important
feature
and look think about what you get
if you take the W and you put the S over it
right just I know this is going to sound
mad like madness but stay with me
take the capital S and flop it over to
either side flop it backwards flop it forward so that
it's lying on its vertex
its vertex is now horizontal
put the W behind it
just try this put the W behind it
and what do you have you have a stitch
you have the joining
you have the wound of the W
annealed by the S that curve
you also have this weird
most miraculous
joining
of principles
angles and curves together
dogs and cats mating in the forest in the thunderstorm
but you have the angles and the curves
now the W and the M are often
understood as evocative of the feminine
the M
of the wisdom
the night seeing of the owls
and this word begins words like mother, matron
madia, maduse
maduzai as Hillman pronounces it
maduzai
and the W
which is of course the M inverted
wow
uh
I wonder if I can remember my alphabetics here
way
it's travel and also
to traverse
um
but it's mirroring to
you have the M
goes from the earth up to the sky
transmits energy through those points up to the sky
and the W draws energy down into the
earth
but that's a poor
uh
situation on W because it's been so long since I've tried to remember
what I was shown
when the teaching intelligences were with me
so what happened to me is
I thought Haiman
joining and Haima blood
these things obviously go together because when the Haiman is broken blood
appears right
and then the association
with feminine medicine immediately brings to mind
what we think of as stinging
and I'll bet you you're going to see
a bunch of correlations here
in the ancient Greek
purple stings
and there's a
sacred mystery in the Blackfoot origin story
of the sun and the moon
and their marriage on earth and the birth of their children
and the moon
becoming seduced by another lover which the sun
detects, excuse me, that's hilarious
de-texts, un-texted
which the sun detects the scent of
and
discovers that
Koko Makitsom
which is the Blackfoot word named for the moon
Natotsi I think is the Blackfoot name for the sun
Koko Makitsom
has been seduced by something
described as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log
and then the snake idea implies stinging
the incredible
terrifying strike, the hypodermic
instantaneous
envenomation resulting from contact with a serpent
when you see
someone or something actually bitten by a viper
or in some cases a cobra
or whatever, the strike is
like lightning
what's actually happening and people don't realize this
is that the animal is transforming time in three different ways
it's literally
manipulating a temporal manifold locally
so the first thing it's doing
that's obvious
and this is very similar in
Tai Chi or martial arts, prior to a strike
you draw energy, there's a compression
into the striking member
and then that compression is released very suddenly
a good example would be
the concept in martial arts of the one inch
punch
no chance to
gain velocity over time space
you shrink time space
and the suddenness with which the strike occurs
absolutely changes time and by the way in case it's not obvious
combat, any kind of combat
it's not, you think, oh no the seconds are all the same
no they're fucking not
combat changes time
intercourse changes time
intercourse is the establishment of a mutual
rhythmic temporal manifold between lovers
it transforms time, it changes the meaning of history in the future
the snake does, just as the venom does
just as the psychedelic does, just as dreaming does
intoxication changes time
it transforms the
not merely how many meaningful events per second are there
we go from like zero or none or very few
to suddenly seven
or fifty
the venom enters the bloodstream, it changes the meaning of a heartbeat
you see, the intoxicant enters
the metabolic body of the being changes the meaning of time
the pace
and the meaning of the tempo and the cadence
and then the venom also changes the future because it may
in many cases collapse
the entire lifespan of a being
into a few moments or hours
or, you know, in very painful situations
days
who was it, is it Paul Rosalie, the
amazon protector
he speaks of a specific snake
I can't remember what he refers to it as
euphemistically, it's like the guardian of the jungle
or something like this, the jungle's
the jungle's warrior isn't used, this isn't the right language
but it's, he implies that this is the spirit
of the jungle and when Lex Fridman
asks him, you know, so
why is this particular
creature so terrifying
and Rosalie says, well, if you get bit by this
you don't call for like
medical help, right, you call your mom
to say goodbye, you pay attention to what's around you
because these are your last few moments of being alive
and notice what he's saying there
he's saying that venom changes time
the transformed temporality and we
moderns think, oh no, you know, time is mechanical
tick tock tick tock tick tock along the clock, the clock rate of the computer
changes time, this is what we mean by
megahertz and gigahertz and things like this, we're talking about
more divisions of a second per second, mechanically
but long before there were mechanical
divisions of any kind at all, there were relational divisions
sensorial divisions
cognitive divisions, magical divisions
and when a ceremony begins
the fundamental form of time
changes
it is temporomagical
it's time magic
I don't even have a word for this
I need some kind of a neologism here
and I'm not sharp enough to forge it immediately
what's he, a designer dog?
so what I
thought of was hymenoptera, I thought of
many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log, those are bees or
wasps and why are they a snake?
because they sting
they have the sting of the snake
suddenly you're being stung, by the way you want to transform time, piss off some wasps
you're going to be transforming time in a huge way there
so I thought, ah the medicine, the venom
and the hymenoptera, the
matriarchal insect super organisms
that I've been fascinated by and stung by
throughout my life, almost died from the
transfer of venom I received
from a yellowjacket when I was 7, 8
at the ocean
and I think those things can bite or sting
and I wasn't allergic to the
venom, it was a septic problem
blood poisoning, because the yellowjackets
don't have, they externalize
their digestive system, so when they bite something they inject
digestive fluids into it
sort of externalizing their stomach and whatever they've been eating
rotten fish, dead
shellfish
bits of gelatinous
festering crab meat, whatever they've been
eating on at the ocean, that gets hypodermically injected
into your skin and in some cases that's not going to go
well and in my case it did not go well
my arm turned purple, the doctors told my parents I might die
I couldn't eat food for many, many weeks
I was in agony, but the thing is when
and this is something Medea must have known
those who trained her must have known, when a living being
invenomates you, that's a
transfer between those people and your people
if you get bitten by a rattlesnake
and you survive, the magic of their
people is in you and with that magic comes knowledge
that is adjoining
this hymen, sewing, joining together
so if the concepts
that Nate so generously
integrated are good
I have more to learn about this, but mainly I'm here to correct
what I said earlier and to explain why I was confused
and how my confusion hopefully is transforming in the direction
of insight, now
if the mosa and the muses guide me well
in my walk about
yes, when you take of a plant substance
you are joined to those beings
when you take of an animal substance you are joined to those beings
ridiculously silly idea that we have, silly for its simplicity
in English, oh you are what you eat
that's the redneck version of wisdom, now you actually
the ancestors of the beings you consume
or you encounter and have
chemical intercourse with
become a part of you, not a part
become integrated into your
being and their intelligences and their memories
and their gnosis, their seeing
becomes integrated into you as the people who think
mushrooms are the source of insight will
of air and yet how confused they are
because the spirit of insight belongs to
those specific substance
and it can be evoked or elicited
invoked, summoned
it can be
whew
it can be brought forth
with nothing more
than language
the music of speaking
yesterday when I met the brilliant painter
is his name perhaps
oh let me get it right
let me get this right
I had seen this man painting
and I asked him
if I could speak with him
because I wanted to know if he sold
his paintings, I felt so
overwhelmed by the living light in his paintings
that I wanted to have one
Joe Barlow
and so he was painting
and I very politely and delicately
inquired may I speak with you
and he just turned to me and rather sternly shook his head
and I understood
because the speaking is the end of the trance of the enchantment
but the speaking can also begin the enchantment
I saw him yesterday and spoke with him briefly
while I was making my recording
he commented on my melodious voice
and so these people who think
psychedelics are the gateway to enlightenment
they are confused
the gateway to enlightenment is passion, curiosity, wonder
the virtues
why is it that the children
the youths who have not yet
been initiated into
sexual congress, why are these the oracles
they are the oracles because
their essence
is yet unmixed
with the progenitive
anatomy
of the
processes that become the incarnation
of souls
and look I'm not
I'm not trying to defame sexuality
here at all
I'm saying that there's a virtue
there are virtues
that emerge
from the suspension
of various behaviors
the behavior of eating for a few days
and you will discover exactly what it is I'm talking about
suspend
the behavior
the behaviors associated with
the generation of orgasm
practice chastity
that the energies of our existence
transform when conserved
and they transform in ways
that are impossible to suspect
in the same way that insight obliterates
previous conception and expectation
and thought
speculation and so forth
actual insight is like
it's as if the mind of an
angel suddenly casts a ray of light
into your consciousness
dissolving its previous forms and reforging them
in beauty and veracity
the forms of truth that lie far beyond
the concept of fact
the spiritual forms of truth
and the fruits of actual virtue
are profound
there's another path where
transgression
leads to madness
and ecstasy
it's the antipodes
of two points on a hypersphere
a four dimensional sphere
where the fourth dimension
actually it's probably a seven dimensional sphere but the other dimensions are things like relation, time
the ancestors
the progeny in the future who will learn and know and remember
the
violation of structure
on one hand and the
perfect preservation
of not structure, not the bones but the marrow
the spirit of the bones on the other hand
and these are matters which we have
long forgotten and I don't know how familiar
Hillman is with them I mean he's definitely familiar with
the
vulgar side
with what we would think of as the vulgar
side definitely
but is he familiar with the side of virtue
does he understand
that
does he understand
does he understand
the power
of conservation of energies
conservation of spirit
what does he know
of the path of virtue
you know I have been
for the past few moments
with one of the sacred trees
and I heard
Hillman and the guy who runs
the Gnostic Informant podcast
and also
a young man who
they referred to as Ariel
on their podcast about
Baal and the Canaanites and so forth I think
yesterday talking about images
of people underneath trees
really of the fact that
the acacia trees
which are apparently the trees that the Ark of the Covenant has forged from
those roots contain the highest
concentration of the MT in any tree
and
but again
but again
you know
when we move toward the physical
we move toward the vulgar
and the vulgar in the sense of
um
the loss of
nuanced richness and depth
and because it
right the difference between the steam
and the water and the ice
um
the steam is reminiscent of spirit
the water of
well this is complicated
I've gotten myself into metaphoric trouble here
we could imagine
the water is reminiscent of dreaming
and the ice
is really structured
as reminiscent of
waking
the spiritual quote unquote
can sometimes be just understood as more dimensions
of meaning, awareness, seeing, relation, memory
but what I wanted to say is
yes of course you can
take a nap
beneath
the night you can go to sleep
underneath the devil's trumpet
you can take your rest underneath
the aura
and it's dusts, it's pollens
will impregnate you
like those bandages worn by the youths who cut their skin
so obviously you can
um
there are ways
to develop resistances to toxins and venoms
through constant
exposure and titration over time
right so um
I've heard stories a bit long ago
medicine women
the specific stories I heard were of the mother
of what was being referred to as the mother of vaccines
and
they presented an image of a woman in ancient
India
who would use thorns or needles
to scratch the skin of the patient
and introduce antidotes
and
drugs but also particularly like
um
she could vaccinate people by introducing extremely small
amounts of the
infective agent
through the skin scratches so that they
the patients would produce antibodies essentially
or antigens
and what Hillman is clearly
speaking of having read about
in what he calls primary sources which I believe to be primary sources
just to be clear
in practice whereby
cuts are made on the skin
and there's different things you can do
so
you can introduce intoxicants
through these scratches by wrapping them in a medicated bandage
impregnated with substances
leave aside for the moment with the origins of
those various substances may be
and you can also
uh
introduce antidotes
this way
or intoxicants right so you can introduce drugs
or possibly vaccines
or poisons and you can imagine that there was an elaborate
culture
of killing by poison
and I'm not going to try to say like look there's an explicit division between the genders
here but the men mostly killed with weapons
combat which changes time
were masters of intoxicants and poisoning
which changes time and you can imagine that if
you are for example
a harlot or a prostitute
male or female
you may have become immune
to certain venoms by the temporal
and physical titration of these venoms over time
introducing them into your bloodstream and your body
so that you are no longer subject to their toxic effects
you can then eat or drink with someone whom
you wish to kill and they will
die and you will not because the dose that
kills them is less than what will kill you
and this is a delicate and dangerous art
but it's very clearly still practiced
today in relatively exotic
locales and persons
there must be traditional
lines along which this knowledge has been
preserved and handed down, complex texts
forbidden texts
pharmacopoia
the arts of poisoning, the arts of intoxication
the arts of curing, the arts of resurrection
and so you see this concept
of joining, sewing together is all through
these topics but what I wanted to say about the trees is
yes you can sleep beneath the detour at night
when it's fragrance is
thick in the atmosphere
and wow is that fragrance thick and you can
sleep beneath it when it's dropping pollen and many trees drop pollen
again we come back to dusts
I suspect very strongly that there were pollens
that were also used curatively, toxically
and in pursuit
of euphoria
there were pollens, dusts
and soils
so you can sleep beneath a tree but there's so
many things you can do with a tree that don't require
the physical
ingestion or
introducing chemistry to your metabolism
you can have the spiritual
transfer, you can have the spiritual
communion, the spiritual inception
relation and amnesis
with nothing more than your passion
your curiosity, your wonder, your soul
your embodied soul and any of the forms in nature
the raccoon, the mouse, the snake, the tree, the living place
the mountain, the sky, the star, the planet
all of these beings are your kin
and you are their kin and the recovery
of those intimacies, results in euphoric
transportation into insight
you know I was just with a tree that I'm very close with
and I got to tell you there's no
there's no intoxicant required
to
experience communion
with the great world forest
the history, the family of the history of all the trees
and the family history of this particular tree
and all of the beings that the trees nurture and heal
rejuvenate and feed and support
these are sacred
relationships and you know you could
you could say yes well why don't you
why don't you become sexual with the spirit of the tree
it's a doable thing, I'm not going to instruct you in the process
it's a doable thing
regardless of your
experiences you can have orgasms with features of nature if that's what you want to do
and I'm not again I'm not
casting aspersions on that, what I'm trying to say is that all of the effects
that are accessible by relatively
I guess the only word I really have
is vulgar or
all of these
all of these effects
all of these transfers of knowledge and initiation
and gnosis and
amnesis
are accessible
by very subtle means and I prefer these subtle means
generally speaking it's not that I never
do it with intoxicants or something, I do
I have
rather that you want to train
your spirit
to become sophisticated
in its capacities
to bond
with the cognizia
the network of
anciently conserved intelligences prior to and embodied in nature
yeah
to travel in the connective tissue of those relationships
which I call the mimula
and that travel you will find
enlightening, provocative and profound
generative of staggering insight
that will knock you off your feet
you may think intoxicants are trippy, you have no idea what it's like
to have the sudden emergence of insight
in and as what previously you thought was your
mind while you're sober
so these are the
virtues that I
adore and recommend that I remember
that I myself pursue and have experienced
so don't be too quick
to leap toward
let's get fucked up and have
forbidden sex
there's something so much better
but vastly different
you should taste
the pure water of life and memory
which are truly your origin
before you become too fascinated
with
the liquors
and the toxins and the venoms
before you think that they have primacy
you should taste the original waters
and hopefully I have corrected my error
my Monde de Green about Haime and Haimen
but before I go I will mention one other thing
consider the Haimophiliac
consider the person or child
who if they are just scratched in the wrong way
will bleed out right quick
and the beloved child, someone beloved to me
was born with this delicate
condition
think about the nature of time and how time is changed
by this condition
the brightness, the redness, the fire
consider this matter
for there
is one sight
that I will leave here undisclosed
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning and seeing
and speaking and traveling together
in search of insight and amnesis, wonder and beauty
again very soon
may your path be blessed
and joyful
rejuvenative and healing
and may you find
not merely that which you most desire
but that which is most beneficial for your path
and relationships
thank you for joining me
I look forward to our further adventures
and to learning and remembering together again
very soon, bye bye for now
