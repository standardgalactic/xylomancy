hello everybody welcome been listening to Danny Jones interviewing Neil from
not performant can't recall his last name at the moment like Sunniak Sennlach
fairly interesting and this is obviously one of the things that's going on with
Danny's podcast at the moment concrete is that clearly he's exploring the world
around Oman Hillman and so a lot of Neil has a lot of interesting historical
perspective and information he Neil is an autodidact he was not educated like
me right he's a self-educating person he follows his passions and his interests
and he became interested in these topics through what he called studying his
way out of Christianity which is very interesting thing to say and there's a
lot of good information Neil is very supportive of Oman's classic classic
his Greek scholarship and one of the things that Neil says is that most of
the people that are attacking Oman's perspectives I will call them just
basically attack it from the place of will know the you know the the agreed
upon knowledge right the consensus by the way that's basically just like
saying with the numbers with the census and this is the ad popular ad populace
rhetorical fallacy well most people think who gives a flying poop storm what
most people think let's be really clear if we go with generalities and
generalizations we're only going to miss everything important because what
will be overlooked is everything that everything that opposes popular
consensus and in our situation with the moderns the educational level of the
common people if we take you know if we how would I put this if we adulterate
the pool with the entire scope of the numbers we're going to find and we got
to include people who are sold their memory doesn't work yet we also have
to include children and stuff who have no formal education speak of or not much
yeah so if we dilute the numbers with the common people what you get is
basically just stupidity like bald bold inveterate ignorance which you can see
very commonly in the United States in our political situation you have two
species of catastrophic stupidity you know assembling golems in public to
war against each other for the sake of what who has nothing to do with running
a country I'll put it that way it has a lot to do with lining pockets and
sustaining lineages of socio-political economic war prison you know power
backroom power exchanges the currying of favor and favor trading and so on which
is the opposite of what a democracy should be about in any case one of the
things that was bothering me is that both Neil and Danny with all due respect
Danny is catastrophically naive about anything relating to spirituality I'm
pretty sure he's an atheist and it's you know Danny asks Neil if he's
religious and he just says anything but so Neil is also hopefully my wind
buffer is gonna work here I did test it a bit so Neil is also what I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna say he's an atheist as far as I can tell he's anti-metaphysical
he doesn't believe there's anything like souls or spirits or gods or diamonds or
angels or anything and you know I'm reminded of experts on fishing who've
never held a rod and this analogy turns out to be really important here in all
kinds of ways they've never seen a fish they live in the desert they don't
believe in fishes fishes are a story the crazy people tell and the crazy people
are so insane that these desert dwellers and these aren't like the Bedouins who
actually have wisdom and stuff these are idiots these are people who live in a
world of their own suppositions having no experience of the things that they
speak of this is what I was talking about in my recording about knowledge and
writing and the problem that that produces it also produces amazing
possibilities of learning in the exchange of the transfer of knowledge on a
broader scope than person to person by song and oral tradition and transfer
that's true it does do that but it comes with very lethal dangers and
historically the humans tend to ignore the dangers of their new technologies and
then what happens is the structures of power the under structure the sort of
malignant under structures of power and wealth and rape and torture and lying
and you know not the good kind of lying not not the aurea no no the kind of
lying that leads to the immiseration of thousands or millions of people over
epochs of time that kind of lying this all gets supported by this process so
what we have here are people you know I can't really speak much about Danny
Jones and it's not my intent to insult him or to be disrespectful but it's clear
by just from listening to him he sounds like an 11 year old kid knowing
absolutely nothing about the topic and look he's interviewed a good I don't know
what his numbers are but a good probably you know 500 or a thousand people very
deep minds you know very rich intelligences strangely his own
intellect appears largely immune these intelligences and I find it tragic this
is the problem with the claim of knowledge right these people are talking
I don't care what they believe and they're welcome to believe whatever they
like or disbelieve whatever they like they're talking about things they have
no experience of just like people in the desert who make up stories and say you
know those people who say there's a there's these people in the West right
and they say that you can go to the end of the world and if you go there you
will see the great water that fills the whole horizon those people are insane
it's not possible for there to be great waters like that there's no chance of it
being true water as far as you can see to the horizon all the way around you
those people are doing those are drunkards and silly people they're just
making shit up right which is effectively what they're saying they're
saying you know Neil studies the origins of religion we might call it and he's
an interesting cat and he's he has a lot of name-based date-based place-based
you know he's got this sort of like you see on those detective shows right where
you there's a wall where all of the sort of major players and situations and the
timeline is there and there's a web of red threads between all the stuff you
know Neil's mind is a bit like this which is super cool I mean for all its
worth in terms of trying to understand
classicism what happened in the ancient world how did where did we get you know
did the Masoretic text come before the Greek Septuagint or vice versa and why
and so forth and Neil's defending Amin primarily by saying that his detractors
cite consensus well the consensus is obviously that Masoretic text precedes
the Greek but when you look at the actual numbers at least from some of the
people that Neil has been interviewing some of whom are lifelong scholars of
these matters they're not trivial idiots you know who these aren't political
theorists okay who I think try you know nope it's nothing like that these are
people who spent their entire lifetime studying in the archives and in
universities and all around the world some of them are probably even in the
Vatican libraries which must be catastrophically astonishing many of
these people think that we should ask questions about the texts and their
origins so he's defending some of what Amin is saying and also by saying that
the people who are trying you know by saying that that the people who are
trying to refute Amin are not citing much they're really just saying well
the consensus has long been particularly if you see on YouTube there's some
ridiculously titled video Amin Hillman debunked well what a load of bullshit
that is there's no debunking of arm first of all you can't debunk a human being
let's just be really clear Amin Hillman exists so you know the text is
already stupidifying Lee the video is already stupidifying Lee titled just
insane can't debunk a human being Amin Hillman debunked what it was what are
you debunking you're debunking your own intelligence in language
so what you can debunk is a claim not a human being it's really clear about that
that little 10-minute video can't recall don't even care to recall the name of the
guy who obviously a friend of Dan McClellan's who has his panties in a
bunch about Hillman and I would argue doesn't even understand has no chance
of understanding what Hillman's doing because what Hillman is doing isn't
history of religion it's related it's related and it it in it has an influence
in that domain but what Hillman's doing is what Hillman's doing is magical it's
not scholarly there is features of it that are academic and scholarly he's
drawing on his education as a classicist and his fascinations particularly
with ancient Greek Galen known as others
everywhere's machines in the park the gardens driving machines around in any
case what Hillman is doing is initiatory it's he's time traveling he's it's like
he's opening up a window to a lost world inside himself he's opening up this
window this portal if you will and he's transporting us back he's giving us a
must be must be a word for this where your where you are in time is flipped
around in exchange for another place in time that's what Hillman is up to in his
paramaniacal dissertations on the Bible and the origin the actual origins of
what's in the Bible particularly the New Testament but not merely that and you
know Hillman's been accused of various kinds of nefarious activities I don't
know what the verity of those activities might be you know basically he was
specifically accused apparently by some feature of the Catholic Church of
summoning demons and quote opening portals unquote he's definitely opening
portals and if he's summoning diamonds it's not the thing like oh be all's above
you know come give me power it's not what's going on at all he's trying to
understand trying to see what the origins of the often absurdly ridiculous
things we believe in modernity where how did we get the stupid he's trying to
understand the history of these situations which are mysteries and when he
uses the word history he doesn't mean a record of what happened he means to
inquire of those with actual knowledge intimate knowledge the kind of knowledge
you have of your lover's mouth when you kiss them that kind of knowledge the kind
of knowledge you have of a fruit when you eat it that kind of knowledge direct
somatic visceral spiritual originary experience not thinking not opinions not
ideas and he doesn't give a flying fuck about consensus nothing does not care in
fact he will blatantly declare that this consensus thing is completely
delusional nothing there at all he often yells he will yell out everything you
think all those thoughts you have all those ideas all those stuff you've been
taught all of that nonsense and then he'll he'll go off camera and you'll
hear spanking sounds now look nobody has to nobody has to authorize Hillman right
you don't have to bow to him he's not running around saying worship me I am the
truth in the light what he's saying is if you want a taste of the ancient world
that's much more like what was almost certainly going on than what you've been
told we will go together using the ancient Greek as a vehicle of travel
travel in what travel in pneumatic on in the front in the freaks travel in the
strands the threads the tributaries of our own origins our minds our consciousness
our souls the spectral body the soma pneumatic on the Greeks he will he will spin
that up and take us far beyond anything we've ever been exposed to for those who
want to go it's an opt-in thing he's not telling the world what to believe or
the scholars but he will openly laugh at them and you know piss in their faces
happily joyfully playfully because what they've been trained to think they're
doing the same kind of thing that they like to accuse him of they're very
selectively picking certain senses of certain words that match up not with
history not with the consensus of primary sources which consensus Hillman may
well authorize no they are doing the same thing they're presumed they're
excluding what they don't want to hear you know quote you know why did Hillman
have to exclude all references to recreational drugs from his dissertation
when that was you know when the use of drugs by the Romans was probably the
primary focus of his district his phd dissertation right why was he told to
exclude these because it was said by the gatekeepers of the institution the
Romans would not do this what what the Romans were doing this of course they
were doing this we do this every people who have ever lived have done this and
what is this we use in toxicants and sometimes psychedelics and other
kind of sedatives and other things and not all of us but if you experience
anesthesia in the surgery this is what he's talking about
so his detractors are doing the same thing they're they're promoting specific
senses of words in Greek and or Hebrew and they are ignoring the senses that
don't agree with their pre-existing narratives and biases many of which are
ridiculously
it's the right word mcdonnellized jack in the bible
eyes
so frankly i uh i think it's weird when people like Danny opine on religious
topics or metaphysical topics if Danny has i don't know his whole history right
i don't pay a lot of attention to him but if he has any direct experience of
metaphysical the world outside what you are thinking with your
representational cognition which let's face it is 99% of the universe
i mean 0.999 right like basically everything isn't what you like to think
is the truth of reality you know of what that which is we might call it all that is
is and Danny's over there trying to think his way through that good luck Dan
you're using the fingernail of your pinky for something that needs to become the palm of your
hand and replace your representational cognition for you to understand it in other words you know
they're literally arguing about people being possessed and laughing about it him and Neil
neither of whom apparently believe in possession which i think is hilarious because
uh clearly almond hat it it seems very clear to me and i'd love to ask him questions about this
but if almond himself has not experienced various kinds of possession particularly by his muse
the uh the dead girl he talks about when he says he has a cheat in the sacred in the in the um
the podcast by quote the sacred speaks unquote when he talks about this dead girl who resurrects
the ancients before him one by one so that he may inquire directly of them
if he's not experiencing something resembling possession i'd love to know what it is that
he is experiencing and these two young men who know nothing of what they're talking about apparently
and by the way you know you can disbelieve something to such a degree that it either
kills you or blinds you right in the same way that you can believe something to such a degree
that it kills you or blinds you you can disbelieve that food is nourishing and die of intonation
right you can disbelieve that you need water you don't need water dead you know 34 days later
if not sooner um you can say there's no objective evidence for love that's just
something people made up to amuse themselves okay you won't have any experience of love
there are certain features of being human and i would argue that many if not most of the features
of being human are like this where if you decide that they don't exist you becoming capable of
participating in them right and unless something comes and overwhelms
your blatant ignorance your it's a word i'm looking for that i can't quite find
unless something comes and just overwhelms you right and takes you over which by the way is
pretty much and i'm not recommending the use of psychedelic drugs here but that's what happens
when one does psychedelic drugs you don't either nothing happens which is what happened to me the
first eight or nine times i smoked weed nothing nothing happened similarly um my friend alan
steinfeld when we were talking the other day he was like you know the first time i looked at a
television it was just incoherent i couldn't tell what the hell that was or what was going on there
or and he's right it's because the form of our cognition this idea that um the crazy people have
that what your mind reveals to you is what's what exists and what it doesn't reveal doesn't exist
that is impossible there's no chance of that being true because what actually happens is that the
mind reforges its own anatomy in order to reveal or occlude features of potential relation history
future possibility and if the mind has never taken on a particular form before it doesn't know what to
do with the information and so it may generate literally it may just knock you out
i've had direct experience of this with things that other people think are completely ordinary
and happen all the time your first experience of eating food with your mouth that wasn't just milk
was probably like this your first experience of standing up was like this my first experiences
of relation you know erotic relation with women in my teens were so like this that it was like
going to another universe so this idea that you're the arbiter of identity function situation
circumstance and you just declare you know what's happening and what's isn't
you can go ahead and play the game of consciousness that way neil danie go ahead be my guest you're
going to miss out on most of what it means to be human and from your weird little isolated castle
or your dungeon of naivete you're going to make ex cathedra declarations that you think
you know other people are just um either having us on or they're good actors i mean this is what
the left hemisphere would say about everything that it doesn't originate grip control um
and also anything that would threaten its supremacy and consciousness and by the left
hemisphere what do i really mean i don't mean uh the left cerebral hemisphere what i mean is um
certain features that we know have an intimate relation with that hemisphere from having done
experiments with stroke victims and from having done the water the water test uh where we anesthetize
one of the hemispheres and we ask the person questions and we can talk to them later about
their experiences and so forth we know that there are faculties from which okay there are
faculties that representational cognition relies fundamentally upon and these faculties are tyrannical
you can see them in actual tyrants you can see them all spun up in people like uh mr trump
and other tyrannical nightmarish folks from history who probably need not be named here
so there's this aspect again it's like the the fingernail on the on your pinky or the the tip
of your pinky screaming at the rest of the hand you don't exist i have never seen a ghost there's
no such thing as possession i mean that's the hilarious irony is these people who say there's
no such thing as possession okay really because you are possessed by an array of faculties that
are declaring that and you are unaware of your possession and think that what you have is the
antithesis or opposite of possession when there's no chance that's true no chance the irony here is
10 miles thick you're possessed by a tiny little array of your cognitive faculties a little tiny
island an archipelago in consciousness and that archipelago is saying many things it's not from
around here doesn't exist those other islands have ocean stuff like that's not no it's not there
there is no boatman boats are a fantasy dreaming thing you know um
some of very close to me last night was arguing fiercely that romantic love was just an invention
made up by poets you know that everyone decided was a good idea afterwards he's not entirely wrong
but neither is he correct because the mind can reforge its anatomy
and under some circumstances that can be extrinsically not exactly forced but very forcefully
catalyzed right um and so this is really important to understand if you are a person like Danny or
Neil who thinks they know things about what it means to be human what's real and what's not real
you don't you're wrong you're using you're using the point it's like you're using one book in a
library or one angle um of a sphere to determine what is true real good veritable trustworthy
and so forth you know alan steinfeld who i recently did a beginning interview with um
spoke about his first experience with a trans channel and he he said in the interview
you know i met this this man and i thought okay either a he is psychotic
b he's a really really good actor or c and this is this is the voice of the left hemispheres
incredible doubt and skepticism or c maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe he said maybe like
12 times maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe there's something going on here that i don't
understand and then later alan was alan's a very intelligent well educated person
and then uh so
so then later he was at a performance where this actually i can't remember if i think it's a woman
who is the channel and she channels an ancient warrior uh his name is something like romp rampha
something like this i can't it was very this channel is very famous one of the first trans channels
he was at a performance the the channel picked him out of the audience pointed him
he very reluctantly so i said you mean me right like you you're talking to me and then the channel
said yes in very elaborate ancient pre-shakesperean english right said yes my beloved you you know
and um yeah alan had a full-on suddenly very very rapidly the whole tablood changed
he said that the theater filled with a kind of uh i'm paraphrasing here like a glowing mist
and he rose kind of out of his body and they embraced and he had this experience unlike
anything he'd ever had before and you know you can argue whatever you like ah hypnosis you know
blah blah i wasn't there i didn't see that it's just here say go ahead be my guest right you can
argue the same thing about the flavor of food right the experience of the you're not seeing red
that's just you know blah blah blah make up any noises you like you can make all the face noises
you want and you can have all of the critical left hemispheric refutations be my guest you're
welcome to have them you're wrong you're just dead wrong you're missing the thing you're using
to determine what is real is only useful in a very very tiny scope of human experience nature
being thought awareness consciousness um all these things very tiny scope
it's very useful if you want to tell is that hot hot or cold very useful there you know
know how many coins are in my pocket very useful there
beyond its applicable scope that those faculties are lethal to understanding
they crucify it they basically just rip out its organs and spray them on the wall
so if you think that you know what's going on based on your rationality you not only don't
know what's going on you're like a bird that thinks only this one feather on my wing on my
you know my left wing or in this case my right wing because birds are similarly lateralized to us
only this one feather can i trust which guess what that means
that means that you will never fly and you're a bird you're born to be sky born
all right you're born for the the wind to just lift you up
into the atmosphere into the sunlight in to dance with the clouds
this is what you're born for and you're really focused on this one feather you're like well
i've never seen anything you know inclined me to believe blah blah blah blah okay good luck
and everybody's you know lots of us start out there the problem is some of us finish there
and i have my own biases and perspectives i too can i've experienced delusion
i've also experienced manic insight mantic insight
um paranoia grandiosity yes yes i've had these experiences and of course we want to be protected
from them we don't want to we don't want our buffers so permeable that anything gets in and
that's part of why rationality reigns supreme is because we're really afraid of the the contagion
of madness okay i get it but there's other approaches that allow us to explore
our nature our origin our intelligences our creativity our participatory
transcendence and this is very crucial that we have these experiences so we
we need a buffer against you know having the membrane completely ruined
by nonsense which is conceivable
but we still need a trustworthy and worthy array of incitements
um maps teachers mentors and perhaps daimons to lead us
be you know out of the prison-eering cage of mere rationality that's it for now
more soon thank you for joining me may your paths be beautiful and your relationships loving
and your dreams amazing bye bye for now
