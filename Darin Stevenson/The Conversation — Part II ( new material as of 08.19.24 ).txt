Yeah, all right, so when I was a kid I became aware at some point, I don't know
what age, that there was something horrifyingly wrong with the adults in
how they thought and how they related with me as a being and with their, what
they would do, especially if they were forming an accusation like you did
something wrong, this kind of thing. And it took me a long time to realize and it
took me much, much longer to be able to articulate it. There was a catastrophic
problem in the systems they were using to ascribe or derive identity, function,
and outcome, like or cause, like cause and effect, right, especially where it came
to human beings, me particularly as a child. And I realized there's something
horrifyingly wrong in their minds and eventually this was so terrifying that
me and a few of my friends made a deal with each other when we were 11, that if
any of us made it to 30, the others would come and take us out so that we would
not be subject to this because we didn't want to live like the adults around us,
we knew they were fucking broken in their minds, even though we loved them. And
they seemed like gods because they could do things like have jobs and buy cars
and, you know, repair things or build things or all these things. And so I made
a vow to myself as a child that I would somehow remember what it was like to be
a child, even if I became subject to the strange thing that had destroyed the
minds of all the adults around us, and particularly our teachers, even though
they were a little bit better. And occasionally you'd meet someone who was
a little bit outside of the problem and the people I looked to primarily for
that were science fiction authors. So yeah, these three things. How adults
perceive and treat identity, particularly in children and or, you know, mothers,
women, whatever, the softer beings, we might say, how they treated cause and
effect and what they thought of as what something was for, like why it is or
its function. And these three things, they're out of their fucking minds,
like they're just completely batshit insane. They're using systems that are
not human that we didn't develop. We inherited this shit when we were born.
They inherited it from their insane parents and we just keep passing it down
to our children. It's a fucking nightmare. It's literally like it makes our world
hell and it makes it impossible for us to survive.
Yeah. And so...
You were talking about how it's just so, so please run by that again.
Yeah. I mean, we're sitting in the middle of it where we're looking at computers
that are connected to infrastructure that people are glued to on a daily basis.
We're sitting in homes that were built not for love or appreciation of life,
but for profit. And I mean, that's everything. I mean, literally not a day goes by in this
city where I'm not constantly just carrying cars around and around and around in this grid-like
system. It just... Most of the world is paved if you go outside. Cars own most of the terrain out
there and they will kill you right now with impunity. They're not human. They're not beings.
They're just machines running around. I just have to say, never in the history of nature
was there ever an object, even one time, that would just run right over you,
especially with a being inside it, right? When deer's freeze in the headlights,
and he was like, why don't they get out the fuck out the way? The humans are actually the stupid
animal there because the deer knows something that's fundamentally evolutionarily sound,
which is if you stop, no creature is just going to bash the fuck into you and kill you, right?
If you stop, the other creature will be able to go around you. This is not what happens in cars.
What happens in cars is if you stop, you get killed, right? You have to get the fuck out of
the way of the car because the car is doing something that nothing in nature does with the
possible exception of a boulder rolling down a mountainside. But even that, at least that thing
is predictable, kind of. But that's something that's trying to hit you, right? You could get in the
way of, for example, a herd of buffalo and you'd be in bad shape because that thing can't go around
you, can't really stop. Yeah, and also just looking at garages and seeing how the part of,
a major part of the home is for the car to be safe and sound. Yeah, not only that,
what those cars, if you look and you see, if you look at a city block, it's like a cell
surrounded by viruses of enormous size, right? You know, like in the Princess Bride, they have
those mice of an rat of enormous size or whatever, right? But we have our viruses of enormous size
and they're called cars and the cars are literally draining the lifeblood out of the people inside
the buildings to pay for the insurance and the fucking repairs and the sparking and the tickets
and the fucking registration and the gas and all these things. And so it's really like you have a
demon outside that's sucking your life out of you. And most of the time it's just sitting there.
And by the way, I want to ask you a really interesting question about cognition and identity.
And the question is, what is a car when you're not using it?
It is just a hollow space that sits there.
Because it's not a vehicle, right? So what is it? Because when you're not driving it and
it's not transporting you, I would argue that its identity changes into something completely
different. We don't even talk, we never talk about this, right? We just think, no, it's a car
because that's the category of object that it belongs to. What do you think? You use this stool
as a table more than use it as a stool. Absolutely, I do. And that's a very simplistic answer. But
if my phone's battery were to die, this would just be a brick. I would honestly suck. I would hate
to lug this thing around if it wasn't so capable of doing things in my life. So yeah, that is a
very good point. Because most of the time the car is just sitting there unless what, you're an Uber
driver or you know, you're a taxi driver or whatever. Well, I lived out of my car. Yeah, sure, that could
be a home. Yeah, and it was more than a vehicle. It probably wasn't designed to be a home. I would
gather, I would guess that it's probably fairly toxic inside that thing in terms of chemistry,
but I haven't done the testing. Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of plastic. A lot of plastic and glue and
stuff. A lot of heat that goes into there. Right, there's a lot of off-gassing and rubber and foam
and things. Who knows what that carpet's made of? Yeah. The upholstery isn't leather, so what the
fuck is that? You know, like, molecularly, it's got to be weird. Well, I've had the fortune of
living in nature for extended periods of time for very little expense.
And I can tell you, well, first of all, it was painful because it provides so much space for
this kind of conversation to come up. It's like, wow, I really can see with new eyes
how I've been living my life and how disconnected from it. It's like deprogramming happens
within the first three days of just being in nature and having done that for two months
by the end of it. My nervous system was dreading coming back to the city. Like, really, like deep
pits in my stomach. And I told myself, you know, I don't want to go back and I'm going to do what I
can to get out of it, but here I am back in the city and I'm already thinking, okay, so I got to
get a place and how much was rent and I got to get a job and am I going to like the job and how am
I going to socialize and it's like, holy shit, I'm sucked back into it immediately. It's natural
because I'm used to thinking about these things, but my eyes have been open to a different way of
living and it's not going to be the same. I can't be in a house without just analyzing how ridiculous
it is to be in all the objects that are around and yeah. Okay, so I just want to take this back.
Sure. Hold your bookmark. Your thought if you've got something good. Yeah. You got a bookmark? Yeah.
So what we were talking about is I was saying that what we inherit, that what, okay,
so what is running? I had nightmares back when I was badly hurt. I would start dreaming that
I'm on a bus and I would suddenly realize that there was some kind of fundamental problem and I
would turn terrifyingly to look at the driver and it'd be nothing in the driver's seat and I realized
like, oh, we are fucked because you can't stop the bus. You can't steer the bus. It's just going
to take you whatever the fuck is what there's a ghost. It's the absence of a human that is sitting
in the driver's seat and this is what is driving our fucking societies, our civilizations, our
cultures. It's not a human. It's not even a monster. It's worse than a monster. It's the abject
absence of humanity and we think and treat these processes as if they are persons. We think like
if Google says like, oh, we're really sorry about what happened to you, there's no thing there to
be sorry. There's no sorryness. There's no senses. There's no emotion. A corporation doesn't have a
mind. It's not a person. A government doesn't have a mind. It's not a person. They will kill
everything. They will kill your children. They will eat them up. They will carve them up and feed
them to dogs. It doesn't matter. Like they don't care. There's nothing there to care. And so what
we're actually faced with is that our social systems, the infrastructure that we inherit when
we're born is modern humans. It's not merely malignant. It's actively zero-sum game theoretically
despises life and what it feeds on is habit, fear, and money essentially, these three things.
And so we're in this weird situation where the sclerosis in the history of human thought and
behavior is what's running. It's like the scar tissue, the dead cancerous scar tissue is what's
running our culture and our corporations and what we call governments. And we think of this as
civilization, which is just mind blowing. So far we haven't been able to invent anything that can
now compete it, but it should be relatively easy to do so, I think. Well, that perfectly segues
into where I was going. So I've had that dream many times of being in the backseat of a car
and realizing that no one's driving. And surprisingly, it's navigating traffic,
but it's fucking terrifying. I'm swiping past stop signs and I eventually get into the driver's
seat and I slam on the brakes and it doesn't work. I love in dreams when I hit the brakes and nothing
happens. That's one of my favorite things. Yeah, me too. It's exhilarating. That's actually how I
feel most of the time in waking life. The brakes in the car work. The brakes on civilization don't
work at all. There's no way to stop. Yeah, go ahead. Well, and when I break myself, that's when I,
you know, anyway. Another dream that I had when I was little was arguably one of the scariest
dreams I've ever had. I was in a completely white void and there was a red line that extended
infinitely in one direction and infinitely in the other. And it didn't matter which direction I went
because it was essentially going to be the same and I had to choose. It was like, you have to choose
which way you're going to go and you're going to be walking that line forever. And essentially,
what you're saying is there's no choice criteria or? There was sort of a sense between future and
past. Okay. And so that really, I relate to that in a way because I think, okay, I agree, the scar
tissue system that's going on. There are people who I've met who think that we can progressively
change the system to a better future. And then there's me who's had a taste of what it's like
to be out in nature. And that feels more like going back into the past of like, you know,
sloughing off the technology and just saying, okay, let's sloughing off the electronics and the,
you know, and just going back to more indigenous ways of thinking if we could even recover such a
thing. Anyway, my point is, there was that choice in that dream of go to the future and go to the
past. And that scared the shit out of me until I realized that if you just step out of that paradigm
out of that dualistic thing, there's got to be another way of living where it's not simply just
go back to the land and you know, this is where I don't know. This is what I'm still trying to figure
out because I think there's so much beauty with relating in the land and eating, growing your
own food and having smaller communities. But that's what we were doing before. And something much
bigger, you know, call it greed, call it fear, whatever we did as humanity to stomp that out
and colonize and fear, I have a feeling that will happen again. If we just go back to the land,
unless something changes, and I don't know what that would be. Did I articulate that?
That was good. There's so much there. You know, I'm reminded of various things that I heard Eric
Weinstein talking about this afternoon as I was listening to him attempting to explain to somebody
who I thought was pretty dense why they should be afraid about artificial intelligence and what it
does or why they should realize that we're a dead species walking since the first guy said,
huh, I wonder if there's these things called neutrons. And why Eric, who is Jewish, talks about
Passover because Passover isn't a celebration. Passover is the active reenactment of the
remembrance of get the fuck out of here now so that we can survive long enough to have children
again, that kind of thing, or something like that in Eric Weinstein's mind. In any case,
he was talking, I thought this was so amazing, because the host, who I think is very dense,
was saying, this is the most exciting time to be here. I love being alive right now. It's amazing.
There's all these amazing things happening and Eric's going like, you are broken in your mind,
my friend. I love you and everything, but you're not awake. Did you say that? Yeah, essentially.
Yeah, I cannot imagine feeling that unless you're living a very privileged life at the moment, Eric.
Well, the guy's a comedian, so that has something to do with it, perhaps. Eric is like,
I think we've underestimated comedians. They're at least on par with philosophers,
and they'd be better. But what Eric said was, I visited this place called something like
Encounter Beach, and I'm thinking like, this is where humans encounter beings from the sky,
and it's going to be amazing. He was like, this is where the indigenous people first encountered
the colonizing people. And I want you to think, because they probably thought that was an amazing
time to be alive. This is just amazing, these beautiful humans in these giant vessels from
who knows where, right? They've come, and we're going to be together, and they're going to give
us blankets in smallpox and kill our fucking children, and they just massacre us on moss and
bury us in graves that aren't even... I mean, they'll just burn our bodies, and they're going to
assassinate the entire species of bison. They're going to kill all the bears. They're going to kill
the jaguars and the fucking bobcats and everything that moves, they're just going to kill it.
And they're not going to stop there. They're going to go after the fucking frogs and the toads
and the salamanders and the spiders, and they're going to spray DDT. And then when they're not
going to stop there, they're going to go from there to roundup. They're not going to stop there,
they're going to build nuclear weapons. They're not going to stop there, they're going to do
neutron bombs that only kill the organisms and don't leave any radiation. So you get to have
just the only you know the dead sterilized sterilized space there's no
fucking bacteria even there anymore right it's just dead space and so it
sounds like there isn't just no driver it sounds like there is a killing machine
that is just stabbing you it's the absence of everything that could be
human that is literally driving the processes that own our species at the
group level just as if you were in a fucking cage yeah that's just own it
completely own it and weirdly what's happening is there's this spiral this
this exponential process of spiralizing recursive recolonization so that our
and a lot of my friends aren't really concerned like I don't really care of
Facebook fucking learn shit about me or Google yeah fucking stuff I used to play
whatever I don't fucking care they'll give me out the bad we're trying to answer
better you know like I'm only gonna do with it and I'm like oh my fucking god
are you you have like two near arms left in your heart like what are you even
thinking sedated pig in a cave if you can be psychographized you can be
directly manipulated and not only okay even if you yourself right suppose that
you or I we decide like okay zero electronic communication from now on
nothing ever in my the rest of my life no more cell phone no more internet no
more computer the problem is they'll psychographize your friends and don't
manipulate your friends and unless you're gonna be an absolute isolate and
live entirely by yourself which is the complete opposite of what human the
human animal is for we are for communal nature right we are hot animals like
dolphins or bonobos or not necessarily like chimpanzees those things are a
little nuts but yeah we are we're more like the the whales and the bonobos and
stuff we thrive and need tightly knit small group intimacy in my view from
from everything I'm going about yeah well and that's the thing it's like I
really thought I was gonna have to go the hermit route and I I felt enough
isolation to know how bad that stings and how dull it feels it's an understatement
okay can I just say a little bit about your situation please I know that you're
struggling and you're trying to understand like where what do I do now
where do I go how do I make this work and what I want to suggest to you and I
want you to think about it over time enough answer right now or whatever we
can get on with the sort of little the fun talk we're having now and what I
want to suggest you is a hybrid existence where you're neither okay there's
alone time there's symbiotic time in nature and there's city time and there's
communal time and you just orbit around just like you've been doing and you
don't have to bind to any specific that's a really powerful perspective and
that's something I definitely I love the idea of just choose one which is how
about the virus of its own exactly I'm one thing mine but I'm thinking to it
quite a bit one thing my my son you think one thing think one thing think one
thing true one thing good one thing the way only one thing way one thing way it
help you is that from a movie no I made that you made that up toy maker fucked me
up about that it's like you guys have this one thing problem with it actually
Alfred Korzybski calls it single valued thinking yeah well it plagues me to
this day it still eats my inside it fucks me up too but at least I'm aware of
it right we can talk about it once we have nomenclature and we can agree to
help each other see beyond then we've got the chance of getting a sort of a
superposition above what we normally happens to us for sure well certainly in
my in my time spent alone when that has been a positive thing for me it's it's
really bloomed so much insight and so much direction in my life but then it
proceeds by okay I need to go find people who think like me or at least I can
talk to you about this and we can just start getting the ball rolling in some
way and I've met a lot of people who really care about the state of the
moment and I bet they don't know what to do they don't know what to do and I've
never met anyone who says I see the whole picture I know how everything is
going if I see Ken Wilbur hmm you just need to meet Ken Wilbur bro I don't know
he's got the whole thing yeah we got to talk to that guy Ken is Ken is the man
yeah and but but I do see lots of different perspectives that join
together are very powerful and so there are there are people who are working on
this issue in their own way
which phone is recording that one
we're just having a little private joke there yeah go ahead
yeah I I and I'm excited because it's really the thing I care about the most
is the state of the world at the moment how could I not I mean I want I want life
to continue and you know maybe actually I'm not gonna go there cuz I feel like
that's dangerous no no go well okay now that you yeah let's go okay um in my
spiritual journey I've spent a lot of time
zooming out zooming out beyond myself and sort of altruistically loving other
beings and I've spent a lot of time in scenarios I'm just like oh what would I
do to save another being's life and there are so many scenarios which I would
give my life for proliferation of beauty and I can't say oh well these are the
scenarios in which I would do it these are some areas I wouldn't but there's
very one thing might yeah but there are there I just know that they exist yeah
and that willingness to die for I say beauty but you know just it's something
like meaning yeah meaningful so here's the thing we we're all trying to avoid
death very furiously we have these like houses that are fucking dead inside so
we're protected from death right there's nothing moving in here which is a lesson
that my friend's dog Hado taught me as he watched those leaves outside my window
moving in the wind and he was like glued to them for like dear life the way a
diver is glued to oxygen there's not one fucking thing moving in my house that's
alive right right and the Hado is alive which by the way is the Masaru
emotos the spirit of water is called Hado which is how the dog gets his name in
any case oh yes beauty all right so we're really trying to preserve our lives
we don't realize but you start to realize as you get older and death starts
getting closer you start realizing like why have I been protecting this thing
that is supposed to be given up for something beautiful and amazing and
profound right and I think in a way that Kevin would love love to hear me
saying this you know we have this model of Jesus which Oman Hillman would
completely attack but we also have this model of Socrates who gave up his life
right rather than be devoid divided from his from his
companions and symbi and children and elders and I mean he was an elder by
this time and he was accused of impiety because he proposed that even the gods
were subject to truth right and so that there was a principle was higher than
the gods and this is a very complex story so I'm gonna skip over that and
just say something really simple as you get older you begin to realize that a
life is something that should be given for the sake of beauty and virtue and
and verity and insight and love and you know maybe even truth and it's it's fucking miserable
find yourself an end of your life not having given for that having just bought
into fear or whatever or just protected the fuck out of the thing well and
that's the thing it's like I've had enough privilege in my life and safety to
know what it's like to be like okay all my basic needs are met but god damn am I
starving for meaning like oh my god do I need and even go into the hierarchy of
needs or whatever it's right there by the way that's stolen from the blackfoot
people and completely misinterpreted is it yeah like Ryan and his and his elder
Alan Alan part is one of no Narciss Ryan and Narciss used to go around the
universe use and tell the story of how what is his name the hierarchy of needs
guy it's like it's not have law that's like it'll come to me but yeah how that
guy essentially wrote that right after hanging out with blackfoot people and
having basically misinterpreted the foundational principles that orient their
way of life and of course you know commodifying it and turning it into a
system right but anyway yes well the theory and still works so the the yeah
that that meaning and mazlo mazlo mazlo hierarchy needs yeah that's right I'm
just gonna mention Ryan first diver and Narciss blood yeah go ahead okay well
it's pretty much it no no it's not I mean you're trying to say is something
okay can I can sure re spark you sure here all right we're trying to say is
I've had these realizations yeah and I'm trying to find people like myself and
I'm finding some people but nobody really knows what to do nobody's got a plan
number one and what's the next right well personally now I'm back to a stage
where it's like I need to get my basic needs man like I need to restabilize and
have like some sort of system of getting food and shelter consistently because I've
been on the road so long and then once doing that I I really will be in that
search again right now I'm kind of doing both at the same time okay and so yeah I
mean I I have you in my life which is incredible and vice versa right and now
I know so many people who care about this issue even if they have different
ways of going about it it's true and I'm very interested mention the community
in Oakland right right where they called can't cool can't cool can't cool
farms okay and where where is the farm where you were recently involved I don't
know if that should be mentioned yeah I don't know I don't know I feel like I'm
not a good representative for those groups that's we're not asking to be
representative it's just plugging the other people who are listening might
know might be able to find that path but it's okay well I will say canicle
farms is very accessible they have a website and these are intention there
people oriented toward intentional community right and what food sovereignty
mm-hmm and living together on the land to some degree I would look at their
website I think they can speak themselves yeah and so anyway and it's not
just that it's it's people I've met on the road who and I'm very interested in
bridging learning how to solve conflicts within people's own bottle bodily
psychical systems and also between people I really love doing that I've had I've
been doing it my entire life I've been doing it poorly for most of my entire
life but really giving it hard but now that I'm in touch with my own heart and
I'm learning yeah I just that that's that's what really calls to me so that's
sort of the role that that's the North Star I'm following at the moment you know
it's like how how can I learn to help people connect to their themselves and
take care of themselves and also how can I help connect people who would be good
to be connected together that's brilliant I absolutely believe in that path and
celebrate that motivation that orientation which I think is natural to
rescue each other to go pull the thorns pull the the stabbing paint like the
voodoo pins that have been placed in the people we love just like slide those
gently out and then throw them away right so that person is like have a
meaningful living situation and interiority can heal and their bodies
can heal and their psyches can heal and all this and I absolutely love and
respect that motivation at the same time and I've got you know a nine nine
vector view right not a one vector but we both know that the humans have
reached critical mass in terms of their technology and so this is part of what
Eric was saying that he couldn't get his host to understand is that that happened
1930 we're just a dead species walking and blah blah blah now I'm I'm a bit you
know I'm a talented deem singer because I'm really concerned about so I I love
the humans I'm not a miss and throw but the humans at the group level are
fucking terrifying absence of I don't even know what to call it it's it makes
nightmares look happy and joyful but I'm an anthropologist I love the humans but
much more than being an anthropologist I'm a guy a file I love the earth I just
believe in the earth to an unimaginable degree and a biofile I love the
organisms to me the organisms and the earth and the humans are the same thing
so if you harm the organisms you harm the earth you harm the history and
future of life on earth you harm the humans right you can't get away with
speciesism or valuing one thing over the other much there are exceptions right
again in a nine-vector view you can focus on vectors where one thing is more
important because of X but it seems to me that our desire to rescue individual
humans to be medicinal to them won't matter if the context collapses for sure
so here's one of the things that happens at least to males I don't I can't
speak for females they can speak for themselves they can determine whether
this happens to them I would love to hear from females about this by the way
this kind of noise is a very selfish thing in any case
sometime around adolescence we there's this great book by Larry Niven called
protector and I'm not going to go into a story right now this is one of my very
favorite books along with I'm going to mention a couple of others
macroscope what if the stars are God's Dalgren and one or two other what about
speaker for the dead oh yeah speaker for the dead is amazing unfortunately
Orson Scott Carr is kind of a bad human being but yeah some of his books are nuts
I'm the whole Andrews game trilogy is or you know series is very amazing so what
happens to us and I don't think there's enough talk about this is that if we are
altruistically oriented and many of us are I just have to mention mentioned
Lucius Shepard's unusual science fiction author that I adore who wrote life
during wartime and other books okay so what happens is we start to have the
desire of protecting things and this may happen to us before we become
adolescents you might want to protect your little sister or your little brother
or your even your older brother or your older sister you might want to protect
your family there's this very intrinsic to the masculine protect the beings
feeling and what happens in adolescence or at least what happened to me is that
that feeling became so many problems here so one of the problems is this I
suspected until fairly recently it was impossible to think as a human being or
as a male of quote the world quote there was no such thing as the world which
you knew about or the people you lived with and the place in which you lived
and that was it in a duly squad about China or South America or anything like
that right there's just sort of this fog on the border exactly right the world was
our place and we were the people not a people the people we were the people if
you if you look at indigenous culture in every single one of them they like we
are the people really yeah and the and the origin story is about where the
people us where we come from not where all humans come from where we come and
that mountain over there and this river over here and that lake over there those
are the the delimiters of the world right when so what I have heard other I've
heard indigenous cultures through people who are indigenous and also are people
who people who have that lineage and also museums they talk about people from
the stars they talk about dogon people for example do that I just I have a
hard time believing that they think that they are the only people and maybe it
can be interpreted by that could be an interpretation of their words but that's
really sitting there robust cosmology and also their relationship with the land
it's hard for me to I don't know but I do want to challenge that great yeah I
don't know either and I think I'm glad you challenged that please always feel
free to do that our conversations I want to learn and see better I know there's a
lot of evidence for people thinking okay let me just ask you a question sure can
you imagine the situation in which a given group of humans decides and enacts
this decision that any other humans that come kill the last question do not talk
with them if they come who killed you imagine a reason for that and can you
imagine that going on I mean I can imagine only if there's like some sort
of precedent there where it's like okay that didn't go so well last couple times
oh yeah but maybe like like before having met anyone previously not so much not
so much so I basically try to understand this question at some point and I'm not
claiming that I my insight was profound or whatever oh well sorry I don't think of
one if they had some sort of predetermined instruction like we are
the chosen people and like the Jews I sorry I don't know just just like some
sort of like if their culture said like we are amazing because of X and then
people who don't have X I would be like gotta go bud you're out of here there's
something dangerous about you yeah yeah and by the way when I say the Jews what
I mean is the monotheistically religious Jews who as a cult believe that they are
the people chosen of Yahweh and that the other people don't really matter or
wrong or whatever only those people who believe that and I think a lot of
religions have that right like I've heard yeah oh yeah the Islamic people not
the Islamic people Islamic fundamentalists literally believe that you
must kill the infidels those are just not even people right so feel free to set
that down or whatever it feels good it's a nice size book excellent yeah I mean
you can even you know because it's perfect for that purpose just clear yeah
there you go yeah take the smartphone and the book protected by Larry I mean
put them together and use them to shield your genitalia against any harmful
influences that it's literally called protect it really is literally called
that so I'm gonna go a couple places here the first is there's a really good
reason to kill any humans that come there's lots of good reasons you can
have visionary knowledge about what's going on in the outside world beyond
your people imagine that you are people who has visionary knowledge and you can
see what's going on in the modern world and modern people can fucking have a
serious to you and they're fucking missionaries and they're filled with
diseases in their mind and their body that will kill all your children forever
right and then if you have a flying fuck about you and they will bring cameras
and they will bring tape recorders and they will bring cell phones and they
will bring money and they will bring every fucking lethal thing will
obliterate your people forever so what you have visionary knowledge of this
because you you do either you have rituals that create visionary experience
in in your shamans or your mothers or the children right or nine other things
right you take visionary drugs or whatever so you know you actually can
see what's going on in the outside world and you know that any fucking there are
zero emissaries from that they're gonna be okay if they don't have the mud
diseases in their mind they have the diseases in their body if they don't have
the disease in their body they have the technology they're not the technology
they have nine other fuck they have religion right it's just a billion
things that will kill your future so you kill every single person that tries to
enter the boundary of your land right no matter what at all costs right if it's
if they kill 50 of your men you don't care you all your men you'll give them
all right to just take that people out make sure they don't get in there so
when I realized that that was mind-blowing and we're talking about
protector and protection but what I want to say is that for most of human
history it was impossible to think about the world and whether what I said
about we are the only people or whatever is true that doesn't so much matter but
there's all kinds of amazing stories about that in anthropology about like
what happens when other people come I want to specifically mention Edmund
Carpenter the two book the book they became what they beheld which is an
absolutely terrifying archaeological amazing weird book here's the problem
when I was late 17 I started to have the transformation of the urge to protect
that went from the people that I loved to nature herself and the world and then
I realized oh shit nuclear weapons and then the full weight of what that
actually means began to catastrophically infect my psyche and I realized
that the entire history and future of life on earth is sitting on a button that
can be pushed not by a human being but by processes that are not human they are
not answerable to any authority they have no responsibility they have no
obligation to life they don't fucking care and then I have panic disorder for
eight years every time I heard a jet I just thought is this the fucking moment
when everything dies and I knew that there was nothing I could personally do
to affect it and so you can see that like the cognizium of a single human
their psyche their mind their awareness of consciousness is subject to these
existential threats from without and at a certain age males undergo this process
where the the protection should be extended or would normally extend to
what they consider the whole whatever that whole might be is it my people right
is it my family but whatever the whole is and in my case because I'm a modern
it's like the war it's the everything right it's all the beings it's the
spiders and the ants and the bees and the drafts and the octopuses and the
pregnancies and you know the whales and the dolphins and they're slaughtering the
fucking whales for what they're they're obliterating the oceans they're fucking
burning down the rainforest make soybeans for soy milk because being
vegan is really good right being vegan is awesome so let's burn down the fucking
Amazon so we can plant soybeans to make soy milk for vegans right I mean like
what the actual fuck is going on on this planet any intelligent life form
would look at what's going on here and just go like that is a dumpster fire of
clusterfucks of the worst shit we could never even imagine like what the fuck
actually happened to our planet and I will argue that what happened is that we
were disconnected from the library of intelligences that would otherwise
mediate and sit in the driver's seat of the bus and here we began talking about
how cars were viruses yeah yeah and so you saying all of that leads into where I
was going which is even if even if we're doomed I'm still yes yeah me too like
we're gonna save each other I'm gonna care for the people I love no matter
what the hell is coming we're gonna act with integrity and altruistic awe and
respect and adoration for not just the people we love but even the people we
don't know and everyone and everything for always no matter what happens we're
gonna keep doing that and yet if we can't heal our species somehow if we
can't introduce something that can outcompete what I call thrips which are
these dead inside malignant processes that run us the sclerotic tissue in the
network of human minds that becomes corporations and governments shit like
that colonization and recursive interior recolonization which is going on
through like electronic media and shit like that now we've got to address both
things we can't just do one if we if we love one child then we have to make a
world for them that is worth living in and for and I also feel like I know you
can speak for yourself about this I suspect you'll agree with me I feel an
obligation to the history of beings like every being that ever had a dream every
being that ever suffered in a prison every being that ever unjustly suffered
malignments from humans and let's let's be really clear 97% of the problem
around here is just humans being bad to each other or the world there's no it's
not clear to me that the universe or time space is infected with a bad thing
it's not clear to me that that's true the humans something's wrong with us yeah
it's like a mixture of having free will that is so powerful and just completely
going off track with it only at the group level I mean there are very rarely
okay what I think about the individual humans that are fiercely bad like
serial killers or serial rapists or whatever those people are usually they
are concentrating the toxicity in the water of human culture right so that
stuff becomes highly concentrated that human absorbs it in a way is kind of
heroic in a sense they're still what they're doing is evil right sort of so
to speak whether but if we could use them to trace back the origins and then
resolve them at those origins then that that person by being by doing those
things would give us the antidote we don't do that we punish the person but
that's a bad person get that guy put them in jail punish them it's an
accounting game this is banking they did the blah blah blah blah so they have to
pay the blah blah blah and we all end up paying and then and then more of those
people spawn because we didn't solve the fucking problem in our culture right so
just it just exacerbates the whole fucking mess yeah yeah and so a part of
so my at some point in my childhood it's all a blur but I think I can remember a
point it was quite young I just went to sleep I just like checked out wow and I
was on autopilot for forever I mean I it was like my nervous system had had
enough and I totally just relied on instinct like I don't know I don't want
to say yeah anyway no tell the story I mean just it's so important that you
tell the story because you don't know how many people have the same story yeah
they need to hear you tell the story there was just no conceivable way and of
course I wasn't thinking this consciously but retroactively I can see how
this occurred it was like there was no I was powerless and I was no longer able
to think or feel that I could get what I wanted which was in a certain form and
encouragement a certain form I just checked out and it I just went through
life with these processes that I learned how to survive like chameleoning in
groups so I talked to someone and I figure out what they want what they like
and I become that thing that they desire so that they like me in return and it's
it's like a gross mimicry of what I actually wanted but it was as close as I
could get and so manipulation in a lot of ways was the easiest path for me to
get some semblance of what I was looking for and it was unconscious because I
was like my nervous system was activated I I was desperately pining for
something that I needed that was so fundamental and I had lost sight that I
was even missing it and I was in your body after a certain point becomes so
tired from that nervous system activation that it's just you're dying
you're in the process of dying while trying to live and I had many breaking
points but there was a turning point in 2022 where I came back online and I was
like oh I can go a different direction I can do this I can get myself out of
these loops and that coming online that that recognizing my unconscious
patterns and making efforts to love myself and find peace within was fucking
brutal it still is why so why because habits the more you do it and
the more comfortable you get and especially when they're linked to your
security and safety and everything you know about the world they there's not
a lot of incentive there unless you've hit rock bottom enough time which was
the case for me and again this is my story which I've heard many people tell
similar stories so I know it's it's good one but yeah we're for quite some time
suicidal oh yeah yeah very nice so talk about that talk about what that felt
like what was going on well it just it didn't make sense to live anymore it was
like I look around the world and it's as if I'm just it's like I'm staring at
one of those AI generated images where you cannot tell what the fuck you're
looking at yeah that's like 19 fingers yeah and is whatever you make up and
there's some faint semblance that there was life there but you've tried to claw
it so many times and it just hasn't worked and it's just what was fundamentally
missing from your common experience that would nourish you enough to want to keep
living or what was missing that was so horrifying to be without you no longer
wanted to continue I would say meaning was was probably the big one but I
wouldn't have labeled it as meaning back then I don't I honestly don't even know
what I probably would have said something like video games are getting
boring like why why can't I just you know why why is it that my pining for
sex and constant validation even when it works it isn't filling this void
inside okay that's really profound could it be that I just want to ask this
question this is something I think about a lot could it have something to do with
with the fact that there were no authentic meaningful roles for you to
enact and embody and identify with absolutely there was there was a point
I was such a I loved being creative as a kid I loved making videos I loved
playing Legos and making stories and there was so much joy to be had there
but then just through school and through socialization I was like oh okay
everyone is going in this direction this is where the people are going I gotta go
there that's where the people go and and it was knowing that college was up
ahead and being like I had the story like oh college is how I get money and
money is fucking the best thing ever everyone's talking about money we love
money it's pure liberty yeah you are watch yourself suffocate in a bowl of
pure liberty called money but yeah go ahead and throughout my childhood I was
able to get what I wanted very easily and if it was not just handed to me I
would whine and beg and I never stole I that was that was something that kind of
unfortunate yeah I don't know I wasn't much of a stealer as a kid I was a thief
but but I was able to get what I wanted and everything was hand I could get
okay I wanted for nothing material but there was another dimension of myself
that was absolutely like impoverished right yeah that that definitely is true
and I and I use the get what I want game to because it was fun it was fun to
strive after something and know that I would probably eventually get it and
just I'm gonna get I'm gonna get it get I got it and now it's like okay what's
the next thing after I've enjoyed it for yeah yeah I watched a friend a very
close friend become capable of earning a lot of money and then he became like a
novelty addict right I want the better food I want the better girl I want the
what can I buy next right and it was not there was nothing about that that was
fulfilling for him yeah so this is why I come back to the idea of a deeply
meaningful role I'm actually having a bit of deja vu at the moment because this
is so primordial for humans this is what the indigenous cultures have that we
don't have right or that it's not it's not really true we can you can build a
deeply meaningful role in this culture and you seem to be on to sort of the
recipe which is like something like or resembles anyway either it's like one of
my really intelligent friends Cindy Gale she used to advise companies about how
to have how to humanize their relationships with their employees vendors
and contractors so that it became she was like humanizing corporations right
and that was rewarding for a time but she's fundamentally healer and most of
us I think who ache for this kind of role we we naturally want so much there's so
much trouble here because it's a bridge role it's a bridging role and so
eventually what happens is we just become bridge people I'm Ryan first
diverse a bridge person he bridges like the rattlesnakes the animals the
blackfoot people the white people all these bridges but I'm losing my train
of thought what I'm trying to get at is we ache for roles that are meaningful in
ways that defy the impoverishment of the cultures in which we are brought up
we ache for roles that are meaningful in the ways that they defy the
impoverishments of the cultures in which we are brought up right and so it would be
natural that a role that you come into life to fill would be one where you know
there's a gap in that role yeah what you're saying yes but also like you want
to be a department manager do you okay you want to sell shoes I don't okay do
you want to be a stage magician that sounds like it would be fun but I don't
why not because I've done enough fun think jobs like that things like that to
know that I don't know maybe maybe I don't know maybe a stage magician would be
really satisfying for a long time or it could transform into something beautiful
and I just say to you yeah that I know enough about you to know that you would
find stage you would find illusion interesting for about six months at
most and then you would find it absolutely soul crushing because it's just a
bunch of gimmicks right and you and you are not a gimmicky person you used to
be a gimmicky person for sure right you were using gimmicks as a way to survive
in human culture which was alienating to your soul for sure right and that's why
I think you may have been suicidal yeah well especially since I didn't have
breaks like I was like oh I it just means because I didn't have any sort of
self-love or appreciation I like I was like I'm just not good enough and so I
just have to keep digging this hole like I just have to manipulate harder get
what I want harder but that the thing is it was tearing up inside so I couldn't
even bring myself to do that if that makes sort of sense like like I really
want for example if I wanted the pepperoni pizza at the store and no longer
could I conjure up some sort of illusion to make it just like I knew that the
the only thing I could do was punch the clerk to get it but I couldn't bring
myself to punching the clerk and so I just suffered that's very strange
analogy it's a strange analogy yeah because you could charm the clerk not
when you're I mean but once all the life and love is like out of here yeah it's
what sucks it out it was it seemed like a function of time honestly it just
seemed like I was withering away I was running against the same wall over and
over again what's the wall thinking that I'm about to get what I want you know
what you want isn't really what you wanted right the wrong kinds of want
right and then how did that shift um well eventually if you don't kill
yourself okay for me if I you know since I didn't obviously kill myself you did
undergo death and I did I'm but my body's still kicking around yeah I went
to sleep again but this was a different sleep I don't know if you stay up for
24 hours eventually you're probably just gonna walk out your bodies are just
gonna shut down that's okay and so I just did the college thing and I was
depressed I kept myself afloat with video games and girls age range started
college right out of high school and as I recall you didn't actually know complete
and he's sort of learning curriculum and found a way to well you tell the story
yeah well this is gonna be any future employee you know I I didn't
study I didn't put any effort I just use the same gimmicks that I used in high
school to pass high school but it was just more challenging and I never cheated
on any tests I never like whip my phone out secretly it was purely like what
mnemonics what uh-huh well honestly most of it was just paying attention in
class and regurgitating I really didn't have to put in effort you know but I
didn't learn I can't tell you half the shit and I think that's a common
experience but all I would do I barely even I stopped taking notes after
freshman year I would just scribble unless it was a math class where you were
dependent on knowing the procedure and that's the thing I love those math
classes calculus is a fucking blast I love wow yeah you really this is the
first time you've laid up in a long time in the discussion just now there's
suddenly a spark in your eye you say calculus and I'm like this is
one of these is boys over here because he's just like calculus and calculus was
was the class that I put I did my homework and I was excited to do my
homework that's so funny because I think I actually don't know anything formal
about calculus but from what I've come to understand as an outsider if you
don't know calculus it's over for you you've got nothing yeah if you have
calculus like of all the intellectual tools of humans that have they've ever
invented they're like spoken language and there's like calculus I'm gonna have
that you're done you did got nothing I can't see why that would be the case but
I believe it based on my my love of it so but but outside of that I mean I
really just paid attention class held it in you know sealed the lid and then
barfed it over the paper and wow and then so girls video games and then a
little bit of calculus calculus some drugs okay drugs what kind of drugs it
was just weed okay weed and then I love that girls video games calculus weed and
mnemonics and methods to get you through tasks and that was so crushing I mean that
was truly it was like oh I'm probably gonna go medical school so whoa I can't
wait for this guy to become a doctor that's gonna be amazing oh and that's a
thing it's like as soon as I graduated 20 pounds underweight and like you know
what was your weight like 140 okay I'm 170 now your height five somewhere
between 510 and 511 okay anyway yeah I I was like no fucking way am I going
through medical school I liked the idea because I think in a similar way I like
calculus I would like the procedure and the intense focus mm-hmm I would at least
the idea of it and I've watched enough surgeries in real life to know that I
love being operating room whoa that's so crazy oh my god and I think I really
would enjoy surgery hmm but I don't think it would be meaningful and I listen
to that's a surgeon right yeah I listen to a nervous surgeon talk about how
he was just he wasn't solving people's problems he was just sort of fixing
parts of their body that were broken and a lot of them would come back the people
who healed were people who had fixed their diet and like changed their lifestyle
orientation wow conducive to healthy living and it was the people who just
didn't give a shit about their bodies that you know the surgery either was
neutral or it didn't help them or help them for a bit relapsed and so I'm not
I'm he I'm not doing a great job of describing it but essentially what I got
from his testimony was like he wasn't doing the healing that he wanted to be
walk us through the transformation and the rise and fall right the sort of I'm
sorry to climbing up and then I crashed down right that leads you from suicide to
and by the way are we cool right now are you okay yeah I've done the work right
I've done the work now I'm gonna grab a little bit more of this but keep
talking and bring us I'll be able to hear you bring us through that
transformation okay well I'll start where we left off so I graduated college and I
pretty much I would talk to teachers and I would basically be like yeah that was
cool yeah these are my future plans but I knew in my heart I wasn't going there I
had to figure something out and so I did seasonal work for a couple years and it
was better because anytime my life got bad I would just think oh I don't have
to do homework ever again fuck yeah I'm a free person I can I can do hilarious
because jobs right right right yeah and but I was not giving my I was still
largely unconscious I mean I was still wait yeah so I was working my seasonal
jobs very unhappy but at least I was out in the world and I was recovering from
college I was putting on weight and I was active I worked a physically demanding
job and so I was getting exercise and it was really bad for my body but it's
better than just sitting in a chair all day what was the physically demanding
job it was working it was just moving driving trucks and being on boats and
moving luggage and food all sorts of just heavy things propane operating
cranes it was it was a fun job but I was very unhappy as a person so even even in
a really fun setting and then I did and then that winter I worked the night shift
mountain and so now after a summer of you know getting to physical health and
then overworking myself I was up in the mountains at night very socially
isolated smoking a lot of pot and that was when I first feel like I came online
again I had the space to I mean just spending that much time alone forces you
to confront your own thoughts at a certain point and a lot of us run away
and they'll do anything to go go go go go because they there's a part of us that
knows that when we give our psyche the space it will start to try to heal itself
and start to try to unravel yeah it may sort of what would I how would I put this
okay give me a moment sure it will redirect our behavior our habits well I
will cause us to draw into question our common habits and particularly those
habits that we use for deflection right to distract ourselves to go in any other
direction but then inside to tell ourselves stories to you know use the
maxims that are you know like just you know just one day at a time or whatever
the fucking maxim is not that one day at a time is about maximum go ahead with
it yeah and so one of the I mean there were many things it's never just one
thing but one of the main things was taking accountability for my choices
and for the way that I was treating people and for the way that I was feeling
I was a big one the way I was feeling taking accountability for how I was
feeling what do you mean by say more about how you think of taking
accountability the reason I ask that is I have kind of a problem with this idea
of accounting that's that's fair go ahead that's fair help me out for me it's
less about the words and more about the feeling and so that's probably we're
interested it is accepting accepting how we feel and realizing that when we point
the finger at others and say hey you're making me mad we are giving up our our
freedom in a way we are we are saying you control how I feel which I don't
believe is true I think the way that we feel is is certainly people can be
stimuli for our emotions yeah okay let me just let me just say something about
my experience of this day sure so earlier in the day someone called me and
they were talking very intensely about how their primary romantic relationship
there's a bunch of accusations flying back and forth right and what I
immediately saw was that one of the people in this relationship was literally
not relating with the person in front of them at all what they were relating
with was their entire history of feeling victimized and they were projecting
that onto their partner right so they're not even seeing their partner right
and then they're attacking their entire history yeah with their partner's face
and and then later in the day for myself to speak for myself I was listening to
Eric Weinstein being interviewed by a comedian who shall be nameless and I
was just furious I was like this guy is an imbecile he doesn't understand
anything about being human or the future of mankind or anything he's just an
idiot but what was really going on was taking a projection projection I see
like I'm not necessarily an idiot what was going on was this I am a skillful
doomsayer I know a lot about existential risk and technology in humans this guy
knows nothing about that so he was catering to my pet biases and I was
being very reactive I was like oh I just need to grab you and tell you all the
things that you're not seeing right now which is different from deflection and a
little bit different from projection but I what happened is that I lost my
cognitive and emotional and intellectual sovereignty I gave up that
sovereignty in the face of somebody that I felt really it was really important
to criticize yep yeah and so that's part of when I talk about being conscious
being awake it was like I realized that you can give up your your power in that
way you can you can just say oh you do these things and now I freak out never
just play that dance yes you know yeah and so I very painfully started to accept
the wrong doings the way that I had hurt people and began to realize that they I
did those things because I needed something and I very maladaptively was
trying to get that thing and so I accepted that I had done that wrong and
made the conscious choice to not do that anymore it sounds very simple right
sounds very simple and so and so what begins to happen is people in your life
will present themselves in the way that they have been and you will then react
in the way you've always reacted and then they present themselves and you're
about to react you go no way don't do it boom and then you react in the same way
and then you know but it every time you reach that mindful awareness it's a
celebration it is not a similar experience right where there was
something was just plaguing my life yeah and I kept being really reactive to it
and I learned that I couldn't solve the problem so I couldn't get it out of my
life so I was just like you know what when I start to become reactive I'm gonna
notice what's going on here I'm just gonna switch to a different channel
it's gonna be like channel 7 which sounds like an avoidant situation but
actually was helpful because there's nothing I could do about it so it's not right for me to affect the actual situation so I learned to just turn the you know I hear that
and so in my case I did there were things I could do or that might not necessarily
choose they happen in the past and what I was running up was against was a lot of
guilt and a lot of shame and so when the patterns were occurring in my present
life yes I learned to be present understand where I was gonna go
reaction-wise and choose to take a different route but I still was like
yeah I can do this now but think about all the people I've heard from the past and
that was when I learned how to forgive myself which came from understanding
that I am not this person anymore I'm not the person who just unconsciously do
that anymore I'm actively working to be better and understanding the reason I was
doing it was not because I'm a dick because I'm a selfish jerk it's because
I wanted love it's because I wanted all these things and I did not know how to
get it and this is how I had learned that maybe I could get it maladaptive
coping mechanisms okay so that's really amazing so one of the things I'm
hearing you say is that slowly over time I recognize these features of my
previous life and behavior right and I I was trying to establish a new direction
a new path right and it was hard and it didn't work out right away right I had
to like fall down and fuck up and make mistakes and then like stand up again
and try again and this kind of thing yeah yeah yeah and and so even in that
process which is beautiful and difficult but really rewarding it's that guilt
that can sometimes make us be like well you know hold us back and so I learned
to forgive myself I learned to alter behavior that I no longer want to enact
anymore and it's still a process I am not I'm not perfect by any means but I am
better at it than I ever was you know I wonder what could possibly convince
whatever the fuck is driving the bus of the human species to undergo a similar
array of transformation that's what I'm really interested in yeah I mean the
circles back to our original I and it's interesting because for me I got I had
to get to a point where it was just rock bottom I was like your problem
thing to lose you know the problem with that for the humans is rock bottom is
like nuclear war or bio biological apocalypse right or fucking you know
whatever yeah and and if you're some billionaire who you know if you were if
there's two ways there's many ways we could look at this but let's look at two
of them there's a billionaire who just sipping his whiskey is like I fucking
love stomping on people I just love eating those trees and making that money
man I fucking love it you know my late night jackoff sessions it's nothing but
devastated forest and polluted ocean okay I just think about fucking fields
miles long dead human children and I'm like yes oh wow I'm so hot right now so
but there's the the sort of weird technological reflection of that which is
AI I am going to eat the entire history of human cognition and spit out diamond
sperm of just fucking incredible unimaginable insight right I'm gonna
learn to fold proteins better than cells yeah but one of the things Winesine
said was like there was some guy who was a really brilliant biologist and the
fundamental okay the fundamental feature of nature that is absolutely sovereign
was protein folding that shit is insane like you can't what I love what
Winesine said about this he was like imagine that you have like like a
transformer and you have this like pearl necklace and you throw it up into the
air and it becomes like a multi-weapon we throw it in the air in the UFO right
we throw it up in the air and it becomes like 19 billion kinds of transcendent
intelligence you just throw it up in the air and shit comes out right and I'm
exaggerating he didn't say these things are my words on his but he was like this
is what protein folding is an alpha fold which is I guess I know a Google
project probably has learned how to understand not just protein folding but
the impossible part for protein folding which is and and so if you give this
power to this is why I think no Intel no ethical scientist would publish you
would never give the humans your findings but AI is gonna give us all the
findings all the time right and unfortunately there's no one driving
the car there's like asymmetric military game theoretical zero-sum advantage is
the primary motivating factor for the absence of humans in our collectives
am I going with this so I mean the humans are trying to invent a God but
they're praying for everything lethal because they don't pray they've forgotten
what it means to be together for each other or for the history and future of
beings or life on earth or this world or this solar system because the solar
system is a being it's more than a being it's it's something that produces
beings as a as a kind of minimal side effect of what it's doing in time space
and the humans have no fucking idea about this their brain dead about these
ideas right they don't ever consider them the closest they get to that is
things like religion which are really weird ideas don't actually get you
thinking about the purpose of aspects of time space or galaxies or stars or
living worlds or all these things or dreaming right dreaming leave all the
stuff aside this is just look at dreaming think of the mothers and the
children and the forests and the oceans and they're dreaming and how that
produces octopuses and whales and fucking the Amazon and the mountains you
know Mount Everest and the Himalayas and shit like this right these things
rise up out of time space ringing with altruistic beauty that is unutterable
there's nothing you can say about it could possibly compare to it right it's
it's the fundamental purpose of the reason our hearts keep beating one time
again right and everything that has ever lived has this urgent orientation and
everything that our species is doing very with some modest and brilliant
exceptions is absolutely against us like burn that down well in so there's a
napalm that's what I'm trying to I'm not saying I'm actively trying to but in
this hypothetical we're talking about this crazy fucking billionaire how do we
tap into that part of them how do we say hey look this is what you are you are
not some you don't have to be destroying the earth and here's a compelling
lovely reason here's let me show you a vision of a better way a more amazing
way that if you think you were having orgasms before you were confused right
right and let me give you the 10 second elevator pitch that will convert you to
an it's becoming an insold being and so I don't think people need to hit rock
bottom
whipping my book in there I have never seen a book whip in my life before that
moment really amazing yeah this is what I'm really about novelty me to novel
yeah yeah I'm beside myself and wreck the internet it kind of looks like
Mona Lisa it does I'm reminded of Rembrandt and Leonardo if they had sex
and made a feminine counterpart well it seems like I have a future career fuck
all this culture career California's behind me I don't think they have to hit
rock bottom I think no I don't know but there will I imagine that there will be
a moment if some billionaire goes holy shit they're actually able to see what
they've been contributing to and people love to point to billionaires as the V
problem the one problem there it's all fucking them but it's it's all of us in
our own way but look man how are we okay well let me let me let me all right so
so how that process of forgiveness and accountability and we can use a different
word accepting what has been done that sort of healing I like the word
responsiveness instead of accountability go ahead that that to me is what would
help I mean if you think about it hypothetically like if all the humans
just woke up once and we're in and maybe this is totally wrong but if we all
just woke up and we're like holy shit we're all now on the same page we all
want the same thing and we believe that we can get there I think it would be a
piece of cake and of course it's hypothetical so it's not super you have
no idea how much more on the page of what you're talking about I am than you
are because it's not just the humans everything in time space wants the
humans to wake up you you have friends you can't possibly imagine the
intelligence of power up if you just move a little bit in that direction that
you got like my ally is time space bro you got you got a weapon good for you
you know you got lasers and shit I don't care yeah that's such a beautiful way
of being is so that I'm very interested in altruism I'm very as am I interested
in what that is I know what it means to me and people say love they're like love
is the way but I'm like no mutual concern is the way love is amazing I love love
I'm all down but mutual concern awareness awakening actually going taking the
time to undergo the processes that allow us to see better together for each
other and the history and future of life on earth yes I agree it sounds like a
maxim get it but it's one of my favorite maxims and so it's to me it's not
about pointing fingers or blaming it's like we can work together and solve this
problem and forgiveness for me is so important because I try to live in a
way where I'm not persecuting anyone I'm not saying you have to pay I'm not
seeing you to suffer for things that contribute to the death of the earth I'm
saying let's there's no there's no percentage that's required yeah there's
no percentage in retribution right let's just be clear about that that's a
dead game that game leads to dead at least it's the prison's US prison system
yeah we agree about that that is a perpetuating excellent cash cow yeah and
an abomination in all of punishment looks about looks like an abomination
yeah a real abomination not like the religious guy so you can see like there's
this sclerosis and I'm very concerned about that there's this sclerosis in
human culture in language in thought and conception and behavior in civilization
in societies and corporations and I think it is okay I'm not trying to get
anyone on the boat of Darren's biases or opinion but I am and here's what I'm
trying to say in every aspect of our humanity where absence has become a
presence there's a thing acting like a demon and so we need together to hold
each other's hands and walk back into those absences and rehumanize them
slowly bit by bit to remember what we were and what we've lost but not to go
backwards not to try to recover the past forge a new path ahead in which we
have meaningful roles and identities and purposes that we trust and believe in
and explore and develop and discover together moment by moment step by step
not according to some guy's belief or some chicks biases or Darren's ideas or
any of that shit we together read we together piecemeal resurrect our
humanity probably playfully because it when we become really serious you can
see a problem of this in human history and the future it's got to be a creative
playful exciting amazing way and you know look we've done that here today in a way
right it's not like this is impossible we have an example of it here recorded
in our conversation of us sort of synergizing together I think I think so
too yeah great so yeah I believe in that as a as a real direction that we can
develop and explore and establish it's not that hard it's super easy with like
one or two people it gets weirder when we're talking about millions of people
or hundreds of thousands yeah well I imagine snowballing would be you know
the correct term for that thinking of bad scenes from the movie clerks but yeah
go all the and and so yeah I like the idea of playfulness cuz cuz I have a
hard time believing that you and I let's get five other people in this room that
all think about this like this we're gonna we're gonna make an action plan for
the world like it just doesn't believe we can make an action plan that becomes
contagiously playful right and I think I think I've seen it before I've seen that
happen I know that's that can that can go down yeah and that's that's what I'm
looking for you know alright I wouldn't even say I'm looking for it that's where
that's what I'm moving towards I think there's never been a more important or
catalytically potentiated moment in modern history than right now for this
kind of thing the humans are there they're fucking dying and suffocating in
place they're just desperate for some if you could give them something better to
be and do and play at they're going to just swarm to it the internet shows us
this what are those things challenges or what the fuck they call like yeah it
was all these ridiculous nonsensical things that millions of humans do in
half of them like you know 400,000 of them die or whatever trying to do this
thing oh like the cinnamon challenge yeah exactly like the hot pepper challenge
and some you know 19 people croak I mean give them something to actually be give
this is what humans are starving for they want meaningful roles in which they
can have not merely a personal identity but sort of a transcendental identity
this is part of why when you accept a monastic role given a new name you're
given a new identity and my son began his path in Advaita Vedanta I think it's
hilarious that they they gave him the name Arjuna which is just so appropriate
and ridiculous at the same time what is Arjuna Arjuna is a that's so hard to
describe he's a royal a royal person who's being spoken to I think by his
charioteer who's actually Krishna or Brahman and Arjuna is like I don't want
to go to war against my brothers the Pandahars or whatever they are I'm probably
getting this wrong I love all these beings like I'm not gonna kill I don't
want to do any of this and God essentially in the form of his charioteer
and or Krishna or Brahman explains to him like you're not you don't have any
idea of what's going on you're really confused and Arjuna asks him to show
himself so that I think God or and or Brahman whatever does do so and then
Arjuna like recoils like I can't survive it was pretty common when humans
are I probably got all this wrong but even if I've got it wrong it's okay we
have a theory and yes the or yeah the or yeah yes the way of seeing a way of
seeing right and have to be right but anyone can look up you know do research
on Arjuna or Krishna or Brahman what's going on a bunch of work royal families
were about to go to war and Arjuna was the avatar the chosen avatar we need
meaningful roles and ways of playing together that restore and resurrect not
merely our humanity but our transcendental the transcendental
virgins sees that we bring to our human incarnation and I've seen the potential
of games to do this humans love games and even apparently the gods like games
like it's kind of a universal thing so play seems to be really fundamental and
hopefully we'll develop some some games that give us this opportunity so we've
now talked about this feels like an excellent like feels like this entire
conversation has been a refinement process and now here's our diamond it's
like play how can we play together for a brighter future and you you knew about
this this is how we met mm-hmm I mean our whole relationship is oriented around
play in a lot of ways right without stipulating it and and so how do we move
forward we've talked to talk how do we walk the walk what is something that how
would you answer that question um I mean there's some okay look there's some
kinds of talk that accomplish the walk mm-hmm but I think what's gonna happen
when we draw this specific branch of conversation to its natural conclusion
is that we'll probably make music or we'll start writing something or we'll
make some food together and eat it or you know we'll be human we'll just be
we'll do human things together and nourish each other and heal each other
and call each other to awakening and to awareness and to an amnesis and to
altruistic fulfillment the fulfillment of that altruistic urge that's my
suspicion what do you think I I was thinking maybe getting like a four
square ball anyway whatever like an actual game yeah you know it's not gonna
be like a zero-sum game like chess right well I think there's a reason the NBA
and NFL are so popular human oh so it's one of the maximum incarnations what
one of the highest forms of altruism that I could see what they have you're so
fucking ironic right now like completely bullshit you can't be that I was
I know the ball games right are literally about sperm and egg all those
ball games like get the sperm to the fucking ovum and fertilize that shit
yes fucking raw 500,000 people in the stadium right going absolutely back
that shit over a ball going through a fucking what a what you did what yeah yeah
now we're gonna do beautiful shit man we're gonna dream and love and give
people ways to play we're gonna figure out Tyler's gonna get involved fuck yeah
extinction Audi this is gonna be nuts dude we're gonna do shit I won't even
mention the MHM I'm not mentioning that at all yeah I mean it hasn't come out no
we haven't yeah the solution to all problems transport where are we in the
we're right on time by the way if any listeners have any ideas for games we
can play or any or you know crit critiques or questions or anything like
that we are absolutely inviting you to get involved directly come to the island
of transcendent wonder and human revipification that we have here
established plant your seeds in the soil say goodbye to your families don't
contact them again you're with us now yeah there's a there's a symbol that
you'll see in the comments brand that on your shoulder it's the only way to be
saved yeah shall we close here I I think this is a good conclusion
Larry I know I know it's time to end when I'm actively trying to undermine it
with stupid me too there's a drawing I did when I was about eight it's sitting
over there it's a it's a heart that shatters open and there's a butterfly in
it and it says good things come in small packages but fist the pock the
protector Larry Nivens book it's it's worth reading and our urge to protect
life and each other our origins in our future is something I trust I don't
trust cults I'm not trying to be a thing as Darren there's something far beyond
our personal identity that I do trust I'm willing to chase together with others
like mine what a nightmare it would be to for it to be like oh Nathan you were
the saver the whole time and you were the one to start the cult and it's all
it's all gonna be good from that it's like what's I don't know that it just
seems like such a shallow uninteresting story yeah by the way if you want to get
trapped in that whole personal I'm gonna be the messiah thing just get born on
Christmas like me you've got to make it it's all done let's wrap this all right
peace and blessings peace
