Again and again, Spongebob Squarepants, I believe, is called, and we're selling here at $180,000.
I'm understanding that art is no longer a collectible.
It is an alternative asset class, and it can produce significant investment returns.
Our view is really that this is an investable asset class.
You should think of it just like you think of stocks, fixed income, any other asset class.
What's wrong with making a little money off of buying and selling art?
Surely you're supporting the artist, right?
And that will make the art better, right?
Right?
Well, not exactly, but I'll get into that.
What's important that you know right now is that things have not always been this way.
It's only really been since around 2004.

and the results have been disastrous.

Art is a dynamic form of human expression,
which can manifest itself in a wide array of mediums
from paint on a canvas to a repurposed urn all signed R.mutt.
Art means a lot of different things to a lot of different people.
discovered, 64,000-year-old Neanderthal cave paintings in Andalusia, broadening our philosophical
concept of art and the human experience as a whole.
At its best, art is a means of communicating ineffable experiences.
It's revolutionary, profound, expressive, informative, awe-inspiring, or just downright
amusing.
At its worst, it's a banana taped to the wall.
For this video, I think it's important to define what art is not.
Art is not an asset class, a commodity, a percentage of an investment portfolio to be
bought in fractal shares.
That's how I've come to treat art, because it's something of value, and value means money,
and who doesn't need more money?
But let's take a step back to understand how we got here in the first place.
As far back in history as we can see, people have been going through great lengths to surround
themselves with things they find beautiful.
Art not only elevates our spirits, but also allows us to show those who we invite into
our homes a little piece of who we are, or at the very least start an interesting conversation.
On the darker side of human nature, collecting art is a symbol of wealth, status, taste, and
erudition.
Having a certain caliber of art separates the initiated from the unwashed masses.
Art collecting as we know it today really started around the time of the Renaissance.
The Medici family of Florence became extremely wealthy through banking during this period
and spent a fortune on commissioning some of the most iconic works of art to this day,
including works by Da Vinci, Paracelli, and Michelangelo.
The tradition of the uber-wealthy buying and collecting art has continued much the same to this day.
The act of collecting art has traditionally been facilitated by the art dealer, an intermediary
between the buyer and seller of art, or a person or group of people who buy art hoping
to sell it to others at a profit.
Recently, however, the lines between dealer and buyer have blurred to the point where
most buyers think and behave more like dealers than lovers of art.
And that brings us to the title of this video.
Art is dead and money killed it.
Not convinced?
Let's take a deeper look.
Music
According to the UBS Global Art Market Report, the art market was worth $64 billion in 2019,
one and a half the revenue of box office sales, and more than three times the sales of recorded music.
So art is big business.
Great news for artists, right?
Wrong.
Your average artist is actually getting poorer as the market booms.
75% of professional artists earn less than $10,000 a year from their work with less than
3% even managing to earn as much as the average fast food worker annually from their art.
So where is all the money going?
Over recent years, it's been increasingly concentrated at the top with celebrity artists
being the safest bet for an investor looking for a return on a piece of art.
Sales over $10 million make up a fraction of 1% of total art transactions, yet represent
28% of that $64 billion I mentioned earlier.
Smaller artists are getting more exposure than ever before thanks to social media,
but the sad truth is the art market today is not interested in the quality of the work as much as the name behind it.
And those artists at the top are being encouraged to overproduce as well as produce on-brand works,
which are safer investments for potential buyers.
Essentially stifling creativity and experimentation in an industry built on creativity and experimentation.
Big money investing is literally killing art.
There's very little magic in the creation of this art either.
Artist studios are incorporated and registered as companies, with teams of assistants pumping out works of art like a factory.
These studios behave like companies as well, needing to turn over millions of dollars in profits a year just to sustain themselves.
Galleries are no different.
Demanding more work from artists and almost never questioning the quality or significance of the works they are buying,
simply assessing how much of a return they might get for it.
China has recently entered the art market in a big way, for many of China's super wealthy.
Buying art with a newsworthy price tag is a great way to show that you've arrived, economically speaking.
The bigger the price tag, the better. The work itself could matter less.
It's not all about flexing though, due to laws put in place by the Chinese government to prevent the devaluation of the euro.
Buying art and selling it overseas is one of the best ways to get substantial sums of money out of mainland China.
Art museums are also increasingly part of the real estate projects in mainland China,
in an attempt to draw attention to the project as well as qualifying developers for special discounts on buying land from the government.
Art's ability to be bought in one currency and sold in another, and its relative mobility compared to say real estate,
makes it an extremely attractive store of wealth.
This has led to the rise of free ports, where art is essentially stowed away in strong boxes, tax free, and customs duty free.
Works can be bought and sold over and over without ever being taxed as long as it remains in the free port.
If all of that sounded shady to you, that's only the legal side of things.
Not even getting into money laundering, which itself is a huge industry in art.
Today's art market has transformed into a dull, dispassionate alternative investment,
with gallery owners noting that their customers are less and less eccentric art lovers and more often cold, rational investors with no interest in art.
Just a little bit of time for the video.
There has been a notable shift in the past 15 years in how we appreciate art.
Social media has shifted the focus from the artwork to the art viewer, putting yourself
in the center stage with the art serving as a mere pretty backdrop for your Instagram picture.
It may seem harmless, but this trend has actually had a significant impact on what modern art
looks like.
Art installations have shifted from works to be marveled at and pondered on, to experiences
to be photographed.
The success of installations, such as Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama and The Rain Room
by Hanes Ko, has led to the creation of an entire pop-up exhibits, such as the Museum
of Ice Cream and the Color Factory, designed for the specific purpose of being the backdrop
of your new profile pic.
In a narcissistic society, any product, such as art, is simply a tool to enhance the status
of the user.
The experience of visiting an art museum or exhibit has become the soulless pursuit of
the perfect picture, with little room for reflection or appreciation of the art on display.
I guess it begs the question, do we the consumer even deserve creations of true genius?
Could we overlook pieces of truly challenging art to line up for a cheeky selfie with an
uninspired work made for Instagram?
Do we even have the attention span to stand still long enough to be moved by a piece of
art?
Can we blame the art industry for selling out to the bankers when we, the consumer, are
too self-obsessed to see art as more than a backdrop for a photo?
The fact of the matter is, we're all guilty of taking genius works of art for granted.
Looking over minute details painstakingly made by artists devoted to their craft.
We care more about the glamour and celebrity personality behind the work of art, than we
care about the state of the art world and where it's headed.
When are we going to get bored with the shallow vapid experiences, and just sit still and
genuinely admire something?
The academic side of art is shunned and dismissed as pretentious, while new artists and art
consumer proudly talent having no foundation in their appreciation of art.
All reactions are powerful, but without an understanding of the significance of a work,
they often ring hollow.
We, the consumer of art, need to do better.
I hope all that doom and gloom didn't put you off to this message, because ultimately
this is a message of hope for greatness.
Looking at the inner workings of the modern art market, it's hard not to include that
art is dead, but that would be ignoring all the lesser known artists devoted to their
craft, putting their heart into creating meaningful works of passion.
They likely won't make headlines for an eight figure sale, or find their way onto a t-shirt
at urban outfitters.
They may never even make it into an exhibit or gallery, but I challenge you to value their
work like it's the Mona Lisa, seek out art that challenges you and let it move you, support
small artists and we can build our own art market separate from the billionaires.
Instead of decorating your room with posters of art that sold for millions, buy original
art from artists you like, but may not be well known.
There's so much greatness in the world that goes unnoticed or unappreciated, make it a
point to recognize it when you see it.
Educate yourself on art history, and build a foundation for deeper art appreciation.
That's the mission of this channel, that's the message of hope.
Art is not dead, it lives on in that friend who's passionate about painting, but can't
manage to turn it into a career.
It lives in that art teacher, or art history professor, who passionately teaches you the
foundations.
And I hope it lives on this channel as well.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying loop of life.
Rage, rage against the dying loop of life.
