Robert Sapolsky got a degree in biological anthropology from Harvard.
This was back in the late 70s, lived in Kenya for a while to study non-human primates, earned
his doctorate in neuroendocrinology, which is hard for...
What in the world is that?
Can you just flesh it out for the rest of us?
Well, it's without an R after the D, so endo, neuroendocrinology.
It's studying the effects of the brain on hormones in the body and the effects of hormones
on the brain.
And that could be about, for my money, totally boring stuff, like how much urine your kidneys
are making, or it could be all about behavior and psychological states and actions.
So yeah, the body, brain, looping influences there.
So you're not a dualist.
The brain is the mind.
The mind is the brain.
The brain is the body.
It's all one.
Yep.
And there's no little me sitting inside the brain that's made out of stuff other than
brain cells.
I was talked to, as I was a believer for decades, a devout Christian.
And I was taught to be afraid of people like you.
I was, you know, don't listen because they think you're just a monkey, right?
They want to make a monkey out of you, literally.
And I spent so long not understanding, but more than that, being afraid.
I was afraid to be even around these ideas because I might become infected with evolution.
Are some people from your perspective more genetically, biologically wired to believe
in gods and monsters?
You think I might have been more primed genetically to be and stay religious?
Well, unfortunately, my guess is a good clean experiment was not done on you, which is to
control for the family you were raised in.
So to clone you and dump one version of you in the middle of some other culture, clone
another version that could have spent nine months in a different womb having a fetal
environment.
So I don't know if it's genes.
The thing we say in the business is it's gene environment interaction.
It's every biological factor environment interaction.
So you can't tease them apart, but it's not by chance that you wound up being who you
are and that each of us did.
Is that essentially nature, nurture?
Is that what we're talking about?
No, because you don't really have to choose anymore because each is interacting with the
other.
You got genes that change how sensitive you are to nurture you've got so that at some
point it doesn't make any sense to say, what does this gene do?
What does it do in a particular environment?
What does this environment do depends on your genetic makeup?
Dr. John Waffey is a friend of mine.
He's a computational neuroscientist.
He wrote a book called The Illusion of God's Presence.
I'm sure I'm not going to do him justice, but I'm going to try to distill his point
that we are born helpless and we require a parental other to provide for our every need.
When we get older, according to Dr. Waffey, there are certain things, I don't know, triggers
that cause those same responses in us as adults and this may explain our desire to look up
to a parental other in the heavens or elsewhere.
Can you hear something like that?
Is there anything to it?
What do you think?
Well, I think there's a lot to it.
I would frame it much more broadly.
We like all sorts of other primates don't like risk a whole lot.
We don't like ambiguity.
We don't like a lack of clarity.
We don't like the possibilities that something happens and we will never know why it did
and anxiety makes us more that way and we have an incredibly powerful human tendency
to fill explanatory vacuums with explanations no matter how dubious and I think a great
example of this is studies.
You take subjects and you sit them down and you say how important is religion in your
life and you get whatever answers you get.
In contrast, if for 20 minutes before these people had been sitting trying to solve some
like Sudoku puzzle or something that was unsolvable, it didn't have a solution.
It was frustrating all of that on the average.
People afterward rate themselves as being more religious uncertainty, novelty, ambiguity
brings out a very desperate need in us for explanation no matter how implausible the explanation
is that we latch on to because it's comforting.
I know you've debated the late philosopher Daniel Dennett.
He had said something and I made this note because I really wanted your take.
He was talking about religion coming out of an idea.
So a lightning strike takes place and I'm in, you know, I'm out on the African savannah
and I say, well, it was the tree God that made the strike happen.
And so I begin to make that claim.
Even those who disagree are talking about it.
It becomes part of the milieu, right?
It becomes embedded in the cultural conversation.
And before you know it, there are shamans and imams or whoever and they're all talking
about maybe they're they're preaching about the magical tree, that kind of thing.
But he said that religion exists only for itself, like the common cold might exist only
for itself.
And I tend to think that religion was actually a bonding agent, a tribal bonding agent between
non-kin, meaning that it grouped us together.
Even if we weren't direct relatives, it solved problems.
It answered questions, filled blanks, alleviated fears.
There was more utility.
It didn't just exist for itself and it's kind of a it's kind of a broad question.
Do you have any thoughts about that?
Yeah, I completely agree with that interpretation.
And religion is a great social glue stated in more evolutionary terms.
We have evolved to want to pass on as many copies of our own genes as possible.
Some of the time we do that by cooperating with kin.
Some of the time we do that by cooperating with non-kin under sort of controlled circumstances
of reciprocity, all of that.
What does religion do?
It induces something people in the business call a sense of pseudo kinship.
You feel more related to people than you actually are.
And that fosters cooperation, that fosters unity.
What that often fosters is the flip side pseudo speciation.
The thems are so different from us.
They hardly even count as human.
And that's a very effective thing.
Great evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson, who is pushed for a very modern view of evolution
playing out on lots of different levels.
And he's got this wonderful book Darwin's Cathedral, where he analyzed the emergence
of Calvinist belief in Switzerland and a whole bunch of little religions were popping up
at the time and analyzed why they happened to be in the right place at the right time
and the right sort of belief system to promote pseudo kinship to a more effective and they're
the ones who won out and to use an evolutionary metaphor, they drove the neighboring competing
new religions into extinction.
So yeah, it is a fantastic sort of mechanism for getting people to feel more connected
to each other.
We've been talking a lot about how I don't think most people attend religious services
or are part of a religion itself for reasons of theology.
I tend to think they're there for reasons of community.
I mean, they don't they own the Bible, but they don't know what's in it.
They know it's true, but they don't know what it says kind of thing.
But I think beyond that, it's more of like, I want to belong.
I need a group.
I need a tribe.
Totally agree.
And something like that has an upside.
There's a long literature showing that religiosity can have some health benefits.
And it takes a lot of work to tease out the fact that religious people usually are less
likely to be abusing substances more importantly, religious people typically get a social community
and that in and of itself is a wonderful source of health protection.
You see the same benefit for atheists who find humanist groups to feel.
So that can have a blood plus side that can have a downside, which is all sorts of studies
showing you look at somebody from a religion with some tradition of extremist violent
fundamentalism like show me a religion that doesn't.
And you try to look for the predictors of it and studies that have been done show, ooh,
how much do you believe in God?
That's not a predictor of like you're willing to become violently fundamentalist.
How often do you pray?
That's not a predictor.
How devoutly do you pray?
How often do you go pray with a bunch of your co-religionists?
That's the predictor.
How often do you go to the church, the mosque, the synagogue?
Because that's a surrogate measure of how often are you in an echo chamber of people
who were saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're special, we're better, they're animals, they
don't count.
So that I think is enormously informative of the potential toxicity of religious social
support that one gets by being religious.
In grouping and out grouping, right, I guess the classic dilemma, which brings me to the
useful fiction claim that, well, you know, it's even if it's not true, it bonds people
together, it gives them a sense of purpose and hope.
I mean, if we're looking at the sort of the bumper sticker version of it, they say, religion
is good for us, even if it's not true.
And I really struggle with that because if it's not was it Bertrand Russell, he said,
if it's true, we should believe it.
And if it's not true, we should not.
How do you approach the useful fiction angle when it comes to the benefits or religion?
Well, useful fictions, religiosity and to a lesser extent spirituality, religiosity, for
example, is great at reducing anxiety.
It provides answers in the face of life's terrifying unknowns.
And exactly as we were talking about, we yearn for attribution at that point.
So you find out, well, there is a purpose or even better, there is a purpose and it has
something to do with people like you being better and even best of all, you being better
and going through all those versions of that.
But then the big problem is what religion is best at when it comes to decreasing anxiety
is decreasing anxieties that religion invented in the first place.
And what do you see in terms of the kindnesses, the potential upsides of
religiosity and the power of faith from my money, there's nothing more destructive when
it turns out that faith turns out to be displaced.
Having the carpet pulled out from under your feet does not constitute psychological well
being.
So they tell me I'm sick and then sell me the cure in so many cases.
You came out of orthodox Judaism and busted out of that mindset pretty early.
You were a teenager.
Is that correct?
Yeah, I was 14 when I had a tumultuous night of Sturm and Drong and decided there's no
God and there's no free will in the universe.
This is big, empty and different place and it's been smooth sailing ever since then.
So yeah, I dumped all of that when I was about 14.
Well, at least you got through the bar mitzvah where you got the presents.
You got all the goodies and then you had your epiphany.
Exactly.
When you say orthodox, please forgive the stereotype, but we've done some talking
about like the ultra orthodox where you was your family, that family where
they're swinging the copper wrote chickens over their heads and pushing
elevator buttons on the Sabbath and shit like that.
I mean, was that the temperature or what?
Close approximation of we were what's called modern orthodox, which
nonetheless has a lot of that.
We had two sinks in the kitchen, one for meat, one for dairy, two refrigerators.
If you screwed up and like infected a utensil with the wrong kind, you buried
it in the backyard for months so that it would be purified.
You sure did not do all sorts of things on Saturday that could be mistaken
for work or anything muscular.
Yeah, so that whole song and dance and a whole ideology slash theology
that went along with that.
It's interesting, though, to see so many secular Jews talking about religion.
I don't even call it a useful fiction in this case because an increasing
number of people who are Jewish, traditional Jewish people or cultural Jews,
rather, they say, well, they're either not sure about God or they just don't buy
it, but they love the culture.
And I totally think that's great.
We're creatures of ritual.
Are we not?
I mean, the music and the clothing and the structure of it all.
There's benefit to that, correct?
Absolutely.
And I deeply resent that circumstances of cultural evolution and societal
prejudices and all of that meant that the Renaissance had a whole lot more
really amazing Christian composers than there were Jewish ones.
So they got the much better music.
But yeah, culture, a sense of belonging is very, very powerful and very
galvanizing and as a double edged sword for better or worse.
But yeah, cultural aspects are great to bring along as long as they are well
selected.
People are often surprised to hear that I say, I support like if you want to
have a secular religion, I mean, knock yourself out.
If you want to frame community in that way, one thing about religions, they
have had a long time to come up with pretty effective models or frameworks
for community, right?
Yeah.
And not only because they've had lots of adherents.
So you get that many more good innovators and because just sheer numbers.
But there's an oomph.
There's an emotional oomph.
You, you make up some silly wedding vows where you're citing, I don't know,
Nelson Mandela and Taylor Swift or something and like, that's great.
But there's a power knowing that you're doing a ritual that your parents
and grandparents and great grandparents all the way back were doing and maybe
even died in some cases for the freedom to do that.
Oh, yeah, time gets a big power to it.
Talking here with Dr.
Robert Sapolsky, this is a hot button you don't have to answer.
I'm just going to toss it out there.
Okay.
So I came out of a, I mean, I used to be that guy.
I was the Fox News Christian of the Ann Coulter reading Glenn Beck listening,
you know, pro death penalty and suck it up, love it or leave it, America kind of guy.
You know, that's pray the gay away guy.
I was essentially a Reagan conservative, okay, even in my youth.
And when I left Christianity, I went through a long re-evaluation of what are my values?
How do I feel about things like drugs and the death penalty and immigration and
the rest of the world and American exceptionalism, et cetera.
And I came out the other end and I, I was struck by how cruel many of my
previous or at least myopic, but inadvertently cruel.
Sometimes positions were when I was a devout hardcore right winger.
So I myself see American conservatism, at least the frontline Republican Party
right now as kind of the culture of the cruel.
You want to touch that at all, Dr. Sapolsky.
Yeah, the way I would reframe it is it's the culture of people who have gotten a
certain type of shitty deal in life.
I mean, there's, there's among like snotty, elitist academic types who love
evolution, all of that.
There's like, ooh, look at the parts in the United States where people don't
believe in evolution.
It's the American South and fundamentalism and like yahooism and the temptation
instead of saying cruel in this case, just not educated and not critical
thinking, all of that.
And I think far more importantly, you look at that part of the United States
and that's the part that's been most screwed over in lots of ways with the
worst health care and the most, you know, toxic mining going on.
And the most, that's a part of the country of people who have gotten a
pretty crummy deal.
And it's not surprising that an anger at them's is one consequence.
It's not surprising that a totally distorted sense that things used to be
better when we were the culture that dominated the country comes to the
forefront.
And it's not at all surprising that a pretty stoic, insular, unempathic
version of explaining the unexplainables and life pops out the other side as well.
Catherine Stewart, journalist and author, friend of mine calls it the
knowledge economy.
There are simply some people who have not benefited from the knowledge economy.
Would you phrase it that way then?
They just simply haven't been given the resources and they were kind of
given a raw deal?
Yeah, all the above horrible leadership in many circumstances, although I don't
know, a Northern state like Illinois has a proud tradition of sending its
governors to prison for horrible leadership.
But nonetheless, the American South, the cultural things that got people there
led to a certain elevated rate of violence that is endemic to the South, the
culture of honor, where the people came from and what their backgrounds were in
the British Isles when first being settled, set things up for that, the fact
that the South stumbled onto a collectivist type of crop, cotton, which
instead of solving it with collectivism, they solved it with slavery has made
that a world that is still trying to recover from its original sin and
probably never will.
Yeah, just all sorts of things that set things up so that certain types of
explanations, even if they're nonsensical, and even if they are angry and
exclusionary and vengeful, can provide comfort if you've been challenged in
certain ways.
Yeah, but not to be labor this speaking to primates.
Isn't some of this just primitive?
It's easier to hate than it is to love.
It's easier to lash out and tear down than it is to build those types of
things.
This idea that I want the world to look like me because I'm a person of great
insecurity and I need validation.
There's a lot of stuff there that's just, you know, I don't necessarily in my
mind think, well, you got the shaft.
Sometimes I think you're just a terrible person.
But maybe maybe I'm not giving them enough credit or at least giving the
story of their lives, their backstory, enough credence.
I don't know.
Well, my gut certainly pulls in that direction very readily and I've got no
shortage of people who challenge my personal rule that it makes no sense to
hate anyone.
Um, but people become who they are for reasons of that.
No one winds up being, you know, Mother Teresa, lover or not, by chance.
Nobody, nobody winds up being Vladimir Putin by chance.
Um, you know, it's, there's no such thing as someone who is just happens to be a
rotten, damaging human or one who just happens to be a wonderfully empathic, you
know, one, we were just the end products of circumstances that made us who we are.
For those who are listening to the audio version, Dr.
Sapolsky's dog, we, I'm a dog lover as well and mine will bark in any moment
whenever someone's outside.
Uh, but if you hear the rattling of the leash, it is Dr.
Sapolsky's not wearing chains or anything like that.
Just know it sounds that way.
Oh, just psychic ones.
Let's talk about political parties since we're in this realm.
Is it true that conservatives have a lower threshold for disgust?
Uh, I think I'd read something along those lines.
Or is it true that, that those who are liberal are more empathetic or is that
just a lie?
I tell myself because I want to feel superior.
Oh, it's a mixture of both the disgust threshold thing.
I love that finding.
So first off, disgusting things, viscerally disgusting things.
Disgust us and make us recoil and make us over generalize what it is that's
making us recoil and fantastic study showing this.
You sit somebody down and they fill out a whole questionnaire about their political
views, their social politics, their geopolitical, their economic, whatever.
And you see on the average how people answer these questions.
And if instead the person was sitting in a room where unbeknownst to them, there
was a completely disgusting smell in the room, people become more socially
conservative, does nothing to your economic views, nothing to your geopolitical.
People sit there and they become more likely to say, Oh, when those people do
something that's different, it's not just different, it's disgusting.
It's wrong, wrong, wrong.
And you find, for example, that across the political spectrum, when people are
made disgusted by stuff, they become more hostile to immigration or become more
hostile to gay marriage back when these studies were being done.
That sort of thing.
So right off the bat, disgust is this fabulous stepping stone from sensory
disgust to moral disgust, emotional disgust, economic, ideological, all of that.
So that's sort of a backdrop with all of us.
But what you see layered on top is on the average, and these are just
statistical, blah, blah, blah, on the average, social conservatives have
a lower threshold for disgust than do social progressives.
What's this about?
What's this about genes, environment, fetal, whatever, you know, however
you turned out to be, but show pictures to people of like festering wounds
crawling with maggots and things like that.
On the average, social conservatives' stomachs lurch more than the average
social progressive.
On the average, social conservatives have more cleaning products in their home,
are more averse to all sorts of germish sort of thing.
And what's that about?
Jonathan Haidt, New York University, has done some wonderful research on
sort of the psychological structure of progressive versus conservative mindsets
and purity, cleanliness, all of that is a much more emotionally salient thing
in the lives of your average social conservatives than social progressives.
How did they become that way?
Because of genes and hormones and environment and culture and all of that
sort of thing, but once you look at the world and it is way easier to decide
that there is disgusting stuff out there, it is way easier to decide
that those people are disgusting when they do that.
And in much the same way, for whatever genetic, environmental, cultural,
et cetera reasons, you wind up being somebody for whom ambiguity is frightening.
You wind up being a social conservative.
If the future is an exciting place, that's one thing.
If the future is terrifying because it's unknown, you spend a lot of time
thinking about how wherever you are needs to be made great again
because it used to be wonderful.
And I think that's where the roots of it are.
So yes, on the average, in the realm of social sort of political issues,
on the average, social conservatives have a lower threshold for disgust
than do social progressives.
And I think that is so cool and interesting.
I used to be that guy.
I was proud of an accident of birth.
I'm proud to be American, even though it was really out of my hands
and I hadn't even qualified it.
Like where do we land in terms of cost of living and crime rate
and who's the most warlike and quality of our health care?
And I actually wrote about this a few years ago.
I was just so absolutely cocooned here in hashtag America.
But as I spiraled out of right wing evangelicalism,
I more and more saw myself as citizen of the world.
I guess that's kind of common, right?
As we see us all, the human primates across the color culture, across borders.
That's common, correct?
Yeah, and I think that provides one of the great sort of thought
experiments for seeing we're just the end product of stuff
that came before that we had no control over.
You look at first generation immigrants on one or you look at people
who are just a couple of generations in my wife and you see kind of
where randomness came in.
Her folks got off the boat at Ellis Island and they had enough money
to get on a train that took them all the way out to Iowa until they ran out
of money and they became like commie leftist cattle ranchers.
And if they had run out of money sooner, they would have wound up in Philadelphia.
They would have wound up in the Lower East Side and completely different cultures
with that, with my parents and grandparents' generation.
If it's some juncture, some border guard had demanded their identity papers,
which had been forged to get out of there or something,
they wouldn't have gotten it and I could have spent my whole life instead
growing up thinking that like Vladimir Putin was a cool guy and those
Ukrainians are all neo-Nazis who are threatening just by the randomness of
like who got on the boat, which boat didn't sink, who was granted asylum,
who inherited the family's wealth and who was the second son who decided
to pick up and try the new world.
You wind up having completely different views.
If somebody had missed a train connection back when I would have been
like a Putin enthusiast or who knows what.
Yeah, you get something like that and you realize it's just the randomness
of circumstance, environmental and biological.
I'd read that travel is one of the great cures for bigotry.
It sounds like a meme.
I'm sure it's reductive, but I mean, I mean, meeting other people,
integrating with other cultures, seeing the other as, you know, front and
center, eye to eye, face to face, voice to voice would be, I think,
an effective cure for othering people.
Yes? No?
As long as you're not going there with the intent of missionizing them
into being second class versions of us and, you know, doesn't take a whole
lot of looking at the history of colonialism to see that that was one big
threat of it.
But yeah, the more different things you see in the world, the more you realize
there's different ways of doing things.
And the more you realize that nonetheless, like people in general love their
kids and get googly eyed over puppies and like being tickled and the commonalities
there, wonderful work by this historian of science, Frank Sullaway, looking at
like the last 500 years, history of science, scientific controversies.
Is the earth round or not?
Is there, do the continents move?
Is there evolution, is phrenology for real?
And looking at all of the scientific players and they're doing lots of research
on their family histories and stuff, trying to predict who we're going to be
the intellectual radicals who embrace this new whatever and who would go to their
grave saying this couldn't possibly be.
And there were a bunch of predictors if you like hated your father, you were going
to wind up being an intellectual radical.
If you thought he was a great guy, much the opposite.
If you were in first born, if you all sorts of other predictors.
And along with that was if you traveled a lot outside your culture while growing
up, you were far more likely to wind up being one of the intellectual radicals.
You could virtually divide the world of mid 19th century naturalists into the
ones who had gone to someplace very exotic versus the ones who left their
office in Oxford to go look at the little birdies in the bushes outside and
predicting who embraced evolution and who didn't.
So yeah, that's a big predictor.
I was at a convention in Toronto years ago and there was a debate.
It was the scientists and the philosophers.
And before the first half hour was up, one of the scientists was so frustrated.
He crawled on top of the table.
He crawled on top of the table and he was banging his fist at the
philosopher.
He was so angry and it's interesting to see this tug of war.
I don't know the answer to the, are all questions, scientific questions, does
philosophy, is it, is philosophy science?
I don't know, how do you even start that conversation?
Oh, God, I'm going to fall into terrible sort of hegemony here.
Everything we do from like our noses twitching to the aesthetics we invent
and the cultures we invent is the product of like the brains we carry around
and brains are made of biological yuck and like, you know, no matter what
type of philosophy you wind up espousing and the polls show about 90% of
philosophers firmly believe in it's both a material world and somehow that's
compatible with their being free will and holding people responsible for
their actions for whatever reasons.
That's the kind of brain you wound up having and that's how you got there.
So philosophy is yet another manifestation of our lives as biological organisms.
You speak a little like a philosopher to me.
You've got that kind of storytelling aspect of the philosopher.
I don't know if that's an insult or a compliment.
Well, reading some of their stuff, I can only be deeply insulted, but I wish
there had been more more anecdotes along the way there.
You know, it was, I mean, are all questions scientific questions
because I tend to lean that direction.
Well, depends on what kind of science I was recently rereading.
Stephen Jay Gould had this essay where Gould was agnostic and left leaning
and all of that paleontologists and this famous essay that he called, oh,
non-overlapping magisteria in which he made the argument that why can't we
all just get along and like, there's room for both science and religion
because they're interested in non-overlapping areas of inquiry.
And that's totally wonderful if you're the type of scientist where what you care
about is like the evolution of snail shells, which is a lot of what Gould did.
On the other hand, if you're the kind of scientist who tries to understand
the neural basis of violence or the neural basis of mental illness
or the neural basis of kids getting brain cancers in any of those horrible,
those are not non-overlapping areas of inquiry.
What you're doing is like you were studying the science
of why some awful, awful things happen and how insisting that
it's a completely separate domain to say that there are transcended forces
who did that and for good reasons that we may not know.
There's no room for both.
So in those realms of science, if you study like any of the awful areas
that biology take you to, which is like saying the nature of life and you
can't have that and room for religion as well, they're incompatible.
Free will, OK, fine.
The philosophers say, I have agency.
I can choose.
At some point, I can get involved.
I can be an interventionist.
And yet I also my brain is doing what it does.
It's such a speed and in such a way that it's sort of predetermined.
I'm just realizing what I'm doing.
So can you sort of spell it out in small words, you know, with crayons
and language that a guy like me can understand your approach to free will, sir?
Well, first off, there's a tiny subset of philosophers who are incompatibilists.
They say you can't have free will and our understanding of how the universe works.
They don't go together.
They're not compatible, but they are way out on the lunatic fringe, which is where I am as well.
But yeah, the majority of philosophers say, yes, yes, yes, the world is made out of atoms
and there was such a thing as biology, but somehow, somehow that's compatible with us
being agents and masters of our own actions and thus appropriately held responsible for things.
And I think that's gibberish and it's gibberish.
Well, so many people believe it because it's often a drag to think otherwise.
But it's gibberish because people get pulled into looking in the wrong place for free will.
You sit there and you got to make a decision.
What flavor ice cream are you going to get or a decision?
Like, are you going to pull this trigger or not?
And you form an intent as to what you're going to do.
You're conscious of what your intent is.
You've got a pretty good guess what the consequence will be.
Most importantly, you know, you're not being forced to do this.
There are alternatives available for you and for most people and for our criminal
justice system, that's necessary and sufficient to show there was free will.
And there's a whole world of people who have been debating with really elegant
experiments, trying to locate when exactly does your brain form an intent
and when are you consciously aware of it?
And that's great.
But like, none of that has to do with free will because as you sit there and you have
this intent and you know that you have it and you know you don't have to act on it,
there's alternatives available to you.
None of that asks the only question you can ask, which is, so how did you turn out
to be the sort of person who would have that intent in that place and place and time?
And when you look at how you turned out to be that sort of person, your brain,
one second ago, your hormones this morning, your environment for decades,
how you were raised, your fetal stressors, your genes, your goal.
When you look at that, none of us had any control over how we turned out to be
the sort of person who would have the intents that we have, who would have
the wishes that we have, who would have the extent of willpower.
You can't will yourself to have more willpower.
You can't successfully wish to wish for something different than what you wish for.
And when you look at sort of the mechanics of how we become, who we turned out to be,
that's where you see there's no room for free will there.
All we are is the end products of our biological histories interacting
with our environmental histories over which we had no control.
Well, if that's the case, I'll play devil's advocate or apologist, often religious
apologist, then how could you ever chastise or punish the child for stealing
the candy out of the store?
How could you ever jail a murderer if it was never their choice?
Well, this is where we get into some really thin ice, because if you follow
through the logical implications of this, blaming and punishing anybody ever
as a virtue in and of itself is not only intellectually insupportable,
it's ethically insupportable.
Likewise, praising and rewarding anybody because that's virtuous to do that makes
no sense either because nobody earned anything.
None of us had any control over who we became.
None of us are entitled to any more or less consideration than anybody else.
And amid that, yeah, punishment and reward can be very good instrumental tools.
And that could be very effective at shaping behavior now and then.
And certainly, some of that goes into child rearing and some of that goes
into every aspects of our behavior.
But the notion that any sort of justice is being served when you punish someone
for behaviors they had no control over or reward someone else for behaviors
they had no control over, it is just a morally unacceptable world.
Oh, my God, people have conniptions at this point.
You're just going to have murderers running around on the streets, obviously not.
I mean, that was my first.
I I found myself literally sitting forward going, wait a minute,
do we not imprison the person who is is a murderer or potential
or, you know, who may murder again or, you know, for the protections of society?
There are so many layers to that onion.
But what someone hears on the surface is, well, hey, it wasn't their fault.
So eh, whatever, that's not what you're saying.
No, you've got to protect people from damaging individuals, regardless
of the fact that people become damaging because they were damaged.
You got to protect society from it.
But you do it in a way where you subtract free will, you subtract blame,
you subtract volition, you subtract rotten souls out of the whole equation.
Oh, my God, that's so difficult.
You know, it's a quarantine model.
Someone becomes dangerous.
You quarantine them so they can't harm other people.
You quarantine them the absolute minimum and not an inch more than that.
And you don't moralize them about how they're a bad person for needing
to be quarantined and you protect society from that.
Whoa, that is like so impractical.
We do it all the time.
We do it.
You got an airline pilot who has hay fever and they're taking antihistamines.
And as a result, they're drowsy.
And the law is something like if you're a pilot and you've taken antihistamines,
you can't fly for three days because you're dangerous.
You've got to protect people from drowsy pilots, not because they have
rotten souls and want to hurt somebody, but you quarantine them.
You can't fly, but you can do whatever else you want.
And it's not your fault that you got, you know, sneezing and that.
And we do that in all sorts of settings where we can protect society
from individuals who are capable of being damaging through no control of their own
without invoking culpability.
And here's one with a great historical sort of precedent to it.
You get some person, Middle East person driving along and from out of nowhere
with no prior history whatsoever, they have a grand mal seizure
and they lose control of the vehicle and they strike and kill someone in the process.
And this is totally heartbreaking and tragic.
But we do not sit there and say, oh, they evilly decided to have a seizure
and lose control of the car.
They could have prevented it.
No, of course, we don't say that.
And people used to say that throughout all of European history,
seizures were associated with demonic possession and people burned at the stake.
No, we don't blame somebody.
It's incredibly crappy luck that this person had a seizure from out of nowhere.
But we got to protect society.
We use a quarantine model and every state in the country has a law.
They vary in terms of the length of how long do you need to be seizure free
on the right meds in order to be able to drive again?
Not because the person is sleeping with Satan,
but they got like screwed up potassium channels in their head
and it's not their fault, but we got to protect society from them.
And we can do that now.
And that would have been unthinkable to somebody 400 years ago
where somebody had a seizure and in the process like, you know,
flung their arms around and bopped you on the head.
Obviously, they and their buddy, Satan, were working with intentionality.
It would have been inconceivable then to have a mindset of saying,
oh, it's a neurological disease.
It isn't the person's fault.
We need to do more research to know how to prevent it.
And but we got to make sure they're not driving
if there's a chance of them having a seizure.
And that's easy for us now.
And all we have to do is extrapolate and know that there are things
where we're sitting right now and it's intuitively obvious
that some people are rotten, mean people and other people are kind and all of that.
And like people can be who they want to be kind of stuff
to know that 400 years from now or 40 years from now,
whatever, we'll be looking back and saying, oh, my God,
I can't believe they used to think that one's capacity for empathy
was a product of free will.
Here's the biology of it.
And we and our judgments will seem just as primitive as people
who are saying epilepsy is a sign of demonic possession.
And in those cases, yeah, there's no blame.
There's no praise.
There's no special treatment.
There's no sense of entitlement.
There's no such thing as justice being served.
But nonetheless, you got to have a society in which dangerous people can't damage people.
And where you foster people with the capacity to do tough,
really useful things and like motivate them to do it.
How about your inbox is a fun place.
Right now, there are people who climbed on a table
and they're banging their fists on the top toward you right now.
I'm just going to let them and you have it out right now.
You've been very generous with your time before I let you go.
If I may, I want to bring in a friend of mine who is a paleontologist.
Her name is Erica.
She runs the gut sick given channel.
She is one of the smartest people I've ever met and she is a fan of yours.
And so I wanted to to just bring her in for a quick introduction
and see if she had a question or comment for you.
Erica, good to see you.
Well, hey, Seth. Hi, Dr.
Sapolsky, it's a pleasure to be here.
I'm sorry to kind of crash the interview.
But gosh, when I found out that Seth was interviewing you, I was like, oh, my gosh,
you know, you've been such a large inspiration to me for so long.
I was like, I'm simply going to have to ask for to drop in and and pester you for a moment.
It sounds good.
So I'm coming at this more from the I'll give you my background.
My my master's degree, I got in primatology out at
Roehampton over there and over, you know, in London.
And I'm currently a third year PhD student in biological anthropology.
So I'm on the morphology side of things.
I study like myosin apes and things of that nature.
But I sort of come from the school of behavioral ecology in living primates.
So, you know, your your work and on the on the primatology side of things,
I found to be supremely inspiring.
And I really enjoyed actually, I haven't read your your book on I believe it's called Determined,
but I finished behave this past Christmas and I really enjoyed it.
So I'm going to sort of ask a question that's that might not be expected.
That's a bit divergent from what you guys have been talking about with the free will stuff.
And I'd just like to hear your your favorite anecdote throughout the years of of your studies
regarding some of our closest living relatives.
Well, let's see, a number of them, a number were completely disastrous,
darting, attempting to anesthetize some of the baboons.
Probably the most exquisite moment I ever had in my 33 seasons of hanging out
with these baboons was one with my wife who came out and studied the baboons
also did her thesis on them.
And we had this incredibly ancient guy and the troop was the last one
from my original population in the late 1970s.
I'd always liked him.
He was this like gentle old guy.
He was a gentle young guy back when his he as far as we can tell,
he was like probably half blind at that point.
The kids, the infants hassled him because he was at the back of every progression.
We were sure he was he had picked off by hyenas and like very, very tentatively
we darted him, we anesthetized him, which is what some of the work was
with all the baboons in the troop and did a workup on him to see how his body was doing.
And when he woke up, you know, you put him in a holding cage
and then you open up the door and every baboon on earth runs out of there
barking and threatening and tear assing out of whatever this and we did it for him.
And he walked out slowly and he took a few steps and he sat down
and we did something that breaks all the rules of like field primatology.
We sat down next to him and we all sat there for a while.
And like we broke even more rules.
We had these like little in Kenya, they're called Malika biscuits
and Swahili Malika is angel.
These little angel biscuits and which are like cookies, shortbread cookie.
And we gave him a piece and we had some and just sitting there
like watching the zebras and watching the clouds with this guy who had been around
for 20 years from when things started with them.
This was like a moment to die for her, even though we were breaking all the
like Starship Enterprise rules of how you're supposed to be a primatologist.
So that was just an exquisite moment.
Dr. Sapolsky, you did a lot of work with baboons living among them.
I when I say it that way, it sounds like you're like climbing in the tree
and and you're actually part of the, you know, the troop.
But can you just in just in a moment tell everybody kind of what your background
is in this area of your work, please?
Yeah, I've kind of oscillated back and forth between two fields as a lab
neurobiologist to feel primatologist.
The common theme has been understanding stress in the lab.
What are the effects of stress on the brain?
What do particular stress hormones do?
Molecular biology of that can use genetically engineered neurons
to be more resistant to stress, blah, blah, all of that out with my baboons.
It was looking at these socially complicated beasts with these really,
really challenging, stressfully challenging societies and stuff and figuring
out whose bodies dealt better with stress than others who had the rotten
cholesterol levels, who had the bad blood pressure, all of that.
And what does that have to do with their social rank, their patterns
of social affiliation, their personality, which is a totally legit term
for other primates.
And that's what the darting was about, monitoring their bodies.
Wow, what's that?
That is our national geographic clock.
Each hour on the hour makes a different sound.
I was like, wow, he brought one of them back from Africa.
Our kids grew up with that and it is as did our dogs.
And it's amazing when we have like somebody over and we're all just sitting there
and like suddenly they hear like some hyena cackle or something.
And we don't respond.
The dogs don't look up.
Did they just hallucinate that sound because we're habituated to it?
So, yes, that's our national geographic.
I would think it'd be a social experiment.
You're actually watching their reaction as if they're in the wild kind of thing.
Yes, then we take urine samples.
Erika, did you have anything else for Dr.
Sapolsky before we call it?
I just want to make sure you've got a few minutes with it.
No, gosh, no, that was that was phenomenal to hear.
I, you know, I've done work in Kenya.
I go every summer and do and collect fossils over there in West Kenya,
kind of off in the core region.
And, you know, it's interesting to hear the softer side of baboons
because, you know, for us out there when the baboons crest the hill
and they're curious about you, it's quite intimidating to see, you know,
a group of a large group of dozens of baboons, especially the males,
hearing them coming with that barking sound.
You know, I prefer the verbates because they're so much,
you know, more docile comparatively, although they're really naughty.
Dr. Sapolsky, though, wasn't there a story that you had told
that you were studying a troupe of baboons and they got tuberculosis
and you disappeared and left that work for a decade, came back
and there was a noticeable change in their behavior.
They were more docile, more cooperative.
Did I read that right?
Yeah, it was a very rare, artificial, unlikely circumstance,
having to do with the presence of humans where it wound up half the males
and the troupe died of tuberculosis and it wasn't random, which half.
It was the males who were most aggressive and least socially
affiliative and this left you with a troupe that was female dominated
and much nicer male baboons left there and they developed
and this is an OK word to use.
They developed a social culture that had much less aggression,
much more social affiliation.
Males did not displace aggression onto females when they were in a bad mood.
And the most amazing thing was, as you said,
I gave up on that troupe after that and didn't look at them for a decade.
But coming back, yeah, they were still like that, but it was new males.
By then, male baboons grow up someplace else, leave their home
troupe at puberty and transfer into this new one.
And over this decade, they were being repopulated by young jerk
male baboons who had grown up out in the big bad normal baboon world.
And they showed up and somehow it took about six months for them to learn.
We don't do stuff like that here.
And I did a ton of work trying to figure out what was the mechanism
for the cultural transmission in them.
So that said, nonetheless, they were still scary.
I do not love baboons.
They're obscene, backstabbing guys.
And that's why they're good for studying psychological stress.
But this particular guy was wonderful.
When I read the story, I must have read it wrong because I was thinking
you had left and there hadn't been direct contact and they all had done
philosophy or something.
They all sat around the base, they had a meeting and thought,
well, let's become more civilized.
It is time for us to evolve to a higher echelon of baboon.
But that's not that's not what happened.
That was kind of a one off because of human intervention.
Go ahead, Erica.
I'm so curious because I remember that anecdote as well.
And I thought that was so fascinating because, you know, in paleoanthropology,
there's this big question of paramatology as well.
Like, was the common ancestor of humans in chimpanzees more chimplike
or more human like?
And they have these disparate social systems, one being more female
dominated or co-dominant and the other being more male dominated.
And they're just separated by this one river.
It makes you wonder.
I remember reading that and thinking to myself, I wonder if something similar
happened in the common ancestor of the Panans, where you got perhaps this
more violent, more linear dominance, hierarchy oriented group of Panan
that for whatever reason, they see the more aggressive individuals
kind of culled from the group.
And then they end up with this sort of female structure to it,
more co-dominant structure, I guess I should say to it.
But I think that's so fascinating to just mull over and it's speculative.
Yeah, that or ecological models where you have very, very dispersed resources.
So you can't get big territorial troops.
You can't get males dominating a whole bunch of female.
Yeah, all sorts of different routes by which you get that.
Well, I could just leave you two in a room and probably go on vacation.
But I'm going to.
I'd hold him captive of conversation.
I've got so I could just ask him questions all day long.
You've got to cut me off.
I was thinking 45 minutes, but I've just I just can't couldn't let him go.
So we've we hit the hour mark.
By the way, we were talking about his dog.
This is my this is Linus.
He is a descendant of the wolf.
And so he's he sits with me occasionally when we are doing the hard work
of pointing and clicking here.
But Eric, it's always good to see you and Dr.
Sapolsky, you are such a good educator and you're such a wonderful communicator.
Storyteller, I've got your lectures up here this week as I was prepping
for the interview listening again.
And I'm just struck by how good a science communicator you are.
You know, it's one thing to have the data, which I think there's so much
good data to have somebody who communicates it in the way that you do.
That's just rare and it's it's really exceptional.
So thank you for your work and and thanks for being here.
You thanks for having me on.
Take care. Good luck.
