Yeah, we're like backups. We love net net Netflix quality
productions. Okay, well, in which case let's kick off. So
we've we've had a couple of technical problems with the
stream. So now we're going to go pre recorded instead, which
is absolutely fine. So we're going to talk about quite a few
things today. Now, one big theme I think is talking about an
activism and the kind of compatibility between the free
energy principle and an activism. We're going to talk
about. Now we have to be very careful how we pronounce this
words auto poetic. Is that right, Maxwell? That's right. Yes.
Amazing. So forgive me when I get it wrong. I'm going to get it
wrong. I'm sorry. So we're talking about auto poetic and
activism, which of which of course was the brainchild of
Varela. And there's an interesting paper that came out,
which was actually quite critical of FEP. We're going to
talk about some of the points in that paper. And that was called
laying down a forking path tensions between an action and
the free energy principle. And in that paper, there were a few
areas. So there was the definition of auto poesis
historicity. So we're talking about temporal sequence
invariance and non steady state equilibria and what it means to
be a Gothic. There was this critique about the non station
arity of distributions. And also a really interesting
discussion about internalism versus externalism, because of
course, the the inactive view is is a form of externalized
cognition, which is this very interesting view that you have
cognizizing elements outside of the mind in the environment
around you. So we'll talk about that as well. We'll touch on
goal directedness and also structure learning, which is a
really, really exciting thing in in any any Bayesian cognitive
framework. Now on the call today, we have obviously, first of
all, Professor Carl Friston, the inventor of the free energy
principle and active inference, a man who requires no
introduction whatsoever. Professor Friston, welcome to the
show. Great to be back.
Fabulous. We also have Dr. Maxwell Ramstead, one of the top
scholars in the free energy principle and the active
inference literature. Of course, we've had Maxwell on very
recently, but welcome back Maxwell.
Always a pleasure, gentlemen. Amazing. And we also have a new
face. Professor Buckley, would you like to introduce yourself?
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, my I'm a faculty member at the University
of Sussex, but I also work with versus with Maxwell and Carl. So
I have a background originally in physics in postgraduate in
physics, and then moved into cognitive robotics was kind of
working in behavior based robotics, and an activism somewhat
early on my my PhD, moved into kind of theoretical neuroscience,
and kind of really got interested in the free energy
principle about eight or nine or so years ago and wrote a review
on it. Originally, you know, wanted to challenge it and
then eventually fell in love with it and now think it's the
right way to go for it for what we ought to do. So I came as a
skeptic and then have been bashed into into into place. Do you
think now this is is the correct way to think about things?
Amazing. Well, let's let the bashing commence. Well, we'll
move straight on to the subject of an activism. So there is this
paper laying down a forking path tensions between an action and
the free energy principle. And the name is very hard to
pronounce it was Esquil de Paolo. Paolo.
Okay, thank you so much for that. Now, just just to be fair to
them, because Maxwell, you did actually couch FEP as an
activism 2.0, despite the an activist rejection of information
methods. And maybe we should start by defining an activism.
And also, there's some similarities with this other
idea called ecological psychology. So why don't why don't we
just start by framing some of these ideas up?
That sounds good. Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
Did you have like a pre prepared definition you wanted to
share? Do you want us to riff on this?
Well, why don't why don't we start with Varela's an activism? So
there are some so it's in terms of philosophy, there are hints of
existentialism and phenomenology and Eastern influences and
focus on lived experience and stuff like that. One of the the
core things is that they reject information processing and
computationalism. They focus on actions and interactions.
It's a very embodied tradition. So why don't we just kind of
start with that?
Okay, yeah, that's a great way to set it up. Well, I mean, we
should probably just add a little bit of context and a few
caveats before launching into this. So I think Chris and I are
of the generation that was trained in the inactive embodied
tradition. I would describe myself as a reformed inactivist.
I don't know if Chris you resonate with that.
I still believe in activism. Yeah.
So these, the inactive approach is one of the so called
four e approaches that have become very popular since the
90s. And I would argue is, at least in in the more
philosophically informed corners of cognitive science and
neuroscience, basically the dominant theoretical paradigm
right now. So it we have to say there's a this is a broad
church of approaches that go from a more kind of minimalist
recognition that cognition involves bodily processes to
the more radical approaches that you were describing earlier
that just wholesale reject information theory, the computation
the computational metaphor for mind that mind is basically a
kind of computing device. And yeah, the inactive approach
grew out of auto poetic theory. They're distinct. It's
important to say so auto poetic theory was developed by Maturana
and Barrela sometime in the 1980s and 90s. And it was a very
mechanistic approach to mind. I mean, you know, some of the
early kind of flagship papers in this tradition are what the
frogs I tells the frogs brain and this kind of stuff. So you
know, hard nosed kind of systems biology type thinking. And I
mean, there was basically a break in the literature where due
to Barrela, in a lot of ways, the emphasis moving from kind of
mechanistic models to phenomenology to a kind of more
dynamic, coupling, interactive kind of mode of explanation. So
yeah, the inactive approach is basically committed to this
idea, fundamentally that cognition is basically bringing
about a world, a structured world of meaning and
significance, through adaptive, appropriate actions left in the
world. So the the slogan is, you know, yeah, exactly constructing
this meaning, you know, laying down a path and walking, I think
is the slogan, the poetic slogan form that's so popular. Yeah,
and in its more radical inclinations, this inactive
approach says, dynamical systems is really the way to study
systems that have mind. And so the kind of the background
assumption there is that there's a fork in the path in the road
somewhere, you know, where we have to choose between information
theory and dynamics. And yeah, they obviously go down the
dynamics path. So I think that's a setup. And before launching
into criticism, I should say that we as a community, genuinely
appreciate and benefit from friendly critical engagement. So I
just want to caveat all this by saying that the criticism comes
from a place of wanting to build community from a place from our
hearts, basically. And yeah, although I'm going to be saying
a lot of critical stuff about the inactive approach. In my
heart, I'm an inactivist, I think just that the a lot of the
methodology and explanatory constructs that are leveraged in
the approach are problematic. And in particular, you see this
come out when the free energy principle comes into play. So
Chris, do you want to add anything to that definition?
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like, I see, I'm going to use this
kind of phraseology was in one of Carl's books, which is a low
road and a high road and activism. I basically was brought up a
low road and activist rights. So this is kind of rejection of
representationalism in cognitive architectures. It was a move
away from good old fashioned artificial intelligence to
embedded and embodied agents. So this is kind of the origin in
Rodney Brooks's behavior based approaches to robotics. And those
are the kinds of ideas I still embrace. And then there's the
kind of high road and activism, which kind of embraces
auto poisons and operational closure at its heart. And I
mean, to me, I mean, if you're if you're a high load, an
activist, they are the same thing, they are they come from the
same place. But I think there's a kind of there is a there are
messages to take from an activism on the low road, which are
super important for cognition, right, without kind of going into
the depths of the auto poisons. Just in terms of like the
language, I think, I think there is a split between dynamical
systems theory, which is kind of the origins of descriptions of
automatic systems and information theory. But that
community has begun to embrace, you know, a little bit of
information theory, but it tends to has been done through kind
of phenomenological models, simple models, rather than kind of
have this kind of theoretical angle or deep theoretical basis
in something like Bayes that like we do. I mean, I to that
paper, I read it before we come to me, it doesn't seem, you
know, some of the language is quite dismissive. But to me, it
seems an opportunity to see whether we can reconcile these
frameworks. And I think they've done a nice job in pointing
where there are maybe things we can express better within the
free energy principle that kind of address things like
operational closure. I feel that this community sometimes feels
like it has to be divided. But I'm very much an inclusive person.
So, you know, some really nice dialogue between people in an
activism and what we do in the active inference and the free
energy principle.
Interesting. I mean, I'll bring Professor Fritzen in in just a
second. But I was reading this very interesting paper by by
Maxwell, written in, I think it was 2019, multi scale integration
or internalism and I was 21. Okay, so it's the multi scale
integration paper. And, you know, of course, this this an active
philosophy is all about externalism. So, you know, you
actually have these cognizing elements outside of of where the
brain is. And in a way, it's, there's this Helm-Hopsian sharp
separation between the organism and the environment, which is
perhaps embraced by neuroscientists. But the interesting
thing about the free energy principle is, is I think it
maintains some vagueness about this notion of whether it's an
internalist system, where you have strong representations and
predictive power about what's going on in the world around you,
versus being this kind of dynamical externalist, inactive
type system. And in that paper, Maxwell, you are saying that
well, actually, we can integrate the two views because you can
have these nested boundaries. And as Professor Fritzen has
said, human minds, the reason we have this temporal depth of
planning and sophistication and representation building and so
on, is because we're at the top of the stack. But there's many,
many layers below us, where perhaps it is more of an inactive
externalized form of cognition. So we can kind of speak to both
worlds. But Professor Fritzen, perhaps you could come in on
that.
Yeah, I was frightened, you were going to ask me, well, if I had
anything to add about inactivism, because I haven't, I'm here to
find out whether I'm an inactivist or not. So at the end,
if somebody can tell me whether I'm an inactivist, I'd be
very grateful. There's probably some nuanced version of it,
like a moderate, epistemological inactivist. So I think, I mean,
that last point, Tim, I think is a really interesting one. And in
fact, I just reviewed a paper for synthese yesterday, I think
touching upon this issue from a philosophical perspective, very
simply, the free energy principle basically will accommodate
both perspectives. It rests upon an externalist view of the
universe as a random dynamical system, that just by equipping
that system with a partition that separates something from
everything else, then induces an internalist explanation for the
way that thing makes sense of its universe. So there is a
necessary enmeshing of both the externalist and the internalist
perspectives. Put it another way, the internalist perspective is
entirely licensed in terms of the interpretation of self
organisation as a process of inference. And you're with that
an explicit commitment to a certain kind of representationalism.
But that only inherits from the way you start from, which is
an externalist view of the thing in an external world with a
particular metaphysics here described in terms of random
dynamical systems. And it's interesting, also, you pick up on
this fork in the road, which I confess, I completely, I do not
understand. All interesting information theory read as
probability theory that is used in physics inherits from
dynamical systems. You know, we're talking thing ranging
things ranging from the master equation through to scrolling as
wave equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, comrade forward
equations, all of these are information theoretic treatments
of dynamical systems. So I don't really understand the nature of
this fork. So I probably should now pass it back to you.
Well, can I follow up on that, Chris? And then maybe you can
answer it. I don't get it either. And so what what confuses me
about it is, one of the the brilliant things about the free
energy principle, to me, is this exact connection between random
dynamical systems of a certain degree of complexity, let's say
approaching autopoetic, right? And, and this behavior that they
must manifest in order to, to be what they are, right, which is
which is this balancing between between, you know, uncertainty
and prediction and that sort of thing. So to me, they're hand
in glove. And so I guess my question to you, Chris, since
you're going to jump in there is, what is the source of this
conflict? Like, is it a fear that if it's linked, if you link
the information and dynamics in this certain way that they have
to conform to this principle that we're all going to be put out
of work, or we're not going to be able to study the things we
want to study?
You might if I just quickly interject with a little bit of
context. Okay. Just to I wanted to elaborate a little bit on
what Carl said, because I think there were some things in here
that might move in what Carl said that might not be clear to the
audience so that bears repeating. The first is that there's this
idea that Markov blankets kind of seclude the organism from the
environment. This is sort of like the Helmholtz style story,
where our relationship to the environment is in some sense only
indirect, and we are separated from the environment by our Markov
blanket. The important thing to point out is that just
definitionally, the Markov blanket comprises the set of
degrees of freedom that separate and couple systems together. So
it's not the veil, it's the interface. So that's the first
thing to point out. So a radically internalist
interpretation of the free energy principle doesn't work,
because you actually need external states to be in play for
the math tour. If there are no external states, then there's
nothing to track, and there's nothing beyond the Markov blanket,
so you don't get the story started, like it doesn't get off the
ground. If you don't assume that there are these things that the
particle in question that the thing that you're interested in is
attuning to, so there needs to be something to couple and to be
separated from for the story to get off the ground. So yeah, it's
a, if you write down your dynamical systems equations, it's
always the generative model that we keep talking about is
defined over your internal blanket and external states. So
that's the first point. What Carlos says is the other the other
way around, too, which is if you're empty of all internal
states, and every single state you have can be influenced from
the outside, well, there's less to talk about.
Well, then you're not a thing strictly speaking, right? That so,
you know, it's it's definitional to what it is to be a thing to
have this kind of interface between that thing and other
things. So that's a first point. So the internal states as
you're pointing out do play an asymmetric role. So the FEP
says if you have this boundary, then the internal states are
going to parameterize the belief about external states. So you
do get this kind of internalist looking thing going as well. So
the there is I think a kind of reconciliation of internalism
and externalism under the free energy principle. This is what
the 2019 paper that you are referring to is about. It's
called multi scale integration. And that's precisely the idea
that things that look separated at one scale can be integrated
within, you know, the auspices of an overarching structure at the
scale above and so on and so on and so on. We're separate as
individuals, but we're coupled in this active inference
community. And, you know, arguably, there's an
intentionality also at play there. Same thing for ourselves,
right? Our cells are separate because they have their
individual boundaries, but then they're integrated on the time
scale of me as an organism and so on. So that's that was about
internalism and externalism. I wanted to speak quickly to the
split between dynamics and information theory. Whenever I
talked to my friends in high end mathematics about this, they
are always as perplexed as you know, Keith and Carl, you are
because it's a nonsensical starting point. To do dynamical
systems theory seriously, you at some point are going to need to
appeal to information theoretic measures. So for example,
distances in state space. So, you know, the inactivists are
all fun, you know, they like to appeal to dynamical systems
theory and stuff, but the systems that they're considering
are usually extremely simple, with a few degrees of freedom
that are coupled together. But if you want to do like, you
know, grown up dynamical systems theory, then you're going to
need to appeal to things like information length to describe
the really the metrics on your state space, you can't avoid
that. Similarly, when we're talking about information,
we're talking about dynamical, you know, the dynamic time
course of the these coupling. So we're interested in the
dynamics of information, these things are not actually
separable. The idea that they are comes from philosophy,
actually, it's a set of papers from the basically late 80s,
early 90s by Van Gelder and Port. And at the time, you know,
dynamical systems theory was a new thing in cognitive science.
And what they were saying was, Hey, there's this approach that
we can take, it's dynamical systems, it's not computational.
And basically, it moved from there to there's an there's
this alternative approach that's mutually incompatible. And
that shift kind of happened slowly by a self referential
literature. So, you know, this is where I'm going to be a bit
critical. You can really do the historiography and trace these
claims back to, I mean, basically Van Gelder and Port, and to
some extent Gibson. But these folks, they don't offer a formal
argument, right? Like, they're not saying here's a proof that
dynamical systems and computational approaches are
like incompatible. They're just starting with this gut feeling
that, Hey, maybe there's something different here. And
then that turns into, I would argue, sclerotic sizes or like
hardens into like an a priori dogmatism, that isn't necessary.
Yeah, exactly. That is just based, like I was saying, on this
kind of circular, you know, we're just citing other
philosophers who cite other philosophers who are making
this stuff up at the bottom. So, yeah, I mean, I kind of
feel like this is a problem with the philosophy literature is
like, you know, taking just conceptual arguments from other
philosophers, maybe a bit more seriously than they should,
without really taking the time to do the proper historiography,
looking where these claims are originating, and then asking
the question, is there any real warrant for this kind of
separation? So yeah, I've been going around recently saying
that yeah, this split between dynamics and information
theory is mostly in people's imaginations. There's no
mathematical basis for it.
And Chris, sorry for the interjection.
You want to jump in? No, no, thank you. Wanted to jump in
earlier and maybe talk about your personal journey might come
into play here.
Yeah, I mean, Maxwell's, you know, said some really
interesting stuff there. I mean, I guess I take a slightly less
hard line on that, right? I mean, I think it's a historical
thing. So Tim van Gelder, we're looking at deterministic
dynamical systems theory like this is in the absence of noise.
And unless you do ensembles of systems, it's not there's no
clear pathway then to information theory. And then initially
in models, when in the 80s and 90s, typically deterministic
dynamical systems theory is looking at bifurcations and so
on. And then, but obviously the richer, the richer set of
descriptions is stochastic dynamical systems theory. And
that's when information theory becomes irreplaceable, right?
This become and then we've come fully in meshed these these
descriptions as Carl writes about so nicely and lots of his
work, right? But I think, you know, I didn't see the forking
path is kind of this. I know in the community that there's a
history of using dynamical systems theory, and there's a
sense in which the free energy is really embraced information
theory. I didn't see that that's as a key, the for the key in
the fork of the path, right? I mean, I got to say that it's way
out of my area, this kind of depth of philosophy, but it
seemed to me the kind of the problem of operate the definition
of operational closure that seems to be upsetting to Randall
Behran is equal to power. And the fact that they don't think
that can be embraced by the tenants of the free energy
principle. I mean, I think they made a nice case. I don't
think a priori that's the case. I can't see there was a hands
down argument that there is this forking path. I still think
it's an interesting angle to take to think deeply about
operational closure within the free energy principle is Maxwell
has, and he's going to tell you the answers to this. But I'm
you know, so I'm just aware of the trickiness in defining
operational closure that's happened in the literature in
the last 20 years. And they're really in an inability to kind
of really get a concrete, quantitative description of what
we mean by operational closure. And so, you know, I guess it's
to say that we've simply solved it within the free energy
principle that might have put some backs up somewhere. But, you
know, Maxwell's maybe can give you a bit more insight to this
because he's thought deeply about how to define operational
closure within the free energy.
Can I frame it up for you, Maxwell? So the paper quoted you
actually, I think you said on one of your papers that there is an
analogy, almost a direct mapping between this concept of
organizational closure and a Markov blanket. And of course,
the Markov blanket is this conditional independence that
you're talking about. And you also called it an interface
earlier on. And when they speak about the definition of
auto poises, they say that I think the way that you folks in
the FEP literature culture is mostly as a form of autonomy,
which is this ability to maintain your own identity
under precarious position, you know, situations. And they say,
well, the Varela kind of definition of auto poises is
very much about structure and organization. So it's not it's
not just maintaining your own identity, but but it's about
this self organization and this kind of generating structure as
well. So I wanted to just just with those things on the table,
could could you, could you
absolutely. So in that paper, I confess that I probably should
have spoken, we probably should have spoken a bit more
precisely. We say the Markov blanket formalism. What we mean
by that is, and I don't think that this was fully appreciated by
the authors at the time. What we mean is Markov blankets and the
generative models, right? Because the claim is, right,
let's remind the audience, just put the terms on the table. A
generative model, right, is our model of the dependencies that
link the states and parameters that make up a given system,
right? So it is our way of talking about basically the causal
connective tissue or structure that underwrites a given system.
And what the free energy principle says is, if the
underlying system has is disconnected in a certain
appropriate way, then you get this tracking behavior. And
formally speaking, it says, if there's a Markov blanket in
this dependency structure, right, if conditioned on certain
blanket states, then it looks as if subsets of the system are
independent from each other, but also tracking each other, then
you know, you get you get this interesting behavior, like if
there is this Markov blanket is if there is this independent
structure, then you will get this tracking behavior. That's what
the free energy principle is talking about. So of course,
it's not sufficient to say that things are carved out in a
specific way. And therefore, you know, you can say interesting
things about them. But I think what's missed in the argument,
and this has to do with like, you know, I think the app, the,
I'll say provocatively, the dogmatic commitment to
anti representationalism is like what when the inactivists read
generative model, they mean a model in my head that I carry
around, they hear like a representation, right? But what's
really at stake is the generative model is the dependency
structure, right? So if you have the right kind of dependency
structure that generates a Markov blanket, I would say that
you have what the inactivists call operational closure. In
fact, you can show this mathematically, it's I don't
think it's appreciated. But there is a duality that has been
rigorously established. Dalton shock to body bell is probably
the main proponent of this work. But you know, Carl has done a
lot of work over the last two decades in this direction. Yeah,
I think the kind of core idea to remember is that minimizing
your variational entropy with your variational free energy with
respect to a generative model, right? So the usual free energy
story, right, is dual to or equivalent to maximizing your
entropy with respect to a set of constraints. So when the
inactivists talk about constraint closure and all this
stuff, you know, Alicia Gerero's new book, context changes
everything, the inactivists in the auto poetic tradition really
want to go hard on this and say, Well, what you really need to
do is map a set of constraints, such that the system kind of
self generates, well, that is rigorously and absolutely
equivalent to minimizing your free energy with respect to a
generative model, there's no difference there. So we're talking
about the same thing. We're talking about the way that like a
set of structured dependencies generates a thing that's able to
sustain itself over time. And as I was saying, this, this
sustained over time is a way of describing the interface or
coupling between the system and its environment. So that just
mathematically, we're talking about the same thing.
Actually, let me, but let me ask you a question here, because
there's, and this is hopefully because I like Carl, I want to
find out if I'm an inactivist. So maybe, maybe you can help set
us up for considering this a big bone of contention for them in
that paper, is this distinction that they have in their mind
between structure and organization. And they seem to get
upset when any attempt is made to link organization to
structure. For example, you know, to me, the Markov boundary
that say analogous to a, a animal cell membrane, I
understand as a former person who studied biology, that the
molecules of that membrane are in flux, things come and go,
proteins are added, carbohydrates are removed, etc. I
don't have in my mind a set of molecules that's like they're
forever, and some type of like, you know, stationary structure,
like it's a very dynamic kind of system. But they seem to say,
Oh, no, if you equate, if you equate, you know, a Markov
boundary to an organizational structure, then you're making
this, you know, fallacy of kind where you're associating like
an organization with like the substrate that, you know,
manifests that in reality. Like, can you explain to me like what
they were actually up and out with this organization structure?
You know, maybe Carl, if you could comment on it when Maxwell
tells us so we can figure out if we're an activist.
So I'll just let me bracket the stuff about stationarity and
historicity for one second. Because I have some stuff to say
about that. But so it comes back to that we'll come back to
the question about that.
It comes back to what I was saying about, you know, it's not
just about Markov blankets, it's about generative models. If
you don't appreciate the distinction, and what you think
we're saying is Markov blankets tell the whole story, then
obviously, you're going to, you know, think that we're conflating
structure and organization. When you realize that what we're
talking about is, you know, a Markov blanket within this
dependency structure, right, then I think you you move to
something else, I would say like what the inactivist call
structure corresponds to these Markov blankets that we're
drawing. And the organization we talk about, and we harness in
the generative model, right, that remember, the generative
model is not my internal representation in my head, it's
the overall dependency structure of the system. It's what
they would call the organization of the system. So I mean, I
would agree that we shouldn't conflate them. And I would, you
know, add that we don't, that there are distinct constructs
that map onto these things. And you know, I would also point
out that Markov blankets are flexible. We will be putting out
work over the next few months on wandering Markov blankets,
like we've got that figured out algorithmically now, we can draw
a blanket around a flame and stuff like that now. So we've
got all of that working. And it's not looking forward to that
since Carl mentioned it in the first, the first interview with
let's, let's set an anchor to come back to that because that
that's very interesting. Actually, one comment you made in
your multi scale paper was that these are ontological
boundaries by which I think you are implying that they are not
a lens, they are fixed to some extent. But I want to just stick
on on this organization point for a second. So in the paper,
they said that essentially the way the FEP couches this as a
form of homeostasis, which is just about you know, maintaining
structural properties. And when they spoke about organization,
they said the conservation of organization is what's spoken
about in the classic orthopedic literature. And I think you are
just making the argument Maxwell that that that generative
model is in some sense the conservation of organization. So
is that the missing link? I mean, maybe a Professor Friston, you
can come in.
Yeah, do you want to take that Carl? I mean, I think that's
right, that Carl will probably comment more eloquently than I
on that. I don't think so. I think you're being very eloquent.
Thank you. Do your worse and then I'll chip in if necessary.
Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's exactly right. Like the
Markov blankets don't have to be permanent. They can be
shifting and basically minimizing your free energy with
respect to some generative model corresponds to keeping some
structure in play. Yeah, actually, this segues nicely into
the stuff about stationarity and historicity. I think this is
the biggest problem in their paper. They claim that the free
energy principle can't account for historicity, in the sense
that it can't account for path dependency, right? So for our
audience, path dependency is this idea that it's not just your
position in state space that matters, it's also your
velocity, roughly speaking, right? That like the kind of
direction that you're going in, where you came from is just as
important to where you're going as where you are currently.
And they claim that, you know, the free energy, so they make a
bunch of false claims about the free energy principle, which
leads them astray. So for example, they claim that the free
energy principle assumes stationarity. It doesn't. As we've
discussed before, there are different applications of the
free energy principle in the literature, the two main
families of applications are density dynamics and path
integrals. So I drink a lot of coffee. And if you were to
sample me at random during the day, I would say there's a one
in 25 chance. Yeah, exactly. I would say there's a one in 25
chance that I'm drinking coffee if you just sample me randomly
during the day. If you were to sample me over a week, once per
day, there's a 100% chance that I would drink coffee per day,
right? So there's a difference between looking at the
probability of states of me, you know, a Maxwell is drinking
coffee, and the probabilities of paths of me or entire
trajectories of me. And that is a really critical distinction.
The free energy principle started off as a path based
formulation. And I think this is absolutely underappreciated in
the literature. If you look back at Carl's early papers,
including the ones that everyone has read, right, the
2010 unified brain theory paper in nature. Yeah, these are all
written in terms of paths. Carl is taking like a sensory path
and then writing down, you know, blanket paths and internal
paths. And it's all, it's all about the way the trajectories
of the system are maintained. So this is a cool idea that was
there before and that we're doubling back down on now, which
is that it's really, it's about blanket paths that make
internal paths independent of external paths. So there's a
sense in which like, it's always been about counterfactual
futures. It's, and it's difficult to argue that, like, you
don't account for historicity when literally, the core
construct that you're deploying is, like probabilities of
different histories, like counterfactual futures. But
that entire argument about historicity makes no sense
formally, just absolute, you know, and again, we appreciate
the critical engagement. This isn't to, you know, bash
anyone specifically, but like, this is a complete non
starter mathematically. Also, when you're doing density
dynamics, right, when you're not considering probability
densities over paths, but rather you're considering
probabilities of states, and you're doing this non
equilibrium steady state stuff. So when you are assuming
stationarity, you're saying like, yeah, there are these kind of
regular cyclical behaviors that I want to model, even in that
context, the free energy principle can handle path
dependence, like literally, I think on page 12 of like Carl's
monograph of 2019, on the density dynamics formulations,
there are already terms that contain, you know, expressions
that are able to handle path dependency, that are basically
dependent on changes in surprise in your system. So neither
before we before we move too far, maybe Chris, you can, you
might be able to steal man what the paper was trying to say
there. Or
why I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to understand, I'm trying
to decide if I'm an inactivist, because Tim's a big fan. So I
want to, you know, give it fair judge anyone, does anybody
want to steal man, you know, where the paper might have been
coming from, in terms of this argument against historicity?
I can straw man it if you want. No, I'm happy to have a go at it.
But I mean, so we're a very broad church at within this
community. And we debate within ourselves about the true
origins and how we get these things out. So I actually was
worried about this historicity thing. In an earlier version,
we did in, we published in Physics for Life Reviews with a
student, a very talented student of mine. And we found real
problems with it when we were in a state based formulation of
the system. And I know Maxwell feels that that even in the
state based description of probability densities that we
can recover historicity, I guess, we still not complete
agreement on that. But what's majorly happened in the in the
free energy is this movement to pass. And I agree, Maxwell, if
you go back into Carl's original work, talking like Carl was not
here, but you're back to Carl's original work, he was framing
it in terms of paths. But the presentations in the monograph
were to do to do with states. And when we work through that,
we found that the historicity was hard to get back into these
systems. But the path formalization then makes it
clear how historicity because it's built into the system
because you're preserving sets of paths you got, you know, home
your recess rather than home your stasis in the descriptions of
these systems. And then there's this kind of nice, elegant way to
deal with historicity. And, you know, and I think so I don't
think that's a real issue with the free energy principle. So
but I can imagine, I don't know what technical literature they've
read. But perhaps if they've read the state based formalize
formulation, they had the same worries about those about
historicity. And if they read these news, perhaps based off the
Maxwell and Dalton developing, I think those kind of dissolve.
I think that it's a much richer framework now.
So maybe Carl, what were you thinking back then, when you did
it as paths, you know, maybe just give us some some thought
behind your intuition for why you originally formulated it as you
know, path, path integrals for past systems and you know, what
your perspective is on what we've been discussing so far.
Right. I can't really remember. I suppose the obvious answer is
much of this inherits from Richard Feynman's work on the
pathological formulation, indeed, the Bayesian free energy can be
traced right back to, I think probably his PhD thesis, I haven't
actually read the PhD thesis, but I've been told that all the
maths you need is there. So it would be difficult for me to
conceive of a calculus that wasn't framed in terms of in terms
of paths, until you start to try and draw graphics and explain to
people who are not familiar with, you know, with the notion of
pathological formulation and its equivalence with density
dynamics as articulated, say with the Fokker-Planck equation or
I repeat, sort of Colm-McRough forward and backward
equations. So I think that is, you know, that's one really
important aspect of historicity and becomes I think even more
prescient when you think about deploying a pathological
formulation of self-organisation in the context of 21st century
physics, because what we're talking about now is a move away
from 20th century equilibrium physics with pointer tractors to
open systems that are far from equilibrium. So mathematically,
a one mathematical bright line between the physics of equilibrium
and the physics of non-equilibrium, which is what the free
energy principle is about, or specifically, when non-equilibrium
say state solutions admit a Markov blanket, but returning to
the sort of what is definitive of non-equilibrium, it is
effectively the, not the historicity, but the itinerancy you
get from solenoidal dynamics, sort of conservative dynamics
that now supplement the dissipative flows that characterise
completely classical physics and equilibrium, equilibrium
steady states. So if you wanted to define the difference between
an open system or an out of equilibrium or non-equilibrium
system from an equilibrium system, the simple kind of systems
that Chris was referring to in his toy models of does a free
energy principle work in this kind of system, then all you would
do is write down the dynamics in terms of dissipative and
conservative or non-dissipative divergence free components. And
that, if you like, decomposition of the flow into
conservative and dissipative parts is just the Helmholtz
decomposition, it's just the fundamental number of variational
calculus, I think, or fundamental theorem, which just says that
you know, any flow, any dynamics can always be decomposed into
this sort of gradient descent that underwrites classical
physics, or equilibrium physics, and the a solenoidal
divergence free flow that underwrites classical mechanics.
But you put the two together and you have, by definition, now
a mathematical image of non-equilibrium systems. And notice
that in introducing this kind of itinerancy, that is, for
example, you know, heuristically, you know, water going down a
plug hole, so the dissipative part, the gradient flow would be
the water tumbling down into the depths of your house. But as
it circulates around, technically, in terms of the information
theory around, on ISO contours, the probability distribution,
but you can just visualize the water circular, that's the
solenoidal part. And of course, when you talk about biotic
self-organization, or self-organization in non-equilibria
that has that sort of life-like or biotic form, the key
characteristic of this kind of biotic circulation is basically
rhythms and life cycles. So the very fact you're dealing with
this kind of a historicity that is inherent in the itinerancy of
any system that is not at equilibrium means that you are, you
have to write down or have an understanding or a mathematics
that deals with these flows and these life cycles. Just one
little interesting twist here is if you take the randomness out
of this, if you go back to deterministic dynamical systems
of the kind, I now understand under the split or the fork in
the road in philosophy, what you do is you're basically removing
from the perspective of the Helmholtz decomposition, the
dissipative part, and you just left with the conservative part.
What is that? That's just Newtonian mechanics. It's a classical
mechanics, which is why the sun, we rotate around the sun or the
moon takes these orbits. This is just this solenoidal flow in the
limit that you've ignored the randomness that calls for the
information theory or probabilistic descriptions of any
world. So the free energy principle doesn't deal with all kinds
of systems. It deals with systems that have an admixture of
both the dissipative and the solenoidal or divergence free
parts. If you wanted to just do the dissipative parts, you do
quantum mechanics. If you just wanted to do the solenoidal
part, you do classical mechanics and deterministic systems.
But in the middle, you're in the Goldilocks regime in which you
and I operate, we're talking about stochastic chaos, basically,
another description of this itinerancy. So I think that
that's one aspect of historicity, which is celebrated in the physics
of self-organization. And I keep using the word self-organization
because I read auto-poesis as self-creation, or at least self
maintenance. I now appreciate it's not quite self, it's slightly
beyond self maintenance and in the sense that to create, imply
something slightly greater, that maybe I'm going to have to ask
Chris, it may be related to operational closure. So I'd like
to, if somebody can just describe for me and the audience when
operational closure is, that would be quite nice. But before you
do, there is another important aspect of historicity, which we
haven't mentioned, which inherits from the deployment of the free
energy principle, or perhaps just the Helmholtz decomposition
in using the apparatus of the renormalization group. And what
that brings to the table is a separation of temporal scales. And
as soon as you have that in play, there's a different kind of
historicity, which you have to accommodate in any given
calculus, certainly for open systems, which means that the
kind of steady state solutions that are non-equilibrium steady
state solutions we are talking about in the context of the
pathological formulation only exist over a certain time scale.
There's always a time scale above that contextualizes it. And
there's always a time scale below that is much, much faster,
where things live for very, very short periods of time. I think
that's another important aspect of historicity that we're not
talking about a unique or privileged time scale here. So when
people talk about stationarity, or ergodicity, or steady states,
they, you know, one cannot say that this is the configuration
of a system at t equals infinity. Because you have to
acknowledge that there is no privileged time scales, at this
time scale, we will assume that is a steady state solution. But
we have to be very explicit at this time scale. And this does
not apply at the time scale above, or the time scale below. And
interestingly, just mathematically, perhaps a naive
mathematical or certainly a physicist's mathematical
perspective, the very fact you have the separation of time scale
basically means that there are fast stuff or fast dynamics and
slow dynamics. And at the end of the day, if you now consider
what is the difference between the flow of states that you would
find in a deterministic deterministic dynamical system, and
the random fluctuations that convert it into a random
dynamical system, the only difference between these things
is whether they're fast or slow. So you can treat the random
fluctuations, the noise that induces a probabilistic
description, and all the information theoretic
treatments, as simply the fast things, and everything else is
the slow stuff. So again, speaking to, if you like, an
almost necessary connection between any dynamical systems
formulation that is sufficiently liberal to include fast and
slow stuff, and probabilistic treatments of that of the kind
that Richard Feynman pursued in terms of trying to work out
the probability of the path of small particle or electron for
his PhD thesis. Anyway, what is operational closure?
So just go up with that definition from Varela, if you
want me to read it out.
Can I just frame you up there, Chris? Because in that forking
paper, there was I actually thought it was a little bit
hand wavy. It's not like in graph theory, where you have very
kind of precise definition. So they had a they had a kind of a
node diagram. And they said it was operationally closed if all
of the black colored nodes had one arrow going out and
connecting to another one. And they had a kind of diagram
just showing an organism. But what's the official definition,
Chris?
Yeah, so this is a definition from Varela. This is an
autonomous system is that is their organization is
characterized by processes such that the processes are related
as a network, so that recursively depend on each of
them, the generation realization of the processes
themselves. And two, they constitute the system as a
unity recognizable in space, in which those processes exist.
So it's kind of this deep recurs, recursivity between the
processes, maintaining the network is necessary for
the processes, this kind of generation of the system's
own constraints. I guess this has been it's always been a
kind of slightly ineffable within the auto put it
literature what this means formally, right? There's a
deep intuition. This is correct, you know, you think
about, as a key said before, where the matter is
changing as flux is changing these processes, but the
identity is somehow staying the same. And that's the
organizational structure that's maintained over time rather
than the material components of that structure. But I do
think, you know, that there is a sense that was when we did
focus on these state based descriptions of the free
energy principle, I think that kind of undersold the
solenoidal flow that Carl was talking about, whereas that is
I think it's much more important to the people in
auto poisons because this notion of this kind of flow of
information and the organization is dynamic within the
equilibrium is important for that field. So I think the, you
know, the new directions they've got in the free energy
principle things that Maxwell and Dalton are pursuing is, to
me, an exciting opportunity to kind of reconcile some of the
ineffability of these operational closure ideas in auto
poisons and this framework, essentially.
Cool, cool. So I want to do want to comment maybe briefly on
that before we move on, like Chris, Chris called out some of
your work there with Dalton.
Yeah, I mean, in a good way, though, I think what Chris is
saying is that he agrees with the direction. I would just say
that this isn't really new work. And this says that you would
Dalton and I are just doing is extending work that Carl did
almost 20 years ago. So I see this as more continuous. You
know, someone might say that I'm being overly generous, which I
might be, you know, by looking at this as like one kind of
continuous development. But yeah, I don't really, I think, you
know, you can think of the state based description as sort of
the asymptotic limit of the path based description, the two
were kind of like deeply connected in some sense. So no, I
mean, I think this is real, this is the direction that we want
to go. There's still some interesting stuff that you can
say using the density dynamics formulation. We just have to be,
you know, it's like we were discussing Keith during our
MLST interview last time, this is mind physics, right? So, you
know, a hallmark of physics is idealization. And so, you know,
necessarily, some of these constructs are going to be, you
know, the map has to be simpler than the territory. It's like
we were saying, right? You know, otherwise, you get you wind up
in a boar has novel with like, you know, a map the size of
Los Angeles that you can't use. So, you know, for certain kinds
of oscillatory cyclical bio behaviors, the non equilibrium
steady state is a perfectly fine, you know, model of it. You
know, I drink coffee so regularly that it might as well be like,
you know, deterministic and like, you know, orbiting the sun
kind of thing. So, you know, this speaks to the fact that the
free energy principle is what it says on the 10. It's a principle.
It's a it's a that leads to a modeling method. And you know,
we make some assumptions, and we're able to say some things.
But the principle itself doesn't rest on any of these
assumptions. Like stationarity, for example, like you don't
really need that to get it to get it working. All you need is a
markup like it in your random dynamical system and you're sort
of ready to go. In terms of like the formalization of the
inactive approach, I always saw this. So like Chris, by the way,
I think this is under, I don't talk about it very much, but much
like Chris, I started off recalcitrant to the free energy
principle. I found out about this stuff in around 2014. And it you
know, like I said, I was trained as an inactivist. And this
really conflicted with my intuitions. And I went into this
thinking I need to and this is also what I think the spirit
that motivates a lot of criticism, you go into this
thinking I need to understand this just enough to be able to to
know for sure that I don't need to understand this actually. And
you know, you go into this. And I you know, I remember having
like a conversion experience reading the Carl's 2012 entropy
paper called a free energy principle for biological
systems, which was a path based kind of formulation and
everything and really, you know, seeing Oh, wow, like, there's
no there's no resisting this, like this is inevitable. And
really getting like, Oh, yeah, this is an inevitable consequence
of physics, isn't it? Like, there's no, there's no getting
around this. And then kind of, you know, doubling down in my
conversion and then becoming a part of the community.
So what's funny is, I had the opposite experience of you two.
So I when I first saw it, I'm like, this is amazing. Like
this is exactly how it works. And now I've been trying to
escape ever since, you know, I don't like being shackled, like
to the free energy principle. And funny enough, we've talked
before about how, you know, Carl, that the free energy
principle is one of the few principles that applies to
itself. It's like, as simple as it is, it can be and still and
still work. The other aspect in which that's true is, as we've
been talking about, it maintains this flexibility, or maybe
vagueness, you know, critics might say, but it maintains this
flexibility, which leads to it inevitably generating all kinds
of controversy and debates, you know, and people arguing about
like the limits of that flexibility, right?
One thing I would quickly point out is like, the there's this
sense, I think in the literature that there are like 17
different possible interpretations of the free
energy principle, and that you can make it say one thing and
it's opposite. What I've been going around saying is no, that's
not correct. There's only the free energy principle. And it has
the implications that it does. And there are misinterpretations
of the free energy principle. So for example, you know, I think
this idea that some people in the literature have been pushing
that like the free energy principle is even compatible
with this kind of radical anti realism, this kind of, you know,
like a Descartes demon kind of thing. That's not that just
doesn't follow. It's incompatible with the math, like the you
need, you need there to be an actual world out there to
couple to you for the math to get off the ground. So there
there actually isn't a bunch of different interpretations.
There's just the free energy principle. It's just that it's a
lens that makes you makes you see that a lot of the dichotomies
that used to structure the way we think about things are false.
And this comes back to the thing that we were discussing at the
end of our interview, Keith. This is sort of like a, you know,
you're sort of abolishing the distinction between the super
lunar re and the sub lunar spheres, right? So classical
mechanics abolishes the distinction that was popular
in scholastic philosophy, which was, you know, like 1000, 2500
years of like, you know, natural philosophy saying, Well, I mean,
if you look at the way things behave, the things out there
beyond the moon, in the super lunar sphere, right, they move
in perfect orbits, perfect circles, seems to have nothing to
do with, you know, things here that fall to the ground or rise
and have a beginning, a middle and an end. These seem like
radically distinct spheres of reality. But then Newton comes
along and classical mechanics equips you with a set of
equations that apply equally to things here and things over
there, thereby just abolishing that distinction. And I think
like the free energy principle comes around and does undoes a
lot of these false dichotomies in the same way, like we were
talking about internalism versus externalism, it allows you to
say, Yeah, there's something to the internalist story, the
internal states are doing something special. But you
actually need the external world to be there to get the story
to kind of pick up. So I think you get a lot of this. And I
guess my hot tag is that the inactivists need there to be a
bright line in the universe, like a bright red line. On the
one. And then what's on each side of the line depends on the
inactivists, right? So like, but the story is always something
like there's physics, there's near physics on one side. And
then there's the interesting stuff on the other side, there's
biology, or maybe there's mind or there's something like that.
And there is this bright red line, like, yeah.
So Maxwell is saying the free energy principle is the ultimate
shade of gray. I hope you
appreciate it. Well, I know Tim, Tim, we wanted to move to a
new topic. Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, there's a few things to touch on that. I mean,
certainly the philosophy of, you know, an activism versus
ecological psychology is an interesting one. Because with
an activism, we get quite a few philosophical things bagged on
that possibly we may or may not want. For example, the
phenomenology, the existentialism, which is this idea that you
can shape your own experience, this kind of Eastern philosophy,
which is that in some sense, there's no distinction between
you and your environment. And it has been criticized as being
quite ill-defined and vague. But I think Maxwell, you have said
that there's much more of a tighter compatibility with
ecological psychology. And that's essentially that we see the
world through affordances. And what that means is that we see
the world as trajectories of actions in our physical
environment that we live in. And philosophically, that's a
realist ontology. So that means there are no representations,
we're taking actions in the real world, and we know that the
real world exists. And now many cognitive science people, of
course, resist to this notion because they say we need to have
representations. And then we get to this interesting discussion
that we're having about this kind of continuum between this
idea that on the one hand, there are no representations if we
are Gibsonian and we are ecological psychologists. But on the
other hand, we might need to have increasing levels of
representation if we actually have this temporal depth, if we
have these nested Markov boundaries, and we are
sophisticated minds that are making predictions into the
future. Now, with that laid out, I wanted to talk about this
notion of goals. Now, in a externalist and activist
framework, I think that goals are not something we should
explicitly define. Now, when you speak with go fi people, and
they talk about building cognitive architectures, they
say that goals should be explicitly crafted into the
architecture, at least that's what they would have said 20 years
ago, now they're slightly more refined. And they say, well, we
should have a goal module in the architecture, but the goals
should be acquired empirically, and there should be sub goals
and so on. Now, if I understand correctly, we were just talking
about the free energy principle has this notion of paths. And
we have beliefs over trajectories of actions into the
future. And to what extent is a belief a goal? Because if you
have an almost infinite number of beliefs, so there's a
trajectory to this future state where I'm rich, but there's
also an infinitude of other potential trajectories. And
they are of course constrained by the physical affordances and
trajectories that I can take in my physical environment. That
seems different to having an intention of wanting to be
rich or wanting to play tennis, because I'm constrained in all
of these different ways. So yeah, why don't we just talk about
the dichotomy between beliefs and goals?
I think Carl or Chris would be better equipped to answer the
latter question. Carl in particular has been thinking
about intentional behavior quite deeply recently. I did want to
quickly comment upon ecological psychology. I have been saying
to the ecocyte community that Bayesian mechanics and ecocyte
are the same discipline. They're really the same thing. Vicente
Raja is one of the cooler, more technically proficient people
in the ecocyte community. And after you know, a few years of
back and forth, we've realized that yeah, we're using exactly
the same set of mathematical tools. The only framing is the
only difference is a philosophical framing is, are you an
indirectist or a directist? Right? So and I happen to think
that these are just kind of semantic quibbles. If you look
at the more contemporary ecocyte literature, so the ecocyte
people tend to be much more sophisticated, technically than
the inactive people. And one thing that they have in common is
that they don't reject information theory out of hand.
They want a richer notion of information like ecological
information or semantic information, some kind of
information that has some relevance to the environment,
you know, the organisms like Melia, it's umvelt, it's, it's
world of life. But they're not rejecting information theory. In
fact, Gibson's original ambition was to apply physics to the
study of perception, just straight up. You know, so it's
all about like, you know, energy, the energy on the perceptual
arrays and all of this stuff. It's essentially, I think, the
same project from a methodological and mathematical
perspective. The main difference is just an inactive, an
ecological psychologist, sorry, would say that we perceive
things directly. But then they appeal to this, these notions of
like resonance, and whatever, which you know, to us is just
synonym for inference. I guess it's like it, the difference
rests in like, are you centering on the internal
perspective of an organism, or are you looking at things as a
multi scale stack with the organism kind of carving out one
level. So we had a great session actually with Michael
Anderson's Emerge Lab group, based out of Ontario, and my, my
gut tells me that there will be a kind of strategic alliance,
and maybe even just a merging of these two fields, moving
forward. Yeah, and, you know, for the more cynical part of me
thinks that the merger of free energy principle and Ecosci gives
you everything that you might want out of inactivism, but
without any of the, you know, heavy kind of metaphysical or
philosophical baggage that seems to be, you know, hindering
progress in that field. So that's my thing about Ecosci.
Okay, maybe we can bring you Chris in on the the goals
thing. So is, is a goal in end state, is it a trajectory, is
it a bearing? And is it, is it does it exist explicitly in the
externalist view of cognition?
Well, so I'm a kind of more of a practical computational
person. So I'll leave the philosophy to Maxwell. But I
mean, I tend to take the intentional stats intentional
standards on systems where if we can, if it makes sense for us
to describe a system as a goal directed, then we should do
so. And if that helps engineers to build those systems, then
they should do so, right? But there's a nice kind of, there's
a nice parallel between those are kind of ideas and the original
work in cybernetics. So there's a, you know, the good
regulator theorem, which this kind of early work by Conan and
Ashby suggests that any any control system of a given
environment is a good model of the environment that it controls
just by necessity from first principles, right? Which to me,
we suggest that we should, in principle, be able to describe an
intentional structure in terms of the kind of generative model
within within a system, we should be able to find it if it is a
good control system, and it should exist. I think there's
also a more practical thing about shifting from the notion of
reward as this kind of potential function that's kind of
dominated the machine learning area, right? So we have this
kind of monolithic thing called reward and everything is in
in service of that reward to a richer notion of beliefs about
dynamics, which which which affords that kind of, you know,
moves away that potential function to a more kind of
dynamical system, so we can get more kind of rich beliefs about
future trajectories and so on. And we know that in control
systems, that's really, it's really important, right? If we
want to control a system, we're doing model based control, we
have to have desires on the futures of those systems, we
need to understand the trajectory and the divergence of the
trajectories over through time, right? So I think it's a much
richer picture, practically, to think about, you know, beliefs
about dynamics, rather than reward. And I think there's this
nice parallel between the intentional structure and the
good regulator theory, because I think the good regulator
theorem entails that we should find those kind of intentional
dynamics within our systems, right? With just by a priori
first reasoning.
Yeah, I just wanted to know if he could explain the good
regulator theorem, because I think that
Yes, the good regular is really strong resonances with this. And
I think, you know, there was a long, there was a long time, not
Carl, the Carl's exclusive. It's a long time, the people who were
reading the free energy literature to think that the kind
of the roots of the free energy principle was in Helmholtz,
Helmholtzian perception, right? This notion of Bayesian
inference and perception. But there's kind of a much richer
reading to see its roots in cybernetics movement, and
particularly by the works of people like Ross Ashby and so on.
So he's basically said, he provided this theorem that
showed that if you want to build a regulator for a given
environmental system that optimally regulates that
system, then it necessitates that regulator is a good model of
that system, right? And there's a kind of you can take that
kind of in a strong way, and the weak way, and we worried
about this for a long time. But just to diffuse that from its
representational kind of implications, which we worried
about for a long time, you can see this in something like even
like the what governor, which is uses his classic, an activist
system that doesn't is non representationist. But there are
kind of, there's a sense in which the dynamics of the what
governor needs to mirror the fluctuations of the the sea
management regulating and it's that kind of coupling and that
kind of reflection of those dynamics, which is important for
the regulation of that system, right? So that kind of you can
back out that, you know, I think this is very nice, along with
the intentional stance and demands an intentional stance if
you if you if you if you if you're committed to this notion of
the good regulator theory.
To riff on your point of the intentional son, I think that
that's a fascinating way of looking at it, Chris, and to
bring you in, Professor Chris and so Professor Daniel Dennett
had this notion of the intentional stance, that when we
you know, we essentially have a mental model of the
intentions of other agents and we use that to understand their
behavior. And an intention is a goal. If you think about it,
it's something I want to do. But in this dynamical systems
framework, it's not explicitly coded anywhere, it kind of
emerges. And of course, it's a subjective state. So we've
spoken about mental phenomenal states being encoded in our
generative model in our in our free energy framework. And those
states will of course have intentional, you know,
representations of the other agents that we're dealing with.
So I guess the question back to you, Professor Friston, how do
goals kind of get encoded in this dynamics?
Yeah, that's a great question. And I know the answer you want,
because you don't like girls, do you? So, or I don't mind if
there I guess I guess the answer is they're emergent, which is,
which is, yeah, I was groggy for that. Yes, you they have to, you
know, you have to find a physics where it looks as if there are
goals, and they emerge from a particular kind of self
organization. I think that's that's been a great question.
That's that's been beautifully illustrated just in the in the
previous conversations you've had. And, you know, ranging from
the work of Ross Ashby on his homeostat, which I think would
be better nowadays called an allostat, but we just stick with
the homeostat. Because, you know, does homeostasis have a
goal? Does does my physiology have the goal of maintaining my
temperature at 37 degrees centigrade? It certainly looks
like that. Do I intend to do that? Well, I think on one
reading of intention, yes, you know, and certainly on an
allostatic reading of behaviors that have this temporal depth
and are the consequence of plans into the future, you're putting
turning on the thermostat or putting on clothes. I think then
you're getting much closer to this sort of more anthropomorphic
notion of intentionality, where there I think there are girls
there are there are endpoints. So I guess that the question
then is, you know, at what point would these different kinds of
intentionality or goal directed behavior emerge from self
organization? And in what particular kinds of systems
would you expect to see this these these these behaviors? I
think there's some fairly straightforward answers from the
point of view of the physicist, not not the philosopher. So if
you just look at the different kinds of systems that you could
apply the free energy principle to we've talked about one of
them right at the beginning, when considering Markov
blankets that did not have any have any internal states, for
example, a stone. Yeah, so every state of this thing is just a
Markov blanket, and it is in reciprocal exchange with the
external states. So that would be when the internal states are
empty. Well, there are other kinds of systems that you could
have. Well, you could imagine systems that didn't have any
active states. But you know, most interesting systems do have
active states. And then you ask about the relative contribution
of these random fluctuations to the dynamics of the self
organization. And if you just follow the math through the
path integral, in particular, maths of the dynamics that any
system at a particular temporal scale must have, if it's
internal or autonomous dynamics, or the dynamics, the flows of
the internal states and the the blanket states that constitute
a particle or a person, when they become sufficiently
precise. So when we become big enough and cool enough, so let's
assume that we're bigger than a quantum scale, but not too big
to become classical. So we're not the size of the moon, but we
are roughly your size or my size, or perhaps the size of a mouse
or an insect through to an elephant or a giraffe. Then you
have this interesting situation of these very precise dynamics
and they're precise just because we are big. So all the random
fluctuations are averaged away. In this particular case, then
you can demo you can show that these particular kinds of things
or Markov blankets have a very well defined probability
distribution over paths into the future, specifically the paths
of the active states. So let's assume that there are certain
kinds of particles or creatures that have active states and
they have, you know, they and the blanket states enshroud a
sufficient number of internal states. What would they look
like if they had very precise dynamics? Well, you can actually
work out the probability distribution over the active states
that over their actions over their movements and these could be
physiological movements, autonomic reflexes, they could be
physical movements, eye movements or for ambulatory
movements, indeed even talking. And it transpires that the
probability distribution over these particular paths of active
states has an interesting functional form when written in
terms of the potential of the log probability, we call that
expected free energy. And that expected free energy, when you
just write it down, passes into or come can be decomposed into
things that people have been dealing with for centuries,
specifically, the expected information gain and the expected
reward or utility where reward or utility is scored by the log
probability of occupying an attractive state or rewarding
state. And I use the word attractive state deliberately
because it is just part of the pullback attractor that
affords the application of the pathological formulation. It's
just the characteristic states and this kind of thing occupies.
So the the goldenness, if you like, is is inherent in the
characteristics of the particle or person that you're trying to
describe. So for certain kinds of particles or persons, then it
will certainly look as if they are acting with long term vision,
namely planning in a way to return themselves to their
attracting set, which you could look you could now regard as a
goal or a rewarded or at least an attracting an attracting
outcome or or state of being. So I think that kind of particle
starts to now show the the deep intention, you know, it looks
as if they are they are doing this because they intend some
outcome. I think the next step, though, which is the one that
you were speaking to possibly done, then it was implying is
another, I think, step, which is, but does the does the internal
state know that? You know, am I aware that I am planning? And
of course, that calls upon very, very sophisticated, so if they
exist, internal or generative models that entail a model of
me and the hypothesis that all of this, these sensations and all
the consequences of my actions, which I am not aware of, you
know, I cannot feel all the sensory, not sensory, all the
neuronal impulses that cause my muscles to contract, all I can
register is the consequences of that through my muscle, my
stretch receptors, my proprioceptive receptors, or if
it's in my gut or my autonomic intraceptive receptors. So I
don't know what I'm I can't I can't have I do have have no
access to my actual action. But I can see the consequences of it
and it looks as if I'm planning. So I now have a hypothesis
model of fantasy that I am a thing. And I seem to have goals.
And if I can learn the kinds of goals that I have, then I can
now start to mentalize and have notions in my journey model
about my goals. And then I can notice, oh, you have goals, or
perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps the first of all, it
looks as if the explanation for this random dynamical system
over here called mom is actually, but she looks as if she
plans, it looks as if she has goals. And then a few years later,
if I develop a sense of self, well, perhaps I'm a thing like
mom, and that perhaps I have goals. So I think that you're
you're from the point of view of Dundan, it's intentional
stance. I think we're talking about a very, very particular
kind of system that actually has this capacity to recognize,
first of all, intentional like behaviors, long term planning
dynamics in other conspiracies or things like itself, and then
actually transcribe that and test the hypothesis, or perhaps I'm
a thing like that as well. Perhaps I mean, yeah.
And what's beautiful about what you just said there, and all
three of you have said this in different different ways. So I
want to dwell on this just a bit, because I think it's a source
of the misunderstanding and or controversy about the free
energy principle. So earlier Maxwell, you had said, you know,
it's really a model about the couplings, and the isolations
together, the couplings and the decouplings and the dynamics
between them. You know, Carl, you just said, systems will
behave as if they had intentions, whether or not they
really have intentions or not is kind of a different
philosophical question, but they'll behave as if they had
intentions. And Chris, you brought up, you know, the Watt
governor, which is, it's obviously a very simple dynamic
system, you know, spending centrifuge and, you know, arm
bar, like whatever else. And yet, it's, it's not as though it's
a literal model in the sense that I'm going to have a
mathematical mathematical model for what the steam engine is
doing, but it's behaving as if it were an effective model of
the steam engine, because hey, when it's slightly out of
sync, the arm flexes a little bit, it readjust, it's, you
know, the spin changes slightly, things continue to work
because if it didn't have the dynamics that were as if it had
a model, the thing wouldn't function, it would just fall
apart. So I guess what we're all, what's all being said here is
that systems at different scales will behave as if they had a
model, even if they don't necessarily have a model in the
sense of a person, like a person might have a conscious model
from which they develop a plan or whatnot. But all these
systems of varying scales and complexity still behave as if
they had a model, they act to minimize the free energy as a
consequence of, you know, being random dynamical systems that
are self-maintaining.
Yeah, I think that's really eloquently put. And actually,
that's, so this is this to kind of underwrite some of the
worries we had about the principle when we first started
working on it, as kind of coming from an activist or a low road
and activist, this notion of kind of an explicit
representationalism that you can you can get in these models
where the model is a homomorphic with the environment, right?
It rankles people who've come from behavior based robotics and
stuff like this. But then to kind of realize that there's a
richer relationship between the internal and external that's
been mirrored, right? It doesn't have to be this homomorphic
mapping. And also, you know, the actions are deeply involved in
carving out the world that you represent. You live in your
own vault. You're a model of your own vault, you're a model of
regulating your own vault, which is not, you know, it's not
just this static separation of the of the agent from its
environment. There's this deep coupling, which, you know, which
these kind of mirrorings emerge from. But yeah, I think you
articulate it really well there.
Can we just
I saw call any comments here?
No, I think you did a good job. I agree with Chris like that.
Yeah.
So I think we've got about 15 minutes left. So we'll do two
more topics. We'll end on structural learning and the
practical implementations of the free energy principle. But I
just wanted to touch on what you were talking about earlier,
Maxwell, which is this notion of the boundaries being
potentially vague, or maybe even observer relative. Now, in
your multi scale paper, you did say use the word ontological
boundaries, I think. And I also wanted to talk about meaning.
So there's the boundaries of cognition in the physical world.
So we have this dynamical system and it kind of converges and
we've got these nested kind of hierarchy of boundaries. But
then in a kind of Dennett sense, meaning emerges gradually and
the meaning kind of depends on your perspective. And the
intentional stance also depends on your perspective. So
different agents could look at different phenomena going on in
their physical environment, and they could describe different
meaning in their generative models. So we seem to have this
kind of weird two tier system where no longer are we even
saying that the boundaries, the marker boundaries are fixed,
they are potentially variable. And then the way that the
agents construct meaning is also observer dependent. And all of
this is kind of touching on what I was saying before with goals,
which is that the reason they emerge is because they are
unintelligible, they're extremely complex. Do you see what I
mean? So it feels like the reason why we need to have this
high resolution generative model is because in principle, it
would be impossible for us to explicitly program it.
So a few quick things about that. I mean, I think you're really
identifying some of the key issues. I would first so with
respect to ontology, I would, you know, distinguish ontology
from metaphysics. ontology is just talking about what kind of
things are. So when we say that the boundaries are ontological,
what we're saying is we're trying to capture kind of features of
the map, in some sense. And you know, what we've argued in a
paper recently is that the free energy principle is
metaphorically speaking, a map of that part of the territory
that behaves like a map. So I want to contrast this with
metaphysics in the sense that like this is all of this is a
modeling approach. This is a physics. This isn't saying like,
once and for all, these boundaries are here and
crystallized and just, you know, are there independently of, you
know, the way that we are experiencing or sampling or
interacting with the world, like that that kind of metaphysical
stuff is not what's at stake. Yeah, so in the paper you're
referring to, we describe we describe these Markov blankets
as existential boundaries, in the sense that they're both
epistemological and ontological. They're ontological in the
sense that they are definitional of what a thing is, in this
kind of physics based approach, if you can pick out a thing as a
physical thing, then it has to have this blanket structure. And
it's, it's epistemological in the sense that it's this
interface, right? Like the thing itself can only know the world
and indeed, we can only know the world, the thing through this
boundary. Okay, so like this isn't meant to be a priori, it's
sort of weird. It's in some sense, it's sort of like an app
posteriori. It's like an empirically driven way to carve
up the world.
That's fine. I mean, on that, I think that answers my question,
because there's always this confusion about whether we're
talking about the map or the territory. And just to be clear,
we are, we are always talking about the map when we talk about
these boundaries.
Yeah, the free energy principle is a map of the boundaries, you
can think of and a map of what happens when things have
boundaries that it and so yeah, that that that is important to
keep in mind, like we don't want to engage in map territory
fallacies. The free energy principle is a model, it's a
scientific model, and it's a map and it turns out to be the
canonical way of modeling systems that are engaged in
modeling. So if maximum entropy is the canonical way of
modeling physical systems in physics, it's the way of arriving
at the most parsimonious model that generates, you know, some
data set, right? Well, the free energy principle is equally a
canonical way of modeling systems that also in turn seem to
be engaged in this kind of modeling behavior. But yeah,
it's a model, it's a map, you know, this probably is not the
final word. And, you know, we're, we're uncovering some, you
know, mathematical structure underneath the free energy
principle and the principle of unitarity and maximum caliber
and all of this stuff that we're tentatively calling G
theory for now and in homage to M theory from string theory,
physics. So yeah, you know, as most scientific models, like
the progress of science means that things will probably change.
Like again, this isn't a metaphysics. This is just a
cohesive modeling approach that inherits from the physics of
information and self organization. I would quickly just
point out that the these things like seem intrinsically
related to observer dependence because they are in some deep
sense. Carl's 2019 monograph, a particular free energy principle
for a particular physics ends on this idea that the free energy
principle at core is a metrological statement, where
metrological means measure theoretic or relating to
measurement. And it basically says, well, things that exist,
look as if they're constantly measuring themselves and like
keeping themselves within certain bounds. So this is, and you
know, this is even clearer from the quantum information
theoretic formulation, where like literally what we're saying
is that the free energy principle is a theory of
observateness. You know, the sort of the it from bit, right?
Like the it's thing this, but from another perspective, it's
observateness, which which are kind of the same thing. I'm
sure Carl could say that again, more eloquently than I. But at
a high level, that's how I would respond to your point.
Maybe Carl would like to give it a go. Yeah, Carl, you could do
that. And then also, since you're trying to decide if you're
an inactivist, you know, maybe, what other questions do we need
to ask for both of us actually to decide, you know, that we
haven't, that we haven't covered yet?
Yeah, we can, we can ask Maxwell and Chris.
So just to pick up on that last exchange and come back to the
free energy principle as being gloriously gray. I think I like
that because, you know, the validity of that principle as
a method. So, you know, as a physicist, you would read any
principle as a method, something that you apply to
something. I think it is underwritten, not by its
explanatory scope, but by its internal consistency with other
principles that people do apply. And that's what is mentioned
one. I think one important example of that, you know, beyond
the principles of least actual variational principles that
underwrite for, you know, say Richard Feynman's work, I'm
thinking of James's maximum entropy principle. So Maxwell
alluded to that in terms of maximum caliber. So maximum
entropy of distributions over states just now becomes
transformed into distributions over paths when you move from,
when you move to the maximum caliber principle. So the
maximum caliber principle is just a Jamesian max entropy
principle for a pathological formulation. And I think that's
important to realize the free energy principle just is that. It
is just a constrained maximum caliber principle or maximum
entropy principle. And you may ask, well, where did the
constraints come from? That's just the generative model. It's
just the description of the characteristic states that
pull back a tractor that constitutes the goals we're just
talking about. So, you know, if you remember, free energy is
just the expected energy, the constraint part plus the
entropy. And therefore, when you're now drilling down on the
constraint part, where does that come from? It's just a
description of the pull back a tractor of the characteristic
states of the system that you're trying to try to understand.
So I really look at the free energy principle as something
terribly new. It's been implicit there all the time. It's just
people using slightly different words for different concepts.
So I think that's kind of why I'm saying this, but it seemed
important to say. And Max, what were you just talking about?
Because there was a link in terms of.
Were you maybe leading into the metrological aspects, the
self measurement?
Absolutely. I know that was really important. Yes, that's
right. So just looking backwards, what is the sibling of the
sibling of the free energy principle of in the past
century, in the past few decades, I think that would be the
maximum entropy principle, constraint maximum principle.
Looking forwards, what would be the bedfellows of the free
energy principle? I think that the that metrological or
relational thing is vitally important. I love the work of
Carla Rovelli and his work with relational approaches to quantum
mechanics, which is all about relationships. And of course, how
do you quantify a relationship? Well, it's just in terms of the
interaction, the coupling, which is going to be a sparse coupling.
It is just a measurement. It is just an observation.
So inference, measurement, synchronization, sparse coupling,
they're all the same thing. And so I think that what will
hopefully happen is that somebody will write down a math,
possibly Dalton will write down a calculus that says all of
these things are just the same way of looking at it. And I
read yesterday, because I had to because I was reviewing this
paper for synthese about ontic structural realism, ontic
structural realism. And it seems to me that that is basically
philosophers having discovered the same underlying fabric that
the reality is in the measurement, but it's the measurement of how
we relate to each other via that measurement of each other
or things, measuring other things, purely in terms of their
relationships. So I think that there is a lot of, if you like,
work to be done from the point of view of free energy principle
theorists in consolidating the links to what has gone in terms of
things like maximum entry principle and what is to come in terms
of, say, quantum loop gravity or Chris Fields quantum
information, theoretic treatment of holographic screens in the
Markov blanket. At each point, the FEP will become grayer
because it will be less easy to discriminate it from everything
else that stood the test of time.
Chris, do you have any comments on that? You're on mute.
You're on mute, Chris.
Sorry. I think I'll leave it there. It's a bit too deep into the
philosophy for me, and we've got two experts here, so I'll pass.
Wonderful. And to my point earlier, we won't go into it now,
but I guess my perspective is it all seems like epistemology to me
rather than ontology, and maybe we can debate that a little bit
later on. But as our uploads are all quite slow and I want to
check that we secure this beautiful interview, I'm going to cut
it off at this point. But gentlemen, it's been an absolute
honor. Thank you so much for coming on MLS2. It means so much
to me.
Genuinely, always a pleasure, gentlemen. This is always great
to find.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
