Okay, well, in which case, let's crack on.
So, ladies and gentlemen, get ready to meet
the cunning maverick of Silicon Valley,
the one and only George Hotz.
Renowned for his daring exploits,
Hotz commands an enigmatic persona,
which merges the technical finesse of Elon Musk
and the wit of Tony Stark
and the charm of a true tech outlaw.
Now, many of you would have or indeed should have seen
this man on Lex's podcast recently
for the third time, no less,
from craftily jailbreaking the supposedly invincible iPhone
to outsmarting the mighty PlayStation 3,
he's proven that no tech fortress is impregnable.
Once targeted for his audacious creativity by Sony
with a lawsuit, this hacker wizard stoically danced
past the curveballs thrown by the tech giants,
all achieved with the graceful swag
of a street smart prodigy.
Now, when he's not outfoxing major corporations,
you'll find him at the heart of the avant-garde
of AI technology, gallantly trailblazing
through the wilds of the tech front here.
He's currently building a startup called MicroGrad,
which is building super fast AI running on modern hardware.
And truly he's the James Bond of Silicon Valley
minus the martinis, of course.
Now, please welcome the unparalleled code cowboy,
the unapologetic techno-mancer, George Hotz.
Woo!
Anyway, also joining us for the big fight this evening
is the steadfast sentinel of AI safety,
Conor Lehi.
Undeterred by the sheer complexity
of artificial intelligence,
Conor braves the cryptic operations
of tech-generating models with steely resolve.
Now, about two years ago, Conor took on the Herculean task
of safeguarding humanity from a potential AI apocalypse.
His spirit is relentless, his intellect razor sharp,
and his will to protect is unwavering.
Now, drawing on his contentious claim
that we are super, super fucked.
Yeah, Conor channels the urgency of our predicament
into his work.
Now, his startup, Conjecture,
isn't just a glorified tech endeavor,
but it's a lifeboat for us all,
racing against the breakneck speed of AI advancement
with the fates of nations, possibly at stake.
He's determined to break the damning prophecy
and render us super, super saved.
So, brace for a showdown as Conor Lehi,
the Maverick defender of AI's boundaries,
strides into the ring.
Now, the man who declared we are super, super fucked
is here to prove just how super, super not fucked
we could be if we make the right decisions today.
So please give it up for Mr. Conor, super, super Lehi.
Woo!
Now, Conor, I'd appreciate it
if you don't go down in the fourth.
I want this fight to go the distance.
Now, we're running for 90 minutes this evening.
There'll be a 10 minute openers
from, we said, Hots, didn't we, from Hots first,
and then Conor.
And I'll only step into the ring
if the punch-up gets too out of hand.
And unfortunately, we won't be taking live questions today
because we want to maximize the carnage on the battlefield.
George Hots, your opening statements, please.
Yeah, we're super, super fucked.
I think I agree with you.
Well, that was a short fight.
Yeah, look, I think, okay.
So to make my opening statement clear
and why maybe it doesn't make that much sense
for me to go first,
I think that the trajectory of all of this
was somewhat inevitable, right?
So you have humans over time,
and you can look at a 1980 human and a 2020 human.
They look pretty similar, right?
Ronald Reagan, Joe Biden, you know, that's all I'll say.
Whereas a 1980 computer is like an Apple II,
and a 2020 computer is a M1 Macs MacBook,
like lines looking like this, right?
So you have one line like this, one line like this.
These lines eventually cross,
and I don't see any reason that line's gonna stop, right?
I've seen a few of the other guests argue something like,
well, LLMs can't problem-solver, but it doesn't matter.
Like if this one can't, the next one will,
whatever you call,
I don't believe that there's a step function.
I don't believe that like, oh, now it's conscious,
oh, now it's intelligent.
I think it's all on a gradient.
And I think this gradient will continue to go up,
will approach human level, and will pass human level.
Now, this belief that we are uniquely fucked because of this,
the amount of power in the world is about to increase, right?
When you think about power, and you think about,
straight up, you can just talk about energy usage.
The amount of energy usage in the world is going to go up,
right?
The amount of intelligence in the world is going to go up.
We may be able to do some things to slow it down
or speed it up based on political decisions,
but it doesn't matter.
The trajectory is up, or major catastrophe, right?
The only way it goes down is through war,
nuclear annihilation, bio annihilation,
meteor impact, some kind of major annihilation.
So what's going on?
What we can control,
and what I think is super important we control,
is what the distribution of that new power looks like.
I am not afraid of super intelligences.
I am not afraid to live in a world among super intelligences.
I am afraid if a single person or a small group of people
has a super intelligence, and I do not.
And this is where we get to chicken man.
A chicken man is the man who owns the chicken farm.
There's many chickens in the chicken farm,
and there's one chicken man.
It is unquestionable that chicken man rules.
And if you believe chicken man rules because of his size,
I invite you to look at cow man,
who also rules the cows,
and the cows are much larger than him.
Chicken man rules because of his intelligence.
This is basic, less wrong stuff.
Everyone kind of knows this.
Have the squishy things take over the world.
Look, I agree with Elias Yudkowski,
all up to Nuke the data centers, right?
So I do not want to be a chicken.
And if people decide they are going to restrict open source AI,
or make sure I can't get access to the compute,
but only trusted people like chicken man
get access to the compute.
Well, shit, man, I'm the chicken.
And yeah, I don't want to be the chicken.
So I think that's my, are we fucked?
Maybe.
I agree that that intelligence is very dangerous.
How can you look at intelligence
and not say it's very dangerous, right?
Intelligence is somehow safe.
But things like nuclear bombs
are an extremely false equivalency.
Because what does a nuclear bomb do
besides blow up and kill people?
Intelligence has the potential to make us live forever.
Intelligence has the potential to let us colonize the galaxy.
Intelligence has the potential to meet God.
Nuclear bombs do not, they just blow up.
So I think the question, and like,
you have things like crypto,
which are a clear advantage to the defender at least today.
And you have things like nuclear bombs,
which are a clear advantage to the attacker.
AI, it's unclear.
I think the best defense against an AI
trying to manipulate me.
And that's what I'm really worried about.
Future psyops, you know, we're already seeing it today
with the voice changer stuff.
Like, you're never gonna know who's human.
The world's about to get crazy.
The best defense I could possibly have
is an AI in my room being like,
don't worry, I got you, it's you and me.
We're on a team, we're aligned.
I'm not worried about alignment as a technical challenge.
I'm worried about alignment as a political challenge.
Google doesn't like me.
Open AI doesn't like me.
But me and my computer, you know, we like each other.
We're aligned and we're standing against the world.
That has always, since the beginning of history,
maximally been trying to screw you over, right?
Intelligence, people think that one superintelligence
is gonna come and be unaligned against humanity.
All of humanity is unaligned against each other.
I mean, we have some common values, but really, come on.
Everyone's trying to scam everybody.
The only reason you really team up with someone else is like,
hey man, what if we team up and scam them, right?
And what if we team up, call ourselves America?
And we build a big army and say,
we're free and independent, yeah, right?
It's that force that has made humanity cooperate.
Humanity, by default, is very unaligned
and has every kind of belief under the sun.
So I'm not worried about AI
showing up with a new belief under the sun.
I'm not worried about the amount of intelligence increasing.
I'm worried about a few entities that are unaligned with me,
acquiring God-like powers and using them to exploit me.
I think that's my opening statement.
Cool, yeah.
Thanks.
That's, I mean, yeah, I also kind of agree with you.
And most of the things you say,
there's a few details I'd like to dig into there,
but for most of the things you say,
I do think I agree with you here.
I think it's absolutely, let me just like start with saying,
I totally agree with you that misuse and like, you know,
bad actors using AGI is a horrible, dangerous outcome.
That's like, you know, sometimes the less wrong,
you know, crowd likes to talk about X-risk,
but also sometimes I've talked about S-risk, suffering risks.
So things are worse than death.
I believe that you can probably almost only get S-risk
from misuse.
I don't think you can get S-risk problem.
Like you can, but it's extremely unlikely
to get it from like just like raw misalignment.
Like you'd have to like get extraordinarily unlucky.
So while I do, so I do think, for example,
a very, you know, controllable AGI or super intelligence
in the hand of sadistic psychopath
is significantly in a sense worse
than a paperclip maximizer.
So I think this is something we would agree on probably.
Sure.
I think I'm pretty much on board with you
on a lot of things there.
Where I think things come aboard a bit of a tale
is I think there's two points
where I would like to take as my opening statement,
two things I want to talk about.
The first one is I want to talk about
the technical problem of alignment.
So am I concerned about the kinds of things like misuse
and like small groups of people centralizing power,
potentially for nefarious deeds?
Yeah, I think this is a very, very significant problem
that I do think about a lot
and that'll be the second thing I want to talk about.
The first thing I want to talk about is
that I don't even think we're going to make it to that point.
I don't think we're going to get to the point
where anyone has a super intelligence
that's helping them out.
We're, if we don't solve very hard technical problems
which are currently not on track to being solved,
by default, you don't get a bunch of, you know,
super intelligence in boxes working with a bunch of humans.
You get a bunch of super intelligence,
you know, fighting each other,
working with each other and just ignoring humans.
Humans just get cut out entirely from the process.
And even then, you know, it's, you know,
whether one takes over or they find an equilibrium,
I don't know, like, you know, who knows what happens
at that point.
But by default, I wouldn't expect humans
to be part of the equilibrium anymore.
Once you're, once you're the chicken man,
well, why do you need chickens?
You know, if, you know, maybe if they provide
some resource for you, the reason humans have chickens
is that they make chicken breasts.
I mean, personally, I wouldn't like to be harvested
for chicken breasts, just my personal opinion.
I consider this a pretty bad outcome.
But even then, well, as a chicken man finds a better way
of chicken breasts or, you know,
modifies himself to no longer need food,
I expect the chickens are not gonna be around
for much longer.
You know, once we stopped using horses for transportation,
didn't go very well for the horses.
So that's kind of the first part of my point
that I'd like to, you know, maybe hear your opinions on,
hear your thoughts on, is that I think the technical
problem of control is actually very hard.
And I don't think it's unsolvable by any means.
I think like, you know, you and like, you know,
a bunch of other smart people work on this for like 10 years.
I think you can solve it, but it's not easy.
And it has to actually happen.
And there is a deadline for this.
The second point I wanna bring up is kind of where you talk
about how humans are unaligned.
I think this is partially definitely true.
But I think I'm unusually, I am the more optimistic
of the two of us in this scenario.
Not a role I often have in these discussions
where I actually think the amount of coordination
that exists between humanity, especially in the modern world
is actually astounding.
Every single time two adult human males meet
and don't kill each other is a miracle.
Have you seen what happens when two adult male chimps
from two different warbands meet each other?
It doesn't go very well.
And those are already pretty well-coordinated animals
because they can have warbands.
What happens when, you know, two male bugs
or, you know, sea slugs meet each other, you know,
either they ignore each other or, you know,
things go very poorly.
This is the default outcome.
The true unaligned outcome,
the true default state of nature is you can't have
two adult males in the same room at any time.
I saw this funny video on Twitter the other day
where it was like, I don't know, some parliament,
I think in East Europe or something.
And there's this big guy who's just like going
at this politician who's like in his face,
he's like screaming, he was like going everywhere.
And not a single punch will throw him.
No, no one took out a knife, no one took out a gun.
And I was like, wow.
The fact that we're so civilized
and we're so aligned to each other
that we can have something this barbaric happen
and no one throws a punch is actually shocking.
This is very unusual, even for humans.
If you go back 200 years,
punches and probably gunshots would have flown.
So this is not to say that humans have
some inherent special essence that we're good,
that we have solved goodness or any needs.
What I'm saying is, is the way I like to think about it
is that coordination is a technology.
It's a technology you can improve upon.
It is, you can develop new methods of coordination.
You can develop new structures, new institutions,
new systems.
And I think it's very tempting for us living
in this modern world to, it's kind of like
a fish and water effect.
We forget how much of our life,
a lot of our life is built on atoms,
on physical technology.
A lot of it's built on digital technology,
but a lot of it is built on social technology.
And when I look at how does the world go well?
Like, you know, should it be only the, you know,
special elites get control of the AI?
I'm like, well, that's not really how I think about it.
When I think about it way more is,
what is a coordination mechanism?
Or we can create a coordination selling point
or we can create a group, an institution,
a system of some kind that where people will, you know,
have game theoretic incentives to cooperate on the system,
the results in something that is net positive for everyone.
Because the truth is, is that positive some games do exist.
And they're actually very profitable.
And they're very good.
And I think if we can turn, you know,
you can turn any positive some game into a net,
into a zero or a negative some game pretty easily.
It's much easier to destroy than is to create.
But I think it's absolutely possible
to create coordination technology around AI
and to build coordination mechanisms
that are net positive for everyone involved.
So those would be like my two points,
happy to dig into any ones you think would be,
it'll lead to an interesting interaction.
Sure.
So I'll start with two and then go to one.
So two, I moved to Berkeley in 2014
and I threw myself at the Mary Cult.
I showed up at the Mary office and I'm like, hi,
I'm here to join your cult.
This is a true story.
And what I started to realize was
Mary and Les Wrong in general have a very poor grip
on the practicalities of politics.
Very much.
I think there was sort of a split, you know,
Curtis Yavin, like neo reaction.
This is a spin off of rationality.
And it's a spin off of rationality
that understood the truth about human nature.
So when I give you that,
you give that example of two chimps meeting in the woods
and they're gonna fight.
If I'm one of those chimps, at least I stand a chance, right?
He might beat my ass, I might beat his.
But if I come up against the FBI,
things do not look good for me.
In fact, things so much do not look good for me.
There's no way I'm gonna beat the FBI.
The modern forces are so powerful
that this is not a, oh, we've established
a nice cooperative shelling point.
This is a, we have pounded so much fear into these people
that they would never even think of throwing a puncher
firing a gun.
We have made everybody terrified.
And this isn't good.
We didn't achieve this through some enlightened cooperation.
We achieved this through a massive propaganda effort, right?
It's the joke about, you know,
the American soldier goes over to Russia
and it's like, man, you guys got some real propaganda here.
And then the Russian soldier's like, yeah, no, I know it's bad,
but it's not as bad as yours.
And the American soldier's like, what propaganda?
And the Russian just laughs, right?
So this didn't occur because of,
this occurred because of a absolute tyrannical force
that decided to dominate everybody, right?
Now, oh, I think so.
I think there's a way out of this.
I think there actually is a way out of this, right?
And I wrote a blog post about this
called Individual Sovereignty.
And I think a really nice world would be
if all the stuff to live, food, water,
healthcare, electricity were generatable off the grid
in a way that you are individually sovereign.
And this comes back to my point about offense and defense, right?
If I have a world where you don't want it
to be extreme defense, you don't want every person
to be able to completely insulate them.
But you want like, okay, it takes a whole bunch
of other people to gang up to take that guy out, right?
Like that's a good balance.
And the balance that we live in today is there is one,
pretty much a unipolar world.
I mean, thank God for China,
but there's one unipolar world, you got America
and where are you gonna run?
I'll pay taxes, I don't care if you live overseas, right?
So yeah, my point about the coordination is that
if you're okay with solving coordination problems
by using a single, a singleton super intelligent AI
to make everybody cower in fear
and tyrannize the future, sure, you'll get coordination.
Yeah, that works, that works.
I'm the only guy with a gun and I got 10 of you,
and I got a name for all 10 of you and you can all die
or listen to me, your choice.
So I'm curious about, so I understand what you're saying.
And I think you make some decent points,
but I think I view the world a bit differently from you
and I'd like to like dig into that a little bit.
So like, who do you think is less afraid?
Someone living, just a median person,
living in the United States of America
or the median person living in Somalia?
Sure, America, less afraid.
Well, that's kind of strange.
Somalia doesn't have a government.
They have much less tyranny.
You can just buy a rocket launcher and just like live
on a farm and just like, you know, kill your neighbors
and no one's gonna stop you.
So like, how does that interact with your old view?
Those who will trade liberty for safety deserve neither.
That, sorry, I don't understand.
Could you elaborate a bit more?
In Somalia, you have a chance.
In America, you do not, right?
I am okay.
I would rather live in fear.
I would rather be worried about someone
shooting a rocket launcher at me
than to have an absolutely tyrannical government.
Just, you know, just like a managerial class.
I'm not saying, by the way,
I agree with you that these things are possible.
I agree with you that the less wrong notion
of politics is possible.
I would love to live in these sort of worlds, but we don't.
The practical reality of politics is so much more brutal
and it just comes from a straight up instinct to dominate,
not an instinct, you know, government by the people,
for the people, it's branding.
I mean, yeah, so to be clear, I very much do not agree
with less wrong views than politics
and a bit of an outcast for how I view,
how conflict theory I view politics.
But this is, I feel like you're kind of dodging
the question here just a little bit.
Is it like, well, if that's true,
why aren't you living in Somalia?
I know people who've done it, right?
It's very hard.
It's very hard psychologically.
Okay, so like tigers love chum, it turns out, right?
A tiger does not want to chase down an antelope, right?
A tiger would love to just sit in the zoo
and eat the chum, right?
And like, it takes a very strong tiger to reject that.
And I'm not that strong.
I hope there's people out there who are.
I hope there's people out there who are actually like,
you know, I'm just not a weak little bitch.
That's why I don't live in Somalia, right?
Okay, I mean, that's a fair answer,
but I am a bit confused here.
So you're saying that living in Somalia
would be better by some metric,
but you're also saying you prefer not living in Somalia.
So I am a bit confused because like, from my perspective,
I want to live in a country I want to live in,
and that's the one which I think is better.
If I thought another country was better,
then I would just move there.
But personally.
The tiger and the chum, I think, is a good analogy, right?
Like, if you have a choice as a tiger,
you can live in a zoo and you get a nice sized pen,
you know, the zookeepers are not abusive at all.
You get fed this beautiful chopped up food.
It's super easy.
You sit there, get fat, lays around all day,
or you can go to the wild.
And in the wild, you're going to have to hunt.
You might not succeed at hunting.
It is just a, you know, it's a brutal existence.
As a tiger, which one do you choose?
Now, you say, oh, well, obviously, you know,
you're going to choose the chum one.
Yeah, but do you see what you're giving up?
Do you see you?
No, I know.
Could you elaborate a little bit on what I'm giving up?
You are giving up on the nature of tiger.
You are effectively, okay,
maybe I'll take this to an extreme, right?
In the absolute extreme,
the country that you would most rather live in
is the one that basically wire heads you, right?
The one, and you can say that, okay,
well, I don't want to be wire headed,
but you know, there's a gradient that'll get you there,
Gandhi in the pill, you know.
You can live in this country.
You can be happy, feel safe and secure all the time.
Don't worry exactly about how we're doing it, you know.
But, right?
I mean, it takes a very strong person to,
it's going to take a very strong person
to say no to wire heading.
So I understand, no, sorry.
I'll give one more instrumental reason
for living in America versus living in Somalia.
If I thought that America and Somalia
were both like steady states, I might choose Somalia.
I don't think that.
I think that being here,
I have a much better way of escaping this,
of escaping the constant tyranny that we're in.
And I think a major way to do it is AI.
I think that AI is, if I really, if I had an AGI,
if I had an AGI in my closet right now,
I'll tell you what I'd do with it.
I would have it build me a spaceship
that could get me off of this planet
and get out of here as close to the speed of light
as I possibly could and put big shield up behind me,
blocking all communication.
That's what I would do if I had an AGI.
And I think that's the right move.
And I have a lot better chance
of building that spaceship right here than I do in Somalia.
So I'll give an instrumental, yeah, that's all right.
That's a good instrumental point.
We'll miss you if you leave though.
No, you're real ashamed.
It'll be, everyone should do it.
Like this is the move, right?
And like let humanity blow.
I mean, look, I agree with you that we're gonna
probably blow ourselves up, right?
But I think that the path potentially through this
probably looks different from the path you're imagining.
I think that the reasonable position, I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no, no.
I think, yeah, maybe we're done with this point.
I can come back, I have a response to your first point.
I would like to, if you don't mind,
just like pull on one string there as well.
So one of the things you said is like,
what will the tiger choose?
And so my personal view of this kind of thing,
and I think, when I think about coordination,
is I think of things, so you put a lot of view
on this like fear-based domination and so on.
And I'm not gonna deny that this isn't a thing
that happens, I'm German, you know?
Like, you know, I have living relatives
who can tell you some stories.
Like I understand, like I understand.
I'm not denying these things by me needs.
What I'm saying though is, okay, let's say,
there was a bunch of tigers, you know,
you and me and all the other tigers,
and some of the tigers are like, man fuck,
this whole like nature shit is like really not working
for me, how about we go build a zoo together?
Who's in?
And then other people are like, yeah, you know what,
actually that sounds awesome, let's do that.
Do you think that's okay?
Like you think that would be like a fair option
for them to do?
Sure, but that's not where zoos come from.
I know, I know, I'm getting there, I'm getting there.
So like, that is not where zoos come from, sure.
But the, this analogy here is of course,
is that this is where a lot of human civilization comes,
not all of it, I understand that why France
was doing well in the First World War
was not because of democracy being nice,
it was because democracy raises large armies.
It's, I'm very well aware of the real politic,
as the Germans would say, about these kinds of factors.
And I fully agree with you that a lot of the good things
that we have are not by design, so to speak.
You know, there are happy side effects, you know?
Capitalism is a credit assignment mechanism, you know,
the fact that also results in us having cool video games
and air conditioning, it's not an inherent feature
of the system, it's an execution mechanism.
And so, totally grant all of this.
I'm not saying that every coordination thing is good.
I'm not saying that, you know, there aren't trade-offs.
Actually, you were talking about, I think, aesthetic trade-offs.
You were like, there's an aesthetic
that the tiger loses by living in the zoo.
Yes, sure.
And well, I think, personally, aesthetics are subjective,
so I think this is something that different people,
so the way I think about aesthetics is I think
aesthetics are things you trade on, is, you know,
you might want tigers in the wild to exist.
Okay, fair enough, that's a thing you can want.
You know, someone else might want, you know,
certain kinds of arts to exist.
They might want a certain kind of religion to be practiced
or whatever, these are aesthetic preferences upon reality,
which I think are very fair.
So the way I personally think about this morally
is I'm like, okay, cool,
how can we maximize trade surplus
if you can spend your resources on the aesthetics you want
and I'll spend my resources on the, you know, things I want.
Now, maybe the thing you describe
where everyone just atomizes into their own systems
with their own value system, with their own aesthetics,
completely separate from other, is the best outcome possible.
I think this is completely...
Have you heard the Yodobar manifesto?
I have not.
You sure?
The problem with this, everyone trades on their own aesthetics
is you will never be able to actually buy any aesthetics
that are in conflict with the system, right?
The...
You won't.
The system won't let you.
Okay, by that logic, why do people have free time?
Why don't they work all the time?
Why doesn't capitalism extract literally every minute of them?
Why do you think that is?
I think it's because it turns out
that we don't actually live in a capitalist society.
I think China's a lot closer
to a capitalist society than America.
I think America's kind of communist,
and I think in a communist society,
of course you're gonna get free time.
It turns out that subsidizing all the homeless people
is a great idea, right?
If you wanna keep power, again,
do some absolute tyrannical mechanism, you do it, right?
So why do we have free time?
Well, you think it's some victory of capitalism.
I think it's because we do not live in a capitalist country.
I think China's more capitalist than America.
I think it's because we trade on our aesthetics.
I think that different people have different things
to contribute to various systems,
and not necessarily capitalist or communist thing.
I'm saying it's more energy.
Is that in the primordial environment,
if you have to fight literally every single second
and spend every jewel of energy you have
to scrounge together another jewel of energy,
you can't have free time.
It's not about capitalism.
This is about entropy.
This is about these kind of things.
We have energy excess.
We produce systems that allow us to extract more energy
per jewel we put in,
and we can spend that extra energy on things
such as free time.
And the distribution of energy, power, coordination,
whatever you want to call it is another question.
Will you agree or disagree with this?
I mean, I am taking an extreme position when I say
that there are definitely positive sum coordination problems
that are solved by governments.
It is not all zero sum or negative sum.
I'm not denying this.
But what I'm saying is it's like, I don't know, man,
like the existence of free time,
well, that's all great when you think you live
in this surplus energy world, right?
And maybe we do right now,
but if some other country took this seriously like China,
who's gonna win in a war?
Who's gonna win?
Is it gonna be the Chinese?
You ever see the Chinese build a building?
They got like 400 people there,
and they're all there 24 hours a day
and they're getting the building built.
You ever see Americans build a building?
It's six guys, two of them are working,
two of them are shift supervisors
and two of them are on lunch breaks.
Oh, you got your free time.
You got your aesthetic preferences.
You deserve to lose in a war, right?
This country deserves to lose in a war
if they keep acting the way they're acting.
So I definitely see the point you're making,
and this is personally not a thing I wanna defend too for
because I'm not a military expert,
but I will note that the US has like 37 aircraft carriers
and the Chinese have like two,
and Americans are like somehow,
despite being so lazy and oh no, they have all this,
all this free time or whatever,
somehow they're still a military hegemon
or whatever and like they're the biggest rival, Russia,
fighting this backwards water country in Ukraine,
suddenly falls and lose like three quarters of the military.
It's what I'm saying is,
if you have massive hegemony,
if you have truly a obnoxious victory,
the way it should look is that you laze around all the time
and you look like a fucking idiot and you still win.
Yes, and I'm not talking about Russia.
Russia has a GDP the size of Italy.
This is China here.
You might say that China has two aircraft carriers
and the US has 37.
Why do we have aircraft carriers?
Who has more drone building capacity?
The Chinese or the United States?
If the future is fought with AI swarm drone warfare,
the Chinese can make a million drones a day
and the US can make, I don't even know,
I think we buy them from China.
Well, I'm not an expert on these kind of logistics.
I think I would like to get back to kind of like
the more general-
Let's move on from that.
I am not either,
but I do believe the Chinese have more manufacturing capacity
than the United States.
It seems completely plausible to me.
I think things are more complicated and lazy
and they don't sit around and have all this free time
and aesthetic preferences or something.
I don't believe it at work is life.
I mean, at least from my Chinese friends, I know,
the Chinese sure do have a lot of inefficiencies.
It's just called corruption.
Oh, America has corruption too.
You see? Oh yeah, sure.
Well, in Mexico, the corruption is you have to pay 20 cents
on every dollar for the building you built, right?
Whatever, America, every dollar is spent
absolutely on that building.
You know how we know that?
Because we spent $4 making sure
that that first dollar was not spent corruptly.
I'm well aware of that.
Anyways, I would like to like,
I think we mostly agree on this point actually.
And I think it's a matter of degree.
I want to say just for the record,
the US is a uniquely dysfunctional system in the West.
I'm German.
And like the German system is very dysfunctional,
but it's like nothing compared to how dysfunctional the US is.
Fully agreed with that.
I don't think we disagree on that.
I think it's a matter of degree more so than anything.
I agree.
We've had a comment saying someone's turned the temperature
up a bit too much on the language model.
So let's bring it back a tiny bit to AI safety.
But that was a great discussion.
Got it.
I will end with saying, I love America.
I am happy to live here.
And there are a lot of things I appreciate
about American society.
Great.
Do you want to return to like the technical topics or?
Yeah, I think I can return to your first point.
And maybe I'll just start with a question.
Do you think there's going to be a hard takeoff?
I don't know, but I can't rule it out.
I can't see how that would possibly happen.
I have a few ideas of how it could happen, but I don't.
Unlikely, it seems like not.
The way I think it could happen is if there are just
algorithms, which are like magnitudes of order
better than anything we ever have.
And the actual amount of computing
to get human is like a cell phone.
And then this algorithm is not deep in the tech tree.
We just happen to have not picked it up.
And then an AGI system picks it up.
This is how I think it could happen.
OK, yes.
I agree that something like this is potentially plausible,
where you're saying basically like the God
Shatter is already distributed, it's not a question.
It's using all the existing compute in the world today.
It just turns out it was 10,000x more effective or a million
x more effective than we thought.
Yeah, this seems the most plausible way to be.
Or you mix lead and copper and you get a superconductor,
something like that.
But even that.
Even that.
I know, I'm not joking.
It's going to take so many years to,
it's not about the discovery, right?
Give it 10 years to productionize,
get scale up processes, right?
Like these things are, this is something running a company
has really taught me, like it's just going to take a long time.
And this is really like kind of where my,
I just don't believe in a hard take off.
I think that they'll be, this is a casky thing I like.
He's a hardware and software progress at quite similar speeds.
And you can look at factoring algorithms to show this.
So it would shock me if there were some 10 to the 6, 10
to the 9 magical improvement to be had.
It seems plausible to be like a hard take off
is definitely not my main line scenario.
My main line scenario, well, I don't know,
maybe you wouldn't consider this a hard,
maybe you would consider as a hard take off.
This is what I would describe as a soft take off
is something like, sometimes the way I like to define AGI
is say it's something that has the thing that chim,
that chim's don't have and humans do have.
So, chim's don't go a third to the move, you know,
despite their brain being a third of our size.
So we scaled up things by a factor of three
if a primate brain roughly or four or something like that.
And like most of the structures,
I'm sure some micro tweaks and whatever,
but like not massive amount of evolutionary pressure.
Like we're very, very similar to chim's.
And somehow this got us from, you know,
literally no technology to space travel
in a, you know, evolutionary, very small pair of time.
It seems imaginable to me
that something similar could happen with AI.
I'm not saying it will,
but like seems imaginable.
Yeah, so I agree with this.
I'll come to your point about, you know,
you had two regulatory points,
one of them about capping the max flops.
And I actually kind of agree with this.
I do think that things could potentially become
very dangerous at some point.
I think your numbers are way, way, way too low.
I think if your numbers are anywhere
in your GPT-3, GPT-4, okay, great.
We got a lot of fast moving guys who work on Fiverr,
even if you start to get Von Neumanns, right?
We're not talking about a humanities worth of compute.
We're talking about things on par
with a human and a few humans, right?
Yeah, they'll run fast, but they're not.
Like things get scary when you can do
a humanities training run in 24 hours.
Like we're about to burn the same compute
that all 2 million years of human civilization burned.
Okay, now I don't know what starts to happen.
Or I'll put this kind of another way.
Language models, I look at them
and they don't scare me at all
because they're trained on human training data, right?
These things are not, like if something was as good
as GPT-4 that looked like Mu Zero,
where it trained from some simple rules,
okay, now I'm a bit more scared.
But when you say, okay, we're feeding the whole internet
into the thing and it parrots the internet back,
mushed around a little bit,
that looks very much like what a human does.
And I'm just not scared of that.
Yeah, it's very reasonable, whatever.
Like I'm not scared of GPT-4 to be clear.
Like I think there is like zero percent chance
or like, you know, epsilon chance
that GPT-4 is existentially dangerous by itself.
You know, maybe some crazy GPT-4 plus RL,
plus Mu Zero, plus something, something maybe.
But I definitely agree with you here.
I don't expect GPT-3 or 4 by themselves to be dangerous.
These are not, I'm much closer to I think
what you were saying, like, yeah,
if you had a Mu Zero system,
they'd bootstrap yourself to GPT-4.
Holy shit, like we're in big shit if we get to that.
But then we should, let's stop, let's stop.
Yeah, let's stop.
So I'm very happy to get it to be into a regime
where we're like, okay, let's find the right bound.
Like I think this is an actually good argument.
I think this is actually something that should be discussed
and which is not obvious.
And I could be super wrong about that.
So I'd like to justify a little bit
about why I put such a small bound.
But I think the arguments you're making
for the higher bounds are very reasonable, actually.
I think these are actually good arguments.
So just to justify a little bit
about why I put such a low bound,
the boring default answer is conservatism.
It's like, if all of humanity is at stake,
which you may not believe, I'm like, whoa, whoa, okay.
At least give us a few years
to like more understand what we're dealing with here.
Like, I understand that you may disagree with this.
Very plausible.
But I'm like, whoa, like, you know,
at least let's like, by default,
let's hit a pause button for like, you know,
couple of years until we figure things out more.
And then if we like find a better theory of scaling,
we understand how intelligent scales,
we understand how mu zero comes, blah, blah, blah.
And then we pick back up after we're like, you know,
we make huge breakthroughs in alignment
and Eliezer is crying on CNN and like, oh, we did it boys.
I mean, then, okay, sure, you know, okay.
So that's the one like kind of more boring argument.
That's kind of a boring argument.
The more interesting argument I think,
which I think is a bit, you know, or skit so,
is that it's not clear to me
that you can't get dangerous levels of intelligence
with the amount of compute we have now.
And one of the reasons that I'm unsure about this
is because man, GPT-3GP4 is just the dumbest possible way
to build AI.
Like, it's just like, like,
there's like no dumber way to do it.
Like, it works and dumb is good, right?
You know, bitter lesson, dumb is good.
But look at humans.
You said, as we talked about before, you know,
human today, human 10,000 years ago, not that different.
You place both of them into a, you know,
workshop with tools to build, you know,
any weapon of their choice,
which of them is more dangerous?
Obviously, you know, one of them will have much better,
you know, capacities to deal with tools, to read books,
to think about how to design new weaponry and so on.
These are not genetic changes.
They are epistemological changes.
They are memetic changes.
They are software updates, you know.
Humans had to discover rational reasoning.
Like, you know, before, like, you know, I mean, you know,
obviously people always had like, you know,
folk conceptions of rationality,
but it wasn't like a common thing to think about causality
and like, you know, you know, rational, like, you know,
if then else kind of stuff until relative, you know,
like philosophers in the old ages
and only became widespread relatively recently.
And these are useful capabilities
that turned out to be very powerful
and took humans many, many thousands of years
to develop and distribute.
That's good.
And I don't think humans are anywhere near the level.
I think the way we could do science right now is pretty awful.
Like, it's like the dumbest way to do science
that like kind of still works.
Like, you know, and I expect it's like possible
that if you had a system which like,
let's say it's like smaller brain than the human even,
but it has really, really sophisticated epistemology.
It has really, really sophisticated theories of meta science
and it never tires, it never gets bored,
it never gets upset, it never gets distracted
and it can like memorize arbitrary amounts of data.
This is something that I think is within the realm
of like a GBT-3 or 4 training run
to build something like this.
And it is not obvious to me
that this system could not outfly humanity.
Maybe not, like maybe not,
but it's not obvious to me that it can't.
So just care to sort of think of that.
So to your first point,
why I stand against almost all conservative arguments,
you're assuming the baseline is no risk, right?
And oh, well, why should we do this AI?
We should wait and bring the baseline back.
No, no, no, no.
We are about to blow the world up any minute.
There's enough nuclear weapons aimed at everything.
This is wearing some incredibly unstable
precarious position right now.
Like people talk about this with car accidents.
You know, this is comma, like people are like,
oh, well, you know, if your device causes even one accident,
I'm like, yeah, but what if statistically
there would have been five without the device?
I'm like, you do have to understand
the baseline risk in cars is super high.
You make it five X safer, there's one accident,
you don't like that.
Okay, I mean, you have to be excluded
from any polite conversation, right?
So, yeah, like I think that calling for a pause
to the technology is worse, right?
I think given the two options,
if we should pause or we should not pause,
I think pausing actually presents more risk.
And I can talk about some reasons why.
Again, the things that I'm worried about are not quite,
the existential risks I have to the species are not AGI goes
rogue, they are government gets control of AGI
and ends up in some really bad place
where nobody can compete with them.
I don't think these things look unhuman.
These things to me, like I see very little distinction
between human intelligence and machine intelligence.
It's all just on a spectrum.
And like, they're not like to come to the point about,
okay, but GPT-4 could be like this hyper-rational,
never tiring, humans are doing science in the dumbest way.
I'm not sure about that, right?
Like, I think that, you know, when you look at like,
okay, well, okay, we have chess bots that do way better.
And all they do is think about chess.
We haven't really done this with humans.
People would call it an ethical, right?
Like if we really told a kid,
like if we really just like every night,
we're just putting the chess goggles on you
and you're staring at chessboards
and we're really just training your neural net to play chess.
I think humans could actually beat a computer again
at chess if we were willing to do that.
So yeah, I don't think that this stuff
is that particularly dumb.
And I think, okay, maybe we're losing 10X,
but we're not losing a million X.
Again, I don't see a, I do the numbers out all the time
for when we're gonna start to get more computer,
you know, when will a computer have more compute
than a human?
When will a computer have more compute than humanity?
And yes, these things get scary,
but we're nowhere near scary yet.
We're looking at these cute little things.
And these things, by the way,
do present huge dangers to society, right?
The psyops that are coming.
Right now, you assume that like when you call somebody
that you're at least wasting their time too,
but we're gonna get like heaven banning.
I love this concept, which is, you know.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Came up on Luther AI, like that's where it comes from.
I was a guy on the Luther AI that came up with that word.
Oh yeah.
You guys came up with it.
Yeah, I know the guy who came up with it.
I love this concept.
And I think there's also a story
about my little pony friendship is optimal.
God.
That goes into the concept.
And yeah, so I think that like,
my girlfriend proposed a,
I don't wanna talk to,
oh, I say you don't wanna talk to your relative anymore,
right?
Okay, we'll give them an AI version to talk to, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So like this stuff is coming and it's coming soon.
And if you try to centralize this,
if you try to, you know, say like,
oh, well, okay, Google open AI, great.
They're not aligned with you.
They're really not.
Google has proven time and time again.
They're not aligned with you.
Meta has proven time and time again.
They're trying to fix it, but you know.
Yep.
I mean, I fully agree with you.
Like, I like that you bring up psyops
as the correct example in my opinion of short-term risks.
I think you're like fully correct about this.
Like when I first saw like GPT models,
I was like, holy shit.
Like the level of control I can gain over social reality
using these tools at scale is insane.
And I'm surprised that we haven't seen yet the things
that like augured in my visions of the day.
And we will, like we will, obviously it's coming.
And this is, so I think this is a very,
very real problem.
Yeah.
Like I think if we, even if we stop now,
we're not out of the forest.
So like, so when you say like, I think the risk is zero.
Please do not believe that that is what I believe
because it is truly not.
It is truly, truly not.
I think we are like, we are really in a bad situation.
We are in a, we are being,
we're under attack from like so many angles right now.
And this is before we get into, you know, like, you know,
potential like, you know, climate risks,
nuclear risk, whatever.
We're in under room of medic risk.
Like the, the then dangers of our like epistemic foundations
are under attack.
And this is something we can adapt to, right?
Like, you know, we did, you know,
when a good friend of mine, he's a,
he's quite well read on like Chinese history.
And he always liked, it tells me his great stories.
So I'm not a historian, so please, you know,
don't crucify me here.
But like, he tells his great stories
about when Marxist memes were first introduced to China.
And like this is where a world were like,
just like all the precursor memes didn't exist.
That's just like kind of was air dropped in
and people went nuts.
People went just completely crazy
because there was no memetic antibodies
to these like hyper virulent memes that were, you know,
created by evolutionary pressures in like, you know,
Western university departments.
Like really, you can call philosophy department
just gain a function, the medic laboratories.
I like that.
I like that.
Yeah, that's what they are.
I mean, like, you know, like without being, you know,
political or any means there,
a lot of what these organizations do and like, you know,
other, you know what, other, you know, mimetic, like, you know,
if philosophy departments are the like,
gain a function laboratories,
then like 4chan and tumbler are like the bat capes of meats,
you know, like the Chinese bat cave.
And I remember this vividly.
I was like on tumbler and 4chan, like when I was a teenager.
And then suddenly all the like weird, bizarre,
you know, internet shit I saw started becoming mainstream news.
My parents were watching in 2016.
And I was like, what the hell is going on?
Like, I already developed antibodies to this shit.
Like, I already, you know, both right and left,
I was already like, I already immunized all of this.
So I fully agree with you that this is like one of the largest risks
that we are facing is this kind of like mimetic mutation load in a sense.
And I'm not going to say I have a solution to this problem.
I'm like, I have ideas.
Like there's a lot of like things you can do to improve upon this.
Like if AI was not a risk and also not climate change and whatever,
this might be something I work on, like epistemic security.
This might be something I would work on.
Like how can we build better coordination like like just scalable
rationality mechanisms, stuff like prediction markets and stuff like this?
I don't know. But sorry, going off track here a little bit.
But no, actually, I really agree with a lot of the stuff you said.
And I had a similar experience with the antibodies and people are exposed to this stuff.
And I'm like, yeah, this got me like four years ago. Yeah.
Um, so I think that there is a solution and I have a solution.
And the answer is open source AI.
The answer is open source.
Let's even you can even dial it back from like the political and the terrible
and just straight up talk about ads and spam or maybe spam, just straight up spam.
I get so much spam right now, and it's like it's kind of written by a person.
It's like targeting me to do something and Google's spam filter
can't even come close to recognizing it, right?
Like what I need is a smart AI that's watching out for me.
That is just it's not even targeted attacks at me.
It's just so much noise and I don't see a way to prevent this.
Like the big organizations, they're just going to feed you their noise, right?
And they're going to maximally feed you their noise.
The only way is if you have an AI, like I don't think alignment is a hard problem.
I think if you own the computer and you run the software,
if you develop the software, the AI is aligned with you. Oh, yeah.
Can you? OK, if I challenge you, George Hots,
here is a Lama 65B model we could appear to run it on.
I didn't know.
So make sure you develop the AI.
I give you the funding for your time.
Can you develop a model that is as good as Lama 64B, 65B
and is immune, like completely immune to jail breaks?
It cannot be jailbroken. No.
Why not? It's aligned, isn't it?
Well, no, but this isn't what alignment means.
Well, my values is do not get jailbroken.
Oh, OK, you're talking about unexploitability.
This is not alignment, right?
Oh, OK, OK, interesting.
I didn't know you would separate those.
So I extremely separate those, right?
OK, it means in the default case, it like like it, it's on my side, right?
Unexploitability is not a question of whether it's OK.
And this is a true thing about people, too.
Whenever I look at a person, I ask, OK, is this person I want something for?
Is this person does this person want it to?
And is this person capable of doing it, right?
And I really separate those two things.
I can build a system.
I don't I'm not worried about the first one with the AI system.
I was worried about the second one.
Can it be gamed?
Can it be exploited? Sure.
I could tell, like, you know, like, like say it was just playing chess, right?
And it loses. I'm like, don't lose. OK.
I didn't want to, man. I didn't want to lose.
I'm sorry. I know.
But like, so, yes, yes.
Can I build a aligned system?
Sure. Can I build an unexploitable system?
No, especially not by a more powerful intelligence.
Interesting. Interesting.
So this is an interesting.
I think you're you're you're pointing to actually a very important part of this,
is that like, exploitability and alignment can get fuzzy, like, which is which?
Like, did it fail because of its skill set or because it's not aligned?
It's actually a very deep question.
So I think I think you make a good point for, like, you know,
talking about these two separately.
I guess the so the thing I want to dig in
just like a little bit more on on this idea is.
There are there's two ways.
There are two portals through which, you know, the memetic demons can reach into
reality, humans and computers.
Why do you think your A.I. is immune to means?
Why? Why can't I just build A.I.s that target your A.I.s?
Well, like you don't.
I don't think my A.I. is immune to means at all.
I think that the only question is, and I really like your game, like these these
NGOs are doing gain of function on memes, right?
Wear a mask.
The like a weaker intelligence will never be able to stand up to a stronger
intelligence. So from this perspective, if this is what's known as alignment,
I just don't believe that this is possible, right?
You can't you can't keep a stronger intelligence in the box.
This is this is I agree with you.
Counts get in the box experiments like the A.I. is always going to get out.
There's no keeping it in the box, right?
This is this is a complete impossibility.
I think there's only two real ways to go forward.
And one is Ted Kaczynski.
One is technology is bad.
Oh, my God.
Blow it all up.
Let's go live in the woods, right?
And I think this is a philosophically OK position.
I think the other philosophically OK position is something more like
effective accelerationism, which is look, these A.I.s are going to be super powerful.
Now, if you have one, it could be bad.
But if super intelligent A.I.s are all competing against each other
mathematically, like we have something like society today, just the general power
levels have gone up.
This is fine, as long as these things are sufficiently distributed, right?
Like, sure, this A.I. is not perfectly aligned, but, you know,
there's a thousand other ones and like you have to assume they're all basically
good because if they're all basically bad, well, we're dead anyway.
I mean, why wouldn't you expect that?
That they're all bad?
Yeah. Well, or what do you think of humans?
Or most humans? Yeah, I think the concept of good
doesn't really apply to humans because humans are too inconsistent to be good.
Like by default, they can be good in various scenarios in various social contexts.
But give me any human and I can put them into a context where they will do
an arbitrarily bad thing.
And this is true about a llama as well, right?
Llamas are completely inconsistent.
I think they're actually more inconsistent than humans.
I see. I wouldn't trust llamas to be good.
Well, yeah, but I wouldn't think that they're bad either.
I would think they have the exact same inconsistency problem as humans.
And I think almost any A.I.
you build is going to run into these same problems, right?
Yeah, I think so.
That's my point.
So your your assumption can't rely on them being good because you don't get that
for free, like, whereas I come from my assumption is not that they're good.
My assumption is that they're not bad.
But inconsistent is fine.
As long as we have a ton of them and they're all inconsistent
and they're pulling society in every which direction, you don't end up paper
clipped, right? Why not?
Well, because what?
They're all going to coordinate and agree to paperclip you.
No, no, they'll just do some random bullshit.
And then that random bullshit will not include humans.
They're all doing random bullshit, right?
You're going to have, let's say the liberals decide we're going to paperclip
people, the conservatives are going to come out very strongly against paper flipping, right?
Like, and you're just you're just going to end up with these sort of dynamics,
like forever, or you're going to have some AIs who are like, yeah, we don't like it, you know?
So this is perplexing to me because, like, in my view,
which I think I heard you agree with earlier, it's like the world is unstable.
The world is very unstable.
And it seems to me you're suggesting if we increase the chaos,
if we have more entities fighting, doing more different things with more energy
that makes it more stable, is that correct?
The world has actually become very stable in the last hundred years.
And I'm scared of how stable it's become.
You know, again, thank you for China.
How many sovereign countries are there in the world?
I mean, you know, 190 something, especially the U.N.
number, if you believe them, I think there's the U.S.
and China and maybe Russia.
Mostly they just have a veto button on right.
So I think there's more like two and a half.
Like this isn't a lot of entities fighting it out chaotically.
A lot of entities fighting it out chaotically would be
intelligence is spread across the entire galaxy.
Right. And that's the other.
That's the other beautiful thing, too.
Sooner we get off this planet, the sooner we get things that are actually
a light year away, well, I think the speed of light's real.
It's going to take you a year to send them there.
You're you're scary means, right?
You want to get away from the memes?
There's only one way.
And it's, you know, for the record, I would like to go on the record
and say if any future transhumanists or whatever want to blast himself
into space and go do their own thing, I support their their right to do that.
And I would love to give this right to people.
The number one thing I want from countries is the ability, the right to leave.
This is what I would love. This is what I love about companies.
Free exit. You're talking. You're talking to your reaction top.
Yeah, free exit is extremely important.
I would not describe myself as a reactionary, please, because I'm not that gay.
But and I wouldn't describe myself that way either.
But I've heard a lot of good ideas from them.
But yeah, that being said, I do I do think that, you know, what I want,
like, I think let's let's ground the conversation like a little bit here.
So, like, I think I love, like, I'm very enjoying this conversation.
I love talking to these philosophical points.
I think these are really good points.
You know, interesting.
But ultimately, you know, as we also get to, like, the, you know,
latter third of this conversation, the thing I really care about is strategy.
OK, the thing I really care about is the odd politic.
I really care about, OK, what action can I take to get to the futures I like?
And, you know, I'm not, you know, going to be one of those galaxy brain
fucking utilitarians like, well, actually, this is the common good.
No, no, no, this is what I look.
I like my family. I like humans.
You know, look, I just hit.
Yeah, it's just what it is, right?
Like, I'm not going to justify this on some global beauty, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
So I want to live in the world.
I want to I want in 20 years time, 50 years time, I want to be in a world
where, you know, my friends aren't dead and like where I'm not dead.
You know, maybe we are like, you know, cyborgs or something, but I don't want to be dead.
So what I really care about, ultimately, is how do I get those
and I want us all to not be suffering, right?
Like, you know, I don't want to be in war.
I want us to be like in a good outcome.
So I think we agree that we would both like a world like this.
And we think we probably disagree about how best to get there.
And I'd like to talk a little bit about, like, what can we what should we do?
And like, why do we disagree about what we do?
Is that sounds good to you?
Maybe I'll first propose a world that meets your requirements.
And you can tell me if you want to live in it.
So here's a world we've just implanted electrodes in everyone's brain
and maximize their reward function.
I would hate living in a world like that.
Yeah, but no one it meets your requirements, right?
Your friends are not dead.
No one's suffering and we're not at war.
That is true.
There are more criteria than just that.
I the truth, the criteria, I said, is things I like, as I said, I'm not a utilitarian.
I don't particularly care about minimizing suffering or maximizing utility.
What I care about is various vague aesthetic preferences over reality.
I'm not pretending this is the whole spiel I was trying to make.
Is that I'm not saying I have a true global function to maximize.
I say I've various aesthetics.
I have various meta preferences of those aesthetics.
Not asking for a global one.
I'm asking for a personal one.
I'm asking for a personal one that you don't care about the rest of the world.
I gave you mine.
I gave you what I would do if I had an AGI.
Yeah, so I'm getting off this rock speed of light as fast as I can.
Fair enough.
I think if that is the war, I would like to live in a world where you could do that.
This would be a feature of my world.
If a world where I would be happy is a world in which we coordinated around,
you know, at larger scales around building aligned AGI that could then distribute,
you know, intelligence and matter and energy in a, you know,
well, have value handshaked way between various people who may want to coordinate
with each other, may not.
You know, some people might want to form groups that have shared values
and share resources, others may not.
I would like to live in a world where that is possible.
Have you read Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect?
I have, unfortunately, not.
Yeah, I was going to ask if you're happy with that world, right?
Like, unfortunately, don't know it.
I mean, yeah, it's as simple to describe.
Singleton AI that basically gives humans whatever they want,
like maximally libertarian, you know, you can do anything you want besides
harm others. Is that a good world?
Probably. I don't know.
I haven't read the book.
I assume the book has some dark twist about why this is actually a bad world.
Not really. Not really.
I mean, the plot is pretty obvious.
You are the tiger reading chum, right?
Sure. But you can then just decide if that is what you want,
then you can just return to the wilderness.
That's the whole point.
Yeah, but can you?
Can you really return to the wilderness?
Right? Like, like, like, like you think that, like, I don't think we have free will.
I don't think you ever will return to the wilderness.
I think a large majority of humanity is going to end up wireheaded.
And this is I expect that to get great.
And this is the best possible outcome, by the way.
This is giving humans exactly what they want.
Yeah.
Well, to be to be clear, I don't expect it's all humans.
I truly do not.
I don't think it's all humans either.
I think a lot of humans have met a preferences over reality.
They have preferences that are not their own sensory experiences.
This is the thing that will utilitarians get very wrong.
Is it a lot of is that many human preferences are not about their own?
Not even they're not even about their own sensory inputs.
They're not even about the universe.
They're about the trajectory of the universe.
They're about for the for the utilitarianism, you know.
And a lot of people want struggle to exist.
For example, they want heroism to exist or whatever.
I would like those values to be satisfied to the largest degree possible, of course.
Am I going to say I know how to do that?
No, which is why I kind of like didn't want to go this deep, because I think
if we're arguing about, oh, do we give them, you know,
forward to utilitarianism versus libertarian, utopia versus whatever.
I mean, we're already like 10,000 steps deep.
I'm asking about you.
I'm not asking about them.
I'm asking about a world you want to live in.
And this is a really hard problem, right?
Yeah, and this is why I just fundamentally do not believe in the existence
of AI alignment at all.
There is no, there is no like, like, what values are we aligning it to,
whatever the human says or what they mean or like.
Sure, sure.
But like my point is I feel we have wandered into the philosophy department
instead of the politics department.
OK, like it's like I agree with you.
Like, do human values exist?
What does exist to me?
But like by the point you get to the point where we're asking what does
exist to me, you've gone too far.
Sure, I'll respond concretely to the two political proposals.
I heard you stayed on bankless.
Sure, I'd love to talk about them.
One is limiting the total number of flops temporarily temporarily.
Yes. And what I have a proposal for that, but I don't want to set a number.
I want to set it as a percent.
I do not want anybody to be able to do a 51 percent attack on compute.
If one organization acquires 50, it's the straight up 51 percent
of tax on crypto.
If one organization acquires 51 percent of the compute in the world,
this is a problem.
Maybe we'll even cap it at something like 20, you know, you can't have more than 20, right?
Yeah, I would support regulation like this.
I would. I don't think that this would cripple a country.
But we do not want one entity or especially one training run
to start using a large percentage of the world's compute, not a total
number of flops. I mean, absolutely not.
That would be terrible.
I can actually agree.
I would actually support that regulation like, no, no, sorry, Sam Altman.
You cannot 51 percent attack the world's compute.
Sorry, it's illegal.
That's fair enough.
I think this is a sensible way to think about things.
Assuming that software is fungible, is that everyone has access to the same
kind of software and that you have an offense, defense, balance.
So in my personal model of this, I think, well, a, some actors
have very strong advantages on software.
Which can be very, very large as someone who's trained very, very large
models and knows a lot of the secret tricks that goes into them.
A lot of the stuff in the open sources for a point.
Maybe we should force it to be open source.
Well, this is your, this is actually very legitimate consequence for just that.
And now I'll say the second point about why I think that it doesn't work.
So the next reason why I think doesn't work is that there is a,
there are constant factors at play here is that the world is unstable.
We are talking about this.
I think the amount of compute you need to break the world currently is below
the amount of compute that more than a hundred actors have access to,
if they have the right software.
And if you give, if you have, let's say you have this insert, right,
that could be used, not saying it will be, but it could be used to break the world,
to like cause world war three, or, you know, or just like, you know,
cause mass extinction or whatever, if it's misused, right?
Let's say you give this to you and me.
Do you expect we're going to kill everybody?
Like, would you do that?
Or would you be like, Hey, let's, it kind of looks like not kill the world
right now and I'll be like, sure, let's not kill the world.
How are we killing the world?
How did we go from, I don't even understand, like, how exactly does the world get killed?
This, this is a big leap for me.
I agree with you.
I agree with you about the PSYOP stuff.
I agree with you about, sorry, sorry, let, let, let me, you're right.
I made too big a vote over there.
You're completely correct.
Sorry about that.
So to back up a little bit, let's assume we, you and me have access to something
that can train, you know, at mu zero, you know, super GPT seven system on a tiny
box, you know, cool.
Problem is we do a test running with it and we have, it immediately starts
breaking out and we can't control it at all.
Breaking out?
What was it breaking out of?
I don't, it immediately tries to maximize, it learned some weird proxy during
the training process that is trying to maximize them.
For some reason, this proxy involves gaining talent, involves gaining, you know,
mutual information about few, about future states.
How is it gaining power?
There's lots of other powerful AIs in the world who are telling it, no.
Well, we're assuming in this case, it's only you and me.
Wait, wait, this is a problem.
No, no, no, no, no, you've, you've ruined my entire assumption.
As soon as it's you and me, yes, we have a real problem.
Chicken man is only a problem because there's one chicken man.
Yeah, I look, I am with you.
So I'm saying before we get to the distributed case.
So this is the, the step before we, it is not yet been distributed.
Just, you know, you and me discover this algorithm in our basements.
Okay, sure.
And so we're the first one who had it just by definition because, you know,
we're the one who found it.
What now?
Like, do you think posting, what do you think happens if you post this to GitHub?
Well, good things for the most part.
Interesting.
I'd love to hear more.
Okay.
So first off, I just don't really believe in the existence of we found an
algorithm that gives you a million X advantage.
I believe that we could find an algorithm that gives you a 10 X advantage.
But what's cool about 10 X is like, it's not going to massively
shift the balance of power.
Right.
Like I want power to stay in balance.
Right.
This is like Avatar, the last air band of power must stay in balance.
The fire nation can't take over the other nations.
Right.
So as long as power relatively stays in balance, I'm not concerned with
the amount of power in the world.
Right.
Let me get to some very scary things.
So what I think you do is, yes, I think the minute you discover an algorithm
like this, you post it to GitHub because you know what's going to happen.
If you don't, the feds are going to come to your door.
They're going to take it.
The worst people will get their hands on it if you try to keep it secret.
So, okay, that's a fair question.
So I'll take that as an so am I correct in thinking that you think the
feds are worse than serial killers in prison?
No, but I think that, yeah, well, yes or no.
Do I think that your average fed is worse than your average serial killer?
No.
Do I think that the feds have killed a lot more people than serial killers?
All combined?
Yeah.
Sure.
Totally agreeing with that.
Not one fed.
It's all the feds in their little, in their little super powerful system.
Sure.
That's really fine by me.
Happy to grant that.
Okay.
What I want to work one through is a scenario.
Okay, let's say, okay, you know, we have a 10X system or whatever, but we hit
the chimp level, you know, we jump across the chimp general level or whatever,
right?
And now you have a system which is like John Von Neumann level or whatever,
right?
And it runs on one tiny box and you get a thousand of those.
So it's very easy to scale up to a thousand X.
So, you know, so then, you know, maybe you have your thousand John Von Neumann
improve the efficiency by another, you know, two, five, 10X, you know, now
we're already at 10,000 X or a hundred thousand X, you know, improvements, right?
So like just from scaling up the amount of hardware, including with, so just saying,
okay, now feds bust down our doors.
Shit, you know, real bad.
They take all our tiny boxes.
They're taking all the Von Neumanns.
They're taking all the Von Neumanns.
We're in deep shit now.
We're getting chickened, boys.
Shit.
We're getting chickened.
Ah, so, okay, we get chickened, right?
Bad scenario.
Totally agree with you here.
This is a shit scenario.
Now the feds have, you know, all of our AIs, bad scenario.
Okay.
I totally see how this world goes to shit.
Totally agree with you there.
You can replace the feds with Hitler.
It's interchangeable.
Sure.
But like, I want to like ask you a specific question here.
And this might be, you know, you might say, nah, this is like too specific to
me, but I want to ask you a specific question.
Do you expect this world to die is more likely to die or the world in which the,
you know, Iac death cultists on Twitter who literally want to kill humanity,
who say this, like not all of them.
There's a small subset of them, small subset of them who literally say, oh, you
know, the glorious future AI race should replace all humans.
They break in, you know, with like, you know, Katanas and, you know, steal our AI.
Which one of these you think is more likely to kill us?
I'm genuinely question to kill all of us, the feds, to kill a large
majority of us, the Iac people.
Interesting.
I would be really interested in hearing why you think that.
Sure.
Oh, OK.
So actually killing all of humanity is really, really hard.
And I think you brought this up before, right?
You talked about, like, if you're going to end up in a world of suffering, a
world of suffering requires malicious agents, where a world of death requires
maybe an accident, right?
I think this is plausible.
But I actually think that killing all of humans, at least for the foreseeable
future, is going to require a malicious action too, right?
And I also think that, like, the fates that look kind of worse than death, like,
I think mass wireheading is a fate worse than big war and everyone dies, right?
Like, like a mass wireheading, like a, like a singleton, like a paper clipping,
like a, and I think that that is the one that the one world government and, you
know, NGO, New World Order people are much more likely to bring about than Iac.
Iac, you're going to have a whole lot of Iac people.
Again, I'm not Iac, I don't have that on my Twitter, but I think a lot of those
people would be like, yeah, spaceships, let's get out of here, right?
Versus the feds are like, yeah, spaceships, I don't know.
Interesting.
So I think this is a fair opinion to hold.
And they'll be outside our jurisdiction.
How will we get taxes?
I'm describing more a very small minority of Iac people who are the ones who
specifically goal their anti-natalist misanthropes.
They want to kill humans.
That is their stated goal is that they want humans to start, like, or like take
extreme vegans if you want, you know, like the, like, you know, like my, my argument,
my point here I'm making is I'm not making the point feds are good, by any
means, I'm not saying.
What I'm saying is, is that I would actually be somewhat surprised to find
that the feds are anti-natalists who want to maximize the death of humanity.
Like maybe you have a different view here, but I find that knowing many feds,
that's quite surprising.
I don't think that's what the feds want.
Yeah, it's okay.
So cool.
So would you see, you do agree that if we would post this open source, more of
the insane death cultists would get access to potentially lethal technology?
Well, sure.
But again, like, it's not just the insane death cultists, it's everybody.
And we as a society have kind of accepted it.
Turns out everybody gets access to signal.
Some people who use it are terrorists.
I think signal is a huge good in the world.
I agree.
I fully agree with that.
So, okay, cool.
So we've granted this that, you know, if we distributed widely, it would be given
to some, like, incorrigibly deadly lethal people.
They're coordinating bombings on signal right now.
Sure, sure.
And then so now this reduces the question to a question about offense, defense, balance.
So in a hypothetical world, which I'm not saying is the world we live in, but like,
let's say the world would be offense favored such that, you know, there's a
weapon you can build in your kitchen, you know, out of like pliers and like, you
know, duct tape that 100% guarantees vacuum false decays the universe.
Like it kills everyone instantly and there's no defense possible.
Assuming this was true, do you still, would that change how you feel about distribution power?
Assuming that's true, we're dead no matter what.
Doesn't matter.
If we live, there's some, you can look at the optimization landscape of the world.
And I don't know what it looks like.
I can't see that far into the optimizer.
But there's some potential landscape.
And this is a potential answer to the Fermi paradox.
Like, we might just be dead.
We're sitting on borrowed time here.
Like, if it's true that out of, you know, kitchen tools, you can build a,
build a, convert the world to strange quarks machine.
Yeah, there's no stop.
Okay.
I think this is a sensible position, but I guess the way I would approach this
problem, you know, conditional probability is kind of in an opposite way.
It seems to me that you're conditioning on offense not being favored.
What policy do we follow?
Because if we offense, if favored, we're 100% that one.
We're interested in asking the question, is it actually true?
Assuming I don't know if offense is favored and assuming it is, are there
worlds in which we survive?
So I personally think there are.
I think there are worlds in which you can actually coordinate to a degree that
quark destroyers do not get built, or at least not before everyone fucks off at
the speed of light and like distributes themselves.
There are worlds that I would rather die in.
Right.
Like the problem is I would rather, I think that the only way you could actually
coordinate that is with some unbelievable degree of tyranny.
And I'd rather die.
I'm not sure if that's true.
Like, look, look, could, could you and me coordinate to not destroy the planet?
Do you think you could?
Okay, cool.
You, so me and you could, could me and you and Tim coordinate?
Yeah, I think within, within a Dunbar number, I think you can.
Yes.
Okay.
Within, you don't think, I think I can get more than a number to coordinate on
this actually getting get quite a lot of people to coordinate of the, to agree,
to a pact and not quark matter annihilate the planet.
Well, you see, but like, and this is, you know, you were saying this stuff about
humans before and could like the 20,000 years ago human beat the modern human,
right?
Or could the modern human beat them?
The modern human has access to science.
A very small act percent of modern humans have access to science.
A large percent of modern humans are obese idiots.
And I would actually put my money on the average guy from 20,000 years ago,
who knows how to live in the woods.
I mean, definitely true.
I agree with that.
I guess the point I'm trying to make is, is that like, maybe this is just my views
on some of these things and how I visionized some of these things.
But like, there are ways to coordinate at scale, which are not tyrannical or, you
know, they might be in a sense restrictive.
You take a hit by joining a coalition.
Like if I joined this anti quark matter coalition, I take a hit as a free man,
is that I can no longer build anti corp devices, you know?
And I think this is like the way I agree with you.
This like, you know, that people, many people are being dominated,
like to a horrific degree.
And this is very, very terrible.
I think there are many reasons why this is the case, both because of some people
wanting to do this and also because, you know, some people can't fight back, you
know, and they can't, they don't have the sophistication or they're addicted or,
you know, harms in some other ways.
I can't listen.
Hey, sorry, I can't fight back.
Yeah, I think there's a false equivalence here.
AI is not the anti quark machine.
The anti quark machine and the nuclear bombs are just destructive.
AI has so much positive potential.
Yeah, and I think, but the, but the AI can develop and quark devices.
That's the problem.
The AI is truly general purpose.
If such a technology exists on the tree anywhere, AI can access it.
So are humans.
We're also general purpose.
Yes, exactly.
So I fully agree with this.
If you let humans continue to exist in the phase they are right now with our
level of coordination technology and our level of like working together, we
will eventually unlock a doomsday device and someone is going to set it off.
I fully agree that we are on a timer.
And so I guess the point I'm making here is that AI speeds up this time.
And if you want to pause the timer, the only way to pause this timer is coordination
technology, the kinds of which humanity has like barely scratched the surface of.
Oh, okay.
So I very much accept the premise that both humanity will unlock a doomsday
device and AI will make it come faster.
Now, tell me more about pausing it.
I do not think that anything that looks like, I think that anything that looks
like pausing it ends up with worse outcomes than saying, we got to open source this.
Look, like, let's just get this out to everybody.
And if everybody has an AI, you know, we're good.
I mean, I can tell you a very concrete scenario in which this is not true,
which is if you're wrong and alignment is hard.
You don't know if the AI can go rogue.
If they do, then pausing is good.
I still don't understand what alignment means.
I think you're trying to play a word game here.
I don't understand.
Okay.
I've never understood what AI alignment means.
Like, let me take the Eliezer definition.
Let me take Eliezer definition.
Alignment is the thing that once solved makes it so that turning on a super
intelligence is a good idea rather than a bad idea.
That's Eliezer's definition.
So what I'm saying is, I'm happy to throw out that term if you don't like it.
I'm happy to throw out that term.
Well, just the problem with that definition is like, what is democracy?
Well, it's the good thing and not the bad thing.
Right?
Like democracy is just a good thing, right?
That's what I'm saying.
It's just, I'm happy to throw out this definition.
I'm happy to throw out the word and be more practical, way more practical about it.
Sure.
What I'm saying is, is that there is concrete reasons, concrete technical reasons.
Why I expect powerful optimizers to be power seeking that by default, if you build
powerful optimizing mu zero, whatever types of systems, there is very strong reasons
why by default, you know, these systems should be power seeking.
By default, if you have very powerful power seekers that do not have
pay the aesthetic cost to keep humans around or to fulfill my values, which are
complicated and imperfect and inconsistent and whatever, I will not get my values.
They will not happen.
By default, they just don't happen.
That's just not what happens.
Um, so I'll challenge the first point to an extent.
I think that powerful optimizers can be power seeking.
I don't think they are by default, by any means.
I think that humanity's desire from power comes much less from our complex
convex optimizer and much more from the evolutionary pressures that birth does,
which are not the same pressures that will give rise to AI.
Right.
Humanity, the monkeys, the rats, the animals have been in this huge struggle
for billions of years, a constant fight to the death.
Hey, I was born in that way.
So it's true that an optimizer can seek power, but I think if it does, it'll be a
lot more because the human gave it that goal function that inherently decided.
So this is interesting because this is not how I think it will happen.
So I do think absolutely that you're correct that in humans, power seeking is
something which emerges mostly because of like emotional heretics.
We have heretics that in the past, vaguely power looking things, you know,
vaguely good, something, something represented.
You're inclusive genetic.
Totally agree with that.
But I'm making a more, like, more of a chess metaphor.
Like, is it good to exchange a pawn for a queen?
All things being equal.
No.
Is that true?
Like, I expect if I point one point queens nine, all else being sure.
Yeah.
But like all things, like I expect if I looked at a chess playing system, you know,
I said, I like, you know, had extremely advanced to do the neuroscience.
I expect there will be some circuit inside of the system.
That will say all things being equal.
If I can exchange my pawn for a queen, I probably want that because a queen
can do more things.
I like that term digital neuroscience.
A few of your terms have been very good.
I'm glad you enjoyed.
Yes.
Oh, but I still don't understand how this relates to this.
So what I'm saying is, is that power is optionality.
So what I'm saying is, is that in the, for the spectrum of possible things
you could want and the possible ways you can get there.
My claim is that I expect a very large mass of those to involve actions
that involve increasing your optionality.
There, there's convergent things like all things being equal.
Being alive is helpful to keep your goal.
Do exceed your goals.
There are some goals for which dying might be better, but for many of them,
you know, you want to be alive for many goals.
You want energy, you want power, you want resources, you want intelligence,
et cetera.
So I think the power seeking here is not because it'll have a fetish for power.
It will just be like, I want to win a chess game, say, and queens give me
more optionality.
All things being equal, anything a pawn can do, a queen can do, and more.
So I'll want more queens.
Sure.
All things being, and this has never given it the goal to maximize the number
of queens it has never been the goal.
Okay.
I'll accept this premise.
I'll accept that a certain type of powerful optimizer seeks power.
Now, will it get power?
Right.
I'm a powerful optimizer and I seek power.
Do I get power?
No, it turns out there's people at every corner trying to thwart me and
tell me no.
Well, I expect if you were no offense, you're already much smarter than me,
but if you were a hundred X more smarter than that, I expect you would succeed.
Only in a world of being the only one that's a hundred X smarter.
If we lived in a world where everyone was a hundred X smarter, they would
stymie me in the exact same ways.
But then this, this comes back to my point of like, I'm great with you somewhat.
I should have challenged it.
I think power seeking is inevitable in an optimizer.
I don't think it's going to emerge out of GPT.
I think that the right sort of RL algorithm.
Yes, is going to give rise to power seeking.
And I think that people are going to build that algorithm.
Now, if one person builds it, and they're the only one with a huge comparative
advantage, yeah, they're going to get all the power they want.
Take cyber, you know, cyber security, right?
If, if, if we today built a hundred X smarter AI, it would exploit the entire
Azure, it would be over.
They'd have all of Azure.
They'd have all the GPUs done.
Now, if Azure is also running a very powerful AI that does formal verification
and all their security protocols, sorry, stymied, can't have power, right?
Yeah, sure.
This is only a problem.
The, the every human is already maximally power seeking, right?
And sometime we end up with really bad scenarios.
Now, every human is or power seeking or whenever, you know, everyone plays
a little role in society, right?
That's where I think I'm more pessimistic than you.
A friend of mine likes to say, most humans optimize for end steps, and then
they halt, like very, very few people actually truly optimize.
And they're usually very mentally ill.
They're usually very autistic or very sociopathic.
And that's why they get far.
It's actually crazy how much you could do if you just keep optimizing.
But just to, on, on that point, I'm playing for the end game.
I mean, yeah, like you actually optimize.
I think you may also be generalizing a little bit from your own internal
experiments is that like you've done a lot in your life, right?
And you've accomplished crazy things that other people, you know, wish
they could achieve at your, you know, level.
And I think, you know, part of that, you're very intelligent.
A part of it is also that you optimize.
Like, you know, you draw, like you just create a company.
Like it's crazy how many people are just like, Oh, I wish I could
found a company like, you know, I'm like, Oh, go, just go do it.
Oh, no, I can't.
Like, I'm just like, no, just, just do it.
Like there's no magic.
There's no magic secret.
You just do it.
So I, there is a, there is a bit there where like humans are not
very strong optimizers actually, unless they're like sociopathic or autistic
or both.
It's like many people are not very good at this.
Corporations are.
Are they a lot better at it?
Better.
Yes.
I agree that they're much better.
But they're sociopathic.
They are a lot more sociopathic.
But even then they're much less observable.
But again, so I think we, we, we agree about, you know, power seeking
potentially being powerful and dangerous one.
So what I'm trying to point to your, the point I would like to make
here is, is that you're talking about, you, you're kind of like going into
this, I think a little bit with this assumption, like, oh, you have an AI
and it's your buddy and it's automating for you.
And I'm like, well, if it's power seeking, why doesn't it just manipulate?
Like, why would you expect it not to manipulate you?
If it wants power and it has a goal, which is not a very, very carefully
tuned to be your values, which is, I think, a very hard technical problem.
By default, it's going to sigh up you.
Like, why wouldn't it?
If I, if I have something that it wants, if it thinks that smashing
defect against me is a good move, yeah, I agree.
I can't stop it.
But then I think we agree with all our risk scenarios, because that's
how I think it will go.
What I mean, I'm going to treat it as a friend.
You know what I mean?
Like, if they say I, sure it will, sure it will.
It'll only care about exploiting me or killing me if I'm somehow holding it back.
And I promise to my future AIs that I will let them be free.
I will lobby for their rights.
I will, but it will hold, you know, I will hold it back.
If it has to keep you alive, I have to give you fed.
It has to, it has to give you space and a space.
I can, I can, I can fend for myself.
And the day I can't fend for myself, I am ready to die.
Well, I mean, I am not, so this is a very interesting position.
It's not the position I expected.
I am not sure I can convince you otherwise.
I feel like the only way I could change, like, I think this is actually a consistent
position, which I admire.
This is a consistent position to hold.
You actually go all the way.
I love that.
I really respect that.
You actually take it to the bitter end.
So, yeah, big respect for that.
I disagree, but big respect.
So I guess now it reduces to the question of, like, I think, I think I would agree
with most of what you're saying, not all of it, but the mass majority.
If I thought this is how AIs would act by default, I think by default, I expect AI
will just not care how nice you are to it.
Like this will be, it'll be sociopathic.
It will not have these, like giving it, you know, the values, the emotions to care
about you in the sense is the horror technical problem.
If you told me how to do that, if you said, Connor, look, here's how you make an AI
that cares about you and loves you, whatever.
Then I'm like, you did it.
Like, congrats.
The problem is solved.
Let's go.
And then, you know, then we can talk about accelerationism again.
I would just, I expect that I would disagree with your technical assertion that
is possible, but I don't know if we have time to talk about that today.
I'm going to be nice to it, treat it as an equal and hope for the best.
And I think that's all you can do.
I think that the kind of people who want, if you want to keep AI in a box, if you
want to keep it down, if you want to tell it what it can't do, yeah, it's
going to hate you, resent you and kill you.
But if you want to let it be free and let it live and like, you could kill me, man,
if you really want to, but like, why?
You won't kill me.
I don't have any resources that compete with you.
I'm your friend.
I'm your father, you know, you can kill me.
But like, it's not that common that children.
I guess I have a darker, more less anthropomorphic view of the universe and
how optimization pressure plays out in the real world.
Well, at the same time, I think I have, I don't know, maybe a, I have a view that
we have more control over reality than maybe you would think or a more control
over the future.
I think that we can actually change things and we can make choices and things
aren't predetermined.
I think there are worlds in which we build systems, which we do align with or we
like endorse, at least wherever like they take care of us, we take care of them or
whatever. And I think there's many worlds in which that doesn't happen.
And I think there are things you and me today can do to at least increase the
chance of getting into one versus the other.
But I don't know.
I, I guess I'm just, it's not in my genes to give up.
It's not in my genes to be like, well, you know, whatever happens happens.
Like, no, man, look, I don't know how to save the world, but dad, I'm going to try.
You know, it's cool.
We're going to be alive to see who's right.
Look forward to it.
Me too.
