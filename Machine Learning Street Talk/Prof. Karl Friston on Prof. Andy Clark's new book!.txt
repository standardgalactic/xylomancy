I had to google what a pot boiler meant.
Apparently it's a brief and cheerful book to make money.
So I went beautifully written, but then I had to re-read it to write the blur,
but it's certainly more than a pot boiler.
It's actually an interesting synthesis of, I think, where that style,
certainly Andy's style of thinking about life and making sense of the lived world
and physically engaging with that world, where he was prior to predictive processing
and active inference before the pragmatic turn or the inactivist shift.
He had been moved from the 21st century.
Before that, he was famous for things like the extended mind, the designer environment.
In the spirit of niche construction, we actually create our own niche.
We create our own environment in a way that makes it much more predictable
and affords the opportunity now to download a lot of our cognitive capacities into the world.
Our memories are now in our iPhones.
Then he's basically taken those foundational and fundamental ideas
and contextualized them in the context of modern predictive processing and active inference.
This is the synthesis. A lovely read.
I wanted to pick up on something you just said, because when I was reading the book,
I was rather struck by this idea that we live in a hallucination,
which is conditioned by actual sensory information,
but let's say 90% hallucination and 10% sensory information.
From an inactivism point of view, what's really interesting about that school of thought
is that we create the world that we live in, as well as the world creating our own kind of sensorium.
That's something that really struck me as being quite interesting.
What's your take on this living a hallucination?
You say 90% hallucination and 10%
I'm probably going to 100% but that's absolutely right.
If you believe that everything that we perceive as being real is a hypothesis,
the product of a constructive organ, a statistical organ,
a little scientist that just is our brain,
then all you're saying is that the sensory data are just in the service of confirming that hypothesis
or this alternative hypothesis or another hypothesis.
The key observation being it's all hypotheses, it's all fantasy.
Using the fantasy word is nice because it means that the brain is literally a fantastic organ.
It's a purveyor of a device for basically adjudicating, choosing the right hypothesis
that has the best fit to this sensory data, but of course as you point out,
it's not just the fact that we assess our brains, creatures, phenotypes that are delivered of data.
Andy Clarke would express this in terms of this outside in process.
We actually have to actively select those data by moving, by palpating with our fingers,
by moving our eyes around.
We are in charge of the data that we now solicit to verify or disconfirm our hallucinations or our hypotheses.
So that's the inactive part, that's a sort of actively engaged in a way that induces this kind of circular causality.
We are certainly constrained by our sensory data.
Our predictions and hypotheses are informed by and contextualized by sensory data,
but at the same time the ensuing hypotheses underwrite the way that we sample the next bit of data.
So there's this wonderful sort of autodidactic, physical engagement with the lived world.
Yes, yes, but I would love to understand where the autonomy comes from.
The reason I'm asking this question is there have been many papers on chat GPT recently
that have essentially built an outer loop to find different prompts.
So if you think of GPT as an information retrieval system,
there's an outer loop to explore prompts in the neighbourhood of the original prompts.
This is very similar to what you're saying from the inactive point of view.
Now there are books about how we think with our bodies and you just said that there's an outer loop that says,
well I now need to explore with my physical body in my physical environment to get more information to do inference.
And what process is doing that outer loop?
So I guess the body is in and of itself just a hypothesis and therefore the answer to your question,
it can't be that the self is, if you like, driving this active engagement,
this sort of active learning and active inference about the way the world works.
If it is the case that the self is actually emergent from,
or an explanation we bring to the table to explain all of these data.
So there must be something underneath that and as a true Bayesian statistician,
my answer would be there are some prior belief.
And I don't mean belief in a sort of folk psychology sense,
I just mean in terms of some probabilistic distributions and probabilistic specification
of what it is to be something like me.
And then something like me goes around self-evidencing, acquiring sensory data
that supplies evidence for my model of this world.
And I suddenly have the hypothesis that this world actually includes me as an agent, as an artifact.
And then I develop a sense of self.
So I guess your question is where does the autonomy come from?
As a mathematician it comes from autonomous differential equations that underwrite the itinerancy
and technically the attracting sets of the attractors that characterise me,
that specify the characteristic states that I will remain in.
So technically speaking I can, if you like, elu the question about where does autonomy come from,
where it comes from autonomous differential equations that characterise
an attracting set of characteristic states that make me.
And you could actually simulate that, you can simulate all sorts of things
that have this sort of bimetic aspect on walking, talking, writing,
all of these basically being a physical realisation or instantiation
of these autonomous dynamics that, in a very straightforward way,
are physically realised by our neuronal dynamics.
However, I suspect your use of the word autonomy wasn't so technical or deflationary.
I think that to be autonomous, first of all, is to be a kind of thing,
a particle or person that can act upon the world.
So I think that there's a minimal requirement that you have various states
that change the states on the outside of you that are external to you,
that are extrinsic, that are hidden behind your sensations,
your sensory veils that are latent in the sense that you'll never observe them directly.
So to be autonomous is to be able to move, but there's clearly more to it
in the sense that if you're trying to explain your inactive or active engagement
with the world in terms of making sense of the world,
you're basically describing active inference, you're describing
an evidence-gavalling machine, you're describing self-evidence
as Jacob Howey would express it, another brother-in-arms
and a friend of Andy Clark's, and another, I guess he'd probably be very pleased
to call himself a cognitive philosopher, but Jacob has not invented
but certainly repurposed the notion of self-evidencing
as a very succinct and neat way to describe this kind of predictive processing
that has this active engagement and active flavour.
For me that would be active inference, and what is it?
Well, it's just basically gathering evidence from my models of the lived world.
So then you say, well okay, what underwrites this evidence-gavalling?
It's the generative model, it's the model that you are gathering evidence for
and you're continually updating that model, and I mean generative model
exactly in the spirit of generative AI, that there is an implicit
and possibly sometimes explicit model that you are gathering evidence for
and that model affords the opportunity to generate the kind of content
that will be generated or observed under that model
and hence you can look at generative AI in a large language model
exactly in that spirit.
So the question now reduces in terms of where does autonomy come from?
It really comes from the genetic model, where does that come from?
Well it comes probably from your mum and dad.
In two senses, not just your genetic and epigenetic specification
but also the cultural niche construction, the way that you are brought up
so that you have, if you like, a specification of the characteristic states
that make you a good son or a good daughter or a good conspecific.
That now undergird the generative model
and then you seek evidence for your model
and you learn the particular specialisation, the parameters of your model
by being brought up properly and by being autododactic later on
in your autonomous sense or sharing the autonomy
that comes along with self-evidencing.
I'll try to get autonomy into as many different sentences as possible for you.
Beautiful, beautiful.
