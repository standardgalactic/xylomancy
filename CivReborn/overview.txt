Checking CivReborn/AutoHotkey Tutorial #4 Functions (Part 1).txt
1. **Passing Values to Functions:** You can pass variables into functions by including them within the function definition with `parameter_name = value` syntax. When calling a function, you list the arguments in parentheses, separated by commas. Example: `function_name(a, b)`.

2. **Returning Values from Functions:** Functions can return values just like they receive them. You specify the return type with `return value` inside the function. Outside the function, you assign the returned value to a variable. Example: `c = function_name(a, b)`.

3. **Performing Operations:** Inside a function, you can perform any operation on the passed values and then return the result. The operations can range from simple arithmetic to complex mathematical or logical computations.

4. **Example:** In the example provided, the function `add(a, b)` returns the sum of the two passed values, which is then stored in variable `c`.

5. **Next Steps:** The video will continue by covering passing by reference and additional tips for testing and other programming practices that can simplify and improve your coding experience.
