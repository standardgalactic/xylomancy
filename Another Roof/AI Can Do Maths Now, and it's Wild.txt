In 1997, Computer Deep Blue beat the highest-rated player at chess.
2011, Computer Watson beat champion players of Jeopardy.
2016, the game Go fell to the computer AlphaGo.
But these are just games.
What about a demonstration of practical problem-solving?
Enter AlphaGeometry, an AI developed by DeepMind that can solve
Olympiad-level geometry problems, outperforming the average human participant.
This has been heralded as a massive leap in AI reasoning
and a step towards artificial general intelligence.
But is it?
I'll give my thoughts in this video.
Firstly, how does it work?
No coverage I've seen actually goes into any detail of AlphaGeometry's solutions.
I went through them and it was so painful I feel it's only right that I inflict that
experience on others, but trust me that pain is worth it as it will help us in the second half
of this video where we discuss whether this is actually a step forward in reasoning
and its potential impact on mathematics as a whole.
First, a brief look at how AlphaGeometry works and then a deep dive into one of the
Olympiad problems it solved.
It is made up of two systems and I'll demonstrate what it might look like
if it tries to prove this well-known result.
The first system is a language model akin to a refined and specific use chat GPT.
I suggest ideas like plot the midpoint of this line or draw this diameter.
The second is a symbolic deduction engine.
I know a bunch of geometrical theorems like M is the midpoint of AC therefore AM equals CM.
OA is a radius, this is a tangent, therefore this is a right angle,
therefore this is 90 subtract x.
These two systems work in tandem with the first making a suggestion.
Let's draw these lines and the second making deductions
because M and O are midpoints, these lines are parallel
and they repeat until the problem is solved.
Now let's draw this line.
By Thales's theorem this is 90.
Angles in a triangle sum to 180 so this must be x
and by angles in the same segment this is also x.
Well done guys, I don't always have the best ideas but we usually get there.
I'm always right but my options are limited by this absolute moron.
Some commentators have likened this to a right brain generating ideas
and a left brain analyzing the facts.
Let's see it in action with a more challenging problem.
The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the world's toughest mathematics papers
for high school students with each paper containing
six problems selected from four mathematical domains.
Let's focus on problem one of the 2008 paper
since alpha geometry solved this in 40 steps
which is fairly close to its average of around 55 steps.
Before we state the problem there might be some language with which you're unfamiliar.
So here's a quick rundown of some triangle properties.
Start with a triangle A, B, C and first.
It turns out that it can be embedded in a unique circle called the circumcircle
and its center is called the circumcenter.
The center is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the three edges.
And I'll leave it as an exercise to justify why.
Second, a line from a vertex meeting the opposite edge at a right angle is called an altitude.
Every triangle has three and third.
It turns out that all three altitudes meet at a common point called the orthocenter.
Ortho, meaning orthogonal, meaning perpendicular, meaning at right angles, you get the idea.
Pause here if you need to just digest this.
I'll summarize them here as I'll be using them for the rest of the video.
The extended cut of this video goes into a bit more detail on these,
like why the circumcircle and orthocenter even exist.
And if you want to check that out as well as extended cuts of other videos,
please consider supporting me on Patreon.
So let's now look at this Olympiad problem.
We'll start with some triangle A, B, C and plot its orthocenter H.
Take the midpoints of the three edges and label them A0, B0, C0,
so that A0 is opposite A, B0 is opposite B, C0 is opposite C.
Now draw a circle centered at A0, which goes through H.
Now this circle will cross BC twice, called these points A1 and A2.
Note these needn't actually be on the triangle.
In an obtuse triangle, they might drift outside, but we plot them anyway.
Now draw circles centered at B0 and C0, each crossing H and plot B1 and B2,
C1 and C2, in the same fashion as A1 and A2.
These problems, Booty tends to front load a lot of information,
so pause and digest this if you need to, because now here's the question.
We want to prove that A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2 all lie on a circle.
In GeoGebra, we can see that this seems to be true, but our task is to prove it.
Pause now if you want to have a crack at it, then we'll look at Alpha Geometry's solution.
So how did Alpha Geometry solve this problem?
Well first, it's worth noting that in the paper on Alpha Geometry,
the problem is stated differently, just wanting to prove that B1, B2, C1 and C2 are cyclic.
This is insufficient. By symmetry, a proof of this kind will generalize to the other pairs of sides,
but it could be the case that the As and Bs, the As and Cs, and the Bs and Cs share different
circles. But anyway, maybe they'll justify why this is sufficient later.
Just a few things to mention up front. There are often a few redundant steps along the way.
It often restates things already deduced. This is due to how it presents solutions,
but I'll mostly just gloss over them and sometimes compress steps together.
But I will show all steps on screen if you care about the minutiae.
I'll assume a high school knowledge of geometry throughout,
the results we'll need will be summarized here.
One to draw your attention to is cyclic quadrilaterals.
Most of us learn that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180,
but the converse is also true. If you have a quadrilateral where opposite angles sum to 180,
then it is cyclic. That's less obvious and it's going to be very important.
I will be going through the steps fairly quickly.
Now each step is fairly simple, but the length of the proof is quite overwhelming.
My advice is not to worry about every little detail and just get a feel for alpha geometry's
approach, but feel free to pause after every step if you want to fully grasp every detail.
I'll use lowercase greek letters for angles and I'll use a star to denote a supplementary angle.
A alpha star is 180 subtract alpha. Let's get into it.
We actually don't need these altitudes, so I'll hide them and it starts by defining 0.0,
such that EH equals EO, so clearly O must lie on this left circle,
but also such that HO is perpendicular to EF. I think we can infer that O is actually
where these circles intersect, but alpha geometry doesn't realize this yet.
Step one is realizing that O must lie on the left hand circle, so that's good.
And step two, it uses angles in the same segment to prove that these are the same.
I'll call them alpha. Also, this is a cyclic quadrilateral, so these angles are supplementary,
they sum to 180. I'll call them beta and beta star. Step three, this triangle is isosceles,
as EB2 and EH are both radii of this circle, so these angles are the same and I'll call them
gamma. Steps four and five, here it infers that this angle is also gamma. Again, this is by angles
in the same segment. Steps six to eight, it deduces that EF is parallel to BC by acknowledging that E
and F are midpoints of those lines of the triangle. Steps nine and 10 are some of the
redundant steps I mentioned earlier, and step 11, we have that this is a right angle,
and that's by Thales's theorem. Angles in a semicircle are 90 degrees. Step 12,
AH is perpendicular to EF. That's because AH and BC are perpendicular by the definition
of an altitude. BC and EF are parallel, so that angle must also be 90. Step 13, now this one is
interesting. We extend the line B2O to EF. I guess that's the right brain talking,
we've run out of angles to chase, so let's just stick another line in. Now, what's this angle
here? Well, we have a right angle triangle, so this is 90 subtract gamma, but here is another
right angle triangle, so this angle must be 90 subtract, 90 subtract gamma. In other words,
it's gamma. Steps 14 to 16 use this common right angle here to establish that AH is parallel to OH.
The diagram is awkward here because it looks like this is necessarily the case,
and it is, but alpha geometry didn't know that yet. Steps 17 and 18, this is a right angle,
and again, that's by Thales's theorem. Steps 19 to 22 are more redundant restatements,
and step 23, this is an isosceles triangle as EB2 and EO are radii, so these base angles are the same,
and I'll call them delta. Steps 24 and 25, now this is a brilliant inference, and that's that
this angle is also delta. All it says as justification is that these are delta and these are gamma,
so why must this be delta? Well, here's a triangle with gamma and delta, so its third
angle supplements them, but now here's a triangle with gamma and this angle, so its third angle
must be delta as required. Step 26, again, another fantastic inference, and that's that EF bisects
this angle here. Now, why is that? Well, call the top one epsilon, yes, that's how many of us
Brits pronounce it, and note this triangle up here, whose top angle is delta star, so epsilon
supplements gamma and delta star, and now note this triangle also with gamma and delta star,
so this angle must be epsilon as well. It's great stuff, I mean, we can infer this so much more
easily, but it is kind of cute how Alpha Geometry picks the most difficult ways to get there.
Step 27, because F lies on the angle bisector of EO and EH, and because EO and EH are the same
length, we have that FO and FH are also the same length. And step 28, therefore, O lies on this
right hand circle. Remember when we said as much at the very beginning? I told you we'd get there
eventually. Okay, so it's putting a lot of pieces together, and step 29, what does it do with this
newfound power? Well, what do you think? It's straight back to chasing the angles, so plot C2O
and HC1. Now, these are the same, via angles in the same segment, and I'll call them zeta. Steps 30
and 31, these are clearly the same as they're both zeta star, and as a result, these angles are the
same, I'll call them eta. And why is that? Well, consider this triangle and call its top angle
theta, then eta supplements theta and zeta star. Now, consider this triangle, and we see that this
angle also supplements theta and zeta star, so it must also be eta. Gonna need the whole Greek
alphabet at this rate. Steps 32, because these triangles have the same angles, they are similar,
and that's expressed as this ratio, AH over HC1 equals AC2 over AO. Steps 33 and 34, this is quite
fiddly, but we're doing a similar thing on the left as we did on the right with the zetas,
so call this top angle kappa, and fill in this angle which we know is beta, we'll need it in
just a second. This angle is 90 plus alpha, and we see that it is in a triangle with beta and kappa,
but this angle is also in a triangle with beta and kappa, so it must also be 90 plus alpha.
Steps 35, similar to before, no pun intended, these two triangles have the same angles,
so they are similar, and that's expressed as AH over AB1 equals AB2 over AO. Steps 36, now a bit
of algebra, we see that AH times AO is equal to AB1 times AB2 and AC1 times AC2, therefore AB1 over
AC2 is equal to AC1 over AB2. Steps 37 and 38, we will use this ratio, so construct B2C1 and B1C2,
and this ratio tells us that these triangles are similar, thus their angles are the same,
in particular these ones which I'll call lambda. Steps 39, so close, this angle supplements lambda,
so I'll call it lambda star, and step 40, finally, we have a quadrilateral B1B2C1C2 with
opposite supplementary angles, thus it is cyclic, thus these four points lie on a circle.
Finally, so what do we think about this proof? Well for a start, it doesn't really answer the
question, there is no demonstration that A1 and A2 must lie on this circle. Now this is easy to
argue because consider any circle containing A1 and A2, then A1A2 is a chord of the circle,
and its perpendicular bisector must contain the center, but A1A2 is a diameter of this
circle centered at A0, therefore A0 lies on this perpendicular bisector, but recall that A0 is the
midpoint of BC, thus this is actually the perpendicular bisector of BC. We conclude that any circle
containing A1 and A2 must be centered on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Repeating the
argument for the other sides, any circle containing all six points must be centered where all three
of these perpendicular bisectors meet, which is the circum center, so all three circles must coincide.
So Alpha Geometry successfully solves this problem, which isn't exactly the same as stated in the
Olympiad paper, and I don't like how the writers have simplified the problem. Yes, it turns out
that it is a solution in this case, but that requires justification and they haven't given any.
The next thing to say about Alpha Geometry's proof is that it's quite meandering, to say the
least. It isn't so much a solution, but more like watching someone else solve the problem in real
time. When we're solving problems, we don't always have the best idea first, so we tinker and
meddle and hope that our ideas go somewhere. What I'd love to see is that if later versions of
Alpha Geometry can refine the solutions into something more palatable. For example, consider
this. Step one, define O as the second intersection of these circles, and step two,
EHFO is a kite, so its diagonals OH and EF are perpendicular. This is well known or provable
in just a few steps, and if we can assume things like Thales's theorem, I think we can assume this.
Step three, E and F are midpoints, so EF is parallel to BC, and step four, altitude AH is
perpendicular to BC by definition, which means it's perpendicular to EF. Since OH and AH are
both perpendicular to EF, they are parallel, and both pass through H, so in fact, A, O, and H are
collinear. Steps five and six establish the beaters as before, so these triangles with
beta and kappa are similar, expressed as follows, and steps seven and eight establish the zetas as
before, so these triangles with zeta star and theta are similar, expressed as follows. Steps
nine and ten chase these ratios to establish similarity of these triangles as before, step
eleven establish the lambdas as before, and step twelve establish this quadrilateral as cyclic,
and we're done. Now, I'm sure we could shorten this further, but without much thought, I took this
from 40 steps to 12 with the benefit of hindsight, but my main issue with this proof is that the
reason why the result is true doesn't leap out at me. A good proof should show why the result
holds. The logic should enlighten us, and I don't find this particularly illuminating. However,
this does veer close to my favorite solution to the problem. Consider the intersecting second
theorem. This says that if you have two non-parallel second lines, one meeting the circle at A and B,
and the other at X and Y, and crossing at P, then the following holds. AP times BP is equal to XB
times YP. The converse is also true. If five points have this property, then those four points are
necessarily cyclic. With that in mind, once we establish that A, O, and H are collinear,
we have by the intersecting second theorem that AB1 times AB2 is equal to AO times AH,
and AC1 times AC2 is equal to AO times AH. Thus AB1 times AB2 equals AC1 times AC2,
and by the converse of the intersecting second theorem, these points are cyclic.
This proof was written by a human, and there is a wealth of other succinct and creative proofs
out there. But most importantly, this is a proof that to me, finally does the job of telling me
why the result is true. I can see it right in front of me, these seconds always combining
in a vertex, and therefore giving rise to this specific circle in the middle. All who love mathematics
love the spark of insight that proofs like this give us. We don't want to just learn the results,
we want to experience the unique joy of resonating with this kind of logical poetry.
It's beautiful. This isn't. But is that a problem? After all, it got the answer,
and it did so in this unique way of combining creativity with deduction.
So let's now take a broader look at what I think alpha geometry means for AI, and what it means
for mathematics. Let me just remind you that I am not a computer scientist, I am a mathematician,
first and foremost. Everything that follows in this video is just like my opinion, man.
Let me loop back to something I said at the start of the video, the previous AIs learned to play
games while this one can solve problems. Well, is alpha geometry really solving problems?
Because it looks like what it's doing is brute forcing its way around the angles,
and eventually landing on the result. But isn't that what problem solving is? Alpha geometry
solutions are pretty haphazard and lacking in any general direction. Look at this solution for
problem 3 of 2015's IMO. Horrendous. But if you try these problems, what do your initial attempts
look like? I think for most of us we just get our hands dirty and work out a bunch of lengths and
angles before we have a good idea. We might have slightly more direction and intent behind our
choices, but is our approach radically different to alpha geometries? I don't think so, and I find
this aspect of alpha geometry impressive and fascinating. A less impressive aspect of alpha
geometry is that plain geometry is easy to codify in terms of strict rules and results.
I mean, it's kind of telling that the oldest recorded axiomatic approach to mathematics
is Euclid's elements, and that begins with plain geometry. Olympiad problems are kind of
like games. We know they have an answer. We know they are solvable with high school level results,
because that's how they are designed. For the language model, right brain, there are only
certain things you can try and certain things that you need to try. Compare this to analytic
number theory or algebraic geometry where problems demand ideas that are way out there.
This is to say that I don't think alpha geometry's achievements can be immediately
generalized to other fields of study. No more than chess computer deep blue could attempt to play
go. For this reason, that I respectfully disagree with some other commentators on this topic.
Sabina Hossenfelder, for example, had this to say about alpha geometry.
It generally highlights AI's growing ability to reason logically, discover new knowledge,
and verify solutions. And not only this, it can also explain how it arrived at a conclusion.
Such a type of AI system has users that extend beyond geometry. Not only can this achievement
be generalized across various mathematical domains, but it will without doubt also come in handy in
other areas where rational thinking and logical deduction is of use. Like everything.
High school level plain geometry questions, which remember are written to be solvable,
are comparatively easy, and there is currently no evidence to suggest that this technique can
be generalized at this present time. Now, I'm not so naive to think that things will be different
in the near future, especially given the rate of AI progress. So maybe soon an AI can tackle something
like algebraic geometry, but not right now. A computer brute forced chess, but it still took
20 years before a computer one at go. Here, alpha geometry is answering geometry questions by,
well, not quite brute force, but it's similar. And I think that we're still a while away from
seeing AI have a go at some of the unsolved problems across mathematics. I come to think of it,
given all the operations alpha geometry can do every second, it's still surprising to me that
it still can't outperform the best humans. How weird would it have been if IBM announced that
its computer deep blue attempted to beat Gary Kasparov, but came second? Note the victory over
the champion was the milestone. I'm not taken away from the achievements in this paper, I just
think our excitement should be tempered a little. In my mind, this is a small step beyond beating
games like go, not a radical leap forward. It's natural then to ask about the future and whether
AI will tackle unsolved problems. Those of you who have read the paper will know that alpha
geometry developed many synthetic theorems, results proved from its foundation that help it make
inferences. It even discovered a new result in this question, because its solution doesn't
require one of the premises. I'd be gubsmacked if the question setters didn't already know about
this and just added this constraint to tune the difficulty of the question. But is this a sign
of AI eventually being used to solve open questions? And is that a good thing? Well, the first thing
I foresee is AI assisted proofs. These fall into a similar region of computer assisted proofs,
but there might be a difference. Computer assists are basically time savers. The four color theorem
for example required a lot of pen and paper research to break down the number of cases,
each of which could then be checked by hand, but a computer can do it much faster so it's
more practical. Even simulations and data analyses essentially boil down to just doing a lot of
calculations, which could be done by hand if we had infinite mathematicians writing on infinite
blackboards, but we do it by computer to save time. A computer is just part of the equipment of the
modern 21st century mathematician, along with chalk and blackboard. Along with traditional
computer assists, AI assists might be considered part of our tool set as well, but AI might replace
some of the creativity involved, and so would a purely generated AI proof. It feels like cheating,
but is that a bad thing? Well, we need to ask, why do we bother solving hard problems?
Other than to satiate our curiosity, I think there are three reasons. The first is that they
have immediate practical value. These are things like optimization problems that could revolutionize
aspects of computing, or cracking the enigma code, it shortened the war, direct impact,
a non-mathematical example would be curing a disease. It's just good, the benefits are immediate
and tangible. The second reason is that the theory or techniques we develop in order to solve them
could be used elsewhere. This is the spin-off effect. Proving Fermat's last theorem, for example,
required several leaps that connected many areas of mathematics and improved our overall
understanding. A non-mathematical example might be that we didn't really gain any practical value
from Armstrong's setting foot on the moon, but many innovations were required to get in there,
which have everyday use. Thirdly, most importantly for me as a pure mathematician,
and a reason I think is overlooked, it's just good to solve problems. You know, it's the old
why climb Everest, because it's there. Even without the innovations required for the Apollo
missions, I still find the moon landing endlessly inspiring. Maybe the proof of the collet's conjecture
won't directly impact my life in the slightest, but I'll still find the event enormously inspiring
nonetheless. Basically, the reason we solve problems, and really the reason we do anything,
is either because it's useful or because it's beautiful. Or it's neither, like my PhD thesis,
but still both reasons are valuable. So here's my take on AI in mathematics. If a solution to
a problem has immediate practical value, we should use AI and cheat and get the answer.
Who cares if we look up the answer to a disease cure? It'll save lives.
The second case gets a bit weird though. I worry that AI-assisted proofs might not
develop interesting spin-off theory, and instead force the solution out of pre-existing knowledge.
When humans puzzle for a long time, they force themselves to be creative,
and that's where the new theory lies. AI might get the answer with a messy and haphazard application
of more basic stuff, so we miss out on potential new techniques. This isn't exactly the same,
but by analogy, it's like this geometry problem. Did you know the intersecting second theorem
before you saw this proof? You might have done, but alpha geometry on the other hand,
applied the same few results over and over. Admittedly, that's just my opinion. I don't
really have any direct evidence of this, but we are already starting to see stagnation in other
areas of AI-generated content. But my main reservation with AI-generated proofs is this
third point, the beauty. I know alpha geometry wasn't designed to create beautiful proofs,
and again, this is just my opinion, but I want to convince you why beauty really matters.
Imagine if an artist composed the greatest painting ever. There is likely no practical
value to be found in the painting, or in any of the techniques developed to compose it,
but we wouldn't say that it's pointless. As an enormous cultural contribution, it would still
enrich our lives in ways beyond what is practical. Well, mathematics is part of our culture. Has
your life tangibly and practically improved because Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem?
Probably not, but the story likely inspired you. The result was as much an enriching cultural
contribution as a great piece of art. Would the story have inspired you if an AI had proved
Fermat's last theorem? And this is again where I disagree with Sabina. I know this last comment
was a bit of a joke, but rational thinking and logical deduction aren't useful for everything.
I can't rationally convince you why this proof is beautiful. To me, it just is, and nor can I
convince you why Alpha Geometry's proofs are ugly. And does this matter? Yes, because we're in the
land of plain geometry, which isn't some untapped wilderness of mathematical usefulness. It's a
playground, squarely in the domain of beauty. And what makes something beautiful? I don't know,
it isn't the length of the proof, as shorter isn't always better, and it isn't simplicity,
as too simple often hides or disguises the inner workings. We just know it when we see it,
and I don't think AI has come close to capturing beauty yet. There's a line about aesthetics in
the Alpha Geometry paper, how Alpha Geometry might discover some plain geometry results overlooked
by us humans because it isn't biased towards symmetry, or that which is aesthetically pleasing.
And great, you do you Alpha Geometry, but if it isn't aesthetically pleasing, why do we care?
Mathematics is often seen as something that's purely logical, it's black and white, and we
love it for that. But we also love it for the aesthetics. Like, be honest, if I made a video
saying, here's an ugly geometrical result, and here are the 100 difficult steps it takes to get
there, would you care about that? No, I curate topics that expose mathematical beauty. Even when
the solution is kind of ugly, I try to make every step intuitive so we can appreciate the
symmetry, the hidden magic, and the beauty within. Three blue-one-browns video on collisions printing
pie, it's a jaw-dropping result. But we all watched the whole video because the real or comes
not from seeing the answer, but from seeing why. That's what we love, that's what inspires us, not
this. I want to be super clear here, I am not criticizing Alpha Geometry or the authors of
this paper. Alpha Geometry wasn't designed to create beautiful mathematics, it was designed to
solve Olympiad problems, and it does that pretty well. All I'm saying is that while AI might be
close to solving problems, I think it's far from solving problems beautifully. This is where my
concerns lie and why I'm not yet excited about AI-generated proofs. To me, mathematics is the
most creative and beautiful thing there is. My qualms echo those who love visual art, music,
and film, and fear that artists, musicians, writers, and actors will be replaced by AI.
This replacement will be a cultural net negative. If AI also solves our mathematical problems,
we might sacrifice their cultural impact as well. Thank you so much for watching.
Bit of a different video this time because I wanted to respond to the news. I think Alpha
Geometry is a fascinating new approach, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt I needed
to say. So I hope you enjoyed and if you disagree with my take, that's absolutely fine. Let me know
down in the comments and keep the discussion respectful. A massive thank you to all my patrons
