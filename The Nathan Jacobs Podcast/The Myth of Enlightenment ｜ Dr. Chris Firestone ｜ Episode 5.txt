Nathan Jacobs podcast. I'm here with a good friend of mine, Chris Firestone,
and we'll be talking about the very popular myth, and it is a myth, that all one day,
all of a sudden, a bunch of religious folks decided to use reason and poke and prod some stuff,
and they became atheists. That's coming up today on the Nathan Jacobs podcast.
All right, welcome, Chris Firestone. Wow, it's been a while, Nathan. So good to be here with you.
Yeah, well, it's good to see you. And for anybody, since this is in a visual podcast,
we're here recording, actually, a Trinity University in Deerfield, Illinois, right down the
street from Michael, is Michael Jordan still here? He's not, but his house is. I don't think he's
been able to sell it for the mega-millions he's looking for. Well, fair enough. I do hear the
housing market in Illinois leave something to be desired. Yeah, I wouldn't want his tax bill,
that's for sure. Well, this place is a blast from the past for me, as are you, of course, Chris,
although you're still part of my present. So what I want to talk about today with you,
and let's just contextualize this for folks so they know what to expect.
There's a very popular myth out there in the cultural sphere, right, in the cultural consciousness
that a lot of folks presume, look, there was a time when people were religious,
you know, and they were engaged in faulty reasoning, you know, sort of Monty Python style,
you know, fallacious reasoning, ridiculous assumptions. And then one day, a bunch of folks
woke up, right, and they were enlightened, right, the enlightenment. And all of a sudden,
they were like, you know what we should do is we should maybe think about some stuff,
you know, maybe use reason, maybe poke and prod some stuff, look at the world. And lo and behold,
all of a sudden, they realized through investigation that all that crazy, ridiculous religious stuff
they thought is false. They all became atheists. And then science, you know, propelled us forward
and advancement and all the rest. And here we are. And, you know, religion is just sort of a silly,
you know, remnant of the past for folks who haven't gotten the memo. And obviously, you and I
have spent a lot of time together working in a variety of ways to dispel that myth,
because it is a myth, right? It is a very not the true myth like Tolkien. It's an absurdity.
It's a totally false myth that has nothing to do with any of the history of ideas proper.
So I want to talk about that. But before we get there, let's just give a little context about
us. So I'd said you're a blast from the past because I was once upon a time a student of yours
when I first started studying philosophy. I don't even remember how long ago that was,
what was that, like 99 or something like that? It was 25 years ago. Oh my gosh. Seems like yesterday.
Yeah. And then after I finished my PhD, or actually while I was finishing
my PhD, a good friend of our Steve's pointer who we dedicated a book to once upon a time,
one that we'll probably mention in this, went and sniped me. He was like, oh man,
there's schools looking at Jacobs. Can we get Jacobs? And they brought me back here and I
taught here for a while before going to moving on and doing some other things. So we went from
teacher and student to colleagues. And then we wrote a couple of books along the way,
you know, well, co-authored a book, co-edited a book. You make it sound so easy and so simple,
but obviously it wasn't it? No. Just like, oh my goodness, there's so many awesome stories in
there. I hope we get to tell those stories sometime. Yeah. Well, you know what we should maybe do,
just as a side, just for folks to get a sense of our wild and crazy. I know what,
my favorite story would be. Do you have a favorite from our past in terms of our time
working together before we jump into the real stuff? I do. Yeah, I do. Okay, I'll be curious
to hear this one. I wonder if this is the same story. Maybe you should go first. No, no, no,
you tell me. Oh my goodness. Well, one of the things that you were well known for as an undergraduate
was rising above your place to do professional papers at conferences. You weren't supposed to
be in. Okay, so I do suspect we are about to tell the same story. Okay, so let me contextualize
this for listeners. So, yes, so Chris, when he first met me, I had left art school, I was studying
philosophy, anybody who's read about my journey where I wanted to existential crisis from LSD and
started studying philosophy and religion. And I talked about certain people who took me under
their wing who recognized, oh, this guy's a little different, right? Like he's, he's rough
around the edges. He's not a typical academic student, but he's a really sharp guy. And it
seems like he's really more about the questions and the answers than he is about, you know,
about the grades or something like that. And Chris was, you know, bar none, you know, he was,
he was definitely the guy in that category of folks who took me under his wing. And I've always been
one who, you know, enjoys a good challenge. And I think I recognize that early on. And so I just
kept throwing them out there wondering which one he'd give up on it. Really, there weren't many of
those. So one of the things that Chris did for me that you did for me was you were like, you know,
there's these academic conferences. And that blew my mind, right? Because I had read all these
different books, I dug around. And I was never bashful about, you know, going and approaching
somebody. In fact, that's how I ended up here in the first place, number of the people I had read,
I was just like, Oh, they teach somewhere outside of Chicago, I grew up there. I'll just go make
an appointment, talk with them at some point, they were like, do you go here? Are you a student?
I'm like, no, I mean, I just just walked into your office to talk to you. And so Chris introduced me
to conferences like the American Academy of Religion, I think was the first one you probably
introduced me to. And it blew my mind because it's thousands upon thousands of people from all over
the world, scholars, students, things like that. And there were all these people I had,
you know, I had read things about like Nicholas Woltersdorf, I think was there, you know,
first session I ever walked into John Hick, the religious pluralist, we met him. And so I'd seen
these, you know, they go there and they talk about their latest ideas at a latest book project and
whatever. And I was fascinated because I was like, Well, this is where the stuff is really happening.
And you had the audacity to be like, Well, I couldn't you submit a talk
or a paper to one of those. And I was like, Well, I mean, if Chris thinks I can, maybe I can.
I do wonder if we have two different ones. There's multiple ones here, right? And the one I'm
thinking of is in a regional, but there's also one in an annual conference. Oh, yeah. Well,
which one do you want to tell? Because I think I'll tell the regional one.
That one is funny. Yes. So again, a little bit more context here is that I had started submitting
these papers and, and much to, well, maybe I should go first with the annual one.
That was the first one, I believe. I think it was. Right. So like, I submitted all these,
you know, I submitted proposals like professionals do. I didn't realize that
undergraduates do not typically submit proposals. And, you know, there's hundreds of proposals
coming in. So if you beat people out, you get selected, it's, it's a, it's a real honor. And
so like, I had submitted one on the problem of evil, I think was the panel. And I ended up getting
selected as an undergrad. Yeah, we were, we were all amazed, you know, I wasn't amazed. I knew it
could be done. It was early in the conference sort of growth, and they weren't really aware
that students might try to pull this. Right. And so Nathan was eager to give it a whirl,
and he did, and he got in. I think what happened next was shocked us all because we thought
probably a room with, you know, 30, 30, you know, people present, you know,
side rooms or something. But we get there and we come to realize it's basically a plenary.
I mean, it's a huge ballroom with, you know, I don't know, let's, let's call it three to 500
people. I didn't count them all. Right. And Nathan's one of the main presenters.
I remember the guy who organized that panel coming up to me because they had asked for a bio.
And I said, Chris, what do I say? I mean, what's my bio of a student? I'm an undergrad.
And so I sent some really ambiguous short bio. And, and I had a respond at John Stackhouse,
right? Who is a well-known, you know, Christian apologist guy who'd done a book recently on
the problem of evil. I think it was, which is why he was the respondent on the panel.
And I remember in the bathroom, you know, he ends up in the urinal right next to me.
And he's like, so I didn't catch in your bio, you know, are you, are you a professor at the,
at the grad school or the divinity school or the, I said, yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a student at the,
at the undergrad. He was like, really? Well, good for you.
I think he realized like, what in the world? So yeah, sure enough, we were there big, big ballroom.
Yeah. There's some, a couple of features about that that were extraordinary. I sat up in the front
with a number of other students. I believe, wasn't that the day I gave you that
philosopher's jacket? Because you were like disheveled. I was like, this guy can't go up to
the front with that, with that button down he's got, that's all wrinkled. He's got the sleeves
rolled up the side. I said, here, take my jacket, put this thing on. It'll be just fine. So he,
Nathan gets up there and he reads his paper and all's going well, except that John Stackhouse is
not a joke of a, of a thinker, philosopher, theologian, apologist. And he came to play ball,
man. He was, he came to take this undergraduate to task. I'm sure what happened in the urinal
just got, what his appetite really, so to speak. Gosh. But he came out after you with a series.
I don't know, seven, was it? Seven critiques. Look, and the fact of the matter is, for good reason,
like what was, what was interesting, I mean, as anybody again who's looked at my history knows,
like I went through, I was an overt, like, heretical philosophical theology guy. And Stackhouse
recognized that. Like he was saying, like, look, man, there's things in here that, that sound like
Pelagianism, right? And he's like, like, sometimes that's just a slur. But I think this guy's like,
actually a Pelagian. Like, he was right. I was. Well, those early years, you were dabbling with
lots of interesting ideas. And I'm sure Pelagianism is one of them. But yeah. So he came out hard
in like, just sort of like, catalogued a whole host of concerns he had. By the time he was done,
I'm sitting here with these other students and I'm like, slouched in my chair thinking,
oh, good Lord, what's Nathan going to do? So he, I remember the, the, the moderator says,
okay, Nathan, you can come forward and you have, I think it was two minutes to reply or something.
No, I was, I mean, maybe, yeah, five minutes. It was something short with seven critiques to
deal with. And you did something that I think set you apart in my mind from all the other students
that I was dealing with at the time. And you, you stopped and you said, you know what, there's too
much here for me to address. I would like to open it to the audience and have you pick, I think it
was two of them for me to answer. And I was like, dang, that's pretty bold and pretty good. And he
actually got the audience hands popping up and they, they gave you two, two of the
critiques to answer and you did. Yeah. No, I actually remember, I don't remember what the
second one was, but I remember I had talked about John Hicks, like epistemic distance argument,
which for anybody who doesn't know is basically Hicks saying like, that part of the hiddenness
of God is there in order to preserve freedom. And I had reiterated that in the sort of theodicy I
posed sketched out in my paper. And, you know, Hick was like, or, and Stackhouse actually said,
like, well, and, you know, he gave an example of like Mount Sinai and he's like, how much epistemic
distance is that? And, you know, and I, and I pointed out, and somebody brought that up,
could you talk about the epistemic distance? I was like, yeah, I was like, okay, so he brought up
Exodus. So I was like, well, actually, one of the things it says in the passage is it says that,
you know, Moses tells the people that God did this in order to instill or instill fear in you,
in order that you might not sin. And I said, so that indicates that that text, even the one you're
ushering out indicates that the violation of the epistemic distance has effects on your behavior,
exactly as Hick and myself have proposed. So it was that sort of thing, right? Like where it was,
and, you know, so there were a couple of those that were just out there. And I think you're right,
that did have a little bit of an effect of saying, well, maybe, I mean, that was my intent,
right? To say like, look, I'm happy to address any of these. I don't have time. So happy to take
you guys name which one you find most effective. Yeah, no, that was, that was pretty stellar. And,
and to do it with that kind of crowd on your first go around, like, dang, that's impressive.
Yeah. Well, and I remember there was a, that was the time when Fordham decided to like,
come and try to scout me out, right? Because there was guy in the,
in there, some guy from Fordham who was like, I missed it. Like, so he has the same thing
that stuck us. Did I missed it in your bio? Are you a professor at the Divinity School or at the
college? Or, and I was like, no, I'm an undergrad. And all of a sudden, like Fordham was writing to me
regularly going like, you want to come over here to the PhD program. You were the first because we,
we ended up, as you know, having like 10 year run of really quality young philosophers coming
out of the program. And you were the first, but you're not the only one who was basically offered
a job at one of these things, but without their credentials. Yeah, that's right. So, but it was
an impressive run and then that jacket that you initiated, that became a fun little tradition
in our department, because all of these sort of rogue, you know, rebel philosophy guys who were
doing things that you weren't supposed to be doing, like speaking at professional conferences,
that became essentially like, what would you call it? It's like the, it's like the, you know,
some sort of rite of passage that, you know, you broke through. So you get to put this on.
That's right. And we utilized it for years. I don't know how many students probably in the
range of 15 to 20 actually wore that jacket in subsequent years for professional presentations
of one sort or another. Yeah. And I honestly think, and I don't think this is an exaggeration.
I think we ended up being the reason that some of these conferences changed the rules to specify
that undergrads couldn't indeed. It was somewhere in the 2010, 2015 range where it started coming,
you started seeing everywhere that you had to have certain degrees and other things
to get into the conferences. Yeah, because they noticed a little too many of us like
breaking through and pushing out to the margins. It was so great to be a first mover in that area.
Yeah. So then the second one, I'm certain I know what your second one is.
Yeah. Well, this is another time you wore the jacket. It was at a regional conference, I believe
it was downtown Chicago. And the interesting thing was, I think it started because we thought
you had submitted a paper to a conference, but you, we forgot the date and it ended up being
like a month later. And you said, let's submit it anyway. And it was to a conference.
It was on, I believe it was on Augustine. Is that right? No. So what it was was the regional,
because you and I would ever, you know, the American Academy of Religion would roll around
or, you know, APA or whatever it was, we'd always look at the call for paper to see what we can latch
hold of. And I remember it was the regional one, they decided to focus, I mean, who came up with
us. They were like, let's do the whole conference on philosophy and humor. And we were like, I was
just like, man, I don't, I don't have anything to say on that. And so we were going to just let it
pass. But then I remember one night we were hanging out and we were like, look, you know,
I think, I think it's the, the call for papers ends in like 10 minutes. Let's see if I can quick
throw something together. I think we threw it together. We submitted it and we realized it was
like a month late or something like that. It's like we got the wrong dates. Yeah. Anyway, they
wrote back to you. It's saying, you're in. That's great. That's a great proposal. And I was like,
the fun doesn't stop there though, because when we realized, you got a paper on, I think it was
Augusta, maybe Aquinas as well. So what it was was, I, this was where I was really fudging,
because I was like, what's the angle I'm going to take? And it was on theological anthropology.
And I was taking, I was putting John Hick and Augusta and Hippo in dialogue and springboarding
off of being there. Yeah, the movie with Peter Sellers, right? And I was like, so I used being
there is like this excuse like, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm going to talk about humor. Right. Right. But it
was like really, I'm going to talk about anthropology. Chauncey Gardner was in the title.
Right. So anybody who doesn't know that film, right? Chance to Chauncey. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah. From Chance to Chauncey. Yeah. So in the film, right? It's a story, it's a story of
mistaken identity, right? This guy, or at least that's what it seems at the beginning,
the ending raises some questions, but like a guy named Chance, who's the gardener. And then when
the guy he works for dies, and he seems touched, you know, he seems, he seems like he's maybe a
little off. And then people mishear his name as Chauncey. And so he becomes known as Chauncey
Gardner. That's right. A mistaken identity piece. Right. And he goes through the heights of power.
And it's one of our favorite movies. We watched it a couple times over the years. It's really
fun and funny. And, and, but the, the irony of, and this is why it comes to my mind all the time,
is that you're going into this thing, we find out that it's been accepted. It's kind of a,
what you might call a Western paper. Right. Yeah. Sure. It's accepted in the section on
Eastern religion, religion, laughter in the East or something like that. Yeah. God laughs in the
East. That's what it was. That was the title. And he gets this paper on Chauncey Gardner in.
And it's like hilarious. How in the world did he possibly get this in? Yeah. Anyway, again,
I bring a number of other students with us. We're sitting and it's, it's a being a, a fairly large
square seminar-based type thing. Right. With a podium in the middle. Yeah. And, and they, they
have these papers on, I don't know, Harry Krishna. Right. You know, just, yeah. Well, I remember
what I sat down on the panel. The guy next to me sits down and he pulls out this little Vishnu
idol and sits in front of him. I'm like, man, where am I? This is hilarious. So the first three
papers go and then Nathan's called up and I'm just in stitches at this point because here's this
undergrad doing a professional paper on a Western philosophical tradition in a, in a laughter. And
God laughs in the East. You can't make this stuff up. Right. And when you get up there,
he introduces. Well, yeah. Well, all right. Well, before that, I mean, that's what, like,
you guys, I could tell, like, you guys nearly lost it. We totally lost it. But before that,
he starts with, he's like, so he's going to be talking about, our next presenter is talking
about being there, which we all know is like a metaphor for soon to Krishna. Like he said,
I'm like, I don't even remember what he said, but, and I'm sitting there thinking it is.
And I can hear you guys like repressing chocolate at that point. And then he culminates and he's
like, now, without further ado, Dr. Nathan. And so, yeah, it was chance turns into Chauncey Gardner
right before our very eyes. And he walks up there as undergraduate with a sport coat on,
becomes Dr. Nathan Jacobs. At this point, what are you thinking? I'm just thinking,
I just hope we get out of here. I mean, once this guy is, the emperor has no clothes on,
we're going to be ushered out of the room. But what transpired next is just continue
to boggle my mind to this day because he reads the paper, gets a number of questions on it,
then they open it up to a wider discussion. And they basically say, well, the best paper here
is one on chance to Chauncey Gardner. Like Nathan Jacobs and every question was on that paper.
Yeah, so remember getting up there, I'm walking up to that podium, I'm side eyeing you guys who
are, are chocolate, which I can't blame you. I'm just thinking Lord have mercy. How did I get
myself into this? And I get up there and I don't know if you remember my opener. I said, now the,
the title of today's conference is God laughs in the East. But I wonder if it'd be more aptly
titled God laughs at me, because my paper is not in fact on any Eastern shaman or sage,
nor does a deal in Eastern religions generally, other than the fact that Shirley MacLean is in
being there. But to watch the rationalization of the, of the moderator who says, but, but, but
Nathan, it really is an appropriate piece for this group. And then I don't even know who she was,
but do you remember there was some woman who clearly had this gravitas in this group where
like, we don't know who she is, but obviously everybody here knew she was, and she was like,
well, I would like to circle back to Dr. Jacobs' paper, because even though he insists that it's
not relevant, there is no paper here that is more relevant. And then she goes out and gives some
exposition about why it's the most relevant piece. And I think that's, in all honesty, that's what
took the jacket from being just a thing to be an icon of the philosophy department. It's the
ring of power, yeah, because everyone who wore it says, I mean, here's that story from us,
somewhere along the way. Yeah, yeah. So those are the lots of great stories, lots of memories
with this place with you and all the rest. But so let's circle back now that people have a little
bit of a taste of your my history, because obviously I went off from that point and I did
grad work and, you know, I doctorate and then Steve Pointer had always had his eye on me as
somebody who would love to get back here to sort of continue that philosophical trajectory that we
had going and he did for a while at a time. Yeah, he and I talked a lot about that possibility,
because you were kind of iconic of what Trinity, in its better days, was hoping to produce.
Somebody who'd been through the undergrad, been through the grad school, onto a PhD, was beginning
to make some noise. Let's get them back here and, you know, we'll be sort of like the, you know,
poster child of what we're trying to accomplish here at Trinity. Right. And at some point in there,
specifically in the grad years, and then into the PhD, you and I had moved from sort of mentor
mentee to co-authors, right? We were doing joint research on Immanuel Kant, and we even published
our notorious, you know, our infamous book, right, in defense of Kant's religion. And then it was
while we were here that we were editing the persistence of the sacred, which is the one that's
most relevant to what I wanted to talk with you about today. That came out while we were here,
right? Because we dedicated it to Steve, and I remember us presenting it to him, like, right,
as he was round, like winding down his time here, right? I believe that's right, you know.
And boy, it's because we were working on so many projects simultaneously. This one,
this one we had in our head over a number of summers because of the Communitas Fellowship
thing. We were there talking about how we might get some authors to do certain essays in the book.
Right. And so forth. Yeah. So I remember us starting that editing process took years,
and that was largely because of slowdowns with Notre Dame. But anyway, maybe I've already given a
little bit of an intro to the folks in terms of what I wanted to talk about here. But why don't
you sort of offer to us a quick abstract for what that book was really all about?
Yeah, I think to capitalize on what you said earlier about the myth, we knew early on because
you and I had both done a lot of work in modern philosophy that very little of that myth is
actually true. Yeah. I mean, from the first modern philosophers, Descartes and Bacon,
you realize their motivations are not to dispel religion or God or anything of the kind,
but quite the opposite. They saw some of these malicious sort of philosophies beginning to emerge,
and they're trying to stake claims to defend theology. Right. You know, I mean, it's well
known that, you know, in the meditations, he's writing to the theological faculty for that very
reason. Right. And so we knew that in our own studies, you know, in Emmanuel Kant and philosophers
in and around Kant there, we realized that the best readings were always the theologically
affirmative readings of these of these thinkers. And yet we'd been trained, at least we've interacted
with, you know, contemporary, I guess what I would call them now as revisionist historians of
some sort who who systematically remove God from the from the center of their philosophical purview.
And we had seen that in Kant pretty clearly, because there's this standard traditional Kant,
you know, the all destroyer of metaphysics and the one who is just a moralist and not really,
he's really an agnostic borderline atheist. But when we started reading Kant and realizing,
hold on, none of this holds together without his theological affirmation throughout his writings,
really. And when we started following those trains of thought, we realized this really could
lead to a potential solution to one of his most maligned texts, religion within the boundaries.
Yeah, any reason. And we did all that hard work over many, many years, you know, and found some
real fruit out of that. We started asking ourselves, I wonder if this is going on any other of these.
Well, don't forget, I was finished, I had finished up my dissertation by this point,
and my dissertation was on the same thing on liveness. Now, nobody doubts that liveness believes
in God. But the thing I had discovered was, he's always read in some contemporary analytic
and anachronistic sort of way. And I was, when I read him, much like when I first started reading
Kant, right? When, when I was reading Kant with you, I was like, wait a second, this is Augustine
here, that he's talking, this, this is Aquinas here. And so I recognize all these sort of theological,
you know, markers that were in there that Kant was, was doing, which is how I got into the texts
in the first place with you. And then you had been in that down the road for a while, but that's
how I got sucked into it. And, but, you know, from same thing with liveness, when I read liveness,
I was like, wait a second, I know with the guys that liveness is citing, I know, I recognize
this stuff and liveness isn't shy about it. But I noticed that liveness scholars don't read what
liveness read, which is all the theology stuff. And so all of a sudden I was doing that revisionist,
and you're right, we started reaching out. You just a side note as you're going on with this is one
of the, one of the themes you and I discovered very early on is the many times contemporary
philosophers can't understand the modernist because they're not theologically sophisticated.
You can't read liveness or Kant without at least some theological sophistication,
or else you have to dismiss it as philosophical dribble, you know. And so I think we, I saw it
first in Kant because that's how I invited you into reading Kant with me. I said, look, I'm,
I'm kind of bumped my head theologically here, Nathan, have a look at some of this, tell me what
you're seeing. And that's how we started partnering on reading Kant together. But I think you were
seeing something similar with liveness, a sophisticated philosopher and a sophisticated
theologian. And a lot of contemporary thinkers who are reading them don't have the theology part.
And so they can't understand where he's going. That's right. And we, and that was the thing,
we were curious, we're like, there's got to be other people. And so we started just kind of at
random, not total random, right? We, we looked at guys like, I remember I had been spending some
time with Hegel. And I noticed that the more theologically robust texts in Hegel had been
translated by Peter Hodgson. So we just took a whirl, you know, we're like, okay, let's send an
email to Peter Hodgson and be like, Hey, Peter, this is, this is what we're seeing. This is what
we're thinking. We're thinking about putting together a book that tries to show that this is
actually more par for the course, right? The idea that these guys actually are theologically
robust and theologically concerned, but you know, their readers are not. And, and Hodgson was like,
man, I've been waiting for somebody to say this, like, yeah, absolutely. Sign me up.
Then we got the same thing from John Cottingham, a famous sort of Descartes scholar and translator
of Descartes work. He was like, thank you. Finally, somebody gives me the platform.
Yeah, those, those two guys in particular got us their essays and like record time.
Oh yeah. So it was like they had been waiting to write it for years and we gave them, we gave them
the runway. But you know, so yeah, so that was, that was how that book came about. You know,
one of the things that I find so interesting about this myth, right? And it, like Walter
Storff, Nicholas Walter Storff, well-known philosopher, analytic philosopher. Well,
what do you call them analytic? Anyway, contemporary philosophy dabbles in a lot of
different things, but he sort of hung out with a lot of analytic guys like Alvin Planiga.
But we knew Nick because he, we won him over on our book on Kant and he had been a big opponent
on, of Kant and then he wrote the forward and said, it's the best, it's the best treatment of
Kant on this topic that we got. And so we talked with him about anybody you'd like to talk about.
And he called out, like he did Locke, he did the John Locke essay. And he really called out the
fact that this is, this is traceable largely, the contemporary version is traceable to like
Leo Strauss and the Straussians, which is really kind of a conspiracy theory, wouldn't you say,
in terms of? It was a conspiracy theory until we started digging into it for the introduction.
And we kind of come to realize, I think Nick's on to something. And we started tracing the sort
of atheistic revisionist historians that emerge after, you know, the Strauss and the, and I guess
you would call them basically Straussians. And realizing that what was happened, what had happened
in the 20th century was a systematic downplaying of the theological side of these, these persons,
that not only makes them less formidable, you know, it also makes them antagonistic to religion.
And the sacred, and that's really the genesis of the book, you know, when we started realizing
somebody has to tell the right side of this story. Yeah. And, and, and I say it's a conspiracy
theory because really the Straussians, they just sort of start with the premise that it's like,
well, any sophisticated person would be an atheist like me, right. And so Plato, I mean,
yeah, he talks about God and the good and all that. But I mean, he doesn't really believe that
like the real, the real stuff, if you read between the lines, right, you know, the truth
between the lines is that he's an atheist like me. And that was kind of, I mean, to caricature a
little bit, that's, that's just, that's just the gist of it, right, that the main hermeneutic guide
is these guys are sophisticated enough to not be theists. And so they're sort of saying what they
have to say in order to like fly under the radar. But they're all part of a wink and a nod that,
you know, later generations will finally have, have the balls to go ahead and say what I'm saying.
That's right. Yeah. I think we, I think it was called, was it Walter Storff? I can't remember
told it, the esoteric reading of these things, right, that somehow the good stuff is the stuff
that has to do with material reality, physical, you know, appearances, and so forth. And when they
start diverging into metaphysics, you know, they're tongue in cheek, they're just doing it for the
sensors or whatever. But that is, that is a hard sell when you look at the logic, you know, logic
of these. And that's why we brought all these authors together, because they were experts on
the various modern philosophers, and they were all saying the logic doesn't work
without God. It doesn't work without their positions on the soul and mortality or whatever.
And so that was convincing to us at the time. And, you know, that book came together in record
time for a contributor volume. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So one of the things that I find so interesting
about that, that myth, right, is that usually the sort of the pop version of that myth is that
you essentially have shoddy, religious renown, right, superficial, you know, sort of
philosophical religious jargon, right, that's really just, you know, it's really just church
dogma, right, it's superstitious nonsense. And then one day, like reason awakens, and people
decide to question their presuppositions. And as they begin to question it, all of the prior
stuff just unravels in their hands. And it gives way to modern science. And eventually,
like God of the Gap starts to fall away. And soon we realize we're in a materialist world.
One of the things like the first step in that entire narrative that I find so insane, right,
it crazy, is like, let's start with the scientific portion. So this would be the sort of thing that
Richard Muller talked about in his piece on Robert Boyle, Robert Boyle, the scientist.
So what I find so fascinating is that none of the, like, none of the scientists, right,
so early on, the early empiricists who go into the scientific, you know, you mentioned bacon,
right, so bacon's like, we've got to go into empirical, not just empiricism, right, when we
trust the senses. Well, we've got to find a way to do like a scientific method where we have
hypotheses and we observe stuff and, you know, we tested and all that sort of stuff. So that's the,
you know, this is the birthing of the empirical sciences. And what's interesting is when you look
at, when you look at what the empiricists are questioning, they're not actually questioning
the religious stuff, right? So what's funny is like those guys are questioning the philosophical
stuff, right? So if you look at the history of Christianity, right, like Judaism, Christianity,
the religious realm eventually converges with like neoplatonism and Aristotelianism and things
like that. And that's what sort of grows into the scholastic stuff in the medieval West. And a lot
of the empiricists, like guys like Robert Boyle, they were still 100% fully in favor of Christianity.
They just doubted the metaphysics. So the irony is the narrative is like, oh, they doubt the theology,
they doubt the God stuff. And all of those guys are like, no, it's the metaphysics stuff we doubt,
we doubt Aristotle, right? Like that's what we doubt. And you can see that in the fact that
the first step is nominalism, right? The first step is let's get rid of the realist metaphysics
of Aristotle, you know, let's, and that was largely because so much of Aristotle's
metaphysics involved invisible stuff, right? Forms matter, matter, not as particles and things
like that, but as the substratum of potential. And they wanted stuff that you could poke and
prod. So they went back to an alternative philosophy, which was the mechanical philosophy of the
Greek atomists. So one of the things that just on the surface of it, right from the get go,
that jumps out to me is exactly that, that it's like the theology didn't bother them. It was
the philosophy that bothered them, right? And, and yet guys like Walter Charlton, who were,
you know, part of that mechanical movement, you know, he was convinced he's actually what
he suggested is their return to atomism, Greek atomism and this materialist philosophy. They're
like, this is the true Christian philosophy. There's really no evidence that the Straussian side was,
was right. I mean, quite the contrary Mueller's article is all about his worry
that they might be greasing the skids toward atheism because largely because they were in removing all
non-empirical stuff. He was like, well, meaning purpose isn't really an empirical object, guys.
We said the only things that are real are things you could poke and prod. Meeting is going to go
away pretty quick. Teleology, purpose or end is going to go away pretty quick. So there were
worries about it going in that direction. But at the end of the day, it wasn't a theological
movement at all. It wasn't an anti-theological movement at all. It was an anti-certain type
of metaphysic, we don't like movement. Yeah. No, that's, I think that's fair because they're
coming at it as scientists, right? And so, I mean, the one that came comes to my mind out of the
book is, you know, is Newton, you know, because Schnablin has done all this work and Newton is
an interesting character because he's a Christian. He's sort of a mystic or, you know, he's not
wanting to throw out faith by any means. In fact, he's just trying to get science to, you know,
to find the sort of causal principles that undergird it and to stabilize it and to show
how it can make progress. But he wasn't by any means throwing out his faith or, you know,
the belief in the spiritual realm or anything like that. He was really, you're right, he's
trying to fix the philosophy so that it could handle the kind of movements we're seeing in science.
Yeah. Well, and the funny thing is when it comes down to it, you know, Newton's laws are descriptive.
And then when you get to the mechanical question of like, yeah, but why do they move, why do they
move that? Why do those laws function that way? Why are they the way they are? Newton's answer is
just because God wills it. That's right. And that's it. And he's not putting it, it's not a punt
to go out of the gaps. Like Newton's actually recognizing they don't have, objects don't have
to move this way. This is just the way God's ordained that they move. And so for all that,
and Snoblin, you know, in order to reinforce that, I think he talks about, yeah, he talks about the
fact that Newton, a lot of the things that he's unearthed was things like that. Newton's doing
things that we would associate with like Southern Baptist fundamentalists or something like that,
which is like he's doing like End Times chart space than the book of Revelation. That's right.
Things like that. Yeah. No, he definitely, you know, seems to be drinking deeply from theology,
from the Bible, from Revelation. And yet, obviously, his contributions to science are legendary or
prodigious. But yeah, I mean, that's a story that Snoblin happily tells in the book.
About that side of Newton that is oftentimes marginalized and pushed aside. I do think that
some of those, you know, what you might call back story presuppositions are distinctly sort of
meaningful and, you know, metaphysical and rich, right? And when you get, when you fast forward
to 21st century, the 20th century, 21st century, you get to things like reformed epistemology,
there all, there would be an agreement, Newton would be an agreement that there's certain basic
things that we just assume are God centered. And we have every right to hold them. We don't
necessarily have scientific evidence for them, but we're properly functioning in the environment
for which we were made, in which we were made, and they work. And that's how science can be done
and done fruitfully. Now, of course, the Leibnizian in me wants to come in and say, oh, now this is
a problem, but this is, so I'll bring up the rationalist side, right? Because the earliest
modern discussion, right? When you're talking about maternity, at least at the original fork
in the road for maternity, is are we going to be rationalists? Are we going to be empiricists,
right? Is it going to be that the most important things are things we observe and can poke and
prod and describe, right, like the laws of motion? Or is it going to be the analytic stuff? Is it
stuff like math and logic and so on? And that's your rationalist, right? And that's the fork in
the road. Which one's more important? Which one is more explanatory? So I think what you just said
is true of how so many empiricists talk and think, I think it's also true of like the
common sense realists, which is sort of where a lot of the contemporary reformed epistemology
guys go, right? Guys like Thomas Reid, who are just like, you just trust your faculties,
common sense realists. This is a certain amount of prima facie truth that everybody can sort of get
on board with. Right. And that's where guys like the contemporary reformed epistemologists tend to,
they grab Reid as their guy, right, Thomas Reid. But what's interesting is on the Leibnizian side,
it's like, okay, so what are the rationalists saying? Are they opposing it? And the answer is,
no, God becomes even more important in the rationalist systems, because Leibniz, somebody
like Leibniz is going to come along and he's going to say, well, look, here's the problem,
right? The exact problem is what Newton grants, which is that the laws of motion
could be otherwise, right? There's no reason objects tend this way rather than that way.
I mean, your laws are descriptive of what is so they're not prescriptive. They don't explain
anything. That's right. And that's Leibniz's concern. I would like an explanation, please.
Exactly. And, and what's interesting is once Leibniz bring washers out like the principle
of sufficient reason, you know, for anybody who doesn't know basically that, you know,
you need an explanation that is, is, you know, that is complete, right? So, you know, if there was
an explosion in this room, and I said, Chris, what happened? And you're like, well, obviously,
there was oxygen in this room. And it's like, well, okay, that's a, that's a partial reason is not
sufficient. Every room I walk into, is it blowing up, you know, that's got oxygen in it.
And so Leibniz is like, you need a sufficient reason, right? Something that really does offer
a complete and closed answer. And where Leibniz traces that to is he says, well, once we start
tracing from one explanation to the next, soon we start going down a long, long, long explanatory
rabbit hole, where we find every explanation is incomplete, right? Even if we explained everything
about why you're here, Chris, we get to, we get to your parents at some point in that equation,
and they need to explanation, and it's going to trace on and on. And so Leibniz is convinced that
what you've got to get to eventually is get to God. But Leibniz doesn't even think, and that's,
this is where his rationalism comes in, right? He's like, just saying, like the God, you know,
sort of, is self sufficient, he's a necessary being, you can sort of just by understanding
what he is, you get an explanation for why he is, that doesn't explain why he does the stuff.
And that's where you need the principle of the best. So Leibniz is theodicy, right? That our
world is the best of all possible worlds, even though it's addressing the problem of evil.
In some ways, what it's really addressing for Leibniz is it's addressing everything else, right?
Leibniz isn't just concerned with answering like, why would God permit evil? Like Leibniz is concerned
with answering why are the laws of physics the way they are? And if you can get to something,
like if you can get to in the idea of God, not just that he exists, but also that he always
does the best, now you have an analytic explanation, you've reached an endpoint of the inquiry.
And so like what's interesting is for Leibniz, without God, and without the sort of classical
understanding of God as the optimal being, you can't explain anything, physics, history, anything.
I think that's a pretty good way of assessing the empiricist-rationalist debate, right? The empiricists
are going to accept certain things that are only premised because the world is meaningful and that
it's orderly, it's essentially, quote unquote, Christian or theistic in some fundamental way,
and they can get science and everything else off the ground. Rationalists are not quite so
eager to simply assume that these things are functioning properly, but they want a sufficient
explanation for it. And so the rationalists quickly go to God to, is the only possible
way to hold that all together. Yeah, no, it's true. And yet somehow, for the empiricists, so many of
them, it does end up requiring when you ask the why, they do have to grant, well, God wills it,
right? That's what you get with so many of these guys. So then how does it begin to unravel, Chris?
Like, if everybody's there, right, like, you know, maybe there's a fork of some kind.
That's a reference for anybody who doesn't know the Hume's fork.
Yeah, well, you know, this, I mean, there's a lot of ways to tell the story. You and I are familiar
with Kant's sort of watershed of the rationalist empiricists saying, look, both of those two are
contributors to the knowing process, but nobody's ever analyzed reason as it and its contribution
to the knowing process. And this, of course, where we get the watershed philosophy, that is
a manual Kant's transcendental thought, that space time in the 12 categories, as well as
freedom and the moral law and some other things are part of the rational makeup of what it means
to be a human being. And that's just a huge moment in Western thought. Everybody sort of is aware of
it. You know, I've taught it a couple of times in different venues, but nobody seems to really
understand it. And so that's why guys like you and I are so important these days, I guess,
trying to translate this for audiences that don't want to wade into those 800-page tombs.
Well, and so I think by way of context, you know, it really is that, and this is incidentally
something that I think is very relevant to how we think about these things. I always consider
David Hume, who precedes Kant, occasions Kant, right? This part of what Kant is trying to answer
address is Hume's skepticism. And so I always like to say that Hume is the most honest of the
empiricists. And the reason is because Hume, Hume is all for like, yeah, let's just trust the senses
absolutely. The only thing that's real is sense experience and so on. But then the problem is
rather than going from there into supreme confidence, because that's what the empiricists want it.
They're like, oh, I can trust my senses. So see, you're right there in front of me.
Hear this? That's a table, right? And it's hard right there. And so it's like, oh, supreme confidence
and all this stuff about sense experience. And yet Hume comes along and says, yeah, there's a lot of
bad habits with the way reason interacts with these things. So just as a simple example is causation.
So it's so easy for us to be like, you know, when I do something like this and knock on a table,
you know, that if you were sitting there watching that, you're going, yeah, of course,
I observe the causation, right? I saw your hand hit the table and then I heard the sound, right?
But what Hume recognizes is those are two different empirical events. One empirical event is the sound,
the other empirical event is the sight. You don't actually observe the connection,
your mind puts them together. But you don't observe the causation, which is incidentally why
foli artists and movies can swap out the real knocking on the table, replace it with a fake one,
and you don't know the difference. And so people like Hume, and he goes through a whole heck of a
lot of, you know, examples of bad habits of mind, right? That he suggests are all relations. And so
causation goes away, the self goes away, you know, all these sorts of things that contrast to bring
back. But it's that skepticism that that's at the stage. Now, the reason I want to just pause
there before we go to Kant is because there's a certain naivete about the contemporary world,
like the folks who want the Straussian narrative. So many of them tend to be empiricists, right?
I don't believe in your sky daddy. I only, you know, I only believe in what I could see and taste
and touch. And, you know, they fancy themselves to be scientifically minded and things like that.
But it's as if they skipped over the entire part of history where empiricism totally unravels in
the hands of everybody who tries to embrace that. And every attempt in the subsequent decades to
resurrect it has failed. Right. That's right. And so with Kant, you know, we get his particular
time. Now, I suspect you and I disagree a little bit, not so much on what Kant thinks, but on,
you know, how good or successful or whatever he is. I think there's a published exchange between
us where we take different sides on that. But, but anyway, we don't need to get into a fistfight
here about it or anything. Well, yeah, I think what we both agree on is that he is, in fact,
the next major movement and his, it's instructive as to how he gets out of that skepticism.
Right. And it is predominantly theistic, you know, the way he does it. Right.
That the whole system of reason is in danger of going retrograde unless it's moving forward
in its understanding of the archaeology of faith, a rational faith. And that's, I think, you know,
what makes the work we did on the religion text so interesting to people is that we show how he
holds it all together, that he's not an old man dribbling on himself as philosophers cloak, but
he's in fact doing reasonably good metaphysical work in the transcendental mode of discourse
that's uniquely Kant. So let me translate that for, for my audience here. So, I mean, basically
what ends up happening with Kant is he, like so many others like Bishop Barkley and others,
start to recognize that part of how, you know, skepticism is, is getting a foothold is because
there's a world out there and a world inside. Right. So part of the question is, I'm looking at
Chris and it's like, okay, but does Chris really look like what's in my head? Right. And that,
and that's how you start to get to skepticism is this inability to bridge that gap. And so you
have the initial bridge with Barkley where he's like, well, let's get rid of the thing outside
of your head and just say that the only thing there is are minds and the ideas inside of your mind.
But, but Kant does something similar but different, right? A turn to the subject where he's like, well,
well, you know, I'll, there will be a certain level of agnosticism about whether the thing out
there is exactly like it is in my head, but that doesn't really matter. Because what I have is what's
in my head. And so the turn to the subject is really a turn to the mind and the structures of
mind and saying like, well, let's, let's analyze the thing that we have access to, which is reason
itself. And so the appearance and various immediate types of experiences, he kind of has a
common sense view of, he thinks we have them and that they're, they, they have to be coming from
somewhere other than pure sense perception or other than just logic, they must be rooted in the
recesses or the contributions of reason. And that's his big transcendental turn to the subject in a
nutshell. Yeah. But the religious part is that basically Kant recognizes, and this part I think
has always been recognized even though some people try to dismiss it as non-realist, we'll say. But
like it's always been recognized that Kant needs God in some sense. He's going to talk about morality.
He's known as a moralist. He recognizes that, you know, morality requires certain things like
that you have free will. If I'm going to be held responsible for my choices, I need to have the
ability to do or not to, you know. And then he also recognizes that there's certain things about
your moral instincts that just grow unstable unless there's a God and, you know, somehow,
you know, you're held accountable for your choices. That's just pretty well known. I mean,
I would say, I would say that's not terribly controversial. Now, how people interpret that,
how sincere he is or not varies. Yeah, exactly. Right. But nonetheless, I don't think there's
many people who would give pushback, the Kant's at least arguing along those lines. That's right.
For anybody who doesn't know, what would you say? I just said like that some people treated
as non-realism. What's, if you want to give a nutshell non-realist, like what's, what's
non-realism for folks who have never heard of it? Yeah, well, non-realist position would be,
you need the ideas in order to have certain pragmatic results, but you don't need to have
anything behind those ideas, except the ideas themselves. Right. And you definitely have people
in the world like this right now, right, who talk about God, but a lot of us sort of raise an eyebrow
and go, do you really believe in God or do you think that's a useful symbol? Right? Or something
like that. Anyway, so that's, that's how the Straussian types try to take over Kant. So like,
he doesn't really mean it, right? That's probably related to evolutionary ethics as well or theories
where it's emergent, you know, that we need these ideas to hold, you know, communities together
and for survival and whatnot. But that's, that's, you know, that's a classic, you know,
genetic fallacy of some kind, like just because it emerged some way or if you have that,
you're not describing whether or not it's true. Yeah. Yeah. And Alvin Planagas does some good
work on that in his, what is it, warranted Christian belief? I think he's got the Marks
Freud objection where he's pointing that out and analyzing it. But I think the thing that you and
I really would, our work, which is so beloved in Kant studies, that's sarcasm, by the way,
we deeply hated. I mean, there's, there's really a sense in which, you know, there's our work has
stirred up a hornet's nest. It's definitely required a lot of people to weigh in and oftentimes
there's a, it's quite divisive. But you, I mean, as another side note, one of the outcomes of
persistence of the sacred in our work on Kant was the realization that a lot of the readers and
receivers of these historic figures have a kind of religious relationship with them.
That if you fundamentally show that they're wrong in their reading or that they're misguided in
some way, they do come out with some, you know, viciousness. And, and, you know, I think we
discovered that in Kant studies, but then we saw it happening in other fields as well.
Right. That is these, I don't know what you'd call them,
revisionist readers of these figures really have religious motivations for why they're
reading them the way they are. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and, and our, our reading, you know,
not that we have to go deep into the weeds on it, but the fact of the matter is you mentioned that
Kant wrote a text later in life, religion within the boundaries of mere reason that most people
just dismissed. You know, they thought it's incoherent. It doesn't fit with Kant's philosophy.
You mentioned that he's dribbling on his philosopher's cloak. He's just an old seal,
an old man who's worried about the fact that he's going to die and he destroyed Christianity.
Yeah. Like that's kind of like the old man was wrong. Right. Like that's the, but you and I were
like, well, we're just going to treat this text with the level of seriousness that Kant seemed
to treat it with when he wrote it and trying to make it coherent. And when we did the result was
a Kant that really it's hard to just treat him like he's just some, you know, either senile
guy or some guy who really doesn't think there's any importance to, to faith or religion or Christianity
or anything like that. Yeah. I mean, we, we did stir up a hornet's nest, but we also stirred up
some real interest from other scholars who said, you guys said what we were struggling to utter
here. And that's the Kant I read as well. Yeah. So now there's a king of the hills sort of thing
going on who, who can get the right interpretation, but, you know, but putting that to one side,
you know, there's definitely a robust sort of treatment of Kant's religious thought going on,
which we were, I mean, we weren't the originators of that. Obviously there had been other people who,
I mean, you did the holy edited volume with Palmquist before this that was talking about that
burgeoning ring, but I don't want to get too far into the weeds with Kant. I mean, obviously
things went awry, right? So, and I'd just be curious, you know, like at some point it did
begin to unravel, right? There's no doubt that even though these guys had religious bents and,
you know, the folks after Kant too, right, Hegel, Hodgson is absolutely right. I mean, Hegel is
very clearly, even though he's like a pantheist or a pendant theist, like God is indispensable
in Hegel's thought. And guys like, you know, FWJ Schelling, right, these other sort of guys
after them are really critical, but at some point it does start to unravel and a certain,
you know, movement really begins to emerge, not in modernity, but sort of on this back end of it,
where people are like, you know, what if we could get rid of the God thing, right? So like, how would
you, I know how I diagnose it, but I'd be curious, like, how do you diagnose that sort of end of the
era where all of a sudden the skids are greased and we end up here, right? And obviously we've
talked about how the narrative gets here. That's the Straussian sort of narrative. But if we're
getting rid of Strauss and we're saying that's rubbish, which it is rubbish, these guys were
deeply sort of philosophically rich, theologically rich. I mean, God was essential to their thinking,
they weren't anti-Christianity, they were unconventional, probably a lot of them are heretical,
whatever, but like they were all sort of deeply, you know, rooted in the importance of God and
religion and so on. But at some point you did hit this point where it drops off into the abyss,
right? And so how would you diagnose the unraveling? Typically the way I try to frame it, and I think
this is among the simplest ways I've heard it, and I think pretty explanatory, is that, you know,
all of our thinking is driven towards better and better metaphysical paradigms for understanding
reality, but it's driven by logic and ethics. And these are fundamental philosophical fields,
analytic logic, and, you know, what you might, I mean, let's call it the moral law,
freedom and the moral law, and that's like a fan of a manual. Well, there's some basic
sort of things that have driven Western philosophy to the heights that it has achieved.
And in the 19th century, we see both of those two pillars of the quest for truth, beauty,
and goodness undermined. I think we first see it in the movement towards understanding the
very mind of God to be synthetic, and that is somehow A equals not A as a fundamental ingredient
of how truth comes into being. And this is, I guess, you know, I look at an apologist who
isn't oftentimes right on philosophers, but on this one, I think he is a guy named Francis Schaefer,
talked about him. Destin off the old Francis Schaefer. I am, I am. I mean, he's known for
this line of despair, and it really is the breaking the back of analytic truth in replacing it with
synthetic truth. Now, that alone isn't enough to cause the problems that we see in the 20th
and 21st centuries, because there is some truth to synthesis.
All right, so let me pause you there. I presume it's been a long time since I read Francis Schaefer,
but I'm presuming he probably pigs that with Hegel, right? That he's, so Hegel's dialectic.
Kant discovers synthesis in a sense based intuition and concepts being united in the
act of synthesis, but Hegel takes it to be fundamental to God's self-understanding,
presenting the world and coming to self-understanding in and through the
synthesis that happens in the human mind. So let me translate this for some folks again.
So when Chris is here talking about synthetic, right, he's talking about Kant's synthetic notion
is somehow that the mind has certain innate ideas in it. And then it encounters the world,
and then those two things merge, and that's where we get, you know,
that's where we get understanding, right? Yeah, some sort of direct, you know,
what we presume is sense experience, right? So if you're going with a standard empiricist stuff,
right, like that's just the encountering of the world is, you know, and but for Kant,
it's synthetic, right? The mind meeting, whatever it's meeting.
Yes, that's the contribution, synthetic a priori contributions of the mind that make an
appearance to us a viable thing. That's consciousness, right? And then Hegel is known for
his dialectic, which is the idea that there is a thesis, right? Some stated something,
an antithesis, right? An opposite, you know, an opposition at least, and then a synthesis that
moves things forward where it's neither those two, but you know, it gets a third sort of thing.
And, you know, I know that I don't know if this is what Schaefer is citing, but certainly when
Hegel starts to give a creation narrative, which incidentally what I'm about to describe
is found in G. Lessing before Hegel, but Lessing wrote a little essay where he talks about this,
but Hegel basically thinks of the world as like you have God who is the absolute, right?
And then, you know, sort of you have the absolute nothingness, right? Like this sort of being
and non-being, and then the synthesis is where you get finitude. So you go from like
absoluteness and not absoluteness, right, to like finitude, right? Finitude, to the world as we
experience it. Right, and this is how Hegel understands the world. I said he's a pantheist
or a penintheist. Penintheist is a newer term, so in his day he was called a pantheist. But the
idea is like that the world itself is sort of this unfolding of God, like, which is not entirely
contrary to the ancient world, right? The ancient world did have this notion that somehow the world
is an articulation of God, right? Like that God is somehow expressing all the different dynamics
of his wisdom and his being and his power through all the different stuff, right? And Hegel's playing
on that, right? And it's the unfolding of God's own being and self-realization. So that's what
absolutely. Schaefer doesn't like that, huh? Yeah, prior to that, you know, the way he tells
a story, analytic thought, was all about understanding the world, breaking it down to its
composite parts and better understanding the whole. But after Hegel, something different's
happening, we think we've unlocked the hidden mysteries of God's understanding of the God-world
man relationship. And that is what he calls a line of despair, where the old rationality of the
Greeks is overcome by a new synthetic rationality that is distinctive to the 19th century.
The other movement, and this is on the ethics side of it, is the coming of Friedrich Nietzsche.
And Friedrich Nietzsche is beyond good and evil, overcoming the very notion of any separation
between good and evil for people who are of, say, a higher historical, you know, the end
of the earth, as he calls them, the Superman. And it's the breaking the back of analytical logic
with a new synthetic logic coupled with the breaking the back of the moral law with the
emergence of the Superman who creates his own laws through the act of the will to power,
conscious act of the will to power, that we get this kind of double piston that used to drive
our collective understanding of how we formulate a worldview in the first place.
And both of those two things are taken, in a sense, off the table. And this promotes the individual,
it promotes the notion that we're conscious manifestations of the will to power. And a lot
happens that then transforms itself in the 21st century to what we now call postmodern philosophy
rooted in this, this, this twin thing that's happening in the 19th century.
It doesn't mean that people wholesale have given up on these things. In fact, lots of people hold
to the importance of logic and the importance of ethics. But now we're getting separation on these
issues, you know, moral relativity, you know, atomistic individualism based upon the individuals
that one who makes discerns where meaning is to be found, what things, you know, what things mean,
and, and how we can now reorganize nature through an act of will. And so that's, you know, if I'm
trying to describe what's what, you know, the origins of what went wrong, and a lot goes wrong
in the 19th century. And these are people who fancy themselves as somehow related to Kant,
and yet transcending him fundamentally. Yeah. So let me give you my diagnosis,
see whether or not you see overlap or dissonance between you and me on this part.
And then I want to ask you a question specifically about the enlightenment. So,
well, my journey generally, but, so anybody who has tracked my work,
and I don't know how much you track my work, Chris, I don't, you know, you never write anymore,
you don't call, so I'm going to get to know you, but no, it's been complicated years. Anyway, but,
so they know that, you know, one of the ways that I think is is how I think, you know, the lens by
which I look at the history of ideas that I think is really, really useful is the entire idea that
in some ways, the history of ideas is really the story of two roads, the road of realism and the
road of nominalism. And folks who listen to this know what I mean by those terms, and obviously
you do as well, right? The idea that the mind looks out into the world, we see, you know,
we see categories, we see genera species, we see groups, we see numbers, we see logic, all
this sort of stuff. So the question, right, the question of realism is when the mind does that,
is it doing that because those things are real, right? And it's abstracting out of reality,
those structures that are there and informative, or are they mental fictions, right? Are they mere
names, and nominalism from no man for name, that the mind projects on reality to organize a
reality and give it structure that isn't really there. And basically the way I think is a really
useful way of looking at the history of ideas is exactly that, right? That it's the story of these
two different roads. So very early on in the pre-socratics, you have people testing these
different roads, you have folks like the Pythagoreans who are noticing like, I think there's this
immaterial stuff, it's called math, right? That's just sort of like an important feature of reality.
And then you've got Adamists who are like, no, I think it's just like hard bits of matter,
like colliding and coalescing and all this sort of stuff. And eventually you have realism,
win the day, right? With people like Socrates and Plato and Aristotle and Stokes and the New
Platonist. The Jews and the Christians get in on this, right? Alexandria and Jews end up embracing
realism. They're really Christians, East and West embrace realism. And now like the pagan world
and the Christian world and all of that is sort of converging into this burgeoning trajectory
of realism, right? That this is the nature of reality, primary is mind, right? And specifically
the divine mind. And then the structures of reality that follow from that. And then, you know,
and that really what we as images of God, or if you were a stoic divine sparks or whatever it is,
you know, are capable of discerning that. And that's discerning what those structures are and
figuring out our place in that is what offers us a way forward in terms of knowing how we ought to
live, right? And so that's sort of like the realist trajectory. And then nominalism enters in and,
you know, at first enters in the late medieval period, people like William of Accom,
who are really sort of initially pietistic about it, right? They want to say in some ways,
like, I don't like saying that there's certain things God can't do, right? He can't make square
circles, which was a quintessentially, you know, realist sort of thing to say like, yeah, you know,
logic, structures of reason are structures of reality, reflective of the divine mind.
But nominalists like Accom didn't like that. So they want to say, well, those are just sort of
our structures. They're the imposed structures that God's given to us, but they're not sort of
like innate in reality. But, you know, nominalism really becomes a driving force in modernity.
The empiricists, we always refer to them as empiricists, but they're really nominalist first.
People like John Locke, you know, the whole opening of his, you know, new essays on human
understanding, or sorry, that was liveness, his essays on human understanding,
liveness did the new essays. But, you know, Locke's essays on human understanding is really
an attack on innate ideas and really Plato, right? It's an attack on realism. And so empiricism is,
and I had said, you know, early on in this discussion that it's first and foremost an attack
on Aristotelian philosophy, not on religion. And that's true, right? Aristotle had won the day in
the Latin Medivals, and they all recognized that. So they're really sort of attacking those
metaphysics more so than anything about the religion. And so the way I see it is I see a
certain flourishing of morality, of politics, of metaphysics, of human understanding and civilization
in the culmination of realism. And in many ways, I really sort of identified the underlying rot
that gives way to postmodernity as nominalism itself. And so when I look at it, I think,
you know, empiricism is the let's give nominalism a try. And I say that not sort of like,
hyperbolically, literally, the mechanical philosophy was a let's dust off the atomism
of the Greeks and give it another whirl. So it really was that sort of like nominalist materialism.
And I think Hume is the right culmination of that, that like once you start to go this route,
you end up alienated from the world, you start to have trouble justifying basic things like
causality. And even though I recognize that what somebody like Immanuel Kant does with the term
to the subject is meant to remedy, you know, the problem, I really do think, you know,
Kant in some ways perpetuates the problem or at least embodies the fact that what you're left
with is like a certain amount of agnosticism, right, that there really is this, well, we're sort
of left with what reason, you know, like reason philosophy almost becomes a form of psychology
more so than metaphysics. And even though people like Hegel tried to reintroduce metaphysics with
this pantheism, pretty quickly, you know, the sort of empiricist impulse here of the underlying
nominalism of the age says, well, yeah, but we don't really have access to the God stuff.
We still only have like the human stuff and the material stuff. So now Hegel gives way to people
like Karl Marx, where it's like, you know, well, first Feuerbach, right, that we're really
play acting that this is about God, let's be honest, this is about man projecting, you know,
and then Karl Marx, the dialect is really just about politics. And in some ways, I see Marx as
sort of the leftist version of this and Nietzsche as the right, right, it either devolves into a sort
of Superman Nazism, right, or a leftist Marxism, right. And so in some ways, what I see is I see
the destruction of, you know, words, right, and the reduction of words not from objective
definitions like in Plato, but reducing them to subjective things, which then means they can
be controlled and manipulated, you know, that the political sphere is not about transcendent good
and bad, right, it's about here and now gritty, good and bad, which is not really about morality
per se, but it's about utility, right, it's about what we can get, you know, in order to
increase pleasure and decrease pain, right, where morality becomes utilitarian in nature and so on.
And so in some ways, I think Hume rightly nails the problem of nominalism, and everything else is
sort of flailing to get out from under that problem. And it just keeps on collapsing down into at some
point, this really is a struggle for power, this is a struggle for resources, this is a struggle for
getting what we can here and now, and objective meeting, objective morality, you know, objective,
you know, really anything other than, you know, what I objectively want for myself,
whatever object I want for myself, it tends to be what it keeps on collapsing into.
And the reason I bring that up as relevant here and now is that I see that divide, that realist,
anomalous divide is between all of the divides and culture, right, like trans says like its first
premise is gender is a social construct, that's an inherently nominalist premise, like the premise is
that all the sort of categories we use of male and female, you know, penis, vagina, right, like,
those are just words imposed on a world that really is just a bunch of matter floating around.
And if we hack it apart and reshape it and give it a new name, it is that thing, right.
And that's a nominalist worldview. Whereas then the man on the street, he's going, you know,
I'm pretty sure a man can't become a woman. And I'm pretty sure that that hacked up penis
isn't a vagina, I think it's still a penis, right, like that's a realist instinct, right.
He thinks the world just is a certain way and you can't just by force, right, make it another way.
And, and in some ways, that's the divide where you have one group that, you know,
the original oppressor is reality itself. And that's why we can manipulate and remake it.
And, you know, we need to be the Superman in this situation, somebody who realizes
that realism is false, right. The Superman is the one who realizes that reality
is whatever we call it and whatever structures we give to it. And therefore, let's just give
it new structures, right. And the realist is the one who's going, you know, I think reality is our
friend, right. Like I think meaning is found by figuring out our place in it, submitting to it
and like, you know, moving through it in a way that leads to flourishing and so on. So that's
how I would diagnose it. I guess my question is, I have two questions for you. So the first is,
given your sort of Schaeferian diagnosis they gave, do you think that there is harmony or dissonance
between that? That's the one question. Yeah. And then the second question is,
as someone who has lived and breathed caught for as long as you have, do you see, I mean,
I obviously see modernity and the enlightenment in a negative way. I do. I think it's step
backwards. And I think the fruit of that tree is shown by where we are right now.
And so, but I guess my question for you would be, would you defend the modern turn? Because, and
I'm not saying defended in the sense of like, these guys aren't atheists, agnostics,
but do you think it was a good thing or a bad thing? You know, step forward, step backwards,
whatever. So those are my two questions. So take it away. Wow, Nathan, that's a tour de force and
a very, you know that your account on the realist, nominalist thing has been influential on me. I
think you're, I think you're right. The way I think of our approaches and why they appear to be
different is that the big questions of life, the way I understand what I call the tree of philosophy
can be approached ontologically or can be approached epistemically. And I choose to approach it
epistemically, probably a son of the Enlightenment. You're not a son of the Enlightenment. Maybe more
medieval or early church or, you know, and so the ontological move of understanding the realism,
nominalism piece as the lens through which to see the problem with our worldview these days
makes a ton of sense to me. So I guess in answer to your first question, I do see them as compatible
where they differ is when I'm looking at the question of knowledge
in the Kantian turn, I see that that can be done critically and well and critical in the sense of
the Kant's understanding of critical where you take the truths in both positions to find a higher
order position, articulate that analytically and feel like you've made progress in your
understanding of the world. I see that as kind of what happens in the history of ideas.
And so with Kant's turn to epistemology, really, you know, one of the things I think you and I
discovered with Kant is that the best reading of Kant is to hold on the ontology in favor of the
epistemology until a full excavation of reason is done. And when you do that, you see that
Kant's rational faith starts to look strangely familiar to metaphysicians
because he's trying to do a transcendental analysis of what we must believe for moral hope.
And if you hold out long enough, you get a kind of understanding of rational faith that looks
awfully amenable. And the leap from rational to empirical faith isn't quite as far as we thought
it was. It's not the Kierkegaardian sort of leap of faith in an irrational sense, but a very
rational movement. If I can't see, Kant talks about, if I can't see any divergence from the prototype
in an empirical manifestation, Allah, Jesus, then that's a reasonable kind of empirical faith to have.
So I do think there's renditions of Kant that are actually epistemically very reasonable to hold,
and I'm not sure I'm all the way there with Kant, even on that rendition, but I do think
something does go vitally wrong after Kant and the receivers of Kant epistemically speaking. They
give up on God, they give up on immortality, they give up on faith and the moral laws I've
stated previously, logic and ethics become problematic in the 19th century in a way they
hadn't been before that. And so when I'm looking at the big questions, I'm approaching it from
that epistemic problem of logic and ethics. Without those things, we're not going to really
be able to have a round table discussion that aims at truth, a Socratic dialogue that actually has
the hope of getting the truth, beauty and goodness. And so that's the way I'm approaching that same
kind of problem. But I'm very sympathetic to the metaphysical, you know, sort of ontological
approach to the big questions where the realism piece, which has been so fruitful to Western
intellectual history, has been systematically replaced by nominalism. And that explains an
awful lot of what we're seeing in this sort of crazy universe. We're now living in a 21st century
America where all these things are reversed and flipped under head. And what we take to be rather
obvious, we can reconstruct through our own creative means and come up with something just as good as
reality. Yeah. So here's what I think is interesting as I listen to you is that I've always known from
our early days of working together and talking that we had differing dispositions on these
sorts of things, not necessarily overtly differing worldviews, but I always knew that I was more of
a purist in metaphysics. And obviously, you know, you knew that about me as well, right? I was
one of the rare people who goes around calling themselves a metaphysician, right? Do those exist
anymore? That was exactly your disposition. And I've also always known that I don't know that I
would call you a pragmatist, but there always was something about you that was like, well, okay,
let's work within, okay, this person has these presuppositions or they have this point, let's
work within that. And I've never been opposed to that, right? Obviously, I think like with Aquinas
or even Gregory of Nessus, you know, a great catechism, right? The idea of starting with what
are the, you can't reason with an atheist the same way you could reason with a fellow theist,
right? You know, you have to deal with the views that are there. And I've always known this that
I'm more of a purist, where I'm like, I want to know whether the entire world, the metaphysics
down to the foundations, I'm going to go in and I'm going to examine the foundations, whereas
you've always been a little more like, well, let's look at the house and working within this house.
What's the best version of this? Now, I do think though, and I'll be curious to see over time whether
you'll be more and more persuaded to my side, because I dare say, I think I've seen movement
with you on this, which is that as we're getting down the road, where we're no longer talking about
gray in world view, we're talking like cosmic differences, where like in this culture, it's
people are looking at each other going, we literally live on different planets,
like that it's all of a sudden, it's starting to look more and more like, maybe you have to go
down to the foundations, because at least I would diagnose that as I think we've benefited from
something that the Enlightenment generally, modernity generally benefited from, which was the fumes
of Christianity. So even when people were like, ah, yeah, let's cast off Christianity, we still
thought, well, we can have a common sense discussion here. I mean, these people aren't crazy, but in
some ways, like the boundary lines of the discussion were nicely constricted by the fact that we all
grew out of this Judeo-Christian culture. And we didn't really ever sit across the way from
the Marduk worshiper, who's going to burn his children, you know, like the valley is a sacrifice
to the pagan god. Like we were never really that far apart. But I think what you're seeing is the
fumes are dissipating. And now the polarity is starting to merge. And it's almost like, wow,
maybe we can no longer have that good faith discussion. And we do have to go down right to
the foundations. I think you're almost certainly right. I don't want to give up quite yet. But
I do think that your charity has no no bounds. Yeah, well, you know, maybe I'm an eternal
optimist or something. But I do see the fact that we're now talking past each other, right?
That the circle, not you and me, but not you and me, but the cultures talking past each other.
We once upon a time had dignity, civility, basic, you know, things that we agreed upon
in the Western intellectual tradition. But this type of skepticism that we're seeing is a little
different than the skeptics of the Greek world. They're now calling everything a manifestation
of the will to power, right? And everything's on an equal plane. And everyone is potentially
your enemy. And, and so we no longer have that kind of civility that we once did in how we see
the other. Everyone's a political animal now. Everyone has some axe to grind. And you can no
longer assume that you are common human beings questing after truth together. And that does put
our real stress on the epistemic approach to the big questions of life. I have to admit,
because I can no longer have cosojourners on this quest with me. I really have to smack them in the
face with reality now in ways that I could assume we would agree upon in days of old.
And so that's giving me a lot more charity and pause and mean ability to your view on the
realism, non-anomalism, a side of things, because that's a much stronger tool when you get to open
discourse with people. It's no longer, let me give you another argument, right? Because you're
seeing that as a power play. And now I just say, let's look at reality and how's that working for
you? Right. No, I mean, it is true. I do think, I think, I do think there was a time and I think
you and I saw this. There was a time when you and I can even remember where we were standing and
thinking back. And I think we were listening to a talk by Harold Nettlin. And we were, who's,
for anybody who doesn't know, is the area's religious pluralism. And I think we were sort of
like snickering a little bit, you know, to our shame that we were snicking a little bit, listening
to some of these like doomsday or Christian apologists who are like, what's coming is like a
pure relativism. And we're like, what? Who really thinks that? I mean, this is some straw man,
you know, it would never get here. And the funny thing is we were shown to be the ones
who are naive because they did see what was coming down, coming down the pipe. And we didn't.
We thought it was all a good, good faith, intellectual discussion. And we didn't see where
it would end up. You know, guys like C.S. Lewis and Schaefer, you know, they had, they had blind
spots in their understanding of some of the big questions. But they were really acutely aware
of where this could go and how quickly it could go there. And then a number of other, you know,
thinking of the 80s, 90s, 2000s, when Christian philosophy was flourishing, a number of these
apologists were warning, this is not good. What we're seeing and what you're going to see 30 years
from now is going to be really bad. And I remember there was a chef, right? You and I went from like
going like, no, I think it's a good faith discussion. And that's where it seemed more like preference,
right? Me being like, I think like a metaphysician, you're willing to work within the boundary lines
of whoever you're engaging. But it seems like now I have to say, I think the sifting out,
the separation happening in culture, almost requires in order to have a coherent discussion,
you have to go down to the foundations at this point, because the divide is so, so big, you know.
I think you've convinced me of that over time. And current events have convinced me that there's
no amount of, you know, discourse, arguments, and so forth. I used to really appreciate the
apologists who would go into the secular environments and stake these powerful analytic arguments,
you know, like, you know, pillars or something into the ground so that we had the sort of
social imaginary, as Charles Taylor talks about it, to actually breathe and live and breathe a
faith, a Christian faith in the midst of that. I'm not sure that's sufficient anymore. I think
that era, I was about 50 year era is kind of over now. The plethora of podcasts, not only like this
one and other things that people are listening to, the voices are, you know, the postmodern
cacophony of voices is just too overwhelming to people. You really do need to get down to those
basics again. So this is, I think, where you've convinced me for sure. Yeah. So last question
is the one that I asked, like, modernity, right, the modern term. We're gonna go back to basics,
let reason have it say all this sort of stuff. Step forward, step backward, somewhere in between.
How would you diagnose it? Wow. You know, I guess, I mean, my gut tells me it's a step forward,
but then a step forward can sometimes be off a cliff.
But I'm particularly thinking of, you know, social contract theory, the sort of founding
documents of the United States of America separation of powers, certain sort of what I would call
instrumental or technical achievements that have proven themselves to be worthwhile over time.
And as a bastion for holding to traditional Western values, you might say, there's some
really good things that have happened there. I think, again, what we're seeing in recent times
is a shaking of these structures, because now you have philosophical systems, this nominalism
you're talking about, this will to power, this dialectical materialism, all out against those
structures, as those are illegitimate in some way, even though they have proven themselves time
and again, to be tried and true. And so, yes, it's a mixed bag. And the verdict is still out on
whether or not America is going to be able to weather this, and its structures are going to be
able to weather this, because there's some great wisdom that went into the Enlightenment movement
that made possible, you know, the government, democracy, this sort of democratic republic
we have now. But it's unclear if without the roots, the realism, the metaphysical foundations
being imbibed by good people, you know, and they're the majority of people, whether or not those
structures are sufficient to withstand what's coming. Yeah, I think you're spot on with that,
which is that I would say the naivete, I mean, I spoke about our naivete 30 years ago,
I think you see the same sort of naivete in a lot of the founding principles,
which is that, you know, on the one hand, they're doing separations of powers,
those sorts of things that you're talking about. On the other hand, where they left vulnerable,
was that none of them saw coming post-maternity. Right. And so, there's the certain naivete that
as long as the texts are clear, right, as long as the principles are there, like obviously,
future generations will, you know, be able to navigate these things and that'll hold.
Now, they recognize that you needed a moral, you know, society in order to do this.
But, you know, there really was, there really was a sense in which the documents themselves
left up for grabs the worldview side of it. Right. Because on the one hand, it tacitly
presumes it, mention of God, of a creator, things like that. But certain things like,
obviously, natural law is clearly part of, you know, the founding documents. A natural view of
rights is there, where you have like, what is it like, where you have, you know, the statement about,
you know, the people have more rights than are here enumerated and they retain those rights or,
you know, statements like that that clearly indicate a natural view of rights, you know,
endowed by the creator, right? That's a natural view of rights. And yet, somehow,
you know, in the early discussions about like, could an atheist hold office, right? The answer was,
well, I guess so, right? And there was no recognition that if you leave the worldview
commitments up for grabs, there's a certain naivete that says the documents and the principles
that take care of the worldview side. And it's like, well, that's not true. Right. And we're
seeing that it's not true, that you really need, you know, the idea that somehow you would have
a system of government that's based entirely on a natural view of rights, but you could have somebody
with a positivist view of rights, that things are just governmental inventions, holding office
and interpreting the documents in a judicial capacity is insane, right? Because you can't,
they can't be trusted, right? And so there's sort of this weird sense in which so many of the founding
principles had a distrust in government, but an odd trust in human reason. And it's, and we're
seeing the fruit of that. And so like, I do think you're right that, that there's a lot of good fruit
that comes out of modernity. But there's a lot of vulnerability because there's still this sort of
a certain level of assumption, you know, naive assumption about, you know, about man and reason
and documents and language that doesn't anticipate the postmodern turn and leaves it vulnerable
in a certain sense. And this is where I would say, obviously, you know, that in the narrative,
I just painted earlier, that I would look at the modern turn as in some sense negative, right? The
turn to toy with nominalism and so on. But I guess here's, here's where I see that going. And this
is where the verdict is still out. I could see that narrative going to its logical conclusion
and collapsing the whole thing, right? Which is what you hinted at about, I don't know.
I could also see it going to its logical conclusion and it's like a drug addict hitting a rock bottom
where they're like, man, reality doesn't play nice when you decide that reality is the enemy
and we can manipulate it. And, and all of a sudden, there's a turn back to how do we rediscover
reality. And I actually am seeing signs of that. When I look at the, the generation of folks who
have walked away from religion, many of them are sort of hitting the end of that road and
realizing something is still lacking and then turning back to religion, oftentimes more traditional
religion than they were raised in. And so I think you're seeing hints of that, right? Hints of this
turning back from having stepped off a cliff, right? The question is, you know, is the critical
mask going to go with those folks? Or is it going to go with the folks who continue to war against
reality? And I really don't know. I don't know either. But I totally agree with what you're
saying here. And I'm, I'm, I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic. And then I see you,
the eternal optimists are still optimistic. And I see, well, part of the sifting that's going on
that we're seeing in the academy is optimism, right? Schools are going down, one of which I was
teaching at and went down, but other schools are rising up with like-minded sort of metaphysical
realists focused on, you know, the canonical books of the Western intellectual tradition
and, you know, biblical principles and, you know, some of the good founding elements of our nation,
recognizing lacunas, but still seeing that that synthetic wedding, if you will, of those things,
can have a future. And that maybe we ought to, you know,
nostalgically return to those roots as our point of orientation for getting back
something that we used to call the American dream, a hope in the future. If you just work hard enough
and believed, you know, in human dignity and God, you know, the, you know, God's got a plan
for your life and that it can work out well if you, if you put the pieces together and face reality
head on. And so, but I am, I am vitally concerned that, you know, once you have let the demons loose
as it were, that they are very difficult to put back into the cage as in the Western intellectual
tradition coupled with this marriage to Christianity was successfully able to do that. And you see
people flocking to these places around the globe. These are what we call colonies that have gotten
such a bad rap has, but they're still dying to get to those places because there's something about
them that is true, good and beautiful. And yet they're being, they're under assault, full,
full scale assault right now. And without, without those things, without the things that made those,
made us great in the first place. I don't know if I can be as optimistic as I want to be on this
thing. Well, I suspect that maybe the, we're getting to a point in history where the real
bottles for how, how truth and goodness and beauty rise above that is probably actually the
early church when it was thrust into a pagan culture. Cause I think we're pretty quickly
getting back to that. So that might be the model. You know, I, I have heard about the martyrs and
the saints and I was hoping we'd never have to go there. But we do, it does seem like there's
some strange similarities with, you know, what Jesus is, the apostles, the early Christians
encountered and what we're starting to encounter once again here in the West. Well, on that note,
we'll, we'll hope your eternal optimism proves to be right. And maybe we'll, we'll end it there.
