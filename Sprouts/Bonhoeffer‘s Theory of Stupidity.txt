In the darkest chapter of German history, during a time when incited mobs threw stones into the
windows of innocent shop owners, and women and children were cruelly humiliated in the open,
Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a young pastor, began to speak publicly against the atrocities that the
regime had produced. After years of trying to change people's minds, Dietrich Bonhoeffer came home
one evening, and his own father had to tell him that two men were waiting in his room to take him
away. In prison, Bonhoeffer began to reflect on how his country of poets and thinkers had turned
into a collective of cowards, crooks and criminals. Eventually, he concluded that the root of the
problem was not malice, but stupidity. In his famous Letters from Prison, Bonhoeffer argued that
stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice, because while one may protest against
evil, it can be exposed and prevented by the use of force. Against stupidity, we are defenseless.
Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here. Reasons fall on deaf ears.
Facts that contradict a stupid person's prejudgment simply need not be believed,
and when they are irrefutable, they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental.
In all this, the stupid person is self-satisfied, and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous
by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for when dealing with a stupid
person than with a malicious one. If we want to know how to get the better of stupidity,
we must seek to understand its nature. This much is certain. Stupidity is, in essence,
not an intellectual defect, but a moral one. There are human beings who are remarkably agile
intellectually, yet stupid, and others who are intellectually dull, yet anything but stupid.
The impression one gains is not so much that stupidity is a congenital defect,
but that, under certain circumstances, people are made stupid, or rather,
they allow this to happen to them. People who live in solitude manifest this
defect less frequently than individuals in groups, and so it would seem that stupidity
is perhaps less a psychological than a sociological problem.
It becomes apparent that every strong upsurge of power, be it of a political or religious nature,
infects a large part of humankind with stupidity, almost as if this is a sociological psychological
law where the power of the one needs the stupidity of the other. The process at work here is not
that particular human capacities, such as intellect, suddenly fail. Instead, it seems that under the
overwhelming impact of rising power, humans are deprived of their inner independence,
and, more or less consciously, give up an autonomous position.
The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us from the fact that he is not
independent. In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with him as
a person, but with slogans, catch words, and the like that have taken possession of him.
He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and is abused in his very being,
having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil,
incapable of seeing that it is evil. Only an act of liberation, not instruction,
can overcome stupidity. Here, we must come to terms with the fact that in most cases,
a genuine internal liberation becomes possible only when external liberation has proceeded it.
Until then, we must abandon all attempts to convince the stupid person.
Bonhoeffer died due to his involvement in a plot against Adolf Hitler
at dawn on the 9th of April 1945 at Flossenberg concentration camp,
just two weeks before soldiers from the United States liberated the camp.
Action springs not from thought, but from a readiness for responsibility.
The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children,
Bonhoeffer once said. Check the description below to read Bonhoeffer's original text
