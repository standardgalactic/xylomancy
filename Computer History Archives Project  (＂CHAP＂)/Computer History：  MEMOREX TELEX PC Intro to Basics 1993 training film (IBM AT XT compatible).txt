master all aspects of the personal computer.
Something has driven you to learn to use a PC, a personal computer,
either your friends, your kids, your job, or maybe just a desire to join the computer age.
Memorex has created this tape to make the basic technology, functions, and terminology of PCs
understandable to you.
And finally, you'll understand that techno nerd babble computer ease that you hear all the time.
You can view this tape in its entirety, or you can set your counter on your VCR at 00 now and
check out this video's table of contents and proceed to just the subjects in which you're
interested. Or go back and review something you've missed.
Personal computers are everywhere nowadays. They're part of so many people's lives. You'll find them
in schools, businesses, even at home. What computers can help you do really defines just how
powerful they can really be.
And to start putting some of that power to work for you, I suggest we begin at the very beginning.
There are two basic types. The IBM PC and Compatibles are made by many different manufacturers
like Dell, Compac, Packardville, among others. There's also the Macintosh family from Apple
Computer. Now, it used to be that IBM and Apple were like the Klingons and the Romions of the
computer world. But those worlds are merging. The needs of most users now can be met by both
systems. If you haven't yet purchased your PC, explore carefully both of these options. And
remember, the most important feature of a PC is its functionality. No matter which technology you
select, this tape should be a helpful introduction. Now, let's get to work.
Okay, well, I think you'll find it's much easier than it may have sounded before. So, let's discuss
the components of a PC. Now, the real brains of a computer are located in the Central Processing
Unit, or CPU. The CPU is the chip that does the actual processing and calculations. Some of the
most commonly discussed are the 286, 386, and 486. The numbers simply refer to the type and
speed of the processing chip in the unit. And no doubt in the future, there's going to be even
faster, more powerful machines like 586 Turbo Power and Super Charge. Oh, don't get carried away.
Let's move on to the monitor. The monitor is the computer's display screen and the primary output
device. Now, the techno-cool name is CRT, which stands for cathode ray 2. You can get monitors,
which display just one color called monochrome, or you can get color. The resolution of color
monitors vary, and are referred to as CGA, EGA, VGA, or dun-dun-dun-duh, Super VGA. The second most
common output device is a printer. There are different types of printers, Daisy Wheel, Dot
Matrix, and LaserJet. Now, they vary in price and capabilities. A good Dot Matrix printer is quite
adequate for a lot of people, although it can be noisy. LaserJet printers produce excellent quality
type and graphics and are very quiet, but can be quite expensive. The keyboard is the most common
input device to enter instructions and information into the computer. Now, there are some special
keys that you won't find on a typewriter, like Enter, which tells the computer to accept your
instructions. Escape, which is usually found in the upper left, lets you exit the program or
function you're working in and back up to the previous step. These are the function keys labeled
F1, F2, and so on. These keys can have distinct actions attributed to them, depending on the program.
Other input devices like a mouse, trackball, or joystick allow the PC user to move the cursor
around to specify an exact location on the screen. The mouse is the most popular. The buttons on it
allow you to send commands to your computer by pointing and clicking. A trackball is basically
a stationary mouse. It looks like a cue ball set into a pedestal, which you roll to move the cursor.
Mary, did you know that computers can communicate over phone lines? Yes, I did, via a modem.
See, your computer can have conversations with other computers, transmitting and receiving data
over a phone line. There are even fax modems that allow users to send and receive fax documents
from or to other computers. Sounds pretty nifty. Now, using a PC is not as complicated as I thought
it might have been, but Mary, how does it all link together? Well, everything plugs into the back.
There's a whole assortment of plugs back there to connect cables to that are called ports.
Serial ports transmit or process data one bit or character at a time, and parallel ports transmit
many bits concurrently. Serial ports are usually used for a mouse or an external modem, and a
parallel port is used to connect a printer. Now, what we've been talking about is hardware, but Mary,
what's software? Oh, software is the real reason you use a computer. It's computer code, the stuff
on disks, programs. Software, or sometimes called application software, tells the hardware what
to do. Well, it looks like I'm ready to sit down on that comfortable, genuine, herky line
software and start using the old PC. What do I do first? Well, first let's talk about floppy disks.
A floppy disk is a plate of magnetic material that stores data in digital form. It goes into the
floppy disk drive. Now, it's used to transfer data from one PC to another, or can be used to backup
data from the hard drive. This doesn't feel floppy at all. In fact, it actually looks like a coaster.
Well, that's a three and a half inch disk that's been encased in plastic. Now, the other common
type is the five and a quarter inch. They both use the same technology and can both be written on
or read from. These are double density disks. These can store about 700,000 characters of
information. There are also high density disks, which can store around 1.4 million or almost
twice the information as a double density disk. But which one do I use? Well, it all depends on
your disk drive. Newer PCs usually have high density drives, which can read all kinds of disks.
Now, Paul, there are a few other inexpensive items that you're going to have to add to your
shopping list, like storage boxes to store and organize your disks and to keep them safe from
dust and damage, paper for your printer, and a mouse pad, which gives you good traction and
protects the mouse and your desk from each other, as well as keeping Oreo cookie crumbs out of the
mouse mechanism. Well, Mary, where is the best place to put it then? Well, your computer should
be placed in a spot that is convenient, clean, cool and dry. Dirt, heat and moisture can damage
your PC's electrical components. I guess that kind of rules out the spot next to the heater.
Well, yeah. Now, you also want to make sure you get a surge protector. It prevents power
fluctuations from damaging circuitry, and you can also use it to protect your power switches from
excess wear and tear. Just turn everything on by using the switch on the surge protector. Mary,
do I need an anti-glare screen? It's a good idea. It prevents eye strain and just fits over your
monitor and prevents light from bouncing off the screen into your eyes. Now, always place your
screen so that you're looking down slightly at it. Face the monitor at a 90-degree angle to any window.
Well, now that we're at the desk, show me the proper way to sit. Okay. Feet nice and flat on the
floor, back straight, forearms level with the keyboard, and my wrists are even supported by this
nice little wrist pad here. Looks good. You must have done most of your homework. The soda. Oh,
you want to keep liquids away from the unit. And also, be sure to cover the unit when it's not in
use. And you can buy a cleaning kit to keep your PC and drive clean and desk free. So my hardware
can actually last longer than the technology. Well, it is constantly changing, but the basics
don't. Let's review. Computers process data by converting it into electrical impulses that
are either on or off. This is a binary code. Just as Morse code used only dots or dashes,
binary code uses zero or one to represent off or on. Each of these pulses is called a bit.
Bits grouped into a pattern of eight are called a byte. These bits and bytes make up all the
numerical information used by a PC. The computer's memory, just like ours, is kept alive by electrical
impulses. When you turn it off, it loses everything unless it's stored on a form of magnetic media
like a floppy or hard drive. There are two types of memory. RAM, random access memory, is the
computer's thinking power. It's the memory that stores data and instructions the PC is currently
using. The more RAM a PC has, the more it can juggle at one time, and the faster it can handle it.
Now, ROM, read only memory, is the memory that is permanently encoded. These are usually the
instructions to turn on, set up, and load the rest of the instructions from the disk.
ROM cannot be changed and won't be erased when the power is turned off.
Now, if you have heard computer jocks talking about megs, they're not talking about girls, they know.
It's short for megabyte or MB. RAM is measured in megabytes. Another thing that is measured in megs
is the capacity of the hard drive. Some hard drives have 40, 80, or even more megabytes. A hard drive
is the device that stores and reads data on a magnetic disk. It's a large capacity storage device
used for long-term permanent storage. The hard drive is where you store the programs and data
that you will be using. Let's take a quick tour inside the PC to see where some of the things
we've been talking about are located. This is the microprocessor chip, which is the brain of the
computer. It's also called the CPU or central processing unit. Now, over here is the floppy
disk drive. If there are two drives, they're stacked on top of each other or side by side.
To the left of or underneath the disk drive is the computer's hard drive, if you have one.
These are the drive's controller cables, which connect to the controller card,
which is plugged into the motherboard. The controller card manages the transfer of data
to and from the drives. This is the computer's power supply, and here are the cables that power
the drive. This is the motherboard. Here are the ROM or read-only memory chips,
and these are the RAM or random access memory. RAM comes in the form of SIMS or single in-line
memory modules. Man, that's a lot of powerful stuff in there. It is, and now that you know what it all
is, it's time to boot up the computer. By the way, if you have the feeling she's not talking
Westernware, you're right. You see, booting up is computer ease for turning the computer on and
getting it up and running by loading the operating system. The operating system tells the PC how to
think and communicate. Some operating systems you may have heard of are OS2 or UNIX, but the most
prevalent is DOS, which stands for Disk Operating System. Developed in 1981 by Microsoft Corporation,
DOS has been made more user-friendly with Windows. The Windows is a graphic user interface similar
in concept to the Macintosh system and can be used with most IBM PCs or compatibles,
depending on the computer's memory. Formatting in DOS is what you must do before you can store
files on a floppy disk. Formatting, sometimes referred to as initializing, prepares a floppy or
hard drive to accept data. It tells DOS how to find the information you stored on it.
In DOS, directories manage information on a hard disk or floppy. Now each directory acts as a drawer
in a filing cabinet and can contain subdirectories or files. To learn more fully how to use DOS,
be sure to reference your manual. The manual? I mean, that's usually the last place I'd check.
Well, maybe that's why you still can't program your VCR either.
No, really, it can be very helpful. And keep it in a place where you can readily get at it
to answer any questions.
You know, Paul, there's a saying. There are two kinds of computer users. Those who have lost
their data and those who will. One of the best habits you can have is backing up. That is,
making a copy of your data onto a floppy. It can also be done onto a data cartridge if you have
a tape drive. If your hard drive crashes or seriously malfunctions, you have lost everything.
Disasters like this can be minimized by copying the contents of the hard drive onto floppies.
And, you know, crashes aren't common, but it only takes once to make you a firm believer in backing
up. You know, backing up is a lot like flossing. Come on, nobody likes to do it, but you sure want
to hold onto your teeth or your data in this case. First long as you need it. Yeah, but the use and
enjoyment you'll get from your PC far outweighs the little dredgeries. Paul, have you thought
about the software you're going to need? Well, I know that I want to do word processing.
Okay, then you'll want to consider programs like WordPerfect
and Microsoft Word. I also have lots of addresses and phone numbers, you know,
friends and clients that I want to keep track of. Well, there are several databases that are popular,
such as D-Base, FoxPro, and Paradox. What about doing budgets? Can anything help?
A spreadsheet program like Lotus or XL can come in very handy, or you might benefit from financial
packages like Quicken. You know, desktop publishing is something that you always hear about.
That's right. It's easy to do beautiful graphics and layouts with software programs
like PageMaker and Ventura Publisher. You can also use your PC to learn an entirely new skill,
even a language, through the vast number of educational programs that are available.
And after I've settled my current budget crisis, I can kick back and play a few games.
Oh darn it! The computer won again. You know, it's good you remember to mention that PCs
are really fun too. You got to put that there.
We've talked about a lot of things in this videotape to provide you with a good overview
to get started in personal computing. We've got over the components of a PC, the CPU,
the keyboard, the monitor, the printer.
And we've talked about how it connects and what you'll need to get started.
We've also taken a closer look at the technology, what memory, RAM, and ROM are,
what a hard drive is, and how to get started on the DOS operating system.
We've also reviewed some safety measures for you, your computer, and your data.
And you know what? None of it as hard as they make it sound. All that tech talk, it's no big deal.
