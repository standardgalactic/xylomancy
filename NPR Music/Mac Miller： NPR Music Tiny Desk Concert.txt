Yeah, the world is so small till it ain't I'm building up a world till it bright
I hate it when I call and it's like I don't want to keep you waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting
I think I know it all, but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke
And I just wanna ball, maybe dunk, but I've never been tall
I might trip, I never fall, God knows I came close
Don't try this at home, I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five star hotel
I'm always in the rush, I been thinking too much
But keep it on the hush, no one need to know just us
That's really all it take
You don't need nothing but today, today, today, today, yeah
The world is so small till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't till it ain't yeah
I'm building up a world till it bright till it bright till it bright till it bright yeah
She hate it when I call, and it's late, and it's late, and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting
I got a bad attitude, playin' tellin' how to move
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak, it's cold in my veins
I'm below freezing, snow season made me
They know that I so need my space, don't wanna grow old
So I smoke just in case, she say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke, that's just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of a world, ain't yet
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gonna be worth it if I make it
There's somewhere above you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothing but today, today, today, today
The world is so small till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't, till it ain't
I'm building up a world till it bright till it bright till it bright till it bright yeah
She hate it when I call, and it's late, and it's late, and it's late
I don't wanna be waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting, waiting
Nine times out of ten I get it wrong, that's why I wrote this song
Tell myself to hold on, I can feel my fingers slipping
In a motherfucking instant I be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall in a wall full of posters
Looking in my dreams, who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Who I've been a fool, but it's cold
That's what human beings do, keep your eyes to the sky
Never glow to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't got a spare second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'
Thank you guys
That's a...
Stundercat on the shaker
Beautiful job, bro
It's beautiful
Alright
I think I'm supposed to talk in between, but...
I don't know
Let's just like stand here and exchange looks
Let me know
Alright
Alright
Oh yeah, this song is called What's the Use
That was called Small Worlds
Alright, that's enough talking
Solid, you've heard enough
Alright
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
You could love it, you could leave it
Sayin' nothing without it
Yeah
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it
But there's somethin' bout it
Yeah
And that just freaks me out
Yeah
I just want another minute
With it, fuck a little
What's the use, yeah
Never superficial
You gon' know it
When it hit you
Get a little sentimental
When I'm off the juice, yeah
Yeah
Okay, we colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me
Motherfucker, hold up
You don't need a hold up
And I can show you what it is
What it truly might be
Nothing that you know of
You don't need a hold up
Cause I'm so above and beyond
Take drugs to make it up
Way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time we don't waste much fuck when we wake up
And I have her saying just like Celine Dion
Whole lotta yes I am
All the way in with no exit plan
Already left in the jet, don't land
Yeah, this time it's tickin'
Come take a ride, get inside, this is highly different
I'm talkin' fly, I got a pilot with him, yeah
Can't not mind my business
Why you trippin', give me something
That your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most
You could love it
You could leave it
Singin' nothing without it, yeah
Don't let them keep you down
What if I'm needed
There's somethin' bout it
And that just freaks me out, yeah
I just want another minute with it
Fuck a little, what's the use, yeah
What's the use, yeah
Never superficial, you gon' know it
When they hit you, get a little center
Men don't win, I'm off the juice, yeah
Well, I'ma give you what you came for
You know, quick to order
I will do who you are
Sippin' costs so far, but call
We could parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably brain more
But you gotta love me
Cause I say today's spendin' money
When I had nothin' shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies, nobody go hungry
Look how far we came
Still they throwin' dirt on my name
But they never worry my friend
Head's turnin' like a hurricane
Swervin' till the sun get up out of my shade
They don't get the picture, cut them out of that frame
Shit, I'm up 30,000, plus change
It's been a while, but I'm down till I'm out
And it is what it is, till it ain't
Thank you
Hey, you could love it
You could leave it
Singin' nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it
Suckin' about it
That just freaks me out
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just want another minute
Where they fuck up it up
What's the use, yeah
What's the use, yeah
I just want another minute
Where they fuck up it up
What's the use, yeah
What's the use, yeah
Never superficial
You gon' learn when it hit you
Get a little center
When I'm off the juice, yeah
Make a little bit more noise
For Thundercat one time
Yeah, yeah
Make a little more noise
For Mac
Yeah
How's your day? How we doin'? We doin' good?
That's good, that's nice
I'm good, solid, wherever that came from
I'm doin' really solid
I'm doin' really solid
Yeah
Alright, banter, banter, banter
I really wanted to have strings for this song
Because this one
Just means a lot to me
Off the album
And we weren't gonna be able to travel with strings
So we sent these guys sheet music
And this is actually our first time
We just played it together for the first time
Like 20 minutes ago, so
Thank you guys
It's a beautiful thing, man
Music is a beautiful thing
Alright

It's beautiful
