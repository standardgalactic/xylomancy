That's not even a question for me,
whether we're going to go take a swing at building the next thing.
I'm just incapable of not doing that.
There's a bunch of times when we wanted to launch features
and then Apple's just like, nope, you're not launching that.
It's like, that sucks.
Are we set up for that with AI,
where you're going to get a handful of companies
that run these closed models that are going to be in control of the APIs
and therefore are going to be able to tell you what you can build?
Then when you start getting into building a data center
that's like 300 megawatts or 500 megawatts or a gigawatt,
just no one has built a single gigawatt data center yet.
From wherever you sit, there's going to be some actor who you don't trust.
If they're the ones who have like the super strong AI,
I think that that's potentially a much bigger risk.
Mark, welcome to the podcast.
Okay, thanks for having me.
Big fan of your podcast.
Oh, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.
Okay, so let's start by talking about the releases that will go out
when this interview goes out.
Tell me about the models.
Tell me about meta AI.
What's new? What's exciting about them?
Yeah, sure.
So I think the main thing that most people in the world
are going to see is the new version of meta AI.
And the most important thing about what we're doing
is the upgrade to the model.
We're rolling out Lama 3.
We're doing it both as open source for the dev community
and it is now going to be powering meta AI.
So there's a lot that I'm sure we'll go into around Lama 3,
but I think the bottom line on this is that with Lama 3,
we now think that meta AI is the most intelligent AI assistant
that people can use that's freely available.
We're also integrating Google and Bing for real-time knowledge.
We're going to make it a lot more prominent across our apps.
So basically, at the top of WhatsApp and Instagram
and Facebook and Messenger, you'll just be able to use the search box
right there to ask it any question.
And there's a bunch of new creation features that we added
that I think are pretty cool that I think people enjoy.
And I think animations is a good one.
You can basically just take any image and animate it.
But I think one that people are going to find pretty wild
is it now generates high-quality images so quickly.
I don't know if you've gotten a chance to play with this,
that it actually generates it as you're typing
and updates it in real-time.
So you're typing your query and it's honing in on...
And it's like, okay, here, show me a picture of a cow
in a field with mountains in the background.
Eating macadamia nuts?
Yeah, eating macadamia nuts, drinking beer.
And it's updating the image in real-time.
It's pretty wild.
I think people are going to enjoy that.
So yeah, that's what most people are going to see in the world.
We're rolling that out not everywhere,
but we're starting in a handful of countries
and we'll do more over the coming weeks and months.
So that, I think, is going to be a pretty big deal.
And I'm really excited to get that in people's hands.
It's a big step forward for Met AI.
But I think if you want to get under the hood a bit,
the Llama 3 stuff is obviously the most technically interesting.
So we're basically, for the first version,
we're training three versions, an eight billion
and a 70 billion, which we're releasing today,
and a 405 billion dense model, which is still training.
So we're not releasing that today.
But the eight and 70, I mean, I'm pretty excited about how they turned out.
I mean, they're leading for their scale.
You know, it's, I mean, we'll release a blog post
with all the benchmarks so people can check it out themselves.
And obviously it's open source so people get a chance to play with it.
We have a roadmap of new releases coming
that are going to bring multi-modality, more multi-linguality,
bigger context windows to those as well.
And then, you know, hopefully sometime later in the year,
we'll get to roll out the 405, which I think is,
you know, in training, it's still training,
but for where it is right now in training,
it is already at around 85 mmlu.
And just, we expect that it's going to have leading benchmarks
on a bunch of the benchmarks.
So I'm pretty excited about all of that.
I mean, the 70 billion is great too.
I mean, we're releasing that today.
It's around 82 mmlu and has leading scores on math and reasoning.
So I mean, it's, I think just getting this in people's hands is going to be pretty wild.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah, that's the first time hearing this benchmark.
That's super impressive.
Yeah, and the 8 billion is nearly as powerful
as the biggest version of Llama 2 that we released.
So it's like the smallest Llama 3 is basically as powerful as the biggest Llama 2.
Okay, so before we dig into these models,
I actually want to go back in time.
2022 is, I'm assuming, when you started acquiring these H100s,
or you can tell me when, where you're like stock prices getting hammered,
people are like, what's happening with all this capex?
People aren't buying the metaverse.
And presumably you're spending that capex to get these H100s.
How, back then, how did you know to get the H100s?
How did you know we'll need the GPUs?
I think it was because we were working on reels.
So, you know, we got into this situation where, you know, we always want to have enough capacity
to build something that we can't quite see that were on the horizon yet.
And we got into this position with reels where we needed more GPUs to train the models, right?
It was this big evolution for our services where instead of just ranking content from people who
you follow, or your friends and whatever pages you follow, we made this big push to basically
start recommending what we call unconnected content.
It basically connected content from people or pages that you're not following.
So now kind of the corpus of kind of content candidates that we could potentially show you
expanded from, you know, on the order of thousands to on the order of hundreds of millions.
So, completely different infrastructure.
And we started working on doing that and we were constrained on basically the infrastructure
that we had to catch up to what TikTok was doing as quickly as we would have wanted to.
So, I basically looked at that and I was like, hey, we have to make sure that we're never in
this situation again. So, let's order enough GPUs to do what we need to do on reels and ranking
content and feed, but let's also double that, right? Because again, like our normal principle is
there's going to be something on the horizon that we can't see yet.
Did you know it would be AI?
Well, we thought it would be, we thought it was going to be something that had to do with
training large models, right? I mean, but at the time, I thought it was probably going to be
more something that I had to do with content, but I don't know. I mean, it's almost just
the pattern matching and running the company is there's always another thing, right?
I'm not even sure I had, at that time, I was so deep in just trying to get the recommendations
working for reels and other content, because I mean, that's just such a big unlock for
Instagram and Facebook to now being able to show people content that's interesting to them that
they're from people that they're not even following. But yeah, that ended up being a
very good decision in retrospect. But it came from being behind. So then it wasn't like I was,
you know, it wasn't like, oh, I was so far ahead. Actually, most of the times, I think, where we
kind of make some decision that ends up seeming good is because we messed something up before
and just didn't want to repeat the mistake. This is a total detour, but I actually want to ask
about this while we're on this. We'll get back to you and AI in a second. So you didn't suffer
one billion, but presumably there's some amount you would have sold for, right? Did you write down
in your head, like, I think the actual valuation of Facebook at the time is this and they're not
actually getting the valuation right? Like the average $5 trillion, of course, you would have
sold. So like, how did you think about that choice? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, look,
I think some of these things are just personal. I don't know at the time that I was sophisticated
enough to do that analysis. But I had all these people around me who were making all these arguments
for how like a billion dollars was, you know, it's like, here's the revenue that we need to make,
and here's how big we need to be. And like, it's clearly so many years in the future. Like,
and it was, it was very far ahead of where we were at the time. And I don't know, I didn't, I didn't
really have the financial sophistication to really even engage with that kind of debate. I just,
I think I sort of deep down believed in what we were doing. And I did some analysis. I was like,
okay, well, what would I go do if I wasn't doing this? It's like, well, I really like building
things. And I like helping people communicate. And I like understanding what's going on with people
and the dynamics between people. So I think if I sold this company, I'd just go build another
company like this. And I kind of like the one I have. So, so I mean, you know, what's why, why,
right? But I don't know, I think a lot of the biggest bets that people make
are often just based on conviction and values. Not, it's actually usually very hard to do the
analyses, trying to connect the dots forward. Yeah. So you've had Facebook AI research for a
long time. Now it's become seemingly central to your company. At what point did making AGI or
whatever, however you consider that mission? At what point is that like, this is a creek
priority of what Meta is doing? Yeah, I mean, it's been a big deal for a while. So we started
fair about 10 years ago. And the idea was that along the way to general intelligence or AI,
like full AI, whatever you want to call it, there can be all these different innovations.
And that's going to just improve everything that we do. So we didn't kind of conceive it as
a product. It was more kind of a research group. And over the last 10 years, it has created a lot
of different things that have basically improved all of our products and advanced the field and
allowed other people in the field to create things that have improved our products too. So
I think that that's been great. But there's obviously a big change. Yeah. In the last few years,
when ChatGPT comes out, the diffusion models around image creation come out and like,
I mean, this is some pretty wild stuff, right? That I think is like pretty clearly going to
affect how people interact with like every app that's out there. So I, at that point,
we started a second group, the Gen AI group, with the goal of basically bringing that stuff
into our product. So building leading foundation models that would sort of power all these different
products. And initially, when we started doing that, the theory at first was, hey, a lot of the
stuff that we're doing is pretty social, right? So it's helping people interact with creators,
helping people interact with businesses to, you know, so the businesses can sell things or do
customer support or, you know, basic assistant functionality for, you know, whether it's for
apps or the smart glasses or VR, like all these different things. So initially, it wasn't
completely clear that you were going to need kind of full AGI to be able to support those use cases.
But then through working on them, I think it's actually become clear that you do, right? And
all these subtle ways. So for example, you know, for llama two, when we were working on it, we
didn't prioritize coding. And the reason why we didn't prioritize coding is because people aren't
going to ask meta AI a lot of coding questions and WhatsApp. Now they will, right? Well, I don't
know. I'm not sure that WhatsApp is like the UI that people are going to be doing a lot of coding
questions. So like, all right, look, in terms of the things that, you know, or Facebook or Instagram
or, you know, those, those different services, maybe, maybe the website or meta data dot AI that
we're relaunching, I think. But, but the thing that was sort of, I think has been a, you know,
somewhat surprising result over the last 18 months is that it, it turns out that coding
is important for a lot of domains, not just coding, right? So even if people aren't asking
coding questions, the models, training the models on coding helps them just be more rigorous and
answer the question and kind of help reason across a lot of different types of domains.
Okay, so that's one example where it's like, all right, so for llama three, we like really focused
on training it with a lot of coding, because it's like, all right, that's going to make it better
on all these things, even if people aren't answering aren't asking primarily coding questions.
Reasoning I think is another example. It's like, okay, yeah, maybe you want to chat with a creator
or, you know, you're a business and you're trying to interact with a customer. You know,
that interaction is not just like, okay, the person sends you a message and you just reply,
right? It's a, it's like a multi step interaction where you're trying to think through how do I
accomplish the person's goals. And, you know, a lot of times when a customer comes, they don't
necessarily know exactly what they're looking for or how to ask their questions. So it's not
really the job of the AI to just respond to the question. It's like, you need to kind of think
about it more holistically. It's really becomes a reasoning problem, right? So if someone else,
you know, solves reasoning or makes good advances on reasoning, and we're sitting here and with a
basic chat bot, then like our product is lame compared to what other people are building. So
it's like, so okay, so at the end of the day, we've got we, you know, we basically realized
we've got to solve general intelligence. And we just kind of up the ante and the investment to
make sure that we could do that. So the version of llama that that that's going to solve all these
use cases for users, is that the version that will be powerful enough to like replace a programmer
you might have in this building? I mean, I just think that all this stuff is going to be progressive
over time. But in case Lama 10. I mean, I think that there's a lot baked into that question. I'm
not sure that we're replacing people as much as making people tools to do more stuff is a programmer
in this building 10x more productive after a lot more. But but no, I mean, look, I'm not I don't
believe that there's like a single threshold of intelligence for for humanity, because I mean,
people have different skills. And at some point, I think that AI is going to be is probably going
to surpass people at most of those things. I'm depending on how powerful the models are. But
but I think it's progressive. And I don't think a GI is one thing, I think it's, you're basically
adding different capabilities. So multimodality is kind of a key one that we're focused on now,
initially with photos and images and text, but eventually with videos. And then because we're
so focused on the metaverse kind of 3d type stuff is important. One modality that I'm pretty focused
on that I haven't seen as many other people in the industry focus on this is sort of like
emotional understanding, like, I mean, so much of of the human brain is just dedicated to
understanding people. And in kind of like understanding your expressions and emotions,
and I think that that's like its own whole modality, right, that I mean, you could say,
okay, maybe it's just video or image, but it's like clearly a very specialized version of those
two. So there's all these different capabilities that I think you want to basically train the
models to focus on, as well as getting a lot better at reasoning, getting a lot better at memory,
which I think is is kind of its own whole thing. It's I mean, I don't think we're going to be,
you know, primarily shoving context or are kind of things into a query context window
in the future to ask more complicated questions. I think that there will be kind of different
stores of memory or different custom models that that are maybe more personalized to people.
But I know I think that these are all just different capabilities. And then obviously
making them big and small, we care about both because, you know, we want to, you know, if you're
running something like meta AI, then we have the ability to that's pretty server based. But we also
want it running on smart glasses. And, you know, there's not a lot of space in smart glasses. So
you want to have something that's very efficient for that. What is the use case that if you're
doing tens of billions of dollars worth of inference, or even eventually hundreds of billions of
dollars worth of inference, using intelligence and industrial scale, what is the use case? Is it
simulations? Is it the AI's that will be in the metaverse? What will be using the data center
score? I mean, our bet is that it's going to, this is basically going to change all of the
products, right? So I think that there's going to be a kind of meta AI general assistant product.
And I think that that will shift from something that feels more like a chat bot where it's like
you just ask a question that kind of formulates an answer to things where you're increasingly
giving it more complicated tasks and that goes away and does them. So that's going to take a lot
of inference. It's going to take a lot of compute in other ways too. Then I think that there's a
big part of what we're going to do that is like interacting with other agents for other people.
So whether it's businesses or creators, I guess a big part of my theory on this is that
there's not just going to be like one singular AI that you interact with, because I think,
every business is going to like want an AI that represents their interests. They're not going
to like want to primarily interact with you through an AI that is going to sell their
competitors' products. So I think creators is going to be a big one. I mean, there are about
200 million creators on our platforms. They all basically have the pattern where they want to
engage their community, but they're limited by hours in the day and their community generally
wants to engage them, but they don't know they're limited by hours in the day. So if you could create
something where that creator can basically own the AI and train it in the way that they want
and can engage their community, I think that that's going to be super powerful too.
So I think that there's going to be a ton of engagement across all these things.
But these are just the consumer use cases. I mean, I think when you think about stuff like,
I mean, I run like our foundation, right, a Chan Zuckerberg initiative with my wife,
and we're doing a bunch of stuff on science. And there's obviously a lot of AI work that
I think is going to advance science and healthcare and all these things too.
This is, I think, an end up affecting basically every area of the products and the economy.
The thing you mentioned about an AI that can just go out and do something for you that's
multi-step. Is that a bigger model? Is that you'll make like Lama 4? There'll be a version
that's still 70B, but you'll just train it on the right data and that will be super powerful.
What does the progression look like? Is it scaling? Is it just same size, but different banks like
you were talking about? I don't know that we know the answer to that. So I think one thing that
seems to be a pattern is that you have the Lama, sorry, the Lama model, and then you build
some kind of other application-specific code around it, right? So some of it is the fine-tuning
for the use case, but some of it is just like logic for, okay, how Met AI should integrate,
that should work with tools like Google or Bing to bring in real-time knowledge. I mean,
that's not part of the base Lama model. That's part of it. Okay, so for Lama 2, we had some of that,
and it was a little more hand-engineered. And then part of our goal for Lama 3 was to bring
more of that into the model itself. But for Lama 3, as we start getting into more of these
agent-like behaviors, I think some of that is going to be more hand-engineered. And then I think
our goal for Lama 4 will be to bring more of that into the model. So I think at each step
along the way, you kind of have a sense of what's going to be possible on the horizon. You start
messing with it and hacking around it. And then I think that that helps you hone your intuition
for what you want to try to train into the next version of the model itself.
Interesting. Which makes it more general, because obviously anything that you're hand-coding is,
you know, you can unlock some use cases, but it's just inherently brittle and non-general.
Hey, everybody. Real quick, I want to tell you about a tool that I wish more applications used.
So obviously you've noticed every single company is trying to add an AI chatbot to their website.
But as a user, I usually find them really annoying, because they give these long, generic,
often useless answers. Command Bar is a user assistant that you can just embed into your
website or application. And it feels like you're talking to a friendly human support agent who
is browsing with you and for you. And it's much more personalized than a regular chatbot. It can
actually look up user's history and respond differently based on that. It can use APIs to
perform actions. It can even practically nudge users to explore new features.
One thing that I think is really cool is that instead of just outputting text, Command Bar can
kind of just say here, let me show you and start browsing alongside the user. Anyways,
there are a bunch of great products already. You can learn more about them at commandbar.com.
Thanks to them for sponsoring this episode. And now back to Mark.
What do you say into the model itself? You train it on the thing that you want in the model itself,
but what do you mean by into the model itself? Well, I mean, I think the example that I gave
for Llama 2, where for Llama 2, the tool use was very, very specific. Whereas Llama 3 has the
ability to have much better tool use. So we don't have to hand code all the stuff to have it use
Google to go do a search. It just kind of can do that. And similarly for coding and kind of
running code and just a bunch of stuff like that. But I think once you kind of get that capability,
then you get a peek of, okay, well, what can we start doing next? Okay, well, I don't necessarily
want to wait until Llama 4 is around to start building those capabilities. So let's start
hacking around it. And so you do a bunch of hand coding, and that makes the products better
if for the interim, but then that also helps show the way of what we want to try to build
into the next version of the model. What is the community fine tune of Llama 3 you're most excited
by? Maybe not the one that will be most useful to you, but just you'll just enjoy playing it with
the most. They like fine tune it on antiquity, and you'll just be like talking to Virgil or
something. What are you excited about? I don't know. I mean, I think the nature of the stuff is
it's like, you get surprised. So I think any specific thing that I sort of
thought would be valuable, we'd probably be building. But I think you'll get distilled versions.
I think you'll get kind of smaller versions. I mean, one thing that I think is
$8 billion, I don't think is quite small enough for a bunch of use cases. I think over time,
I'd love to get a billion parameter model or a 2 billion parameter model or even like a,
I don't know, maybe like a 500 million parameter model and see what you can do with that. Because
as they start getting, if with 8 billion parameters were basically nearly as powerful as the largest
Llama 2 model, then with a billion parameters, you should be able to do something that's
interesting and faster, good for classification or a lot of kind of like basic things that people do
before kind of understanding the intent of a user query and feeding it to the most powerful model
to kind of hone what the prompt should be. So I don't know. I think that's one thing that maybe
the community can help fill in. But I mean, we'll also, we're also thinking about getting around to
distilling some of these ourselves, but right now the GPUs are training the 405.
Okay. So you have all these GPUs. I think you're saying 350,000 by the end of the year.
That's the whole fleet. I mean, we built two, I think it's like 22, 24,000 clusters that are
kind of the single clusters that we have for training the big models. I mean, obviously across a lot
of the stuff that we do, a lot of our stuff goes towards training like Reels models and
Facebook news feed and Instagram feed. And then inference is a huge thing for us because we serve
a ton of people, right? So our ratio of inference compute required to training is probably much
higher than most other companies that are doing this stuff just because the sheer volume of the
community that we're serving. Yeah. Yeah. That was really interesting in the material they shared
with me before that you trained it on more data than is compute optimal just for training
because the inference is such a big deal for you guys and also for the community
that it makes sense to just have this thing and have trillions of tokens in there.
Yeah. Yeah. Although, and one of the interesting things about it that we saw even with the 70
billion is we thought it would get more saturated at, you know, it's like we trained on around
15 trillion tokens. Yeah. I guess our prediction going in was that it was going to ask them to
it more, but even by the end, it was still learning, right? It's like, we probably could have fed it
more tokens and it would have gotten somewhat better. But I mean, at some point,
you know, you're running a company, you need to do these meta reasoning questions of like,
all right, how do I want to spend our GPUs on like training this 70 billion model further? Do we
want to kind of get on with it so we can start testing hypotheses for Llama 4? So we kind of
needed to make that call. And I think we got it, I think we got to a reasonable balance for this
version of the 70 billion. There will be others in the future where, you know, 70 billion multimodal
one that'll come over the next period. But yeah, I mean, that was fascinating that you could just
that it's the architectures at this point can just take so much data. Yeah, that's really
interesting. So what is this implied by future models? You mentioned that the Llama 3 8B is
better than the Llama 270B? No, no, it's nearly as good. Okay, I don't want to overstep. But does
that mean like the Llama 4? Does that mean like the Llama 470B will be as good as the Llama 3
4 or 5B? This is one of the great questions that I think no one knows is basically,
you know, it's one of the trickiest things in the world to plan around is when you have an
exponential curve, how long does it keep going for? And I think it's likely enough that it will
keep going that it is worth investing the 10s or 100 billion plus in building the infrastructure to
assume that if that kind of keeps going, you're going to get some really amazing
things that are just going to make amazing products. But I don't think anyone in the
industry can really tell you that it will continue scaling at that rate for sure, right?
In general, in history, you hit bottlenecks at certain points. And now there's so much energy
on this that maybe those bottlenecks get knocked over pretty quickly. But I don't know. I think
that that's an interesting question. What does the world look like where there aren't these
bottlenecks? You know, suppose like progress just continues at this pace, which seems plausible,
like zooming out. They're going to be different bottlenecks.
Right. So if not training, then like, oh, yeah, go ahead.
Well, I think at some point, over the last few years, I think there's this issue of GPU production.
Yeah. Right. So even companies that had the models, sorry, that had the money to pay for the GPUs,
couldn't necessarily get as many as they wanted because there were all these supply
constraints. Now, I think that's sort of getting less. So now, I think you're seeing a bunch of
companies think about, wow, we should just like really invest a lot of money in building out
these things. And I think that that will go for some period of time. I think there's a,
there is a capital question of like, okay, at what point does it stop being worth it to put the
capital in? But I actually think before we hit that, you're going to run into energy constraints.
Right. Because I just, I mean, I don't think anyone's built a gigawatt single training cluster yet.
Right. And, and then you run into these things that just end up being slower in the world,
like getting energy permitted is like a very heavily regulated government function. Right.
So you're going from on the one hand software, which is somewhat regulated. I'd argue that it
is more regulated than I think a lot of people in the tech community feel, although it's obviously
different if you're starting a small company, maybe you feel that less if you're a big company,
you know, we just interact with people, but different governments and regulators are, you know,
we have kind of lots of rules that we need to kind of follow and make sure we do a good job
with around the world. But I think that there's no doubt that like energy, and if you're talking
about building large new power plants or large buildouts and then building transmission lines that
cross other private or public land, that is just a heavily regulated thing. So you're talking about
many years of lead time. So if we wanted to stand up to some like massive facility
to power that, I think that that is, that's, that's a very long term project. Right. And
so I don't know, I think that that's, I think people do it, but I don't think that this is like
something that can be quite as magical as just like, okay, you get a level of AI and you get a
bunch of capital and you put it in and then like all of a sudden the models are just going to kind
of like interest, like I think you do hit different bottlenecks along the way.
Yeah. Is there something, a project, maybe I realize that it may be not that even a company
like Meta doesn't have the resources for it. Like if your R&D budget or CapEx budget was 10x what
it is now, then you could pursue it. Like it's in the back of your mind, but Meta today and maybe
you could like even you can't even issue a stock or bond for it. It's like just 10x bigger than
your budget. Well, I think energy is one piece. Yeah. Right. I think we would probably build out
bigger clusters than we currently can if we could get the energy to do it. So I think that that's
that's fundamentally money bottlenecked in the limit. Like if you had a trillion dollars.
I think it's time. Yeah. Right. Well, if you look at it in terms of, but it depends on how
far the exponential curves go. Right. Like I think a number of companies are working on,
you know, right now I think a lot of data centers are on the order of 50 megawatts or 100 megawatts
or like a big one might be 150 megawatts. Okay. So you take a whole data center and you fill it up
with just all the stuff that you need to do for training and you build the biggest cluster you
can. I think you're, that's kind of, I think a bunch of companies are running at stuff like that.
But then when you start getting into building a data center that's like 300 megawatts or 500
megawatts or a gigawatt, I just, I mean, just no one has built a single gigawatt data center yet.
So I think it will happen. Right. I mean, this is only a matter of time, but it's not going to be
next year. Right. It's, I think that some of these things will take, I don't know,
some number of years to build out. And then the question is, okay, well, if you,
I mean, just to, I guess, put this in perspective, I think a gigawatt, it's like around the size of
like a meaningful nuclear power plant only going towards training a model. Didn't Amazon do this?
There's like, they have a 950 gig a megawatt. Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what you did. You
have to, what they did, you'd have to ask them. But it doesn't have to be in the same place, right?
If distributed training works, it can be distributed. That I think is a big question. Yeah.
Right. Is basically how that's going to work. And I do think in the future,
it seems quite possible that more of what we call training for these big models is actually
more along the lines of inference, generating synthetic data to then go feed into the model.
So I don't know what that ratio is going to be, but I consider the generation of synthetic data
to be more inference than training today. But obviously, if you're doing it in order to train
a model, it's, it's part of the broader training process. So I don't know, that's an, that's an
open question is to, to kind of where, what the balance of that and how that plays out.
If that's the case, would that potentially also be the case with Lama three and maybe like Lama
four onwards where you put this out and if somebody has a ton of compute, then using the models that
you've put out, you can just keep making these things arbitrarily smarter, like some Kuwait or
UAE or some random country has a ton of compute. And they can just actually just use Lama four
to just make something much smarter. I do think that there are going to be dynamics like that.
But I also think that there is a fundamental limitation on,
on kind of the network architecture, right, or the, the kind of model architecture, right? So
I think like a 70 billion model that kind of we trained with the Lama three architecture
can get better, right? It can, it can keep going. Like I was saying, it's, you know,
we felt like if we kept on feeding it more data or rotated the high value tokens through again,
then, then, you know, it would continue getting better. But
and we've seen a bunch of other people around the world, you know, different companies basically
take the Lama two 70 billion base, like take that model architecture and then build a new model.
It's still the case that when you make a generational improvement to the kind of Lama
three 70 billion or the Lama three 405, there's nothing open source anything like that today,
right? Like it's, it's not, I think that that's like, it's a big step function and what people
are going to be able to build on top of that I don't think can go infinitely from there. I think
it can, there can be some optimization in that until you get to the next step function.
Yeah. Okay. So let's zoom out a little bit from specific models and even the many years lead times
you would need to get energy approvals and so on, like big picture these next couple of decades.
Sure. What's happening with AI? Is, does it feel like another technology like metaverse or social
or does it feel like a fundamentally different thing in the course of human history?
I think it's going to be pretty fundamental. I think it's going to be more like
the creation of computing in the first place, right? So you'll get all these new apps
in the same way that when you got the web, or you got mobile phones, you got like people basically
rethought all these experiences and a lot of things that weren't possible before now became possible.
Something that will happen, but I think it's a much lower level innovation. It's, it's, it's going
to be more like going from people didn't have computers to people have computers is my, my sense.
But it's also, it's, it's a, I don't know. It's, it's very hard to reason about exactly how this
goes. I tend to think that, you know, in like the cosmic scale, obviously it'll happen quickly over a,
you know, a couple of decades or something. But I do think that there, there is some set of people
who are afraid of like, you know, it really just kind of spins and goes from being like
extremely intelligent overnight. And I just think that there's all these physical constraints that
make that, so that that's unlikely to happen. I just don't, I don't really see that, that playing
out. So I think you'll have, I think we'll have time to kind of acclimate a bit, but it will really
change the way that we work and give people all these creative tools to do different things that
they, yeah, I think, I think it's going to be, it's going to really enable people to do the
things that they want a lot more is, is my view. Okay, so maybe not overnight, but is it your
view that like on a cosmic scale, if you think like humans evolved and then like AI happened and
then they like went out through the galaxy or maybe it takes many decades, maybe it takes a century,
but like, is that like the grand scheme of what's happening right now in history?
Sorry, in what sense? I mean, in the sense that there were other technologies like computers
and even like fire, but like the AI happening is as significant as like humans evolving in the
first place. I think that's tricky. I think people like to, you know, the history of humanity I think
has been people basically, you know, thinking that certain aspects of humanity are like
really unique in different ways. And then coming to grips with the fact that that's not true,
but humanity is actually still super special, right? So it's like we thought that the earth
was the center of the universe. And it's like, it's not, but like, it's like humans are still
pretty awesome, right? And pretty unique. I think that another bias that people tend to have is
thinking that intelligence is somehow kind of fundamentally connected to life. And it's not
actually clear that it is, right? I think like, like people think that I mean, I don't know that we
have a clear enough definition of consciousness or, or life to kind of fully interrogate this, but
I know there's all this science fiction about, okay, you create intelligence and now it like
starts taking on all these human like behaviors and things like that. But I actually think that
the current incarnation of all this stuff at least kind of feels like it's going in a direction where
intelligence can be pretty separated from consciousness and agency and things like that,
that I think just makes it a super valuable tool. So I don't know, I mean, obviously it's, it's,
it's very difficult to predict what direction the stuff goes in over time, which is why I,
I don't think anyone should be dogmatic about, you know, how they plan to develop it or what
they plan to do. I think you want to kind of look at like each release, you know, it's like,
we're obviously very pro open source, but I haven't committed that we're going to like release
every single thing that we do. But it's basically we like, I'm just generally very inclined to
thinking that open sourcing it is going to be good for the community and also good for us,
right? Because we'll benefit from, from the innovations. But if it at some point,
like there's some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it's just
not responsible to open source it, then we won't. But so I don't know, it's, it's, it's all, it's
all very difficult to predict. Yeah. What is a kind of qualitative change like a specific thing,
you're training lamify, lamaphore, and you've seen this and like, you know what, I'm not sure about
open sourcing it. I think that that it's a little hard to answer that in the abstract because
there are negative behaviors that any product can exhibit that as long as you can mitigate it,
it's like, it's okay, right? So I mean, there's bad things about social media that we work to
mitigate, right? There's bad things about llama two that we spend a lot of time trying to make
sure that it's not like, you know, helping people commit violent acts or things like that, right?
I mean, that doesn't mean that it's like a kind of autonomous or intelligent agent, it just means
that it's learned a lot about the world and it can answer a set of questions that we think it
would be unhelpful for it to answer. So I don't know, I think the question isn't really what behaviors
would it show? It's what things would we not be able to mitigate after it shows that and
and I don't know, I think that there's so many ways in which something can be good or bad that
it's hard to actually enumerate them all upfront. If you even look at like, what we've had to deal
with and in, you know, social media and like the different types of harms, we've basically gotten
to it's like, there's like 18 or 19 categories of harmful things that that people do. And we've
basically built AI systems to try to go identify what those things are that people are doing and
try to make sure that that, you know, doesn't happen on our network as much as possible. So
yeah, I think you can over time, I think you'll be able to break down
this into more of a taxonomy too. And I think this is a thing that we spend time researching too,
because we want to make sure that we understand that. So one of the things I asked Mark is what
industrial scale use of LLMs would look like? You see this in previous technological revolutions,
where at first they're thinking in a very small scale way about what's enabled. And I think that's
what chatbots might be for LLMs. And I think the large scale use case might look something like
what v seven go is. And by the way, it's made by v seven labs who's sponsoring this episode. So
it's like a spreadsheet, you put in raw information, like documents, images, whatever,
and they become rows, and the columns are populated by an LLM of your choice. And in fact,
I used it to prepare for Mark. So I fed in a bunch of blog posts and papers from Metas AI Research.
And as you can see, if you're on YouTube, it summarizes and extracts exactly the information
I want as columns. And obviously mine is a small use case, we can imagine, for example,
a company like FedEx has to process half a million documents a day. Obviously a chatbot can't do that.
A spreadsheet can because this is just like a fire hose of intelligence in there, right?
Anyways, you can learn more about them at v seven labs.com slash go or the link in the description.
Back to Mark. Yeah, like, it seems to me it would be a good idea. I would be disappointed
in a future where AI systems aren't broadly deployed and everybody doesn't have access to them.
At the same time, I want to better understand the mitigations. Because if the mitigation is
the fine tuning, well, the whole thing about open weights is that you can then remove the fine
tuning, which is often superficial on top of these capabilities. If it's like talking on Slack
with a biology researcher, and again, I think models are very far from this, right now they're
like Google search. But I can show them my petri disk and they can next lane, here's why you're
a smallpox sample didn't grow, here's what to change. How do you mitigate that? Because
somebody can just fine tune that in there, right? Yeah, I mean, that's true. I think a lot of people
will basically use the off the shelf model. And some people who have basically bad faith are going
to try to strip out all the bad stuff. So I do think that that's an issue. The flip side of this
is that and this is one of the reasons why I'm kind of philosophically so pro open source
is I do think that a concentration of AI in the future has the potential to be as dangerous
as kind of it being widespread. So I think a lot of people are they think about the questions of,
okay, well, if we can do this stuff, is it bad for it to be out wild, like just in kind of widely
available? I think another version of this is like, okay, well, it's probably also pretty bad
for one institution to have an AI that is way more powerful than everyone else's AI.
So if you look at like, I guess one security analogy that I think of is,
you know, it doesn't take AI to basically, okay, there's security holes and so many different
things. And if you could travel back in time a year or two years, right, it's like, that's not AI,
it's like you just let's say you just have like one year or two years more knowledge of the security
holes, pretty much hack into like any system, right? So it's not that farfetched to believe
that a very intelligent AI would probably be able to identify some holes and basically be like a
human who could potentially go back in time a year or two and compromise all these systems. Okay,
so how have we dealt with that as a society? Well, one big part is open source software
that makes it so that when improvements are made to the software, it doesn't just kind of get stuck
in one company's products, but it can kind of be broadly deployed to a lot of different systems,
whether it's banks or hospitals or government stuff. And like just everyone can kind of,
like as the software gets hardened, which happens because more people can see it and more people
can bang on it. And there are standards on how this stuff works. The world can kind of get
upgraded together pretty quickly. And I kind of think that a world where AI is very widely deployed
in a way where it's gotten hardened progressively over time. And is one where all the different
systems will be in check in a way that seems like it is fundamentally more healthy to me
than one where this is more concentrated. So there are risks on all sides, but I know that
that's one risk that I think people, I don't hear them talking about quite as much. I think like
there's sort of the risk of like, okay, well, what if the AI system does something bad? I
am more like, you know, I stay up at night more worrying, well, what if like,
some actor that, whatever, it's like, from wherever you sit, there's going to be some actor who you
don't trust. If they're the ones who have like the super strong AI, whether it's some like other
government that we that does sort of like an opponent of our country or some company that
you don't trust or whatever it is. Like, I think that that's potentially a much bigger risk.
As in they could like overthrow our government because they have a weapon that like nobody else
has caused a lot of mayhem, right? It's I think it's like, I mean, I think the intuition is that
this stuff ends up being pretty kind of important and, and invaluable for both kind of economic and
kind of security and other things. And I don't know, I just think, yeah, if like, if someone who
you don't trust or is an adversary of you, gets something that is more powerful, then
I think that that could be an issue. And I think the probably the best way to mitigate that
is to have good open source AI that basically becomes the standard. And in a lot of ways,
kind of can become the leader. And in that way, it just ensures that it's a much more kind of
even and balanced playing field. Yeah, that seems plausible to me. And if that works out,
that would be the future I prefer. I guess I want to understand like mechanistically how if somebody
was going to cause mayhem with AI systems, how the fact that there are other open source systems
in the world prevents that like the specific example of like somebody coming with a bio weapon.
Is it just that we'll do a bunch of like R&D in the rest of the world to like figure out vaccines
really fast? Like what's happening? Let me take like the computer, the security one that I was
talking about. I think someone with a weaker AI trying to hack into a system that is like
protected by a stronger AI will succeed less. Right. So, so I think that that's I mean, that's
like in terms of how do you know everything in the world is like that? Like what if bio weapons
aren't like that? No, I mean, I don't know that everything in the world is like that.
I think that that's I guess one of the bio weapons are one of the areas where I think
the people who are most worried about this stuff are focused and and I think that that's
I think that makes a lot of sense to think about that.
The I think that there are certain mitigations. You can try to not train certain knowledge into
the model, right? There's different things. But yeah, I mean, it's some level.
I mean, if you get a sufficiently bad actor and you don't have other AI that can sort of balance
them and understand what's going on and what the threats are, then then that could be a risk.
So I think that that's one of the things that we need to watch out for.
Is there something you could see in the deployment of these systems where
you you observe like you're training Lama 4 and it's like lied to you because you thought you
weren't noticing or something and you're like, whoa, what's going on here? Not that you this is
probably not likely with the Lama Forty system. But is there something you can imagine like that
where you'd like be really concerned about deceptiveness and if like billions of copies
of things are out in the wild? Yeah, I mean, I think that that's not necessarily I mean,
right now it's we see a lot of hallucinations, right? So it's more more that I think it's an
interesting question how you would tell the difference between a hallucination and deception.
But yeah, I mean, look, I mean, I think there's a lot of risks and things to think about the
the flip side of all this is that there are also a lot of I try to in running our company,
at least balance what I think of as these longer term theoretical risks
with what I actually think are quite real risks that exist today. So like when you talk about
deception, the form of that that I worry about most is people using this to generate misinformation
and then like pump that through whether it's our networks or others. So the way that we've basically
combated a lot of this type of harmful content is by building AI systems that are smarter than
the adversarial ones. And I use this as part of this kind of informs part of my theory on this,
right, is if you look at like the different types of harm that people do or try to do through
through social networks. There are ones that are not very adversarial. So for example,
like hate speech, I would say is not super adversarial in the sense that like,
people aren't getting better at being racist, right? They're just like, it's you just like,
okay, if you kind of that's one where I think the AIs are generally just getting way more
sophisticated faster than people are at those issues. So we have and we have issues both ways.
It's like, people do bad things that whether they're trying to incite violence or something.
But we also have a lot of false positives, right? So where we basically censor stuff that we
shouldn't and I think understandably make a lot of people annoyed. So I think having an AI that
just gets increasingly precise on that, that's going to be good over time. But let me give you
another example, which is like nation states trying to interfere in elections. That's an example
where they're absolutely they have cutting edge technology and absolutely get better each year.
So we block some technique, they learn what we did, they come at us with a different technique,
right? It's not like a person trying to, you know, I don't say, say mean things, right? It's like,
it's, it's they're, they're basically they have a goal, they're sophisticated, they have a lot of
technology. In those cases, I still think the ability to kind of have RAI systems grow and in
sophistication at a faster rate than theirs have, it's an arms race, but I think we're at least
currently winning that arms race. So I don't know, I think that that's, but this is like a lot of
the stuff that I that I spend time thinking about is like, okay, yes, it is possible that
whether it's llama four or llama five or llama six, yeah, we need to think about like what behaviors
were we're observing. And it's not just us as part of the reason why you make this open source is
that there are a lot of other people who study this too. So yeah, we want to see what other
people are observing, what we're observing, what we can mitigate. And then we'll make our assessment
on whether we can make it open source. But I think for the foreseeable future, I'm optimistic,
we will be able to. And in the near term, I don't want to take our eye off the ball of what are
actual bad things that people are trying to use the models for today, even if they're not existential,
but they're like, they're like, pretty bad kind of day to day harms that we're familiar with and
running our services. That's actually a lot of what we have to, I think, spend our time on as well.
Actually, I found the synthetic data thing really curious. I'm actually interested in why you don't
think like current models, it makes sense why there might be an asymptote with just doing the
synthetic data again and again, if they get smarter and use the kind of techniques you talk about
in the paper or the blog post that's coming out on the day this will be released, where it goes to
the thought chain that is the most correct, why this wouldn't like lead to a loop that, of course,
it wouldn't be overnight, but over many months or years of training potentially with a smarter
model, it gets smarter or makes better output gets smarter and so forth. Well, I think it could
within the parameter of whatever the model architecture is, it's just that like at some level,
I don't know, I think like today is 8 billion parameter models. I just don't think you're
going to be able to get to be as good as the state of the art multi 100 billion parameter models
that are incorporating new research into the architecture itself. But those will be open
source as well, right? Well, yeah, but I think that that's if I mean, subject to all the questions
that we just talked about, yes, I mean, we would hope that that'll be the case. But I think that at
each point, I don't know, it's like, when you're building software, there's like a ton of stuff
that you can do with software. But then at some level, you're constrained by the chips that it's
running on, right? So there are always going to be different physical constraints. And it's like,
how big are the models is going to be constrained by how much energy you can get and and use for
inference. So I guess I'm simultaneously very optimistic that this stuff will continue to
improve quickly. And also a little more measured than I think some people are about.
Kind of it's, I just don't think the runaway case is like a particularly likely one.
I think it makes sense to keep your options open. Like there's so much we don't know.
There's a case in which like it's really important to keep the balance of power. So when
nobody becomes like a title or a dictator, there's a case in which like, you don't want to open
the architecture because like China can use it to catch up to America's AIs and like there is an
intelligence explosion and they like win that. A lot of things are impossible, just like keeping
your options open, considering all of them seems reasonable. Let's talk about some other things.
Metaverse, what time period in human history would you be most interested in going into?
A 100,000 BCE to now. You just want to see what it was like.
Through the past? I don't know. I mean, I have the periods of time that I'm
interested, I mean, I'm really interested in American history and classical history and
I'm really interested in the history of science too. So I actually think seeing
and trying to understand more about how some of the big advances came about. I mean, all we have
are like somewhat limited writings about some of that stuff. I'm not sure the metaverse is going
to let you do that because I mean, it's going to be hard to kind of go back in time for things
that we don't have records of, but I'm actually not sure that going back in time is going to be
that important thing for them. I mean, I think it's going to be cool for like history classes
and stuff, but that's probably not the use case that I'm most excited about for the metaverse
overall. I mean, the main thing is just the ability to feel present with people no matter
where you are. I think that that's going to be killer. I mean, there's, I mean, in the AI
conversation that we were having, I mean, it's so much of it is about physical constraints
that kind of underlie all of this, right? And you want to move, I mean, one lesson of technology
is you want to move things from the physical constraint realm into software as much as possible
because software is so much easier to build and evolve. And like, you can democratize it more
because like not everyone is going to have a data center, but like a lot of people can kind of
write code and take open source code and modify it. The metaverse version of this
is I think enabling realistic digital presence is going to be just an absolutely huge difference
for making it so that people don't feel like they have to physically be together for as many
things. Now, I mean, I think that there are going to be things that are better about being physically
together. So it's not, I mean, these things aren't binary, it's not going to be like, okay, now it's,
you don't need to do that anymore. But overall, I mean, I think that this, it's just going to be
really powerful for socializing, for feeling connected with people, for working, for, I don't
know, parts of industry, for medicine, for like so many things. I want to go back to something
you said at the beginning of the conversation where you didn't sell the company for a billion
dollars and like the metaverse, you knew we were going to do this even though the market was hammering
you for it. And then I'm actually curious, like, what is the source of that edge? And you said,
like, oh, values, I have this intuition, but like, everybody says that, right? Like, if you had to
say something that's specific to you, what is, how would you express what that is? Like, why were
you so convinced about the metaverse? Well, I think that those are different questions. So what,
I mean, what, what are the things that, that kind of power me? I think we've talked about a bunch
of things. So it's, I mean, I, I just really like building things. I specifically like building
things around how people communicate and sort of understanding how people express themselves
and how people work, right? And when I was in college, I was, I was, I studied computer science
and psychology, like a lot of other people in the industry, so I studied computer science, right?
So it's, it's always been sort of the intersection of those two things for me. But
I think it's also sort of this like really deep drive. I don't know how to explain it, but I just
feel like in the constitutionally, like I'm doing something wrong, if I'm not building something
new, right? And so I think that there's like, you know, even when we're putting together the business
case for, you know, investing like $100 billion in AI, or some huge amount in the metaverse,
it's like, yeah, I mean, we have plans that I think make it pretty clear that if our stuff
works, it'll be a good investment. But like, you can't know for certain from the outset.
And there's all these arguments that people have, you know, whether it's like,
you know, with advisors or, or different folks, it's like, well, how, how could you,
like, it's how are you confident enough to do this? And it's like, well,
the day I stop trying to build new things, I'm just done, I'm going to go build new things
somewhere else, right? It's like, it's like, it is, I'm fundamentally incapable of
running something, or in my own life, and like, not trying to build new things that I think are
interesting. It's like, that's not even a question for me, right? It's like, whether, like, whether
we're going to go take a swing at like building the next thing. It's like, it's like, I'm, I'm
just incapable of not doing that. And I don't know. And I'm kind of like this in like, all the
different aspects of my life, right? It's like, we built this like, family built this ranch in
Kauai, and like, I just like, worked like design all these buildings, I'm like, kind of trying to,
like, we started raising cattle. And I'm like, all right, well, I want to make like the best
cattle in the world, right? So it's like, how do we, like, how do we architect this so that way
we can figure this out and like, and build and call the stuff up that we need to try to do that?
So I don't know. That's me. What was the other part of the question?
Look, Metta is just a really amazing tech company, right? They have all these great
software engineers, and even they work with Stripe to handle payments. And I think that's
just a really notable fact that Stripe's ability to engineer these checkout experiences is so good
that big companies like Ford, Zoom, Metta, even OpenAI, they work with Stripe to handle payments.
Because just think about how many different possibilities you have to handle. If you're
in a different country, you'll pay a different way. And if you're buying a certain kind of item,
that might affect how you decide to pay. And Stripe is able to test these fine-grained optimizations
across tens of billions of transactions a day to figure out what will convert people. And obviously,
conversion means more revenue for you. And look, I'm not a big company like Metta or anything,
but I've been using Stripe since long before they were advertisers. Stripe Atlas was just the easiest
way for me to set up an LLC. And they have these payments and invoicing features that make it
super convenient for me to get money from advertisers. And obviously, without that,
it would have been much harder for me to earn money from the podcast. And so it's been great for me.
Go to stripe.com to learn more. Thanks to them for sponsoring the episode. Now back to Mark.
I'm not sure about that. I'm actually curious about something else, which is
so the 19-year-old Mark reads a bunch of like antiquity in classics, high school, college.
What important lesson did you learn from it? Not just interesting things you found, but like,
there aren't that many tokens you consume by the time you're 19. A bunch of them were about the
classics. Clearly, that was important in some way.
Tokens you consume. I don't know. That's a good question. I mean,
one of the things that I thought was really fascinating is, so when Augustus was first,
so he became emperor, and he was trying to establish peace. And there was no real conception
of peace at the time. Like the people's understanding of peace was it is the temporary
time between when your enemies will inevitably attack you again, so you get like a short rest.
And he had this view, which is like, look, we want to change the economy
from instead of being so mercenary and kind of militaristic to actually this positive something.
It's like a very novel idea at the time. I don't know. I think that there's something that's
just really fundamental about that. It's like in terms of the bounds on what people can conceive
at the time of what are rational ways to work. And going back to, this applies to both the
Metaverse and the AI stuff, but a lot of investors and just different people just can't wrap their
head around why we would open source this. And it's like, I don't understand. It's like open
source. That must just be like the temporary time between which you're making things proprietary.
But I actually think it's like this very profound thing in tech that has actually,
it creates a lot of winners. And so I don't want to strain the analogy too much, but I do think
that there's a lot of times I think ways where you can, that are just like models for building
things that people can't even like, they just like often can't wrap their head around how that would
be a valuable thing for people to go do or like a reasonable state of the world that it's, I mean,
it's, I think that there's more reasonable things than people think. That's super fascinating.
Can I give you my answer? What I was thinking, you might have gotten from it. This is probably
totally off, but just how young some of these people are who have very important roles in the
empire. Like Caesar Augustus, by the time he's 19, he's actually incredibly one of the most
prominent people in Roman politics. And he's like leading battles and forming the second
triumvirate. I wonder if you're like the 19 year old is like, I can actually do this because like
I think that's an interesting example, both from a lot of history and American history.
I mean, it's one of my favorite quotes. It's this Picasso quote that all children are artists and
the challenge is how do you remain an artist when you grow up? And it's like, basically,
I think because when you're younger, I think it's just easier to have kind of wild ideas and you're
not, you know, you have no, there are all these analogies to the innovators dilemma that exist
in your life as well as your company or whatever you built, right? So, you know, you're kind of
earlier on your trajectory, it's easier to pivot and take in new ideas without it disrupting other
commitments that you've made to different things. And so I don't know, I think that's an interesting
part of running a company is like, how do you kind of stay dynamic? Going back to the investors
in open source, the $10 billion model, suppose it's totally safe, you've done these evaluations
and unlike in this case, the evaluators can also fine tune the model, which hopefully will be the
case in future models. Would you open source set the $10 billion model? Well, I mean, as long as
it's helping us, then yeah, but would it like to $10 billion of R&D and then now it's like open source?
Well, I think here's, I think a question, which we'll have to evaluate this as time goes on too.
But we have a long history of open sourcing software, right? We don't tend to open source our
product, right? So it's not like we take, we don't take like the code for Instagram and make it
open source, but we take like a lot of the low level infrastructure. And we make that open source,
right? The, the probably the biggest one in our history was open compute project where we took
the designs for kind of all of our servers and network switches and data centers and made it
open source and ended up being super helpful because, you know, I mean, a lot of people can
design servers, but now like the industry standardized on our design, which meant that the
supply chains basically all got built out around our design, the volumes went up. So it got cheaper
for everyone and saved us billions of dollars. So awesome, right? Okay. So there's multiple ways
where open source I think could be helpful for us. One is if people figure out how to run the
models more cheaply, well, we're going to be spending tens or like a hundred billion dollars
or more over time on all this stuff. So if we can do that 10% more effectively, we're saving
billions or tens of billions of dollars. Okay, that's probably worth a lot by itself.
Especially if there's other competitive models out there, it's not like our thing is like
be giving away some kind of crazy advantage. So is there a view that the trading will be commodified?
I think there's a bunch of ways that this could play out. That's one. The the other is
is that. So commodity kind of implies that it's going to get very cheap because there's lots of
options. The other direction that this could go in is qualitative improvements. So you mentioned
fine tuning, right? It's like right now it's pretty limited what you can do with fine tuning
major other models out there. And there are some options, but generally not for the biggest models.
So I think being able to do that and and be able to kind of do different app specific things or
use case specific things or build them into specific tool chains. I think we'll not only enable
kind of more efficient development, it could enable qualitatively different things.
Here's one analogy on this is so one thing that I think generally sucks about the mobile ecosystem
is that like you have these two gatekeeper companies, Apple and Google that can tell you
what you're allowed to build. And there are lots of times in our history. So there's the economic
version of that, which is like, all right, we build something in there just like I'm going to take a
bunch of your money. But then there's the there's the the qualitative version, which is actually what
kind of upsets me more, which is there's a bunch of times when we've launched or wanted to launch
features. And then Apple's just like, Nope, you're not launching that. It's like, that sucks.
Right. And so the question is, what is like, are we kind of set up for a world
like that with AI, where like, you're going to get a handful of companies that run these closed
models that are going to be in control of the API is and therefore going to be able to tell you
what you can build. Well, for one, I can say, for us, it is worth it to go build a model ourselves
to make sure that we're not in that position, right? Like, I don't want any of those other
companies telling us what we can build. But from an open source perspective, I think a lot of
developers don't want those companies telling them what they can build either. So the question is,
what is the ecosystem that gets built out around that? What are interesting new things? How much
does that improve our products? I know there's a lot of cases where if this ends up being like,
you know, like our databases or caching systems or architecture, we'll get valuable contributions
from the community that'll make our stuff better. And then our app specific work that we do will
still be so differentiated that it won't really matter, right? It's like, well, we'll be able to
do what we do, we'll benefit in all the systems ours and the communities will be better because
it's open source. There is one world where maybe it's not that I mean, maybe the model just ends
up being more of the product itself. In that case, then I think it's, it's a trickier economic
calculation about whether you open source that because then you are kind of commoditizing yourself
a lot. But I don't, from what I can see so far, it doesn't seem like we're in that zone.
Do you expect to earn significant revenue from licensing your model to the cloud providers? So
they have to pay you a fee to actually serve the model? We want to have an arrangement like that,
but I don't know how significant it'll be. And we have this, this is basically our license for
Lama. Yeah. You know, in a lot of ways, it's, it's like a very permissive open source license,
except that we have a limit for the largest companies using it. And this is why we put
that limit in is we're not trying to prevent them from using it. We just want them to come
talk to us because if they're going to just basically take what we built and resell it and
make money off of it, then it's like, okay, well, if you're like, you know, Microsoft Azure or Amazon,
then yeah, if you're going to reselling the model, then we should have some revenue share on that.
So just come talk to us before you go do that. And that's how that's played out. So for Lama
2, it's, I mean, we basically just have deals with all these major cloud companies and Lama
2 is available as a hosted service on all those clouds. And I assume that as we, as we release
bigger and bigger models, that'll become a bigger thing. It's not the main thing that we're doing,
but I just think if others are, if those companies are going to be selling our models,
it makes sense that we should, you know, share the upside of that somehow.
Yeah. With regards to the other open source dangers, I think I have like genuine legitimate
points about the balance of power stuff. And potentially like the harms you can get rid of
because we have better alignment techniques or something. I wish there was some sort of
framework that Meta had like other labs have this where they say like, if we see this is a concrete
thing, then that's a no-go on the open source or like even potentially on deployment.
Just like writing it down. So like the company is ready for it. People have expectations around
it and so forth. Yeah. No, I think that that's a fair point on the existential risk side. Right
now we focus more on the types of risks that we see today, which are more of these content risks.
So, you know, we have lines on, we don't want the model to be basically doing things that
are helping people commit violence or fraud or, you know, just harming people in different ways. So
in practice for today's models, and I would guess the next generation and maybe even the
generation after that, I think while it is somewhat more maybe intellectually interesting
to talk about the existential risks, I actually think the real harms that need more energy being
mitigated are things that are going to like have someone take a model and do something to hurt a
person with today's parameters and kind of the types of kind of more mundane harms that we see
today, like people kind of committing fraud against each other or things like that. So
that, I just don't want to shortchange that. I think we have a responsibility to make sure we
do a good job on that. Yeah. Meta's a big company. You can handle both. Yeah.
Okay. So as far as the open source goes, I'm actually curious if you think the impact of the
open source from PyTorch, React, open compute, these things has been bigger for the world than
even the social media aspects of Meta. Because I've like talked to people who use these services
who think like it's plausible, because a big part of the internet runs on these things.
It's an interesting question. I mean, I think almost half the world uses our...
Yeah. So I think it's hard to beat that. But
no, I think open sources, it's really powerful as a new way of building things. And
yeah, I mean, it's possible. I mean, it's maybe one of these things where
I don't know, like Bell Labs, where they, it's like they were working on
the transistor because they wanted to enable long distance calling. And they did. And it ended up
being really profitable for them that they were able to enable long distance calling. And if you
ask them five to 10 years out from that, what was the most useful thing that they invented?
It's like, okay, will we enable long distance calling? And now all these people are long
distance calling. But if you ask 100 years later, maybe it's a different question. So
I think that that's true of a lot of the things that we're building, right? Reality Labs,
some of the AI stuff, some of the open source stuff, I think it's like
the specific products evolve and to some degree come and go. But I think like the advances for
humanity persist. And that's like a, I don't know, a cool part of what we all get to do.
By when will the Lama models be trained on your own custom silicon?
Soon. Not Lama 4. The approach that we took is first we basically built custom silicon that
could handle inference for our ranking and recommendation type stuff. So reels, news feed,
ads. And that was consuming a lot of GPUs. But when we were able to move that to our own silicon,
we now were able to use the more expensive Nvidia GPUs only for training. So
at some point, we will hopefully have silicon ourselves that we can be using for probably
first training some of the simpler things that eventually training these like really large models.
But in the meantime, I'd say the program is going quite well, and we're just rolling it out
methodically and have a long-term roadmap for it. Final question. This is sort of the
out of left field. But if you were made CEO of Google plus, could you have made it work?
Google plus? Oof. Well, I don't know. I don't know. That's a very difficult,
very difficult counterfactual. Okay, then the real final question will be when Gemini was
launched, did you, was there any chance that somebody in the office uttered Carthage Delinda est?
No, I think we're tamer now. Google. Yeah, I don't know. It's a good question. I don't know.
The problem is there was no CEO of Google plus. It was just like a division within a company.
I think it's like, and you asked before about what are the kind of scarcest commodities,
but you asked about it in terms of dollars. And I actually think for most companies,
it's, it's of this scale, at least it's focus, right? It's like when you're a startup, maybe
you're more constrained on capital. You know, you just are working on one idea and you might
not have all the resources. I think you cross some threshold at some point where
the nature of what you're doing, you're building multiple things and you're
creating more value across them, but you become more constrained on what can you direct and
to go well. And like, there's always the cases where something just random awesome happens in
the organization. I don't even know about it. And those are, that's great. But like, but I think in
general, the organization's capacity is largely limited by what like the CEO and the, and the
management team are able to kind of oversee and kind of manage. It's, I think that that's just been
a big focus for us. It's like, all right, keep the, as I guess Ben Horowitz says, keep the main
thing, the main thing, right? And, and try to kind of stay focused on your key priorities.
Yeah. All right. Awesome. That was excellent, Mark. Thanks so much. That was a lot of fun.
Yeah. Really fun. Thanks for having me. Absolutely. Hey, everybody. I hope you enjoyed that episode
