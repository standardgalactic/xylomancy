I challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot
surpass human performance. It looks like on the surface, it
cannot. It looks on the surface, if you just learn to
imitate, to predict what people do, it means that you can only
copy people. But the here is a counter argument for why it might
not be quite so if your neural net is, if your base neural net
is smart enough, you just ask it like, what would I what would
a person with like great insight and wisdom and
capability do? Maybe such a person doesn't exist. But there's
a pretty good chance that the neural net will be able to
extrapolate how such a person would behave. Do you see what I
mean?
Yes, although where would it get the sort of insight about
what that person would do? If not from from the data of
regular people? Because like, if you think about it, what does
it mean to predict the next token well enough? What does it
mean? Actually, it's actually it's a much it's a deeper
question than it seems. Predicting the next token well
means that you understand the underlying reality that led to
the creation of that token. It's not statistics like it is
statistics, but what is statistics? In order to
understand those statistics to compress them, you need to
understand what is it about the world that creates this those
statistics. And so then you say, Okay, well, I have all those
people, what is it about people that creates their behaviors?
Well, they have, you know, they have thoughts and they have
feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain ways.
All of those would be deduced from next token prediction. And I'd
argue that this should make it possible, not indefinitely, but
to a to a pretty decent degree to say, Well, can you guess what
you what you do if you took a person with like this
characteristic and that characteristic, like such a person
doesn't exist. But because you're so good at predicting the
next token, you should still be able to guess what that person
would do this hypothetical imaginary person with a greater
mental ability than the rest of us.
