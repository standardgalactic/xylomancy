So today with us is Wolfgang Smith.
He has majors in physics, mathematics, and philosophy.
He contributed a theoretical solution
to the reentry problem for spaceflight
during his work as an aerodynamicist.
He has a doctorate in mathematics
and pursued a career as a mathematician
until his retirement in 1992.
He devoted himself to the publication of books,
Mission to Correct the Fallacies of Contemporary
Scientific Belief, by the way, of insights derived
from the perennial wisdom of mankind.
These works focus primarily on foundational problems
in quantum theory and the problems of visual perception.
Welcome, Wolfgang.
Well, thank you.
Glad to be here.
Very, very glad you're here.
Very excited.
With us also today is Brian Murphy.
Now, Brian, could you please introduce yourself,
who you are, why you're here?
Hi, Jack, thank you, and hello to your audience.
I'll make my comments brief, and then I'll
turn it back to you and Wolfgang,
because that's really where the money is in this conversation.
And I came to know Wolfgang after seeing the documentary
about him called The End of Quantum Reality.
And after that, I ordered one of his books.
In that case, it was Science and Myth,
with a response to Stephen Hawking's The Grand Design.
And after reading that book, I reached out
to the producer of the documentary on Facebook.
And I asked him if he had thought about creating
an educational initiative in the foundation.
And that led to a conversation and introduction
to Wolfgang and a friendship that has developed
over the past three years.
So we're now developing educational outreach
and hopefully a lecture series under the banner
of Project Scola.
And we have a number of prominent and highly skilled
and educated scholars from around the world
who are committed to this endeavor.
And so I have to say, when I read that book,
and I mean in the first chapter of that book,
the entire edifice of the worldview
that I had imbibed over the many years just melted
into oblivion.
And I think we're all familiar with that worldview.
It's the one that purports to be scientific.
It generally comes from PhDs who tell us
where sums of parts are composed of atoms or particles
speeding through space and time to no purpose.
And some might even say we have no free will
or that our actions and decisions are determined
in advance by these forces of physics.
And so, but I'm like one of your audience members.
I'm a lay person.
I don't have a PhD.
I'm not a physicist.
But I'm very interested in this topic
because I think it goes to the very heart of reality.
It goes to the very heart of what it means to be human.
And so in Wolfgang's latest book,
Physics, A Science and Quest of Ontology,
which you're gonna talk to him about,
Wolfgang really offers a new cosmology,
which is really an ancient cosmology.
And I think it'll really open people's eyes
to things they haven't heard before
or maybe haven't heard in decades.
So the bottom line is what I want your audience to know
is that Wolfgang Smith is not just another guy
with some interesting ideas among many.
No, I really feel there's no one like Wolfgang Smith.
And he has resolved the quantum reality problem,
the measurement problem.
And what he shows with amazing simplicity
is that our world is full of irreducible holes,
of beings imbued with qualities
that transcend the world of physics.
And so like Plato's analogy of the cave,
he invites his readers and he invites listeners
to make that ascent out of the cave.
So I would invite you to listen to this man
and become a member of his foundation,
the Philosophia Initiative.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you too.
Thank you, that was a great introduction.
Thank you.
Probably much better than I would have done.
Now, as I said just before we were in life,
Wolfgang kind of flew under the radar for me.
It kind of surprised me.
I got an email from his publicist and I had to check him out.
And they sent me a book.
This is Physics Assigned Inquest of Nontology.
And it was actually much more interesting
than I initially expected, Wolfgang.
You have a beautiful way of writing, honestly,
but I'm not bad, but you also take no prisoners.
And I kind of like that.
Let me give you one example here.
And you said, I came upon the words,
there is no way to convince an expert
that he or she has done nonsense for 30 years.
I realized instantly that this person has something to say.
When I read that, I instantly realized
that Wolfgang has something to say too.
So it was kind of tongue-in-cheek, but I like it.
Well, the people who are listening right now
are from the idealist space, metaphysical idealism.
So we're already not really convinced of scientism.
But it doesn't mean that we have to talk about idealism.
But there's this little thing about,
I haven't read, I haven't come across this in this book.
So before we start, I'm actually kind of curious,
just what are your thoughts on just consciousness?
I haven't seen the word in this book.
Maybe if you wrote about it, maybe you haven't.
But physicists have a lot to say about consciousness,
and idealists have a lot to say about consciousness.
But I haven't heard Wolfgang say anything about consciousness.
Is there anything you'd like to personally
say about that topic?
Well, I think the topic of consciousness
is obviously very central, very major.
And what I have to say about it,
I think can best be described as being the very opposite
of what is nowadays involved regarding
the subject of consciousness.
Because I am persuaded that instead of coming somehow
up from the bottom,
there's some process of evolution,
and I think that's a very important thing.
Process of evolution, consciousness is ultimately
in the final count, what used to be called a nomen day.
It is actually rooted in divinity itself.
And by way of explication,
let me mention that the oldest tradition,
intellectual tradition in the world
and questionably is the Vedic.
And in the Vedic tradition,
our consciousness is indeed a nomen day.
And it is part of the Sanskrit word,
satchitananda.
So satchitananda, these are three words put into one.
Satt means being,
chit means consciousness and ananda means bliss.
So being consciousness and bliss are so to speak
the three aspects or faces, if you will,
of the divinity, the very, very first principle.
And I honestly believe that there is no other way
of really understanding consciousness.
It's not an epiphenomenon,
it has nothing whatsoever to do with neurons.
And in fact, it is rooted in the very, very first principle
of all, which is God.
So I think these remarks may suffice to show
that my thinking is really very far removed
from the contemporary because the contemporary thinking
is characterized by the fact that almost instinctively,
contemporary Western man wants to understand everything
from the bottom, which he conceives more or less
in terms of quantum mechanics.
And this is to me the epitome of error.
And in fact, I would justify this claim
by pointing out that the contemporary metaphysics
is really nothing new, but it is a revival
of the philosophy of Democritus,
who famously said the Golga believe in
qualities, color, sweet and bitter,
but in reality, there is only atoms and the void.
So this is basically not only the oldest,
one of the oldest philosophical positions of mankind,
but it has been revived in the 17th century
and it has become our modern cradle.
And let me mention that very soon after Democritus
propounded his theory concerning atoms and the void,
Plato attacked it and I believe rigorously disqualified
this position once and for all.
And so for 2000 years thereafter,
they're well informed,
regarded this atomistic metaphysics as a heresy.
And so what happened in the 17th century
under the aegis of people like Descartes and Galileo,
that ancient heresy was revived
and became the foundation of what we nowadays call
the enlightenment.
So this is, so to speak,
the historical overview of where we find ourselves today.
And needless to say, I've been an opponent
of the current Weltanschauung since the age of 14, really.
Really, what happened when you were 14,
that made that happen?
Well, I think the decisive event was that somehow or other,
I came across a very important book,
the book by Alfred North Whitehead
entitled, Science in the Modern World.
I read this book with great interest,
I don't think I understood that much
because I was very young,
but I understood enough to be fascinated
and in a sense to be devoted to these questions
for the rest of my life.
So, Whitehead, as it were,
awakened my philosophical interest and instincts,
if you will, instinctively when I read about
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness
and these things, I realized that this must be true.
And so this started me on the basis of the book
on a career which put me in the position
of the outsider from the very beginning.
I always felt myself as an outsider
in the contemporary Western culture.
And the reason was that I felt myself as an insider
when it comes to the ancient philosophies,
primarily Platonism.
So in Platonism, I felt that I was an insider,
not that I understood it that well,
but instinctively I was drawn to it
and something within me
assured me that this must be the truth.
And incidentally, Platonism doesn't stand alone.
It is inherently the same as the Vedic tradition.
There are certain differences,
but in essence it is the same doctrine.
And as I said,
the contemporary Weltanschauung
which is regards particles of some kind or another
as a very basis from which everything else evolves,
that Weltanschauung is really nothing new at all.
As I said, it goes back to the market,
and you might say it is one of the oldest heresies
in the history of human thought.
You're not a fan of atomistic thinking.
That's certainly what I got it from reading your book.
And you even go as far as to say
that there are no, that particles do not exist.
And I think that's a good thing.
I know that particles do not exist.
Yes, when you really pursue the Platonist metaphysics
and apply it to the contemporary panorama of physics
with its division between classical physics
and quantum physics,
you find, and this came to me as an amazement,
you find that everything falls into place
and you can in fact understand this division
between classical physics and quantum physics
in a brand new way which finally makes sense.
I really like you to go deeper into that
or at least explain your solution to this problem.
So if you can briefly state the problem
and then your solution.
Yes, let me just say by way of introduction
that the Platonist metaphysics
is in a sense a diametric opposite
of what contemporary intellectuals believe
because contemporary intellectuals believe
that it all begins with atoms.
Nowadays, this is conceived evidently
in quantum mechanical terms,
but metaphysically speaking,
it's just atoms and the void,
very much as democratic conceived of it.
It's the beginning of the fifth century BC.
So in a sense, you can say there's nothing new
under the sun because stripped of its technical aspects,
the contemporary worldview is basically
democratize all over again.
And it is as much a heresy today
as it was in the early days of democratize.
In other words, it is simply false to say
that everything arises from particles.
There's no evidence to that effect.
People may think so, but if you dig into it
a little bit more deeply,
you'll find that all these purported scenarios
really prove to be baseless.
And if you go into it with any kind of mathematical depths,
you find quickly enough that this contemporary scenario
which tries to reduce everything to aggregates of particles
actually proves to be impossible.
And in fact, it may interest many people to know
that starting in the year 1998,
this philosophy, this Belt and Schoen
has really been disproved.
It turns out to be mathematically impossible.
And it is very simple.
I think I can explain that a few words comprehensible
to the non-specialist.
If you start out with particles,
then you need to talk about evolution.
You need to introduce this term
because somehow these particles have to give rise
to all that there is beginning with the planetary system
and the simplest organic structures.
So everything has to arise by way of quote unquote evolution.
This is the given because obviously we live not
in a world of particles,
but in a world of something
which may conceivably reduce an aggregate of particles,
but it certainly is not what appears to us.
So what I'm trying to say is that
if you base yourself on an ontology of particles,
then evolution is an absolute necessity
to go from these particles to the world which we inhabit.
Because the world which we inhabit
is more than the sum of its parts.
It's also one of the things you seem to keep pressing on
in this book of yours,
that there is an irreducible hold
that you cannot take apart, you cannot atomize it.
And this is also one of the things you stress.
Yes, yes, I do stress this,
but the point Jack is that
according to the contemporary scientific mindset,
everything does reduce to a sum of parts.
This is what our Weltanschauung insists upon.
Physics by its very modus operandi assumes this much.
The only reason physics can understand an object,
whatever it may be, is if that object is a sum of parts,
because that's how physics operates.
That's where differential equations come into the picture.
So our contemporary science is predicated upon this
assumption that the world consists of sums of parts.
And now I wanted to point out that it turns out
and incidentally that's another way
of introducing the idea of evolution.
It's the same thing.
If you start with particles,
then the world and everything in it
is a result of evolution.
These parts come together to form holes
and so you get ever more complicated aggregates of particles.
And this is the explanation of the world
in which we find ourselves.
But it turns out that this basic premise is untenable.
And that is a direct consequence
over a rigorous mathematical theorem
proved in the year 1998
by an American mathematician named William Demsky.
And what Demsky proved is really very, very simple,
although the proof is not very simple,
but the idea is very simple.
Demsky proved that if you have something
sufficiently complicated,
then it becomes mathematically impossible
to suppose that this entity came about by chance.
If you have some stochastic random process,
like tossing a coin,
the likelihood that this will somehow spell out
all the volumes in the Library of Congress
in their chronological order is so small
that it is rigorously impossible.
And this is what Demsky proved
in this so-called intelligent design theorem
which was published in a book
Cambridge University Press in 1998.
So what the theorem of Demsky affirms is that
a causality operating in time,
which is causality of physics,
cannot produce what is called complex specified information.
And with this causality,
you specifically refer to horizontal causation.
Yes, so horizontal.
So when I saw this term for the first time
or at least vertical causation,
I've never heard of it before,
that immediately I,
instinctively I thought, okay,
so what does Wolfgang mean?
Because I haven't had,
by that point I have not read your book
and I can imagine you have on the one hand,
a cause which leads to an effect
and that effect can be another cause.
And we imagine this at least in the Western world
because we do not have circular time in our Western thinking.
We have a linear time going
and it usually is imagined from the left to the right.
So that seems to me the horizontal causation
but you introduce an idea which is vertical causation
which might explain this,
some instant annuity start,
but I just wanted to...
You're absolutely right.
What Demski's theorem affirms,
the Buddha in my language,
is that horizontal causation,
the causation upon which physics is based,
cannot produce complex specified information.
And since even the simplest forms of life,
an amoeba as it were embodies
huge quantities of complex specified information,
it follows from Demski's theorem
that a natural process,
a process that physics can understand
could not have formed that organic organism,
that amoeba.
So the point that I'm making
is that actually with Demski's theorem,
evolution as we normally conceive of it
has become mathematically impossible.
And the fact that this is
this basic discovery is very much suppressed.
This is not what you will learn
at any reputable university.
There are no courses in Harvard or Princeton
that will tell you these things.
It shows that when it comes to Weltanschau,
the matter is not based on pure simple logic.
I mean, we are human, ideology comes into play.
So as a general statement of what I discovered
rather early in life,
is that our so-called scientific Weltanschau,
which entails the idea, for example,
of evolution and life springing
from the mental particles ultimately,
that this is not a scientific fact.
There's no proof of this.
On the contrary, as I've just said,
there are mathematical theorems that disprove
that possibility, but the point is
that our Weltanschau, which claims to be scientific,
and if you will, objective is, in fact, ideology-driven.
I agree.
Yeah, Brian, go ahead.
I just wanted to add something.
Wolfgang uses the word Weltanschau,
which is a German word that just means worldview
or how one looks out upon the world.
But just going back to your question, Jack,
if I could reintroduce, you had the question
about the Wolfgang's resolution to the quantum enigma,
and Wolfgang, before you came across
Dempke's theorem in 1998, you wrote a book
called The Quantum Enigma, Finding the Hidden Key,
in which you pick up on Heisenberg's description
of what quantum reality is,
and this is what leads you down the path
to your resolution.
So maybe you could talk about where you picked up
from Heisenberg and how you came to this resolution.
All right.
Quantum theory was discovered in the early decades
of the 20th century.
And very soon, after its discovery,
a problem confronted the physicists,
which they were unable to resolve.
And that is the following.
Quantum theory describes a physical system
by a so-called wave function.
And in that wave function description,
the physical systems behave in a very weird way.
Particles, for example, multi-locate,
and you are in a realm
totally different from the world
as we know it in our daily life.
But when you, for example, set up an experiment
to measure the position of this, say, multi-locating particle,
you find that at the instant of measurement,
the particle ceases to multi-locate
and actually presents itself
at some particular location in space.
And this, of course, is very puzzling.
How does this miracle arise?
That in an instant,
a system completely changes
and becomes something that it was not before.
And this is called the measurement problem.
And I became very interested in that problem.
It was about 1995, the abouts.
And I finally became convinced that I see
the one and only way to resolve it.
And I wrote a book to that effect on that subject
called the quantum enigma,
where I start from the ground up
and develop the idea,
ideas, actually, two of them,
that are needed to resolve this problem.
And there are two ideas that you need.
The first idea is the fact that the perceptible world,
which is really the world in which we find ourselves,
happens not to be a quantum world.
It happens not to be even just the physical world.
So the world as a physicist conceives of it
is not the full world, there's more.
And if there were not more,
for example, there could be no perception,
there could be no life.
So I made the basic ontological distinction
between a corporeal entity and the physical entity.
Our corporeal entity is the kind of entity
which we encounter in our normal daily life.
It's something that we perceive is our senses
and something that has a reality,
transcending what the physicist can describe
in abstract mathematical terms.
Now, every corporeal object X has associated with it
a physical object, call it SX.
In other words, the physical object that
classical physics deals with are corporeal objects
as conceived by the physicist.
So there's a difference between the corporeal object X
and the object SX,
which is the physicist's conception of that corporeal object.
I would say that the corporeal object
would be not reducible to each part
and the physical object as,
or at least an abstract object
would be decomposable into parts, the atomistic way.
Yes, you're absolutely right.
Only at this point in the quantum enigma,
I had not yet introduced this idea of irreducible wholeness.
I simply distinguished the object that we know
in daily life through our normal senses
from the corresponding physical object,
which is reduced,
it is limited by the physicist's assumptions.
So you have to distinguish these two objects,
they're not the same.
So there's a distinction between a corporeal object X
and the physicist's concept of that,
which I call the corresponding physical object.
But does the physical object actually exist
or is it just an abstraction?
An abstraction of the corporeal objects.
It does exist.
I mean, the physicist does not deal with non-entities.
Yes, it has an existence.
The important thing is that you need
to distinguish between the two.
They're not the same thing.
And as long as you don't see that distinction,
you will not be able to solve the measuring problem.
And this is why this measuring problem
has been kicked around by top scientists,
top physicists for close to 100 years now.
And actually it has not been solved by these considerations
because in fact, it cannot be solved on that basis.
And the reason it cannot be solved on that basis
is that the crux of the matter is this distinction
between the corporeal entity X
and the associated physical entity SS.
They're not the same.
The corporeal is more and it is this more
that is the decisive factor in the measurement problem.
And so I think physicists are still thinking
of the measurement problem.
The fact is that they cannot solve it
on the basis of physics.
So what I showed in this 1995 book,
The Quantum Enigma is that in a sense,
physics is limited.
It doesn't deal with everything.
And it is in fact so limited
that it is incapable of recognizing
its own limitation.
The fact that the physicist's world
is not the entire world, that's a basic fact.
And unless you understand the basic facts,
you will not be able to correctly understand anything.
But this basic fact is invisible to physics,
that definition if you will.
Could you say, I was gonna ask Wolfgang,
could you say that SS exists insofar
as it participates in X or partakes in X?
Yes, it derives its being from X.
And this is a major factor.
But this being that the physical object
derives from the corporeal is something entirely invisible
to the physicist, because in fact,
being as such is invisible to the physicist
because being is not a sum of parts.
And all the physicists can ever see is sums of parts.
That's why differential equations come into play
because when you deal with things
that do reduce the sum of parts,
these things then are amenable to study
by means of differential equations.
I used to always have trouble with the concept
of something being more than the sum of its parts.
Until I wrote an example by John Furveki.
He's a cognitive scientist, got shorn.
And he gave the example of the necker cube,
the two-dimensional drawing of a three-dimensional cube
in a wire frame.
And you can flip that inside and outside.
And he said, well, you have this two-dimensional drawing,
but the three-dimensional projection you have in your head,
that's the thing that is more than the sum of its parts.
So only until then I kind of understood
what it really meant for something to be more
than the sum of its parts.
It's not something emergent,
or it's there's something that is not,
you can reduce the three-dimensional image in your head
to the lines on the paper.
And there has to be something more.
Anyway, I just wanted to add that.
Well, this example that John Furveki gave you
is very, very interesting and very fascinating.
But let me point out that it is not necessary
to go to something as high-faluting as this example,
because take, for example, any quality, say a color,
the color red.
The color red, obviously, is not a sum of parts
because it doesn't even have parts.
So it was Aristotle, really,
who recognized the difference
between quantities and qualities.
And the point is that qualities are characterized
by the fact that they have no parts.
So the upshot is that physics and our physical sciences
deal with a very limited aspect of reality.
And in fact, this is where its power comes from.
I always like to quote Goethe, who has said so many wise things
and one of them is, quote, you understand it,
in the Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister.
In limitation, the master shows himself.
So the point is that physics gains its power
through the enormity of its limitation.
And what is that limitation?
The limitation is that it will concentrate
entirely upon quantities.
The physicist, our physicist has no eye for qualities.
He sees no color, he sees nothing but quantities
and therefore he sees nothing but sums of parts.
This is an enormous limitation
and it is the enormity of this limitation
that gives physics its equally enormous power.
So this, if I had any influence upon universities,
which I don't, this is what I would like to convey
to the students because it makes for wisdom.
It makes for real understanding.
Our scientific Weltanschauung is bought at a cost.
We pay something to get that Weltanschauung
and what we pay, in other words,
what we lose in the process
is the qualitative side of the world,
which we completely leave out of account
in our physical sciences.
So actually, if you want to be very positive
and precise, very rigorous,
you could say that there is no
contemporary scientific Weltanschauung
for the simple reason that our sciences are based upon physics
and the physical world cannot really be looked upon at all.
The only way you can deal with it
is through mathematical equations.
And so in order to make a Weltanschauung
out of the findings of physics,
we have to add something to that,
which cannot, in any way, be based upon physics.
So in a sense, our question is,
so in a sense, our contemporary Weltanschauung is a fake.
It is a fantasy.
It's a contradiction in terms
because if the world were really
what the physicist takes it to be,
that does not give rise to a Weltanschauung.
This is nothing that you can tell the non-physicist,
aha, that's what the world is like,
because all that remains basically are equations
and the non-physicist doesn't understand these equations.
Nor does it make any sense to say
that in reality, the world reduces to equations.
This is really nonsense.
And this is why I like the saying of Goethe so much
because this Goethe's dictum really tells us why
the physicist Weltanschauung is not a Weltanschauung at all.
Unless he added something, an ingredient
which is not part of physics,
he couldn't speak to the non-physicist.
Can I quote you from your book?
I just remind me of something you wrote.
Please.
Please.
You said the people today muddle along
and don't even know anymore what is muddle
and what is fact.
And it's something that I find is really good quote.
I made me chuckle a bit.
I had the same thing when I was younger.
It's that it almost feels like the scientific worldview
which isn't actually a worldview,
but it pretends to be one at least.
And, but it doesn't tell you it is.
I had to find out later that there is a distinction
between modeling the world and,
or describing the world and the world in itself.
And the model of the world is not the same thing
as the world.
And I can understand why people get confused, let's say.
And we need people like Wolfgang and other people
to reintroduce this classical idea actually.
We seem to have forgotten that.
So I just wanted to add that.
Yes.
As a result of this dominance of physical science
in our time, our intellectuals
have become very, very confused.
And in these days of mass communication,
these ideas remain not only amongst the intellectuals,
it pervades our civilization.
I think nowadays, even in grade school,
you'll be given all sorts of information
about atoms and particles and so on.
So we are very, very confused people,
seriously confused.
And it, of course, affects our entire civilization profoundly.
I mean, for example, the arts are profoundly affected
by this so-called scientific,
well-done shown, which as I have just tried to explain,
is really a fake.
It is really a fake.
But these things are not easy to understand intellectually.
It requires a certain qualifications,
which are apparently quite rare.
And so the confusion remains
and in fact perpetuates itself
and is getting worse and worse.
We are very, very confused people
and it is affecting our culture as a whole.
And to the extent that one actually sees
what is going on, one cannot but be very worried.
I agree.
Wolfgang, you introduced a concept
as a correlation to horizontal causation,
it's vertical causation.
And you picked up on where Heisenberg said
something about quantum particles
that there's somewhere between being and non-being
and as such a reminiscent of Aristotelian potentiae.
And this is something you picked up on.
And you said something interesting,
you're quoted in your documentary as saying
that no one on either side of the Copenhagen debate
seemed to have realized that it was the role
of quantum particles not to bestow, but to receive being.
And so this plays into your idea of vertical causation,
which Jack had alluded to earlier.
Yeah, I want to respond to what you have just said, Brian,
because it touches upon something very, very major.
Heisenberg was a very, very unusual physicist.
He was different from all the other physicists
by the fact that he was the son of a classicist.
His father was a classicist
and Heisenberg himself was very versed
in say the philosophy of Plato,
the philosophy of Aristotle.
He had a high degree of insight into these ancient doctrines
and that set him off from the rest of the physicists.
And he was really alone
among physicists to recognize
that these so-called quantum particles
really had no being.
Physicists by and large regarded these particles
as the ultimate building blocks of the world
when in fact Heisenberg due to his knowledge
of ancient philosophy recognized that they were not,
they could not be that because in fact they lack being.
You cannot build a world out of things
which don't exist, which don't have being.
So on the other hand, Heisenberg never managed
to take these recognitions all the way
and build what might be called a complete philosophy
of physics which puts everything in its right place.
He never managed to do that,
but he did recognize the fact that quantum particles
are potentie that means they don't really exist
but they are material in relation to form.
So I picked up, as it were, on this note
and I recognized very clearly
that this is what the quantum particles are.
What the measurement problem is all about
when you measure a quantum system,
you give being to some entities
which previously were mere potency.
And if a measuring instrument
were itself a quantum system, you obviously couldn't do that.
Somewhere along the line, you need to bring into play
some entities which have being
so that they can then affect the transition
from the potency of a quantum particle
to the actuality of a measurement, of a measured system.
So I realized that there is an ontological difference
between an ordinary corporeal entity,
the kind of entities that we encounter in our conscious life,
a chair, a table or anything that you can pick up,
anything that you can actually perceive.
So these are corporeal entities
and they are ontologically different
from a mere quantum system
because they do have being a quantum system does not.
So based upon this very, very simple recognition
I found a very, very simple solution
to the so-called measurement problem.
The point is, in order to measure a quantum system,
you need which is a mere potency, a mere potency,
you need something that is more than a potency
and these kind of entities are called corporeal entities.
The chair I'm sitting on is corporeal
otherwise I couldn't sit on it.
So the first new idea that I introduced
and that needs to be introduced
if you want to solve the measurement problem
is the distinction between a corporeal entity
and the associated physical entity
to the corporeal entity is more
and this more is essential in the active measurement.
But that was not enough in order to complete the argument,
you need to recognize that if measurement is a transition
from potency to act, you need a corresponding causality
because the transition from potency to act
cannot take place in time, it can only be instantaneous
because there's nothing in between the potency and act.
So it is an instantaneous effect.
It is an instantaneous effect.
Now physics deals with a causality
which I call horizontal causality
which itself takes place in time.
That's why you can write a differential equation
because this is a causality
which is really a process in time.
But the causality that you need
in order to measure a quantum system
cannot be a causality that takes place in time
because as I said, it has to be instantaneous.
And so this led to the discovery, if you will,
of so-called vertical causation.
Vertical causation is an entirely different kind of causation
and it is characterized by the fact
that it takes place instantaneously.
And so these are the two ontological ideas
that I introduced in 1995
in connection with the measurement problem.
And let me just point out
that it was very interesting
that three years later, exactly,
William Demsky wrote his book on intelligent design
in which he proved that theorem,
which I have just mentioned,
to the effect that it takes vertical causality
to effect, to produce complex specified information.
So I guess the time for the discovery
of vertical causality had come
because two independent books
demonstrated the need for that kind of causality.
Where does that causality come from, this vertical causality?
Excuse me, Jack.
Where does this vertical causality come from?
Ah, well, that is a wonderful question
because actually it turns out
that you can have vertical causality only
in a Platonist cosmos.
You need a cosmos as Plato himself conceived of it
because the Platonist cosmos is inherently tripartite.
It consists of three levels, if you will,
in which the first level, the highest level,
what Plato called the intelligible,
is not subject to either space or time.
And it is this intelligible,
I call it avi-ternal level
from which vertical causation emanates.
Okay, please tell me what the word avi-ternal.
My spellchecker keeps telling me this word doesn't exist
and I was just curious.
I've never come across it.
I think it's a beautiful word, but it's it.
Well, the word goes back to the Christian middle ages
where the scholastic philosophers recognized
that there is a level in the cosmos
beyond space and time.
So then your question is,
what is it that distinguishes this kind of eternity
from what theologians want to call eternity?
And the answer was given by Thomas Aquinas
who said that the avi-ternal realm
is subject, is not subject to time,
not subject to time, but time can be added onto it.
These are the words.
That means even though avi-ternity has no time,
it is really part of the cosmos in which time does exist.
So it's a very sharp distinction,
but very, very essential from a metaphysical point of view
because the avi-ternity of the highest cosmic sphere
is not to be equated to the eternity
that properly speaking belongs to God himself
who is the creator of the world.
So the eternity of God is more than the avi-ternity
of the highest cosmic sphere.
Right, and this is where this avi-ternity
is where the vertical causation comes from.
Exactly, the vertical causation in so far
as it does not happen in time,
it therefore comes from the avi-ternal plane.
It emanates, let's say.
It doesn't emerge, it emanates.
Is there any metaphor we can use for this?
There really is not because here we are dealing
with the deepest metaphysical problems
which being basic cannot be further reduced, so to speak.
Fair enough.
So after writing this book on the quantum enigma,
I began to realize that the key
to all these metaphysical questions
relating to the nature of physics and the physical world
need to be resolved on a Platonist basis.
I've always instinctively been a Platonist,
but it was after this rather intense work
I put in on the quantum enigma
that it became more clear to me than ever before
that in order to understand physics,
we need to go back to the Platonist philosophy.
This is really the key, this is the right way of doing it.
And let me say that in light of my latest book,
where I actually carry out, if you will, that plan,
I am very gratified and in a way amazed
to see that if you look at physics
from a rigorous Platonist point of view,
everything becomes very, very simple.
And not only does it become very, very simple,
but you also at the same time realize
that the actual story is the very opposite
of what physicists nowadays believe.
It's a very opposite because basically physicists start
with particles and then they want to,
from particles step by step build a universe.
And it turns out from the Platonist point of view
that I've just alluded to,
that the true story is just the other way around.
Every particles come at the very end
and they even have no being.
So the real ontology starts from just the opposite direction.
The true ontology is top down, it is not bottom up.
Interesting.
Wolfgang, if I could ask a question,
you introduced a reminder that it was reported,
reportedly said or written above the Platonic Academy
at Atlants, let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.
And I think this informed your concept
of the tripartite cosmos and a tripartite man.
And it takes shape of an icon of a circle
with a center point.
And would it be fair to characterize this icon
reflecting the human person, let's say,
or any created entity?
Well, in particular, you introduced the intellect,
the idea of the intellect.
So you reintroduce a distinction
between the intellect and reason and then the corporeal.
The intellect is instantaneous.
It's not constrained by time or space
and it's how we perceive things.
And this is, you did quite a bit of research
into James J. Gibson's theory of ecological perception
which supported this.
And then there's the distinction
between the intellectual moving into the rational,
which is discursive thought that takes place in time
but requires no space.
And then being terminates on the level of the corporeal,
let's say, where the person manifests
him or herself in space and time.
And so each person has these three aspects
of their nature, the intelligible.
They have access to this where there's no space, no time.
They have access to the reason
and the rational discursive thought in time, no space.
And the corporeal.
So maybe, I know Jack was interested in your research
on James J. Gibson and how this ties into that concept.
Well, this, you raise a very fundamental question.
I think the first thing that I should point out is that
it is very enlightening to associate
the Platonist doctrine of the three levels of the cosmos
with the bounds of space and time.
And incidentally, I don't see this
talked about in the Platonist philosophy.
They must have known it because they were very wise
and this is very basic, but I don't find it written
about, say, in the Timaeus or the other relevant dialogues.
The point is this, Platonism distinguishes
three levels of the cosmos.
The supreme level, which is beyond time,
is called the intelligible, I call it the eternal.
The second level, which the Platonists call
the psychic or the vital, I call it the intermediary.
The second level, I say, and this is,
this I do not find explicitly in the Platonist dialogues.
The second level is subject to time, but not to space.
So the intermediary level, which is a psychic,
is subject to time, but not to space.
And then of course, as you would expect,
the third or lowest, what we call the corporeal level
is subject to both time and space.
So you have these three levels of the cosmos
and you can, if you will, define them
in terms of the two bounds, time and space.
There is a level that is subject to neither.
There's a level that is subject to time, but not to space.
And then there's a level that is subject to both.
So this is very simple.
And amazing consequences fall here and so from this way
of looking at the matter.
And I think perhaps the one that will interest
our listeners the most is the fact
that the existence of a time only level of the cosmos,
the existence of what I call the intermediary plane
in itself disproves or disqualifies Einsteinian relativity.
Einsteinian relativity, which it is,
will fuse a space and time in what is called spacetime.
If Einstein were right, there could be no cosmic realm
subject to time, but not to space
because space and time are, so to speak,
two different aspects of a spacetime
which includes both.
So one of the obviously most interesting consequences
of this recognition of the Platonist ontology
is affirming an intermediary realm subject to time alone.
One most amazing consequences of this
is that it disqualifies Einsteinian relativity
at a single scale.
So, sorry, and sometimes I agree.
Well, that was something I would like to,
before I forget, I didn't have many questions,
but there was a paper you mentioned by J. Gibson.
I just mentioned it yourself, too,
and I haven't read the paper simply
because I'm not really good at reading papers,
but I hope you can give a summarization of,
you can summarize the general idea behind it
because all I understand from it is that we see reality
how it is.
That's what I read in your book or in the key points
that we see reality as it is.
What does Gibson mean by that?
Well, I'm so glad you brought up the name of James Gibson
because I really think he is one of the absolutely
most important scientists of the 20th century
because he has single-handedly corrected
a major mistake of a post-Cartesian science
by rediscovering the fact that in visual perception,
what you actually perceive is not inside the head,
it's in the external world itself.
We do perceive mountains and trees
and we do perceive color.
So in my language, what we perceive
is exactly the corporeal world
as distinguished from the physical.
And it is an amazing achievement
on the part of Gibson to have actually formulated
in rigorous empirical terms a theory of visual perception
which completely breaks with the so-called retinal image
theory which as we know,
think of perception as a process originating
in the retina, these rods and cones
are stimulated by light impinging upon the retina.
So then there are nerve currents set up into the cortex
and a very, very complicated process ensues
in which involves something on the order of 20 or 21
visual centers in the cortex
and libraries have been filled with the product of that research
but the fact of the matter is that
when all is said and done,
we can just trace the process of seeing,
the process of visual perception
to a bunch of visual centers in the cortex,
none of which actually contains that image that we see.
And so it turns out that the so-called retinal image
theory of visual perception doesn't really lead to perception.
It leads in a sense to the very opposite
in the sense that these different visual centers
take the image apart and as Sir Francis Crick said famously,
we see how the brain takes the image apart,
we do not yet see how the brain puts the picture back
together again and the obvious fact is
that the brain does not put the picture back together again.
In fact, it can't and the fact that it can't
has come to be known as a so-called binding problem.
The problem is you've got say a million people
neurons in these visual centers of the brain
and as a result of light striking the retina,
these are in various modes of on and off position.
How do you make a picture out of this vast multiplicity
of neuronal states?
And in other words, how does the brain
put the picture back together again?
And the answer quite obviously is the brain
can do no such thing.
And so this has become known in the world of,
this has become known as the binding problem.
And the fact of the matter is that the binding problem
really has no solution on a neuronal basis.
The neurons takes a picture apart,
they do not, they cannot put it back together again.
And so at one point I simply stated
the obvious fact that the binding problem
cannot be solved on the corporeal level.
In other words, the only way the binding problem
can solve, can be solved, the way it is solved
is that in our integral being,
we are not subject to the conditional space.
In our corporeal nature, yes, on that level,
we are subject to the condition of space.
And this is where all that neurophysiology takes place.
But the actual binding takes place on the next level up,
which is the level of the intermediary or psychic plane.
So the answer to the binding problem is this,
it is resolved not on the corporeal level,
but on the psychic.
So if we were purely corporeal creatures,
we could not see anything.
There could be no perception.
And incidentally, so we have these three levels
of the cosmos, the intelligible,
the psychic and the corporeal.
And I just want to point out that in days gone by,
every child really knew that the human being himself
consists of three levels.
In Latin, it's anima, soul, psyche, mind,
and intellect or spiritus.
So corpus anima spiritus, this trichotomy of man
is simply tells us that man is a microcosm.
Man is the cosmos in miniature.
So even as the cosmos is tripartite,
the anthropos is also tripartite.
And if we were not tripartite, for example,
visual perception would be impossible.
And this is what has now baffled the neurophysiologists.
This is the binding problem which no one has solved
and no one can solve on the corporeal level.
The binding problem would be impossible to solve
if it were not for the fact that man is more than a body.
Man has not only a body, he has also a soul.
And then there's a third component,
above soul there is spiritus.
And we need all three actually turns out,
excuse me, turns out that in addition to the intermediary,
the eternal level in man is also needed for ordinary perception
because there could be no perception of motion.
If you think about it deeply,
the perception of motion is possible only because within man
there is a level above time itself.
So if we were completely immersed in time,
we could not perceive motion.
And this is what Gibson discovered, didn't he?
Yes.
Perception didn't take place as a series of points in time,
but was required constant motion and was instantaneous.
Yes.
The point about Gibson is that he was all empiricist.
He was one of the greatest empiricists,
I think the world has ever seen,
but he was not a metaphysician.
And when you read his papers,
he expresses himself in purely empiricist terms.
He won't talk to you about,
he doesn't write about matter and form
or a psychic realm subject to time and not to space.
This is not the language he uses.
He was an empiricist of absolutely first rank.
I'm very happy that he has been recognized and acknowledged.
I think the academic community has honored him
and made him a member of the Academy of Science and so on.
They have greatly honored him.
And I think they have done so because they have not recognized
how dangerous he is to everything that they stand for.
Because if they would really understand Gibson,
they would realize, to quote my friend Alexander Unziger,
they would realize that for 30 years they've been talking nonsense.
Because he destroyed that materialist ontology
which underlies our academic sciences
as the assumption that nobody really wants to talk about.
You assume it, it is not talked about.
I think this is a good place to end it here.
Well, unless you want to go on.
I mean, I don't want to text you too much.
As you know from reading this latest book of mine,
I have still many things, basic things to say,
but I'm happy to end at any point that you...
I still have some energy left in me.
If you can go, we'll just go on.
I just want to be considerate here.
Because then we'll go on a little bit.
We'll see how far we can go.
The reason I asked for Gibson,
for your explanation of Gibson's argument,
because I wasn't necessarily familiar with it,
is we also had on Donald Hoffman,
and he's a mathematician,
and he said the opposite,
but now that I heard your argument,
I'm not sure if that's just...
I'm not sure if it's just semantics or not,
because his argument was that we almost certainly
do not see reality as it is,
but that argument was based on evolution.
I'm not sure if you're familiar with Donald Hoffman.
Well, let me tell you quite frankly
that I'm not familiar with most of the contemporary thinkers
who have made a name for themselves,
because as you can see from what has already transpired
in our conversation,
I stand really on the opposite pole
of the contemporary worldview.
I'm a Platonist,
I've always been a Platonist,
and the older I get,
the more deeply I value Plato,
and the more instinctively I look upon all issues
from a Platonist point of view,
and this Platonist point of view
is quite evidently the very opposite
of the modern or contemporary way of looking at things.
The contemporary way of looking at things
is basically a Democratian.
From a Platonist point of view,
we're repeating the Democratian heresy,
and in a way priding ourselves on that.
The point being that we are trying to understand
complex things, corporeal things,
and mental things,
except being something supramental,
that too we're trying to understand everything
on the basis of atoms and the void.
In other words, in modern terms,
this would be quantum particles,
and I think it already emerges
from what we have been talking about this morning,
that you do not understand anything ontologically
if you imagine that things reduce the quantum particles,
because in fact quantum particles have no being.
They're not really there.
They are near potencies,
and obviously the universe is not a potency,
but an actuality.
So from my Platonist point of view,
contemporary thought regarding the nature
of cosmic reality is upside down.
We are standing upside down.
We are trying to understand actuality
in terms of potency,
and it's a hopeless process.
And so I have read comparatively few contemporary authors,
and the only contemporary authors
that I've really read with great interest,
like for example James Gibson,
is due to the fact that he opposes the contemporary point of view.
Gibson interests me so enormously
because he says the opposite
of most other cognitive psychologists.
Wolfgang, what could you say specifically
that Gibson discovered about perception,
meaning what was it about the nature of perception
that was so distinct from the retinal image version?
Well, he discovered something that practically no one
in the contemporary scientific world was prepared to believe,
namely that what we see in visual perception
is not inside the head, it's outside.
We actually perceive a mountain or a rose.
If the rose is red,
we actually perceive that redness in the rose.
This is what, of course, the ancients believed.
This was in Plato's day.
Everyone would have agreed.
But it goes completely contrary to everything
that the Western intelligentsia has believed
since the days of René Descartes.
And so it comes as an enormous shock,
or should come as an enormous shock
to the educated world of our day,
that someone like Gibson has made these discoveries
in a way which cannot really be refuted.
You introduced René Descartes,
and one of the topics that you like to talk about
is the notion of bifurcation,
which was the term coined by Alfred North Whitehead
to describe Descartes' bifurcated world
between thought and extension.
And I have a feeling that that plays a role
in, let's say, Professor Hoffman's conception
of perceiving the world as conjecture in our mind
as opposed to the world as it is.
Yeah, I'm glad, Brian,
that you brought up the idea of bifurcation
because it is really very, very basic
and Descartes introduced it in the 17th century.
And it is simply the postulate that the world,
the realm of existing things,
splits into two categories.
The first category is what they call the res extensé,
which means extended entities.
And these are entities which exist in space
and they have no other attributes
than the fact that they exist in space and time.
Everything that is not a res extensor
is what Descartes calls a res cogitans,
which means a thing of the mind.
So having split the entire universe
into extended entities on one side
and mental entities on the other,
he has set the world up ideally
for the mathematical physicists
because it tells the mathematical physicists
that the real world, the world that exists outside
and not inside the head,
consists of only extended entities.
So this suggested to Sir Isaac Newton
and to physicists really ever after
that the real world is precisely the world
as the physicists concede of it.
These are the things that can be described
in mathematical terms.
It began in a crude way with mechanisms
that are somewhat like a clockwork.
And you remember in the 17th century
in fact they built these mechanisms.
You see them in Venice.
And they built them because they really thought
that that's what the real world is like.
It's a world of cogs and wheels
interacting mechanically.
And so the physicists were delighted
because Descartes left them with an exterior
so-called external world of the kind
that really is made for mathematical analysis.
It's ideal.
The physicist was in his paradise.
And however, it turns out that
by reducing the external world to res-extensé
making out of it a kind of clockwork universe
Descartes misrepresented the external world.
He oversimplified it.
And we have been paying the price ever since.
Now this Cartesian dichotomy into res-extensé
and res-covitantes has become
so-to-speak second nature among physicists.
Every physicist learns this bifurcation
with outlook very early in life.
And then he learns it so deeply
and so naturally that he doesn't recognize it
as a postulate.
Most physicists, it turns out, are really incapable
of grasping bifurcation as a philosophical axiom
an assumption which may or may not be true.
And so it was Alfred Norse Whitehead
who coined that term bifurcation.
And then he went to all the finest universities
in the UK and in the States
lecturing physicists about this assumption
that unwittingly they have made.
And he pointed out to them that it has created
an incredible model.
And in the hope of waking them up as it were
but the fact of the matter is that it's uncertain
whether there exists even one famous physicist
who is not instinctively bifurcationist.
So bifurcation is then a metaphysical axiom
which physicists almost without exception
or perhaps actually without exception
believe in.
Now the important thing is that bifurcation
is ultimately untenable.
It is not true.
It is a metaphysical error.
And in a sense we know that since the days of
democratus because in a sense
democratus is the first philosopher in history
to introduce bifurcation into philosophical discourse.
So the upshot of the matter is that physics
as it is understood in our day
is bound up with this axiom of bifurcation
which it assumes rigidly.
And once you have assumed that axiom
you are committed to a kind of crude materialism
which cannot possibly be true.
It's an error that invalidates your wealth and charm.
In fact Heisenberg spoke about it as well.
Didn't he wrote about it?
I had a quote here and he wrote
if one follows with great difficulty
which even eminent scientists like Einstein
have an understanding in accepting
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory
one can trace the roots of that difficulty
to the Cartesian partition.
And he goes on to say that this partition
has penetrated deeply into the human mind
during the three centuries following Descartes
and it will take a long time for it to be replaced
by a really different attitude toward the reality problem.
That was from Heisenberg
which might come as a surprise to me.
The interesting thing about Heisenberg is
that here and there in his writings
you will find passages like the one that you just read.
But I've made a rather thorough study of Heisenberg
because I regard him as among all the physicists
he was the most enlightened metaphysically
far more than anyone else that I can name.
But the fact of the matter is that there are other passages
you can quote in the writings of Heisenberg
where he is in fact placing himself
on a bifurcationist basis.
So he was not completely, he was far more enlightened
metaphysically than any other well-known physicist
of our time.
But, and I say this is due to the fact
that he was a son of a classicist.
Through his father he came to know Platonism
and philosophy of Aristotle and so forth
but he was not altogether consistent
and I think if he had
comprehended non-bifurcation more deeply
he would have resolved the leading problems
in the philosophy of physics which he did not actually resolve.
He gives us clues occasionally, very perceptive clues
but he did not carry through to solve.
For example, he did not give us a solution
of the measurement problem.
The so-called Copenhagen rule which he and Niels Bohr proposed
gave us a way of doing physics without getting into trouble.
But the reason for the Copenhagen cut
is something that he never articulated explicitly
which he could have based upon the recognition
that bifurcation is false.
I have a question from the audience.
You seem to be a big, when I read your book
you seem to have a lot of quotes from Anziker.
I'm not sure how you pronounce it.
How do you pronounce it?
Well, Anziker is a great admirer of Albert Einstein.
In fact, in his recent book just published a short while ago
he goes into the Einsteinian physics in a very interesting way
and it clearly reveals that he regards Einsteinian physics
as the key to a deeper understanding of the subject.
And so on this point, Alexander, Anziker and I
are completely on opposite sides of the issue.
I regard Einsteinian physics as fundamentally misconceived.
The reason that this is not universally known or accepted
resides in the fact that Einsteinian physics differs
from classical physics mathematically by a square root
of 1 minus v squared over c squared
where b is the velocity of the object that you are speaking about
and c is the velocity of light.
Now, since the speed of light is about 300,000 kilometers per second
1 minus v squared over c squared
is so incredibly close to 1
unless you get up to speeds which approach the speed of light
which is very hard to do in an empirical setting.
So on account of this fact
the deviation between Einsteinian physics and non-Einsteinian physics
is so small as to be practically unmeasurable.
There is one, what is regarded as an Einsteinian formula
which is not covered by this observation
and that is a formula e equals mc squared
called the atom bomb formula.
Now, it is true that Einstein derived this formula from his 1905 paper
what is generally unknown even among physicists
in fact that the formula e equals mc squared
can also be derived from classical physics.
In a word, it has nothing to do with our relativity theory
and this is one of the reasons why Einsteinian physics
has been just about universally accepted
is because if you regard e equals mc squared
to be a relativistic formula
well that certainly unfortunately has proved itself to be absolutely correct.
So what I am saying is that
Einsteinian physics has not really passed
the empirical test.
People think it has
but if you actually go into the details
about 50 different experiments that can be listed
which were designed to test relativistic effects
not one of them really stands up under scrutiny
and the exception, the parent exception
the e equals mc squared formula
that does stand up under scrutiny
but it has nothing to do with relativity theory at all.
It can equally well be derived from classical physics.
So therefore I believe that
our present addiction if you will
to Einsteinian physics is misconceived
and I think the time will come perhaps very soon
when this will come to light
and Einstein will be discredited.
Right, but this person was asking about variable light speed
or at least the variable light speed.
I am not acquainted with the theory
but I am imagining that light can go different speeds
and that would probably solve some problems.
Yes, I am not an expert on these things at all.
I have done some inquiry into Einsteinian physics
because for various reasons this has interested me a lot
and I did as I have just indicated come to the conclusion
that the theory has been accepted on spurious grounds
that a lot of ideology enters into it.
It is a very complicated story.
I would love to read a book which has not yet been written
which so to speak gives the inside story
of what stands behind Einsteinian physics
and that fascination, that love affair if you will
that we have had with Einsteinian physics
I would be very interested to know more about that.
All I know is that there has been a lot of misconception
on this subject and in particular I do disagree
with Alexander Unziger on this point.
Fair enough.
It is not a question but a statement someone made could be me.
But many of the comments Dr. Smith has made
and his attention to Plato seems to align with ideas
we hear from John Furveki.
Well, could be me.
There is a, as far as Dr. Smith has done an interview
with John Furveki, at least one I think.
I had two conversations with him.
Well, there you go.
So if you are listening, check it out.
They are probably very, very good.
John Furveki is an excellent, excellent speaker.
Very creative mind.
I love the dear doctor.
Very pleased when I saw that one.
I was like, okay.
There's got to be some interesting things in there.
Yeah.
Yes, he's a very, very erudite man
and a very deep thinker
and I think what I admire most
is that he is truly a seeker of truth.
Truth is important to him.
Not for any ulterior motive,
but it is important because it should be important.
What is more important than truth?
Should we end it here?
We have been going on for two hours already
and my voices, I've actually been sick as a dog
and I'm trying not to cough.
What is acting up right now?
I think for my own sake, I have to stop this time.
Well, I thank you so much, Jack, for this interview.
I'm very happy to have had an opportunity
to discuss these matters
because I think they are very, very important.
Very important in a very broad sense.
I think our civilization has been under the influence
of certain materialist conceptions
which prove not to be true
and I think it is very, very important
that these things be rectified
and I think your program is doing a lot of good
in the sense that it is helping to bring clarity into these issues.
Thank you. I really hope so.
Thank you so much for having the stamina to talk for two hours.
Brian, thank you for joining us, for helping me.
Anybody who is listening, thank you too for your comments
and for listening.
I wish you all a very good night
and I will see you guys the next time.
Good night.
Thank you and alles Gute.
Thanks, Jack.
Jack, if you ever go to visit Wolfgang,
you better have more stamina than that
because he'll go till three in the morning.
Oh, that's good to know.
I did not expect this, honestly.
That's a good conversation.
Good night.
Good night. Thank you so much.
