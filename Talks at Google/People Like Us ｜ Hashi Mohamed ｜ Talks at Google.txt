a so they met in Kenya, where they were living,
all throughout the 80s, when I was growing up there.
And roughly when the war broke out in 1991, 1992 in Somalia,
so many of my family had moved over to Kenya,
seeking some sort of refuge and help.
And there was roughly around the time when the Dada refugee camp had opened up in Kenya.

But when his mother, his sisters, and his other siblings all were fleeing the war from Somalia and came to Kenya,
there was a choice to be made.
There was a choice to be made as to whether or not they were going to seek asylum outside of Africa,
or stay in Kenya, or as most people were thinking at that time,
the war is just going to die down in a bit and we'll just go back over and it's going to be fine.
But then a lot of my siblings then sought asylum and I have brothers and sisters who ended up in America,
some ended up in Canada, I have cousins who ended up in Sweden, in Norway, and all sorts of different countries.
And for my father we were going to stay and by this point it's sort of like 92, 93,
and then in 93 when a vast majority of my family had sought asylum where they could,
my father died in a car crash in Kenya.
So then that meant there was another choice to be made.
At this point my father's brother was given a full scholarship to study and then work in Italy,
where he was starting to establish himself and maybe start his own family.
And he came back to Kenya to bury his brother, my father.
And then there was another choice to be made there because he had to have a conversation with my mum and say,
do you stay here with these kids?
And my mum and father never learnt to read and write, they never were formally educated.
And they had to decide what to do.
My uncle's advice was you're here with no income, with no real way of feeding these children.
Either you follow this wave of people who are seeking asylum somewhere else in the world
and try and find a new place to start again with help,
or you stay here and nobody knows what's going to happen.
You now have with you five children under the age of 12.
And my mother said, well, okay, well, I think I could make it here,
but leave the youngest one and take the rest.
Which meant that we, the elder ones, ended up in London without our parents having just helped to bury our father.
So you could just imagine for a moment being a nine-year-old boy or as my sister's six-year-old girl, five-year-old girl,
turning up in a place like London without your mum, without your dad,
not understanding the language, I'd like to think I've mastered the English language now a little bit,
not understanding the culture, not understanding anything about what's happening.
Such was the shock for us that I still remember to this day, and I talk about it in the book,
walking down the street and where I'd come from in the semi-slum in Nairobi, there were no streetlights.
When walking down the street and literally walking into a lamppost and knocking myself out as a child,
that's just how different and new the environment was to us.
And settling in to a place like this when you don't understand the culture and the customs,
when you don't have an adult to explain to you what's happening, why it's happening,
what it means to be here, how it's going to work.
All of those things can be really, really difficult.
But here's the key point about that.
That kind of beginning and that kind of start for a lot of people like me,
especially Somalis who came and sought asylum in this country,
that was a really remarkably unremarkable thing.
In fact, in many ways we were lucky because we hadn't seen war.
My father's sister, who had come to Kenya and then the UK to seek asylum,
she had six kids of her own, but her husband had been killed in the war.
And all of her children had experienced the war.
At least with us, we hadn't experienced the war directly, but we were victims of the war indirectly.
And so in that sense, the starting point was remarkably unremarkable in that sense.
There was nothing special about the difficulties that we were facing at that time.
Then what happens after that?
Well, then it's, my mum comes four years later,
and then we're having to sort of get to know your mum all over again
because we now all speak English.
She doesn't speak any English.
You're trying to communicate with her.
She's speaking to us in Swahili and Somali, which we understand but not very well.
And you can imagine all the difficulties that then that causes.
I try and talk about it in the book as much as detail as I can,
but it was quite painful as you might imagine to sort of dig all that up and think it through
and what it meant and why certain choices were made
and why certain choices were not made and so on.
But then, you know, I did enough to get to GCSEs,
enough to get to the A levels,
enough to get to an undergraduate degree in law and French at the University of Hertfordshire.
I then got a full scholarship to do my postgraduate studies at Oxford University.
Then I got a full scholarship to study for the bar exams in London.
Then became a barrister fully qualified in 2012
and then here I am now promoting this book that is telling that story.
Now, you know, in many ways it's a sort of shortened version
and people say, well, now it must mean that, you know, it's smooth sailing from here.
Well, I mean, there's still plenty of time to mess this up.
You know, let's not get carried away.
But it's that kind of journey that I am still digesting in many ways
and I will continue to digest for quite some time
because there's no shame in admitting that the pain and the sorrow and the grief will take a lifetime.
And one of the ways in which a sociologist and a psychologist
and a neuroscientist that I interviewed for the book and talked about
were explaining how when grief, for example, or a traumatic event, it's really important.
Come on in, trust you to be very late.
Just one of those things that, you know, I know him, I'm not just picking up on him.
I'm not just picking on him.
And, you know, it's one of those things that people talk about when, you know, trauma or a death, for example,
people always say, well, you'll get over it. You'll get over it.
But actually one of the ways in which people explain that is they say,
well, imagine your brain is just this one big sort of circle.
When you're young and something very traumatic happens like death,
that particular event will be also another big circle within that brain circle of yours
because it will dominate a huge part of who you are.
But as you go older and as you mourn properly and as you digest that trauma,
that inner circle that signifies and represents that trauma
just gets slightly smaller compared to that part of your brain that is there to be dealing with it.
So in other words, you never get over it.
It just becomes a smaller part of who you are, the contours of your life,
the part of what makes you a whole human being.
And that is, for me, the best way in which somebody described to me the way in which we deal with trauma
and death and that kind of thing that happens to you in our life.
So it's quite important that you don't always come across to people or say to somebody,
well, you'll get over it. It's fine. Time will heal you.
That's just not the right way to look at it.
Because if you do, you're going to come up against the wall that hits you and hits you and hits you.
So what about the book in terms of the themes?
Well, the themes that I've looked into here are quite varied and big.
So the book ranges from what is happening to you as a child
and sort of what is happening to you in the womb of your mother
and the kind of diet that your mother's having
in terms of what kind of human being that you grow up to become
or the way through to whatever fulfilling career you're looking for,
whatever fulfilling destiny that you want
if you've ever dreamt of ever being at Google or whatever it is.
What exactly is happening at each stage that allows you to be able to succeed
and how does it all come together is the kind of overall thesis of the book.
So I touch upon this idea, for example,
which is all the things that people talk about biological determinism, for example.
Are you born with your talents?
Or is it part of your environment that actually teaches you?
What does the science suggest?
How does it affect me personally?
How do I think that my illiterate parents
who were never formally educated are a part of who I am now
and actually does it mean that your intelligence can be measured
by way of sort of formal education
as opposed to informal education and life lessons?
And does it mean that your destiny is determined
purely by virtue of the fact that you may or may not be born
to people who actually know how to read and write, for example?
It's quite controversial, but I tackle it in the book.
The answer is more or less it's 50-50.
But equally, you may be born with some talent,
but your environment may well suppress it.
You may be born with very little talent,
but the right environment might really, really accentuate that
and make you push whatever little talent you were born with
to a level that it goes to.
The way I put it is how do you make sure
that somebody's environment doesn't determine their destiny
in the same way as somebody's environment
manages to protect them from their destiny?
And that's the best way to look at the nature and nurture debate
in that context.
Education.
How many of you guys have heard governments, politicians, ministers
always say education's the answer?
Education, education, education.
If you just get them to school and they know how to write
and get a university degree, they will be fine.
How many times do you always hear that?
You hear that so many times.
Well, I've got a news flash for you.
The idea that education is the answer or even the main answer
to the conundrum of social mobility is nonsense.
Complete and utter nonsense.
And I'll tell you why.
Education for education's sake is fundamental
to the human progress.
You need to learn how to be literate and numerate
and be able to communicate and be able to understand people.
You need to be able to read a bank statement.
You need to be able to fill out forms.
You need to be able to understand, you know,
the mechanics of communicating with human beings
both in writing and in speaking.
Of course, that's a given.
But the idea that more exams and more degrees
and more qualifications necessarily equals a trajectory
in which you will become socially mobile,
it just doesn't follow.
It doesn't follow and we've got to tackle that head on
because the consequence of not tackling that
is putting pressure on our education system.
It's putting pressure on our teachers.
It's putting crazy pressure on the kids
and it's putting forward unrealistic expectations
on parents who are desperately trying to do
what they can for their children.
And I set that out what that means in the book.
And then when you translate that into what that looks like,
take this example that was found by a couple of academics
at the London School of Economics,
Sam Friedman and Daniel Morrison
who wrote a book called The Class Ceiling.
They looked at two individuals and took and made sure
they controlled for degree classification,
the subject that they studied,
the kind of university they went to
and then the kind of entry job that they had.
The only difference between these two people
is that one went to a state school
and one went to a private school.
Everything else has been controlled for, okay?
When they get into that same entry job,
it turns out that the person who went to private school
within three and a half years is earning 16% more.
How do you account for that?
These are two individuals who more or less
had the exact same trajectory
when you control for everything else
except for what school they went to.
And yet, three and a half years later,
one is earning 16% more
based on what school they went to.
How do you explain that
if education and especially tertiary education
was supposed to be this great equalizer?
Was supposed to be this moment
that everybody becomes equal
in terms of equality of opportunity?
Again, there are no easy answers to this,
but I delve into it and I try and figure out
what it could mean
and what are the kind of unwritten rules,
the social capital, connections,
the cultural capital,
how you understand the culture in which you're going into,
the barrister profession, where I am now as a barrister.
Cultural capital is huge.
Being able to understand how people communicate
when they talk about what school
and what college you went to,
rather than saying,
what did you study?
They will say, what did you read?
And that's the kind of lingo
that Oxbridge types will understand
and maybe others wouldn't.
And that cultural capital can make a difference.
And again, what does that mean
if we keep banging on about
the fact that education is the answer?
Another big theme in the book
is the role of luck.
How many of you guys believe you're lucky in life?
Okay, and for those of you who don't put your hand up,
do you think it's all you put your hand up?
You worked hard to be here.
One person, that's good.
I hope you're being ironic.
Because if you're not, you really need to read the book.
Luck is important because
especially successful people
tend to tell a story that it's all them,
that they worked hard,
that it was all down to them.
And I give about four or five examples of that.
But I'll share with you two examples.
Jeff Bezos.
Am I allowed to mention the names of competitor organisations?
Jeff Bezos talks about
and many of the sort of founding fathers
or individuals who start up tech companies
always tell this story of
I founded my company in a garage.
You know what I mean?
It was in my garage.
I sat there and I worked hard and it came together.
This nonsense that they tell people
about it all began in this garage.
Have you seen that image of Jeff Bezos sitting in his garage
with Amazon written on fountain pen
and sitting there hunched in front of his computer
and he built this billion dollar?
Well, here's the footnote.
The footnote is in 1995.
Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250,000
for free to start up his company
and all of the connections and people that he needed to know
and all of the things that he needed to push to be where he is.
And of course, things picked up in a way that has been exponential
and arguably in a way that we will never see happen again.
In the way that it happened at that particular moment in time.
Now, if that's not lucky,
I don't know what is.
But that's not the story we tell, right?
That's not the story we tell.
The story we tell is he worked hard in this garage
and look at this guy now.
He deserves to be there.
And the reason why that's a problem
is because we set then unrealistic expectations
about what success looks like.
We then set people up for failure.
We then tell people the kind of stories
that I consider to be irresponsible
when it comes to people's expectations
of what they're worth, of what's possible,
and what's probable in your set of circumstances.
And that's the kind of thing that I'm talking about in the book
and I try and lay out.
Another example is Bill Gates,
where we all know about how he came about
with the natural stories he dropped out of Harvard.
And, you know, he's amazing.
Look at him now.
What they don't tell you is that he's one of the very few people
who had access to the early computer
in a way that was unprecedented and learnt hours and hours
and hours of coding and programming
and being able to do it in such a way that his parents,
in that context, in that environment in Seattle,
allowed for him to grow in a way that, again,
arguably will never see again.
But when you hear about his story,
you hear he dropped out of Harvard, right?
Dropouts are good.
Dropouts can succeed, too.
I won't get to the big guys of yours.
That's for another time.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
But luck.
Luck is an example.
The way...
There's a really good professor briefly.
I'll mention by the name of Robert Frank at Cornell University,
who's written a really fantastic book about luck,
success and luck.
And the way he describes luck
is actually, interestingly,
and I occasionally were talking about bikes earlier in a different context,
but you're riding a bicycle,
and when you're riding your bicycle and you're riding it really strongly
and the wind is blowing at you,
you're fully aware of the wind because it's pushing at you.
You're, like, struggling.
Your feet are pedaling away.
You're feeling that the wind, that current, is pushing back at you.
That's you being fully aware of your bad luck
because it's there.
It's constant.
It's consistent.
But say you take a left,
and now you're going downhill in a slight incline,
and now the wind is in your back
and you're cycling fast and you're flying.
You will only notice that the wind is in your back
and you're on the incline for the first 10 seconds.
After that, you're more likely to say it's all me.
You're much more likely to say it's all me
because look how fit I am.
That's you hardly ever noticing good luck.
You will always be aware of bad luck,
but you're less likely to notice good luck.
And again, I set that out in the book.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I'm no shrinking violet.
I do think I'm special too.
And I don't want to undermine my own talents and what I'm good at,
but it would be a complete nonsense
and a folly to not acknowledge the number of times
I've had help, the number of mentors who've shown me the way,
the number of second chances I've had,
the number of opportunities that people have given me,
that I then recognized, that I then worked on,
that I then pushed.
And that's important
because otherwise another different story
is both irresponsible and sets people up for failure.
That's another, you know, it's really important that I impart that to you.
The next themes in the book are in relation to concepts like confidence.
Where does this idea of confidence come from?
What does it take for you to be confident enough to be in a room like this
and address people and talk in a big meeting
and hold your own and be confident?
What does that actually look like?
What does it taste like?
How do you teach it?
Can you teach it?
Can you learn it?
Can you unlearn it?
What are the kind of contexts that give it a boost?
And what are the kind of contexts that undermine it?
It's all there.
I delve into that.
Imagination is another chapter
which is about this idea that if you're coming from,
you know, one of the most deprived areas of the country
and you have never met a barrister or a programmer
or somebody who works in an environment that you hope to aspire to one day,
how do you have the imagination to, first of all,
picture yourself there and then actually work towards it?
How does that happen?
It's a big question and I try and tackle it.
And then there's another question which is often quite controversial
and I get in trouble for it.
This is a country in particular.
How many of you guys grew up in the UK?
Just out of interest.
Good.
So those of you who grew up in the UK will recognise instantly,
perhaps less so the ones who didn't,
but you might recognise it now that you're living here more.
This is a country that is obsessed with a lot of things,
but one of the things that it is really deeply obsessed with is accents.
And how you speak and how you communicate can, in so many ways,
determine whether or not you will be successful in this country,
despite what your qualifications show
and despite how competent you might be
and despite how gifted you might be.
I am not ashamed of saying it.
English is my third language.
I didn't speak like this when I was growing up
and my accent has undoubtedly changed.
I speak in different ways depending on different languages,
depending on who I'm talking to,
depending on where I am and depending on what I'm trying to achieve.
That's the reality of understanding the world as it is
rather than the world as you would like it to be.
And so if it occurs to you very early on in your life,
it turns out that they say that it's very hard for you
to change your accent after the age of 25,
so some of you it's too late.
So don't worry about it.
If very early on it occurs to you that this is a fundamental issue,
for example, not me saying this,
but the statistics show that if you have a Scouser accent from Liverpool,
a Geordi accent from Newcastle or the Northeast,
or a Brummy accent from Birmingham and the black country,
you will be significantly and disproportionately discriminated against.
28% of people believe that they have been discriminated against
based on their accents,
and they are right because 80%,
80% of employers say they have been discriminated against people
during interviews based on their accents.
Now, if you're faced with that kind of fact,
do you still keep your accent or do you change how you speak?
I'll ask a different question.
How many of you still speak how you spoke when you were 15?
Put your hand up.
Exact same how you spoke when you were 15,
two people out of the rest of the other people who are in this room.
Sorry, I didn't see if you guys might have said the same.
Ish.
For me, if you still speak in that accent,
I would argue that that suggests in some ways
that you were born into a particular accent
that allows you to be able to keep it in one way or another.
It has to be.
Those who say to you, oh, you're changing and you're not being yourself,
you're being inauthentic, just be yourself, it's guff, it's nonsense.
It sets you up for failure and I am not ashamed of saying so.
You just got to read the book.
Now, the last thing I'd add is there's a lot more about employment,
what employers should be doing,
how to improve employment practices,
and just generally about my reflections of how and where things are going.
I thought I'd read for you then a slight short bit in the book
before we open it up to question and answer.
I've spoken for a bit longer.
I hope this is not single use.
I like it.
I read you this small passage here
that encapsulates the book in a nutshell for you
so that when you are reading it,
you can more or less know what it's about based on this bit here.
The reality remains that for a young refugee boy
who buried his father at the age of nine,
arrived in Britain without his mother
and was brought up in poverty and among profound deprivation.
The chances that you would be writing a book like this one are minuscule.
Not impossible, but highly improbable.
In that context, what politicians should really be saying is this.
The chance of you succeeding in Britain today is down to many factors.
The wealth and profession of your parents,
the kind of school you attended, your mental and physical health,
and the quality of your early environment in terms of stability and attention.
You will need to work harder than you have ever imagined
and hope that whatever talents you have,
given the fast-paced development of automation,
you are still going to be needed when you grow up.
You will need a lot of luck as you go,
and let's hope that along the way someone explains to you
the unwritten rules of the world you want to join.
And you will need to make it through all of that
with your belief in yourself and your vision in your future still intact.
And then, maybe, you'll make it.
It's a bit of a mouthful, but it's certainly better than people
that say when we live in a meritocratic society.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
APPLAUSE
So, maybe up to questions.
I'm going to ask mine first, for I'm selfish.
Please wait until you have the mic because it is needed for the video.
So, my question, which I know the answer,
but I also like to hear the detail behind it, is
so it would a child arriving from a similar situation now to Britain
have a better experience than you or a worse experience?
It's a very good question.
A child arriving today would almost certainly not have
the best experience that they might have had when I was growing up,
partly because things have hardened in society these days.
I don't think we've become more racist or more intolerant.
I personally don't think we have.
I think we've more or less been as racist and as intolerant, as normal.
It's just we're more aware of it now because of social media
and all of the things that are out there.
So, in some ways, I think it's harder because it's all in your face
and it can be quite demoralising.
But I think your life is easier because now more than ever,
we're more aware generally.
Now, that doesn't mean that we're more aware because people are aware
because they're kind of curious.
I think we're more aware because the information is out there.
The data is out there.
The opportunities are out there.
People are talking about this issue everywhere I go.
Everyone's talking about diversity and inclusion and diversity
and all this, that and the other.
Now, I talk about the book how a lot of organisations are doing this
in a very cat-handed way and actually some of them are causing more damage
to the system, good, but at least it's out there.
At least we're talking about it.
And I gave an interview to the Guardian or the Observer.
I can't remember.
Where I said in the book, I said in that interview, I said,
I wish I had a book like this where I'm talking about what it feels like
to be growing up lonely without information, without data,
without understanding how to sort out my homelessness situation,
without getting somebody to help you with the application form
or just anything, any sort of information out there.
How do we find it?
So, in a way, things are worse because of the kind of climate
that we're living in, but actually things are a lot better
because of the fact that so much of this information now is available
to you in a way that it's never been before.
Hi.
Thanks, Hashi.
This is an incredible story.
A lot kind of resonates a little bit with some of the stuff
that I've got for.
I guess it's advice, really.
So, people from my community come and say, look, how do I crack
this puzzle of British society?
How do I?
And now you can say to them, buy this book?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And what you've articulated really well is the facts of life.
And so, I struggle sometimes with what I would aspire the culture
to be versus what the culture actually is.
And perhaps what my experience was is perhaps not the experience
that you will be having.
So, I can give the experience.
So, my question, I suppose, is how do we give advice
without being too cynical or perhaps it's changed?
Yeah.
Well, it's a very good question because my experience
growing up as a young black kid with a Muslim name is not going
to be the same as a young Asian kid growing up in a city London
in similar or worse set of circumstances, right?
And for me, the best advice I tell them, and there is some cynicism
in that, is that it's really, really basic and it's really fundamental.
It is critical that you treat the world as you find it rather
than some utopia of what it you hope it to be.
And the sort of advice that people give, especially in my profession,
that just be yourself, you'll be fine.
It is such poisonous crap that for somebody who doesn't have the information,
the wherewithal, the understanding, the context,
the ability to actually question that, it is such poison for you.
Because what then happens is that you be yourself without understanding
that the world doesn't work like that.
And pretty soon you get to a point where you're in conflict with yourself
because when you realize that the world doesn't accept you as you are,
where are you going to turn to?
Because what you've been told to believe is be yourself because the world is fair
and you'll be fine.
Because soon when you realize that doesn't work but you still believe the world is fair,
then the logical conclusion is that the world that is fair won't accept me for who I am.
And that's the trouble.
And so you have to be cynical in that you have to understand that the world as it is
rather than as we would like it to be isn't the same thing.
But then the question then becomes when you do make it and when you do get to the point
where you are successful, whatever success looks like for you,
it is important that you tell a responsible story of your rise.
And that's what I'd like to say I'm doing now is, yeah, I knew what I was worth.
I know what my talents are worth.
I knew that if I sat the same exams at the bar school,
I knew if I did the same assessments when I was being interviewed to be a barrister
that I'd be as good as anyone else.
But what I didn't know was if I walk into a room and one of the softer skills is that,
you know, did you get to see Richard III's performance last weekend or which is the longest
Shakespearean play turns out is Hamlet.
And you don't have that kind of cultural capital that you didn't learn in inner city London
that kind of feel that people have in a profession like mine where we all do is not just my profession.
Every profession, people recruit in their own image.
You recruit with people like us.
You recruit in a way of, do I like this person?
Can I work with this person?
Dare I say, it happens right here.
And so when you realize that and you realize that it's not just about your grades,
although that's a good start, it's not just about your performance and competence,
but it's a lot what sociologists call the homophily, which is the idea of you recruiting people
who are just like you because you are effectively then creating a tribe.
Once you appreciate that, that's the key.
And so the ideal world is I'd like to think, for example, just on the point about accents.
Of course, I'd like to live in a world where people judge me based on what I have to say
rather than how I have to say it.
But when you realize that there is a deeper social conditioning,
that means that what I have to say will basically become muted after the first couple of words
that they've heard you speak in a particular accent, you'd be mad to ignore that.
You'd be mad.
That's my view.
People might disagree, but that's my view.
Thank you so much for coming and sharing your story with us.
It's fascinating.
I think it's a very good point, and I'm just struggling with it a little bit
because I've been here for just over a year, and I am a member of the Gaglers,
which is one of the ERGs, is an employee group, and we work really hard as volunteers
to make sure that people like me can come here and be themselves.
And I've always felt that at Google I can be myself.
I am gay, I am Latino, and I talk to people at work about everything that I do,
about who I am, yes, I have an accent, and sometimes I feel the accent thing,
and I agree with you, and I work in the legal department.
I know that people like me, if they want to become baristas like yourself,
it would be much, much harder, but how...
Not the coffee makers, though.
Yeah, exactly.
So my question to you is, how do you change that?
I mean, if it is so difficult, how do you change that?
Because I think it's a little bit unrealistic to expect that we all try to become something else
so that we can fit in.
No, I completely agree in the sense that it's not easy.
I talk about it in the book.
I say, look, there is a tension.
There is a tension between saying you need to adapt to the set of circumstances you're in
to be able to get on, and the tension on the other side of that is,
well, how are we going to change everything when we're all aspiring to join this mono culture?
Just true.
It's a very good point.
I accept that, but then the attack in my judgment has to be twofold.
The attack has to be on an individual basis and on a systematic basis.
On an individual basis, I've made the choices that I've made,
and I'm not suggesting that everyone else should.
And on a systematic basis, I am putting the feet to the fire by talking about it.
The trouble with expecting an individual to go up against the system is that you will always lose.
The game is rigged, and as an individual, you will lose.
But then, if there is a critical mass of people like me and you who are then hopefully sitting at the top table,
slowly but surely, we will get some sort of progress.
It probably won't happen in our lifetime, but we will get there.
But the trouble of insisting that an individual remains who they are is to pit two different individuals.
You're pitting a giant against a matchstick, and the giant will always win.
And so I accept that there is that tension.
Of course there is, but it's not reconcilable within our lifetime, and that's the conclusion I've come to.
And the final thing is that we won't be able to reconcile it within our lifetime,
and the insistent that individuals be themselves with all that comes with that is that you end up dying at the altar of authenticity.
And it's not worth it.
I want to hear if you disagree with me. I want to hear like, come on, man.
I want people who disagree with me.
Because I want to write in the next book.
I was interested to hear about luck and accents.
Do you feel that that's a particularly British construct?
Because I grew up in Australia, a similar private schooling system.
I've spent a lot of time studying in Germany and Holland where they don't have as much of that.
It does exist in Australia as well.
The Australian system is directly geared from the British system, but in places like Germany,
they're very, very, by comparison to me, like you have to submit your like high school grades when you go for a job.
They try to be as objective as possible.
If you were to say there's like 200 countries in the world just for round's sake,
where would you put the UK in terms of like meritocratic?
I did a quiz last night.
Turns out that the UN recognises 193 countries, but yeah, yeah.
The UK, the UK.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
That's a very, where would I put the UK?
That's a very good question.
So, for example, like China is known as quite meritocratic, it's very, like...
Yeah, you got it.
Yeah, yeah.
They're trying to do that in Germany.
You have less of this, like, old foyer system.
Very good question.
Very good question.
I'll take that, another question there and then the guy over there and then I'll answer three of them together.
Yes.
You spoke about confidence, but I'm also interested in your take about motivation.
If it's ever a real thing, actually.
Definitely.
You mean the ability to motivate yourself?
Yeah, correct.
Especially when things are extremely hard and if you have like concrete examples.
And the other thing is you spoke at the very beginning about controversial things that you write and trolls and like, what is it about?
It's on Twitter, just people who write to me about, especially on the accent thing.
The accent thing is a big problem for a lot of English people, trust me.
Right there.
I'll take the last one on there.
So a motivation on there and accents on Australia and the question about meritocracy in the world.
I'll come to that.
Sorry, thank you very much.
This may be covered in your book, but my question was an aspiration like us as a society aspiring to be better than who we are.
And I want to get your thoughts on that, given the fact, given your argument around accepting the world as it is, as opposed to as it should be.
And if we are doing that, aren't we setting ourselves up to just remain just as we are or evolve slower?
I don't know.
Very good question.
So in other words, if you accept the world as it is, does that limit your aspiration?
Okay, good question.
So just dealing with the question about accents, Australia and even Americans to some extent have borrowed a huge part of the class structures.
It just manifests itself in a different way.
I'd slightly disagree with you in Germany because Germany has got a similar issue in one sense because actually if you're from Bavaria, as opposed to another region of Germany, there is a slight snobbery depending on which part of Germany you're in.
So they have their own bits as well, but you're right in the sense that they are trying a little bit harder.
The only problem with the German education system when I've been looking into this is that they make people choose very early on what they want to be.
So you pretty much, by the age you're 14, 15, you pretty much have to decide whether you want to go down the vocational route or a professional route.
At 15, I could barely speak much English.
So the idea that my destiny could have been determined at the age of 15, you know, but you know what I mean.
And in terms of, there's all these different indexes about where the UK is on this thing and it turns out that the UK and the US are right at the bottom, right at the bottom in that index of what it means to be socially mobile.
But having said that, I gave an interview to the Guardian. My wife is Swedish and she always bangs on about how the Scandinavian countries are super meritocratic.
And that's also nonsense because what you find is that the Swedish and especially Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Norway and Sweden,
Finland is part of the Nordic countries. It isn't Scandinavian.
They spend a huge amount of money on education and really training people early on.
And so they make sure that by the time you get to 15, 16, you have really made huge amount of progress in terms of basic education.
But then when you look at what we call absolute mobility, in other words, are you doing better than your parents when it comes to the kind of progress that you make?
Sweden isn't doing that much better. There's a really good book called The Sun Also Rises, S-O-N.
And it shows different surnames. It tracks social mobility through surnames.
And it shows that basically Sweden is owned by about five families for a millennium.
And that has just meant that basically, so in absolute terms, they're trying to galvanize and push people up.
But in relative terms, I really don't think that Sweden is making that as much progress as people give them credit for.
I'll have to answer these guys and I'll come back to you.
On the question of motivation, it's a very difficult one.
If you're sitting there working hard, pushing yourself, and then you have to get up in the morning and it's raining and it's cold and you just want to be under your duvet, it's not easy.
And motivation is something I looked into for the book and there's a lot in there about what's often described as instant gratification and delayed gratification.
So the idea that when I was growing up, you walk around the streets and all the guys with the nicest cars are the drug dealers or whatever,
but you have to believe that you've got to go to this crap school and get the grades and that one day I'll be something.
That's delayed gratification. Instant gratification is just like, get this.
Why don't I just go there now and I can have that car and those nice trainers, which is not reality.
So for me, what I argue is that you've got to find that motivation for yourself wherever it comes from.
My own personal motivation was always that I just wanted better than what I had.
I was just like, I want to buy a house because we've never had our own place.
We've always lived six to a room.
I was like, I want to be able to buy whatever I want without ever asking anyone and just work towards that.
It was materialistic to begin with, but it's just that visceral feeling of being able to control more of your own life that has been that huge motivation for me.
I struggle with it even now sometimes. We're all lazy.
We're all bored and we're all trying to find different ways to motivate ourselves.
Trust me, even the most driven people have their moments.
So don't ever believe that, again, it goes back to that thing about I dropped out of Harvard, I started my thing in a garage.
It's complete nonsense. We're all facing our own deep challenges, whatever that might be.
On the question of the challenge and the tension between accepting the world as it is and to what extent, then, does that limit your aspiration?
My point about accepting the world as it is isn't necessarily linked to aspiration.
It's simply a question of tools.
So whatever your aspiration is, keep it there.
But don't expect that the world is going to be kind to you, generous to you, nice to you and treat you in good faith simply because you want to aspire to that aspiration.
What I'm saying is you have to accept the world as it is because they're not going to judge you just based on your grades.
They're not just going to judge you based on your raw talent.
They're not going to just judge you based on your competence, which is what people tell you, right?
People tell you just study hard, work hard, do the right thing, and it will come together.
And what I'm saying is that's not true.
There's a lot more deeper that you need to dig.
That doesn't mean lower your aspiration.
It just means that the route that you're going to take is going to be a lot more bumpier because you're realistic about the world as it is rather than as you would like it to be.
Which is more likely to treat you to a sort of instant failure.
Any other couple of questions before we wrap up?
I've been told, I don't mind, I've got time.
So as long as you guys have got time, I'm happy to take whatever questions.
I'll take a few together.
Thank you so much for sharing your story.
I'm really looking forward to reading the book.
You said at the beginning that ultimately you don't think education is the key to social mobility.
Yet you yourself are a prime example of somebody who's chose to pursue higher education and whose ultimate career and where you are now is a result of that.
So if it's not education and we're talking about young people that maybe don't have parents who can give them the best advice, what is the key mobility tool?
A very good question.
I'm really interested in your definition of success.
My hunch is that you just said about being able to buy what you want.
That kind of sits very much within a capitalist idea of success.
How does that sit against happiness?
What is the measure of being successful or making it as you refer to?
Very good.
Lady there and then there's one more here I think.
So I'll take those two and then I haven't forgotten.
No, that's all right. We can start there and then go there.
Yes, exactly.
I guess on the one hand where we have to conform.
But on the other hand we have to also push HR departments to have a different system where they're not looking.
Maybe they're not allowed to look at people or listen to people until they make a certain judgment that allows those people to get to a certain degree.
So I just wouldn't want to discount that, but I totally agree with you.
What you're saying seems to fit in with yet you've got to dress a certain way.
It's not just accent.
You've got to dress a certain way.
It's your mannerisms.
It's all sorts of things and totally agree that you have to play the game to agree.
How do we best help children or children and teenagers?
Good question. I'll take that last one to the lady there.
You haven't yet mentioned like inclinations.
We talked about motivation, but I'm looking at it from a slightly different perspective.
I work a lot with children with cancer and teenagers with cancer who miss out on a load of school, their lives.
They can either.
They've had a lot of bad luck.
You talk about cycling against the wind and the wind being behind you.
Their choice when the wind is behind them, sometimes they don't even want to be on the bike.
How do you instill that inclination to be hungry to look for the opportunities?
Because that fits with everything you're talking about because you still have to look for those opportunities.
So how do you instill that and what you discuss in the book about inclination?
That's a very good question about inclination.
So just starting out with education.
What I'm trying to say is that education is not the answer.
I'm not suggesting that it's not part of the answer, but it's not even the main answer I would argue.
Simply because if we see education as even having this relationship with social mobility in the way that politicians talk about it, we're setting kids up for failure.
What I'm saying instead is that education is just one of those life things like breathing, like sleeping, like just peace, whatever.
Just to kind of think of anything that is just a standard thing that you do when you brush your teeth.
That's what education is.
The idea of constantly obsessing over then linking it to people becoming more socially mobile is where I'm disagreeing and I talk about that.
And the other stuff that I talk about that comes with that is exactly as I've sort of alluded to in the end, you know, the circumstances in which you're growing up in.
The kind of aspirations you're exposed to by your parents.
The fact that you can have a decent diet at home to be able to allow your brain to grow and not have anxiety
and not have the kind of jittery ways in which you're then going to develop issues later on in life.
The kind of things about mentoring that allows you to, the chapter on mentoring I, is subtitled Filling in the Blanks.
So if you don't know what you don't know, having those people around you to be able to show you language.
So there's loads of other things I argue that make up the bigger social mobility story, but this intense focus on education.
There was a famous Tony Blair, former Prime Minister's speech where he said education, education, education.
Again, that was a classic example of putting the emphasis in my judgment in the wrong place.
That's what I mean.
So I don't want to undermine the purpose and need of education.
Just plowing through a few of the other questions.
On the question of what it means to be successful, you have to define that for yourself.
And I do talk about that in the book.
I talk about happiness.
I do talk about not necessarily seeking out the kind of happiness that means that you are monetarily more happy,
but rather that you're happy and successful in the sense that you have pursued what you're good at
and what you're not so good at, what you enjoy, what you don't enjoy,
and the kind of things that allow you to grow as a human being.
Now, to ignore money would be a folly.
To ignore money and income is just nonsense.
Either it's nonsense or you've grown up financially secure and independently wealthy to which extent it means nothing to you.
But I say in the book, if you're going to try to be, for example, a lawyer, pick an area of law.
If you're a socially mobile person, pick an area of law that will allow you to earn a lot of money.
Why get obsessed over human rights and I want to save the world?
When you've come from a very poor set of circumstances, in those areas of law, you're not likely to make much money
and therefore not likely to transform the lives of your family.
Whereas if you pick an area that does give you a decent income, then you can change your life.
You can change that.
Don't be ashamed of that.
There's no shame in that.
The shame is when you make it your sole central goal.
Finally on that, it's really interesting how football, I'm a big football fan, is a huge meritocracy.
If you think about it, it's raw, raw talent.
And it's no wonder that a lot of the people who make it into it are just dirt poor.
Dirt, dirt poor, most of them.
And then when you meet a lot of these kids who are growing up in inner city London today,
the vast majority of them, most kids, even if they're growing up in nice circumstances,
want to be footballers, but disproportionately, poor kids want to be footballers.
Why? Because it's the first opportunity that they think they can have through their own hard work to change their lives.
There is something there.
On the question of inclination, I'm not a scientist, I don't know what instinctively occurs to people,
but I do talk about how much your early life exposure can make a difference to your inclination.
So, for example, if you're growing up in a household where every morning everyone's leaving for work at six in the morning
and getting up and having breakfast as opposed to what is often pejoratively termed by different governments
and waking up in households where the curtains are never drawn until midday,
I think that there is something there about an inclination that happens for a child very early on
that then sets the tone for the rest of their lives.
But if you're somebody facing cancer and lots of issues with cancer and problems like that,
chances of your inclination being quite there is very hard because you probably believe,
I don't know, but you probably believe and feel that life is giving you a pretty raw deal.
And so, why are you going to be more inclined to get up if you think I didn't deserve this
and now I'm ridden with this horrible disease that I have no control over?
So, I haven't gone into too much detail, but I do talk about inclination to an extent.
On the final question, I remember it briefly, but you're going to have to just tell me one word and it will come to me.
The HR, the HR, it's a very good point.
So, the HR points is a really interesting one, so we have to do more to help HR.
So, I interviewed a lot of HR people for this book and what was really fascinating was they said to me,
ah, we had this amazing young lady, she was really talented, she was so good, but she had an Essex accent.
We can't put her, you know what she said to me?
She said, I'd love to hire her, but I can't put her in front of the clients.
Think about that. You get to a point where you've managed to convince the HR people to not judge somebody based on their mannerisms or the way they speak.
But then another hurdle appears out of nowhere where she says, what are the clients going to say?
I can't put her in front of the clients.
So, then I say we need to move towards an environment where if the HR department has decided this person is competent,
then you should be prepared to put that person in front of the clients or tell your clients to take their business elsewhere.
Now, what company is going to do that on their bottom line?
Come on, come on, think about it.
Not many companies are going to be prepared to take that hit right now, but we're slowly moving in the right direction.
The point I'm making is that what I'm learning in this process of writing is that every time we seem to find a solution,
we seem to hit our heads against a new problem that we may or may not have noticed before,
that has always been there but has become to the forefront of where it is.
Anyway, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
