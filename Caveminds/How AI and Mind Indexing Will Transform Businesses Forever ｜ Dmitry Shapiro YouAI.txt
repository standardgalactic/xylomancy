And we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at communicating
with one another because communication can be radically better.
And alignment can be radically better and disambiguation can be radically better.
People say words, other people hear something else or they project something else onto it.
Something needs to help us communicate with one another and AI is going to do that.
And indexing plus AI does just that.
Welcome to the caveminds podcast.
Welcome to the caveminds podcast here.
We are, we got exciting yesterday, Dmitri Shapiro, and he is the co-founder CEO of UAI
and he's got a pretty extensive background and I'm excited to kind of share that through
with everybody.
So Dmitri, aside from being the co-founder CEO of UAI and Koji, another company, he's
also the founder CEO of Go Meta Inc. based in San Diego.
And Dmitri, feel free to jump in at any point if I'm not reading this right.
But before this, he created the video sharing site Vale, which I've, everyone has used back
in 2005.
And then he served as a CTO at MySpace, which is one of the most epic companies that everyone
used back in the day.
And then before moving on to Google, where he took up a role of Group Product Manager.
And then after that, Dmitri left Google to found Go Meta.
And then he has a bachelor's in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of
Technology.
Is that, is that pretty good, Dmitri?
I think it hits a bunch of points.
I'm not sure if that it's in the right order, but that's all right.
It's complicated.
Yeah.
So the way I describe myself these days is I'm an old nerd.
I started writing code in 1984 when I was in high school.
I studied electrical engineering and got a degree, but I've never done a day of it.
I've always done software.
I most recently before finding Go Meta, which is the company that owns Koji and owns UAI.
So these are two platforms that Go Meta Inc. the holding company owns.
And I'm CEO of Go Meta Inc.
And therefore, CEO of these two platforms, Koji and UAI.
Prior to that, I was at Google for four years on the main campus for the first three years.
I ran three machine learning teams, a product for three machine learning teams that were
crunching a bunch of implicit signals that Google had.
Prior to that, I was CTO of Myspace and then prior to that, I founded two other venture
about companies.
One was a major competitor to YouTube called VO Networks, which is the one you mentioned.
And then I also built a venture backed cybersecurity company, enterprise software cybersecurity
company called Aconics Systems, raised 34 million for that, raised 70 million for VO.
And then before both of those for five years from 95 to 99, I built the web team at Fujitsu,
which is giant Japanese company.
And so as I said, I'm just an old nerd.
You've been around, definitely.
I mean, that's a lot of experience there.
And then I think they're really destroyed.
I think total, roughly, I think you've raised over 140 million venture capital from various
companies.
Okay.
So let's jump into it.
Because then our main topic here is we, at CaveMinds, we've got thousands of founders
from networks like EO, YPO, Vistage, and a lot of startup grind, some wine accommodator
people.
And then I think our main thing is that we want to bring on AI leaders.
And that's why we have you here today.
It's like people that have done it, been there and are still doing it today and just building
stuff within AI, even beyond that, like real AI.
And then sharing the practical applications and what they need to consider and just shedding
more light.
Because I've been having conversations with a lot of these founders that have built businesses,
but in outside of AI, and then if they're non-technical, they're all overwhelmed.
They don't know what's happening.
They see all these tools.
They're using ChatGPD.
They're prompting, but they really don't know what they don't know.
And they kind of stick to their lane.
So and I think that's one of the things when I was checking on UAI was like, wow, you've
simplified the ability to allow people, developers, or even founders to go on and build an app
within AI that they can actually start then releasing it and launching it.
It's almost like you're creating the AI app marketplace essentially, especially, yeah,
exactly there.
And Mind Studio, especially to allow them to build in with it.
And everything I like about UAI for all of you listeners, check it out, go on there because
you can go on there and you can actually see what is what is currently available.
And it's all laid out in a very simple way.
So there's no complex jargon or like text and stuff for you to like complicate and overwhelm
me like other AI things.
It's like really simple and easy to understand, which is not easy to do, especially to distill
that information.
Always making it a little bit crisper and tighter and constantly working on messaging
because these are complex things to describe to people.
This is new to everyone.
I've been working with machine learning since 2006 when we started using it at VO against
a YouTube competitor.
We actually had recommendations, video recommendations before YouTube had them.
My chief scientist at that time was Dr. Ted Dunning, who's a sort of world renowned expert
in collaborative filtering, which is sort of a form of machine learning.
Not exactly machine learning, but used for similar things, prior generations version
of machine learning.
So anyway, so yeah, I appreciate the compliment and I sympathize with founders who are trying
to build companies in this environment.
Again, this is my third venture back company.
I've now been doing this one for seven years, the other two or five years each.
So there you go, 17 years of this.
And I think this is the most interesting time, meaning it has many variables that must be
considered that didn't exist in sort of my prior experience.
Things used to feel relatively stable, meaning you kind of knew what the floor was that you
were building on, what the ground was what you were building on.
Now the ground is sort of moving quite a bit.
And everybody is struggling with it from founders to venture capitalists who also sort
of don't know how to invest in this kind of an environment because things that they're
doing due diligence on this week, we're going to get disrupted later on this week.
It's moving so fast.
And then you start doing due diligence on that and that gets disrupted and you do that
a few times.
And all of a sudden they're like, well, it seems everything's about to get disrupted
over and over again.
How can we invest?
And so I have a lot of friends that are venture capitalists that are sort of struggling, trying
to figure out how do I do my job in this kind of an environment.
So it's a difficult environment for everyone.
But I believe, I think certainly, that this is the best environment for new entrepreneurs
to jump in and build companies.
What AI, specifically generative AI, has brought to the table is the ability to build products
much faster, like orders of magnitude faster and with a lot less technical capabilities
required from a human resource standpoint.
You've seen large language models writing code.
You've seen large language models responding to prompts that if those responses would have
been somehow written in something other than a large language model, some kind of a heuristic
approach, that would have been a lot of software development and a lot of data crunching to
be able to give these kinds of responses.
They come in a sense for free instantaneously.
So those dynamics have changed dramatically of how quickly one can bring a new product
to market.
And we're sort of in the thick of things with UAI Mines Studio, to your point, which is
someone can show up with an idea and then in less than an hour, launch a product that
leverages all of the power of chat GPT and, you know, Anthropics Clawed were model agnostics
so we support today GPT 33540 and also Clawed 1 and 2, so we'll support all the other models
as well.
And so you can sort of leverage the power of all of those in less than an hour, build
a new service that you can launch on the internet, including monetization, that you
ask people to give it a free tier and ask people to pay a subscription fee for it.
And we now have over a thousand of these services that have been launched.
This is the last month and a half since we announced Mines Studio.
And I think a lot of them are like really profound, like, you know, people are building
an AI medic.
You're basically like a physician that you can chat with and it'll diagnose your symptoms.
There's also an AI vet.
So if your pet is having symptoms, you can diagnose it.
There's gardening assistance.
So if you want to plant tomatoes in San Diego where I live, this gardening assistant knows
where you live and will tell you the exact time to plant tomatoes because if you're living
in Northern California, this is the wrong time.
You got a different time.
You're in a different zone, right?
Or a parenting copilot.
I have five kids.
Oh, wow.
You could try to read all the books in the world.
I don't have time to read any books.
But I have on my phone a parenting assistant that's read every book.
That's read every study because behind the scenes, it's just GPT-4 and it simply asks
me what's happening and it knows about my kids because I've already trained it.
That took two minutes less to train it.
And so I can say Una is crying because Diego won't go to sleep and this thing knows that
Diego's older and Una is younger and can tell me exactly what to say to Una, exactly
what to say to Diego, how to frame any of it.
And there's over a thousand more of those.
Wow, that's interesting.
Okay, that's super helpful because then I just realized because I was playing around
with it and then I think that, yeah, like parenting is one use case and there's thousands
of use cases there.
But I think that if I can pop in and use it because the difference that using GPT-4,
you got to heavily prompt and you got to do a new chat every time.
But this is fully trained in that specific use case.
It retains everything.
And I think there's no limits as far as I know.
I haven't reached any limits yet using it in terms of like prompting, like it's like,
I think, correct me.
Other than context windows and standard things that are limits of modern LLMs, there are
no limits because, again, behind the scenes, think of us as like an abstraction layer,
like the application abstraction layer, two large language models.
Basically, we believe, which is what you're pointing at, that it doesn't make sense for
consumers, for regular people to go directly to chat GPT and start typing.
You are a blog writing assistant that has 40 years of experience and like all these things
people write, please, I will give you examples, backspace, backspace.
This doesn't make any sense.
We believe AI should work the same way as mobile apps work, meaning there's an app for
that.
You want to write a blog post, you push the write blog post button.
You want help with parenting, you push the parenting co-pilot button.
Prompt engineers, people who are nerds like us, who want to go and craft those prompts
and experiment and tune them up in Nuancem, those people should do the work to create
that and package it using MindStudio, package those prompts as consumer accessible AIs.
So, we're basically just a prompt package, but it's more than prompt.
It's prompt and system message and preamble and various parameters of large language models,
temperature and dealing with context windows and overflows and summarizations.
A lot of things there that we allow you as a prompt engineer to tune so that the consumer
can simply answer the question, what do you want to write the blog post about and now
paste a sample of your writing style, they only need to do that once, paste a sample
of their writing style, from then on they've trained their own personalized blog post writer
and from then on all they have to do is say, I'm going to write a blog post of how AI is
going to disrupt medicine and it says, who's the audience and you might say physicians
who are concerned about AI displacing them, great, this thing is going to write a blog
post in your writing style towards physicians that are concerned.
How many words would a consumer have to write in order to set up chat GPT to be able to
do that?
Really cool because my mind is going to race now because I think that, I don't know if
maybe this is already released, maybe it's not correct me if I'm wrong, but what if let's
say the top five to 10 parent blogging apps or any of the categories there and then they're
like, okay, instead of us building this whole conversation of chatbot using ABCD app, I want
to just integrate the parenting app on UAI into our website and then they pay, they don't
pay the consumer rate but they pay a business, is that already available or is that something
that's still in the works?
You can say if you have content of your own, let's say you're a parenting blogger and you've
got a bunch of your blog posts and so in a sense, your mental models are digitized, you've
written a content, there it is.
You can take MindStudio, our product and you can take that content and integrate it into
a URL that is a chatbot and embed that on your blog or post it as an Instagram story,
it's just a link.
Share it anywhere on social media, post it to Twitter, I guess X and yes, that's really
easy to do and then you want to charge for it.
Oh wait, so the businesses, they pay for the usage of it, meaning that like if they have
a thousand visitors visiting the site and then they all 1000 use the app through their
business website or through their blog.
No, no, the way it's set up is that you as prompt engineer can show up, create a free
account, start, you know, say create new AI, we give you a bunch of templates you can use
or you can use blank and make that AI, again, typically takes a few minutes to an hour maybe,
depends on like how much you want to geek out to really tune it up and make it awesome
but not huge amounts of time, including integrating your own data and all of that and then when
you publish it, that asks you to fill out some information.
What do you want to call it?
Give it an icon, give it like a sharing image and then there's a section says do you want
to make it free to consumers to use or do you want to charge a subscription fee?
You want to charge a subscription fee for me to use your AI as a consumer, I get a free
tier which typically, you know, I think 15 messages and then it prompts me to give you
money depending on how much you've said you want to charge.
Some people are charging dollars, some people are charging 50 bucks a month, again, we just
launched payments the late last week before last, so like 10 days ago and there are already
people who have subscribers and making money, you know, so it's still in the teens, not
even 100 but still, like the thing works and people are starting to generate recurring
revenue, monthly subscribers for their hard work of doing prompt engineering, you know,
figuring out what prompts work the right way and tuning all the other parameters and setting
it up.
This use case is that every blog, any business, e-commerce, the world I come from can definitely
utilize building a specific app on it, putting it on as an embed somewhere or even on a page
and being like, hey, like get like a customer AI chat bot with our thing.
Or you can add them to home screens on mobile phones, right, because they're just web apps,
so you can bookmark them and add them to home screens, they're there, again, we see people
sharing them on social media, that's an awesome channel to be able to do it because they'll
render inside of a Facebook feed because they, you know, Facebook thinks of them as like
articles and so you get the open graph image and description and people can just tap on
it or click on it and instantly get access to this AI inside of Instagram or Facebook
or Twitter or anywhere else.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Very cool.
And by the way, your point of like use cases, this is going to be just like the mobile app
store, meaning what kind of apps are in the mobile app stores, over 2 million apps in
each app store, apps for everything.
There's an app for that.
This is the same way.
There should be an AI for that.
Today the AI for that is chat GPT, I have to go there and tell chat GPT to behave as
some AI for that that we just discussed.
But really what we should do is treat chat GPT as like raw material and we prompt engineers,
take all that raw material and make out of it, specific things for specific use cases
that are much faster and easier for people to use, consumers and SMBs and enterprises.
The scope is infinite.
It is.
And that is current product as of today.
And what do you think is the long-term vision?
What's the vision that you have like long-term that you can share like publicly?
I'm sure there's a lot of things happening behind the scenes, but yeah, I tend to be
an open book.
So I'll happily share.
Yeah.
So there's near term work that we're doing and then there's a longer term vision that
we believe in that we've already experimented with, meaning we put it into alpha and got
data to show us that we are right, but that this is viable.
I'll explain both of these to you.
So there's the near term thing, which is mind studio.
And so again, we believe that already these large language models and image diffusion
models and video models that are coming out, all of these generative models are incredible,
have countless, literally countless use cases, but that the interface today that's provided
to consumers, this sort of chatbot interface cannot be the right interface.
Those of us that are old enough to remember DOS before there was Windows, DOS was generally
unusable.
It wasn't until we got Windows that computing took off.
And this is the same thing we believe.
So while it's extraordinarily powerful, and it's amazing that people think that they need
to become prompt engineers to be able to sort of live in this new world of leveraging AI,
we don't believe that's true.
We believe we prompt engineers, let's call ourselves people that are motivated to do
this work should show up right now, use mind studio and basically build out every use case
possible.
And you can do that now.
You don't need any programming experience, there's no code to this.
You need to be able to use language well, though, you need to be able to be articulate.
You have to explain, but that's what prompt writing is to be able to explain clearly what
you want the thing to do.
And so that is a skill that you should have, but you can show up now and do it.
So that's the near term.
And so we're making mind studio more powerful.
So in it, for example, is something called automations where you can do these like multi
step workflows, you can collect input from a user, you know, during during their sessions,
including, you know, long term memory.
So this thing remembers.
So when they come back next week or next year, this thing knows about them.
So it's really, really powerful.
Yeah.
I don't have to constantly start up from scratch and and type things.
Yeah, that's the biggest challenge.
And so we're expanding the automation section quite dramatically.
We are making the sort of the output product itself, the AI, they're creating better interfaces
for it.
So it's sort of more usable by consumers and simpler to configure.
We are adding analytics, deep analytics for AI creators to be able to understand how people
are using their AI so they can take it and make better AIs and make new AIs and all of
that.
So there's a lot of work that's being done right now.
You'll see a lot of releases coming from us in the mind studio realm, again, focused on
creators of AIs, these, let's call them prompt engineers for them, and for consumers that
are engaging with those, that's one piece.
Another piece is we run a directory called UAI, UAI.AI.
And there you can go and find, again, over a thousand of these AIs already.
So think of it as like an app store for AIs.
You can go and browse categories or search and find interesting tools, AI tools you can
use and simply use them.
And you know, the favorite section, and again, as I said, you can just add them to your home
screen and there you go.
So we're going to make that better.
Right now, discovery is dumb.
There's some editorial that we do.
There's nothing personalized.
There's nothing algorithmic.
But there's already a lot of really powerful, interesting stuff and some resources and discovery
that's there.
That's in the near term.
Longer term, oh, by the way, look, this is when I say near term, like this is certainly
the next year and probably next two years as we're here, because this opportunity is
giant for there to be an app store for AIs and for all prompt engineers of the world
to show up and sort of plant their flag and build out all of these services and then benefit
from that by making a living doing it.
We think, again, another way to put it is if you want to start a new company, start it
on MindStudio, start it on UAI MindStudio.
Show up, build an AI, say I want to make money from it, monetize it.
And there you go.
You just launch the company.
Later on today, you can launch another company, meaning another product, probably one company,
but another product.
One was an AI medic, another one's an AI vet.
Same thing, sort of.
You didn't have to do any work other than tell GPT that it's now a vet versus it's now
a human medic.
That's interesting.
Because everything else is reusable.
And also, as you're talking about the short term side, one of the things I was thinking
about was let's say there's like 100 vet apps over a period of time.
How do you navigate that from the consumer side?
The business side doesn't affect it, but...
Yeah.
I mean, same way you do it in the App Store.
How many calendars are there in the App Store?
How many productivity apps?
Countless of anything.
And so you have ranking, right?
And you have reviews, and you have usage stats, and you basically...
It's a ranking problem.
Okay.
And then there's something that you'll build in like in the near term.
We're doing that now.
Yeah.
That's one of the things that we're doing now, because we already have, as I said, over
1,000 AIs.
Last week, there was over 100 created.
It's accelerating.
Yeah.
And it makes sense because it's like easy to go on and hop on a build.
Is there...
Do you have something to think about when it comes to like audio, like voice conversational
within these apps?
That would be interesting.
Like instead of text, it's like you can speak to that app.
I mean, in the sense you can speak to that, because built into every desktop or mobile
operating system now is voice to text capabilities, right?
So you got a little microphone next to Messenger.
Oh, okay.
You can just speak to where there's the next input.
We already have the way to take voice and transcode it into text, basically.
Yeah.
So we don't have to build that.
I thought where you were going is there are absolutely sound generation models that are
starting to be available and meaningful, and also, you know, sort of music generation
and speech generation is part of that, where you can do sort of automated generation of
audio.
Today we don't have any of those, but we absolutely will, because as I mentioned, we're completely
model agnostic, and so we will support all major language models and diffusion models
and video and audio and all of that.
I was just thinking like how I would probably use it is I would just put UAI as the actual
thing saved on my phone, on my iPhone, and just click on it and then use it as like I
can navigate and search everything, also saving like specific apps as well, because
then I would be able to just like get access to everything in one go and then I could find
things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, I mean, I think I saw you posting things about prompts, right?
Like, so I see people saying, Hey, I've got this like notion, you know, sheet or I've
got, I've got a spreadsheet that's got all these prompts, and you can just go find the
right prompt and copy and paste it into chat GPT and do that.
We think that's a silly way of doing things.
If you've got a good prompt, turn it into an AI.
So I as a consumer can just pick it and bookmark it and just use it whenever I want.
Why should I have to go and open up a spreadsheet and copy and paste things into chat GPT?
How does that make sense?
Yeah.
It's just inefficient.
And even right now, like anytime we, and the biggest thing is that it forgets.
And if you delete it or you lose it, yeah, it's just everything.
But I do like that.
The fact that you're agnostic is then you integrate all these other LLMs and API's and stuff.
And then I don't have to manually go to thought because right now what we're doing is like,
even as like us trying to utilize different platforms, we're going to multiple different
ones, trying to link it together.
And it just takes way more time than it's necessary, which versus I can just use that
one, go to you and then be able to integrate.
Hey, I want to use these and topic or use like open AI or something like that.
Total.
Okay.
Yeah.
Interesting.
That makes sense.
And it, okay.
So in the, going back to the longterm, like do you, in like five to 10 years, I guess,
like, where do you, where do you kind of see that?
Like some, that, that's what's interesting as well.
So that is the longterm piece that I want to tell you about.
So in May, so just a few months ago, we launched an alpha of UAI.
This is before we had Mind Studio.
Mind Studio sort of came out of UAI.
And our, our vision there that we articulated to people and said, please come and play with
it if you want, is this, that the right way to truly leverage all the power of modern
information technology, meaning that continues to accelerate.
We have Google, which by the way, behind the scenes is all machine learning output that's
not seen as an AI platform, but it's absolutely an AI platform or YouTube or any of these
things are all behind the scenes driven by machine learning.
That's why they are so good.
But now we have these new generative models and all of that is just accelerating faster
and faster and faster.
And so the thing that we pointed out is that we believe that humans are the bottleneck
already in being able to leverage all of the power of information technology, meaning
I'll get to you like this.
There are countless mobile apps I could be using right now that would make me better,
faster, happier, et cetera.
I have no time to go find them, set them up, learn to use them and use them.
I am the bottleneck.
The technology exists, but I'm the bottleneck.
All of these new large language models are really sort of exacerbating that and making
it clear that human beings are the bottleneck in being able to leverage all the power.
This is why things like auto GPT are exciting because you take the human out of the loop.
All of a sudden, you have wire speed AI.
Well, now we're talking.
It's not guided very well.
So we believe that the real problem is the problem of human to digital interface.
And today it's gotten even worse because we said that the interface is a chat box, which
is one of the worst interfaces to it.
We believe the right interface to that is to take our minds, all of these beliefs, biases,
mental constructs, desires, all those things in our minds and digitize them, turn them
into a data set.
So we can then take that data set and grant it to AI, which by the way, these are all
neural networks.
They don't want prompts.
They want data sets.
Their core thing that they do is they take data sets and they process them and they find
structure in them where structure may not have been seen by humans or was seen, but
they're much better at doing it statistically meaningful features.
That's what these things do.
And so if we digitize our minds somehow, and I'll explain to you how we did it that works.
You can play with it.
Then you get a data set of your mind and you can simply give that to AI and they I can
sort of look at and say, uh-huh, I'll rock you.
I understand how you're different from this person or different from the majority or whatever.
I understand what your strengths are.
I understand what your weaknesses are.
I understand what your gaps of knowledge are.
I understand what your desires are.
And then AI, the AI can take the lead and say, you don't need to prompt me anymore.
Let me take the lead and make proposals for you.
I think you might like this.
Do you like it?
And you say, yes, please do that.
Thank you.
I got you.
What about this?
I thought you might want to learn this.
I've created a custom learning material for you because I thought that you understood
prompt engineering, but it seemed you didn't understand this dimension of prompt engineering.
And so I filled that in for you.
Here it is.
Just that.
Instead of giving you more things to read about prompt engineering.
And so anyway, so we believe that's the future of human beings being able to leverage all
of the accelerating power of information technology is to, for us, not to interface with this
technology directly, but for us to, in a sense, interface with this proxy, this mind
indexing proxy.
And because our minds are constantly changing, this is something that we do from now on.
And by the way, what does it feel like?
It feels like tic-tac.
It feels like a never ending feed of proposals and interfaces that we present to human and
say, how would you choose?
Some are open answer questions.
Some are multiple choice questions.
Some are high density grids that say, tap all the things that seem yummy.
How would you describe yummy to chat GPT in words if you wanted to recommend food choices
for you?
That would take a lot of words.
It would be very crude.
But if I give you just a few screens of high density screens of images and say, pick the
things that seem yummy, I can build a vector that differentiates you from me or from other
people, you see?
And so we announced this.
We had over 5,000 people show up in our alpha and go through a median number of prompts.
We call them prompts.
We presented to them, answered as 177.
So 177 explicitly articulated data points.
By the way, the reason it was, even though on one hand, that's extraordinarily high.
On the other hand, that's limited because we only had a limited number of prompts in
there.
And so people ran out of things to answer.
And we paused it for a moment, maybe for a little bit of time, because we realized from
that that that is going to work.
We could really go in that and digitize people's minds.
But for what?
What are they going to get for that in the near term?
That's where MindStudio comes in.
What they get for that is all of these AIs that are being built right now with MindStudio
can leverage all of that data that's being collected by MindIndexing.
You can grant any new AI you discover.
It can ask you, can I use this set of data about you?
And you can say yes.
And it's instantly trained, personalized to you.
You're essentially like, it's like a closest thing to digitalizing one's mind and also
replicating them.
You get a lot of good points.
I guess I can tell you philosophical as well.
What do you think are the philosophical implications of this?
The digitization of one's mind and removing someone to fully build a fully AI-powered
experience where the human isn't getting involved in each step and all that stuff that's currently
the state of AI?
Yeah, I think it's a brave new world.
It's profoundly transformative.
Obviously, the speed of ability for a human to communicate with machine becomes many orders
of magnitude faster, so that itself is profound.
The ability, again, I think one of the biggest problems humans have is we don't know what
we don't know.
And this thing can figure out what we don't know and fill in the gaps for us.
And so education gets transformed radically, so the pace of education goes up dramatically
and everyone gets basically personal content delivered to them.
It also transforms the web, doesn't make sense anymore to create websites that are geared
towards personas or ideal customer profiles.
There is no such thing.
These are all crude caricatures.
Any persona, any marketing team has ever built is a crude caricature of something that doesn't
exist.
A person is infinitely complex, individual.
So this thing could actually sort of leverage that data where a human shows up to an e-commerce
site and says, here's me in data form.
An e-commerce site says, I grok you.
Here are the things that you would like from our catalog of things.
Let me explain them to you in the language you will understand, how they will matter
in your life and why you should choose this over our competitor's product.
So everything becomes ultra-personalized, content created on demand for each one of us
based upon, again, our states of being.
That's the right way it should be.
That's the way humans do it, like if you have a human salesperson, why is a human salesperson
better than just a website?
Because a human person can have a conversation with the other human and understand them in
a more nuanced way and then paraphrase thing to them and leave them from where they are
now to where we need them to be.
And that can only be done by understanding who is the customer in this case.
And by the way, of course, beyond that, you start to get into all kinds of other crazy
things, which is when you digitize, and again, I've thought about this now for years and
so I'll propose some things that to me are quite obvious, but won't be obvious at first
blush, which is, so I'm married.
My wife and I just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.
We have five kids.
I know her extraordinarily well.
But periodically, there are still things that come out in conversation.
I'm like, how did I not know this about you?
Like, I've had this with Fran, 54 years old, I've had this with friends I've known for
30 years.
I'm like, how is it possible that we'd never touched upon that?
Or I always assumed you were this or now you're this, right?
Well, because I propose to you and the listeners that we know a very thin veneer of one another.
And communication is very shallow.
We don't have time to go deep.
It's uncomfortable to go deep.
Who takes the lead on making things deeper?
It's hard to do that.
But if we are all indexing our own mind, we can show up at a situation and say, hey, do
you want to compare mental models?
And then say yes and yes.
And all of a sudden, instantly look at that data and realize all of these amazing things
that we have in common that we would have never discovered in 40 years of friendship.
But now we can see them, we can go deep.
We can find misalignment where I thought you believed this, but you actually don't.
No wonder we've been miscommunicating or I've been trying to get you to see things in some
way.
But you can't see them in that way because of this thing.
I would have never known that about you.
How would I discover that?
But because we're digitizing minds, we can overlay and do that.
We can also do that in teams, which is profound.
I run companies.
Running companies is one of the hardest things, mostly in alignment and communication.
People say, we agree.
We're going in the right direction.
I say, I'm not sure that's true.
Explain it to me in your own words.
And they explain it.
I'm like, OK.
We're aligned.
And then all of a sudden, we somehow are moving in different directions.
How?
Well, because the vector from which we were looking at it, it seemed like we were aligned
because we're pointing at a point in space, but we're pointing from different directions.
This thing can find misalignment and help us align so we can work together.
Anyway, so those kinds of things become quite profound and transformative to society.
That was honestly, I don't even know how to describe what you said.
But I think that what you just shared is mind-blowing because to me, that changes relationships
forever in the sense that I don't know how it would look like functionally, tactically.
But if what you just described is a concept, if I can just press a button and then we know
everything, and then we can just look at it or maybe scroll through it.
This is like a caveman version of where we're at, but they scroll through like, oh, Julie
or John, we have all these things in common.
These are things that we don't want.
And it's things that you didn't know or you didn't know.
That would actually be, I would love to use that.
That would be an amazing thing.
Well, we are very near that.
We almost launched that.
We could, in a sense, launch it at any week.
We're close to being able to launch that.
We now have over, I think, just under 10,000 people who've been digitizing minds.
Maybe it's now above 10,000, but some are in that range.
This is with UAI?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
And so we actually, like I said, we started, we almost launched that comparison thing.
And it's just a mobile interface or desktop interface that says, you know, given these
two people, they can both consent because obviously the information is private consent
and then say, great.
Okay.
Let me compare the two of you.
If it comes out and it actually explains it to you in just plain English, like it even
does the parsing and the processing.
Oh, wow.
You don't have to just like look at data.
I mean, you can look at the raw data too.
But like, it can summarize it for you and it can help you grok, you know, how to interact
with other humans, like human communications about to change radically.
Yeah.
So because then it changes the way that we, not just build a relationship, but it helps
us build deeper and more meaningful relationship because then we save the time of, because
we have limited time.
And so like having hours and hours of conversation that we normally have now is meaningful.
But it's, it's also, there's a level of AI where what you described as a thing that's
being built.
Yeah.
That's really exciting.
Actually, I can see, I can, I would definitely use that because I was even thinking the other
day and this is just like a, in a nutshell version, like we do so many intro calls in
business and then everyone's like, Hey, can we hop on an intro call, intro call?
And then like in the lifetime of business, we probably do thousands of intro calls.
But if there's a way to literally apply what you just shared into the intro calls and then,
you know, and then we get into kind of like the, Hey, this is the core thing that we can
add value to each other in that way.
But we save the 30 minutes in one hour.
Not to say that it's not meaningful, but it's just to focus on building and doing more creative
work and whatnot.
I think that would be like really interesting as well.
And you can instantly go deep.
You can skip all the shallow stuff again, doesn't mean you don't do shallow stuff.
shallow stuff is interesting, flirting is great, but, but the real value happens in
the depths in personal relationships and business relationships.
The devil is in the details.
So get to the details because the rest, why should we waste our time talking it?
It's much faster to index it, have the AI summarize it and let you guys now move on to the depths.
You're both good people.
I, AI, think you should work together.
It looks like you're going to fit.
Great.
Let's get in the depths of it.
This is really interesting.
What if, uh, since we're riffing on it, like just, uh, what if you imagine like that, but
then you add in a audio replica version of the person and then that person would, after
the matching is done, the audio would be there.
And then you, the person that want to interact with them could do, could have a call with
the audio version of it.
And that's similar to, I don't know if you've seen, you've probably seen air.ai where it's
like an AI version of the person having a conversation.
And then let's say they, once they have the conversation, then it goes into that real,
real self.
So it's like the AI version of you having conversation with the real person and then it becomes a
real person.
Yeah.
So I think a lot, you know, lots of people are doing lots of interesting things.
My personal gut feel, take that with a trillion pounds of salt, you know, but my personal
opinion is that at least for the near future, humans are going to be generally allergic
to speaking with your AI avatar instead of you.
It's disrespectful.
It's like speaking to a, to an answering machine.
Oh, there we go.
That's true.
You know, Mike.
And that doesn't feel right.
But since we can make our calls much shorter, we can be much more efficient is what we were
just talking about.
Is we can skip all the fluff and instantly understand one another and have a short call
and build rapport and get questions answered.
And I know that you human answered me rather than like your, your avatar.
The same thing with like all of these like writing things that will reply to emails for
you and all of that.
As soon as that becomes mainstream, I think that's just going to generally kill email because
like, what am I talking?
Who am I talking to?
Not talking to a human.
Can I take that to the bank?
Oh, no, my AI was hallucinating.
I didn't mean that.
I didn't say that AI said it.
So anyway, I'm not bullish on those things.
I think they're novelties.
No, they're amazing novelties, you know, and we've got things that can generate content
like you.
So you can answer emails and do all that.
That's great and sound like you.
But is that good?
I'm not sure.
I don't think so.
That's a good point.
I think the respect part is key.
Like you touched on that.
Just that one where represents it's like, I think once you do the matching, then the human
interaction, you can't, at least like, based on what we're talking about, you can't scale
that without, the human element's always going to be important at the very bottom to build
those relationships.
Yeah.
And we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at communicating
with one another.
And therefore we could interact with more humans or we could, or we can get much deeper
with one human using our time because communication can be radically better and alignment can be
radically better and disambiguation can be radically better and all of that.
Human communication is, looking at it from this lens is extraordinarily draconian.
We're in the dark ages of human communication.
By the way, this is why we have the battles we have in culture wars and all of this other
stuff that we see sort of all around us right now, all of this outrage.
It's a communication problem.
People say words, other people hear something else or they project something else onto it.
Something needs to help us communicate with one another and AI is going to do that.
Mind indexing plus AI does just that.
Okay.
That's a quote right there.
We're going to quote that part that you just went through.
That's exactly it.
So next thing I would say would be some interesting questions I had was like, what are your thoughts
actually, now that we're talking about it, what are your thoughts on the GPT wrapper
stuff where people are just basically using the open AI stuff and then just building one
single feature thing and then they're making like, I don't know, 25, 50K, 100K outfit versus
building a long-term sustainable AI business like UAI and then actually literally thinking
about the product, building a team.
The two, what are your thoughts on those like is that you think it's like either or like
pros and cons obviously, but what do you think is like just general thoughts around it, the
people that are doing either or?
Yeah.
So both of those work and both of those are needed.
I like to build platforms.
I like to build things that other people use to build things.
I don't like to build products actually.
If you said to me, build an e-commerce store and go run it, to me that's very uninteresting.
I'm not knocking it.
Some people it's extraordinarily interesting, but to me it's not.
But build a platform that allows people to build many e-commerce stores, that's interesting.
And so my advice to entrepreneurs is work on things that interest you, that's the most
important part.
So if you're interested at the layer of platform, go build a platform company.
If you're interested in AI as a solution for some kind of a problem and you want to
build something that wraps, that leverages chat GPT or Claude or whatever and then provides
a real service to consumers, you should do that.
I would say go do it on Mind Studio because that's the fastest, easiest way to do it.
I don't know if faster way to do it.
You don't need to go raise venture capital.
That's right.
Bootstrap, build it and then like ship it because that speed and time is like of the
essence.
Yeah.
And you can do it this afternoon, whenever you hear this, you can do it that same day
and launch it and promote it and start to make money that same day.
And then the next day build another one because again, there's countless use cases that need
to be enumerated and built out.
So I think both of those approaches work just depends on what you like doing.
It's going to be interesting on these about the second order effects of you creating the
platform and then people going on and literally building agencies.
I'm excited to see that of like, hey, we're going to build on UAI for these small businesses
that don't know anything about AI and then they just like build it for them or even just
any business and then they'll be charging like thousands of dollars.
I'm sure it's going to happen.
Someone's going to do it and it's going to be really good.
I know who's going to do it first because we're about, they reached out to us and we're
going to do it with them.
So what you described is literally about to happen where I can't give it away unfortunately
here, but you'll see it and there'll be a first of many I'm sure partnerships of other
companies, big companies.
This one's over 20 years old.
It's got over 2000 employees that are showing up and saying, hey, we can leverage all of
this power we have with our customer base and we just want to be able to very quickly
create a bunch of AI services that we can then sell to our existing clients and new clients.
So these are in businesses.
So this is not a consumer thing.
It's a SMB primarily thing.
And the platform just gets better and better.
So it makes sense.
It's like a long-term partnership.
Interesting.
What do you think would be the, you know, aside from you, what do you think would be
the next let's quote unquote say like most impactful AI business that no one is building
because you've seen a lot.
So what would you say would be something that you're like, oh, okay.
I think the business is a big sort of question mark word there.
If we can take that out and forget the business part of it because there's a bunch of business
dynamics that might prevent extraordinarily powerful things, you know, transformative
things to occur and that could radically change the world and by the way, then change
how you would even build businesses.
Like what does it mean to build a business?
If we were talking early in the podcast, right, I said that venture capitalists are struggling
with sort of the pace of disruption and I think that's only going to accelerate.
And so how do you build a business?
What is a business?
And you certainly don't write a business plan.
Do you have time to incorporate?
No, you don't.
I mean, you should, but you do that later.
The first thing you do is you throw a lot of stuff at the wall and see what sticks and
once it sticks, that's when you build a business around it.
And so like finding product market fit becomes something you do multiple times a day on different
things until you find it and then you very quickly go to and by the way, you'll probably
get disrupted shortly thereafter because other people can do that too.
Once they have the idea, they'll do that too.
And that's going to be really hard to build businesses in general.
Kind of an environment.
Yeah.
So if we take that off the table, then it becomes arguably even a more difficult question
because everywhere you look, their AI is going to create transformative, like massively
transformative change.
Look at medicine, radically transform medicine, access to diagnosis, ability for personalized
treatment plans, discovery, research.
One of the reasons that we got these mRNA vaccines so quickly is because of our current
computing capabilities to be able to run all these things and we can do things proactively.
So you're doing research while we sleep at wire speed and that's by the way only accelerating.
And so whatever, that's medicine.
You can pick anything else.
I want to point you to one that we talked about earlier, which is the creator economy
is about to be destroyed, I believe, as an economy.
Now this is going to be provocative and because I built a company in the creator economy space,
it becomes even more provocative and I'm not trying to be provocative.
I just want to point to something that we think is obvious, which is humans are obviously
creative beings and so we will never stop creating for the sake of creating and using
our creations as a means of communicating with one another, self-expression, etc.
Check.
But making that into a business and monetizing it, when you make something into a business,
you start to deal with the cost of goods.
How much time does it take me to produce a piece of content versus how much money can
I get from producing that content?
As soon as you look at that equation, it becomes very clear that there's no need, no possibility
for humans to compete with automated content creation, personalized automated content creation.
So we already see automated YouTube channels, mostly the stuff that producing is kind of
junk, soon it won't be junk.
It'll be as compelling as anything produced by a human, but it'll be produced on demand
for each of us individually and that's obviously going to be radically more compelling than
anything else.
I think the only YouTubers in the sense that might get a pass for a little while are the
YouTubers where the content is about them, the human, not about anything else because
that goes back to that thing we were just talking about where I don't want to talk to your AI,
I want to talk to you, I don't want to see your AI generated, you know, vlog videos,
I want to see you, okay great, then you're safe.
But for everything else, I don't care if it's you who created it or not, I care about
the topic.
And there that topic is going to be, again, because it's personalized, it's going to be
so much better than anything you could possibly afford to produce and that's going to be very,
very disruptive.
That's true, because then it's self-explanatory, like it's just personalized to me, I don't
need to search for anything, and that's the ultimate, yeah, personalization, AI, interesting,
okay.
Proactive AI, AI, we shouldn't be asking AI what to do generally, again, this is the
dark ages.
Another way of looking, I've tried to explain to some people, if you met a genie, and the
genie said, I'll answer any of your questions, what do you want to know?
And some people say, what's the meaning of life and all of that, that's great.
But I say that my question would be, what question should I ask?
What should I know that I don't know?
What's the most important thing to know?
I don't know.
So, how can I ask the question?
Only thing I can do is say, I trust that you may know what I should be asking you, because
you know the world, and I'm just little on me, and I'm willing to tell you about myself,
that's the mind digitization, I'll tell you what I know and I don't know how I see the
world, and you tell me what I should know to make my life better, and to make my children's
lives better, that's the ultimate thing.
And I think that reversal of roles, where the AI can take the lead, is the big transformative
thing, that's what takes us again to wire speed, and those are those quantum leaps and
capabilities, not our ability to type faster.
That's true.
Yeah, and also like that AI can coach us, can be like the life guide, as well as once
they learn everything about us, not just for the relationship aspect.
Wow, okay.
I want to be respectful of your time, so I know we've got a few minutes left.
I'm just going to rapid fire these three, because I think they'll be really interesting.
If you were to lose everything tomorrow, what would you rebuild, aside from UAI?
You mean in business?
Could be business, or could be...
Could be everything, or you're like...
Oh, sorry, for business, let's say for business, that's right.
You locked your hand when you walked in.
Oh, no, no, no, sorry, not, yeah, just business, yeah.
In business, if I was to lose everything in business, what would I build?
Again, if I maintain sort of the same state of mind that I have now, and I looked at opportunities,
where I would opportunity to be, I would instantly start launching AIs.
Now, again, some people would look at this and say, okay, well, he's building a damn
platform, he's just promoting it, he's biased, and I respect that.
But I'm telling you, as much as I can strip that away, that's what I would do, because
this is obviously the growth area, this is obviously green field.
I wouldn't go and build like mobile apps, almost 3 million in each app store, that thing
is saturated.
I wouldn't go and try to do like drop shipping and affiliate programs and any of that stuff,
that doesn't make sense.
If I wanted to build a business, I would go and leverage all of the power of AI, and
I would build things for the world that the world needed.
And then, depends on what I address, consumery things, or SMB things, or enterprise things,
or medical or whatever, depends.
I tend to like consumery things rather than, I mean, I built an enterprise software company,
Aconics, the cyber security company, raised 34 million for it, spent five years at Fidget,
so I know enterprise.
I don't much enjoy building enterprise products, so I'd probably do consumery things.
Very cool.
And then, what's the single, what would you say is the single greatest lesson you've learned
so far in life, if you were to pick one?
That I, like you, am an instance of the universe, and that we are as connected to one another
as my fingers are connected on my hand, that this is not a finger that's different from
this finger and in competition with one another, struggling to get all the resources, so this
finger has fewer resources.
If you do that, your hand dies, and that we, all of us, including the animals and the plants
and all of us are instances of one thing, you can call it God, you can call it nature,
you can call it universe, you don't have to call it anything, but that, that, by the
way, that I discovered in my first Burning Man in 2009, and I'm about to go to my 12th
Burning Man tomorrow.
Oh, wow.
So I'm leaving tomorrow for my 12th Burning Man with all of my kids and my whole family
and my parents-in-law, who now this is their seventh year at Burning Man, and so all of
that came from that.
So I think that would, that's the most profound thing that I learned when I was 40, and that
changed my life.
And that also is the thing that made me want to have children, you know, until my 40s,
I didn't think I wanted children and I shouldn't populate the world and any of that.
But now I realize that it's a, the world is a wonderful place, not a place, a thing that
keeps happening, and I'm part of it, and my job is to participate.
I love that.
I love that.
That could have been, it couldn't have been well put, and then obviously a big lesson to
go to Burning Man, especially if you've done it 17 times, isn't it?
Sorry, 12.
Oh, 12.
Wow.
Okay.
So that's, okay.
So I'm going to sign out on the register for it in the next one.
I don't think I can go for tomorrow, but yeah, that's amazing.
Well, okay, Dmitry, this is honestly, it was more than I expected in terms of mind-blowing
like insights and stuff.
I learned a lot, really appreciate you.
I think that like in the middle part where you talked about like the YouTube and then
they released like the thing, and then there was the deeper, profound lessons.
So I'm definitely going to re-listen to this myself, because I think that we covered a
lot of things and we went like deeper, and I love that you've got the personal like philosophical
and like deeper level thinking, and I'm sure that's like, that's how you always operate,
but it's just like, it's just great to hear that.
And then not just talk about like the, the technical aspect, but getting more grounded
as well.
It's basically, I think I was thinking about the title of this episode, speaking to a brilliant
mind.
Like that's what came to my mind.
So something like that, speaking of really mind, but then going into more deep depth
of like UAI, and then obviously like, we'll come with something interesting for the titles
and stuff.
And there was a lot of great clips and content there for sure.
Appreciate it.
It was a lot of fun.
Yeah.
I had a great time chatting.
Thanks for wanting me to, to spend time with you.
It was a pleasure.
Yeah.
Likewise.
Any questions, thoughts or anything before we wrap up?
Yeah.
Excited to, that we're connected.
I'm excited that I, you clearly understood what I said.
That's awesome.
And now that you've understood it, I think what I've done is I've planted that seed in
your mind that you can now help me spread the word.
Yes.
This is what people should be doing.
Like this is the new, I'm certain this is the, you know, you want to side hustle.
This is the new side hustle.
You want to build a business.
This is the place to build a business.
There's no point trying to go and raise venture capital and build this big company to build
a business.
That doesn't make any sense in this environment.
The way to build a business is solve a problem, leverage the power of AI to solve a problem
and put a price on it and then solve another problem tomorrow and another problem the next
day.
When you solve a whole collection of problems, you get massively rich.
You've done great work to help the world be better.
You've leveraged all the power of AI.
Does those AIs get better?
Your AI gets better because behind the scenes, it's always using all of those models.
Yeah.
You're never stabbing them, you're never stuck, you don't have to upgrade anything.
Open AI is going to upgrade things, Anthropics is going to upgrade things, you know, Facebook
is going to upgrade things and as those things get upgraded, your AI continues to get better.
I don't know of a more clear entrepreneurial path.
Exclamation point.
There we go.
Awesome.
Thanks again to me.
Have a safe flight and enjoy the 12th Burning Man.
Thanks.
Yeah.
It's a 16-hour drive.
No flights.
Yeah.
16-hour drive and then another probably eight hours sitting at the gate to get in and then
you've got to set everything up.
It's not a vacation of any sorts.
It's a bit of a sort of going to the moon and doing it.
But I love it.
Self discovery.
I find it powerful.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Thanks so much.
Have a great weekend.
Yeah.
I appreciate you.
Take care.
Thank you.
Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
