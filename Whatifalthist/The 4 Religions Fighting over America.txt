My favorite era of history is the Middle Ages, and one of the interesting things about that time
period is that it's an era of history in which people generally didn't apologize for human nature
nearly as much as they do in our society. Things would happen in the Middle Ages,
and they just were what they were. A barbarian invasion was a barbarian invasion.
A church would openly burn heretics, or the nobility was openly trying to oppress the poor.
The thing is that all of that still happens today, often at much worse scales,
but we invent some modern cover in order to differentiate it from the past. The barbarian
invaders are the Taliban. Burning heretics becomes cancel culture, and oppressing the poor is ubiquitous.
Modernity does all the same stuff as the rest of history. Again, with much much more deaths,
but we pretend what we're doing is in some new category of behavior which makes it okay.
In China, they've started calling the new tenements, like that which the working classes
huddled in 150 years ago, micro-apartments. An example of this that I'd like to pause at
is that America, and I think much of the world in general, is in the midst of a religious war
between four different factions. We don't notice this since we imagine this kind of thing doesn't
happen anymore, but whoever wins in this current conflict will determine the course of history
in almost every single way you could possibly imagine.
Well, these are the four religions that are fighting over the West. There are other religions
and beliefs that permeate other civilizations, and one way to see that is through looking at their
art. This can be hard since they operate with very different mediums from us, but with today's

What our current era of history reminds me of is that there was an era of history,
basically no one thinks about, which occurred after the fall of the Mesopotamian or Egyptian
civilizations and then before the rise of Islam. Ever since I was in middle school,
I wonder what was going on in the Middle East under Persian, Greek, or Roman colonization.
The short answer is that even though the region were colonies, you can see profound cultural and
especially religious revolutions that were occurring under the surface. On top of this,
the foundations of what later became Islamic culture, especially in the Fertile Crescent,
and through architecture, was developing in the first centuries after the birth of Christ.
The Middle East in the Hellenistic period saw the flowering of a series of religions that
became Judaism, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, the Cult of Isis, Stoicism, Christianity,
Sibley, Mithraism, Manichaeism, Mazdikism, or Islam. There was something in the water at that
time which created a bunch of religions. These were all popular cults or religions which spread
across the whole world, including to the Roman Empire. The Hellenistic period, or when the Greeks
controlled the Middle East, was a period of widespread secularism. And people often forget
that there was secularism or atheism in the ancient world, but there was a significant amount. And
since that didn't fulfill people's spiritual needs, they turned to these Eastern mystery cults.
The irony is that I'm pretty sure the people of that time period accept those people who ran
those religions, didn't realize that a Darwinistic battle for survival was occurring between these
different mystery religions, which would change the course of history. What ended up happening
eventually is that Christianity crushed all the other religions, but in a process of doing so,
taking what was best from the rest of them. The parallel to our current era is that both of
these were during ages of nihilism and secularism, where the societies in general didn't believe in
anything. There were waning and waxing political issues, while the seeds were being planted for
the next age of faith. There were large empires which allowed rapid trade and increases in
communication and commerce, but said empires fell into decadence while their sheer size made people
feel like they were useless and completely powerless. And I think a similar process is going on now
due to all these parallels in these spiritual and social institutions of our society are really
not up to snuff with what our needs are. Thus, what we will see over the next few centuries,
in that I don't think this process is going to be completed anytime soon, is the competition
between these different worldviews for whichever one will achieve total dominance in the next age.
I think we're only going to see how important the events going on now were hundreds of years in
the future looking back with hindsight. Some of you might have seen my video on the religious
wars of the 20th century, in which I posit that it's better to see the ideological conflicts of
the 20th century as the bloodiest religious wars in history fought between Marxism, Fascism, and
Liberalism. Our current age is a finishing act to those wars in which those three ideologies are
still fighting each other today. That being said, and the world doesn't have any pretensions to
being simple, in that killing the other, these three ideologies will transform into something
completely incomprehensible to what they were before. I'm briefly covered in that video in
which Liberalism or Marxism have morphed to being the exact opposites of what they originally started
as, with Liberalism today standing for government bureaucracy and social engineering, which is
the exact opposite of its libertarian roots. Meanwhile, Marxism has become a corporate
elite ideology supported by the wealthy in opposition to its revolutionary working class
roots. I am of the opinion that Classical Liberalism is basically dead. The only people who push for it
are people who are actually Christians, where Classical Liberalism is just their economic and
social system. The reason this process is occurring is the social foundations under which the 20th
century we're operating are completely alien to those of today. All three of those humanist
ideologies operate under the principle that through greater wealth, technology, and social
engineering, that humanity will reach a utopia where heaven is like earth. That being said,
with the Second World War, three events have occurred which have completely discredited this
theory. The first being that the Western world has attained an absurd level of wealth, safety,
peace, health, fairness, or comfort, and it made us miserable to the point of suicide. I know most
of us don't live in that anymore, but it didn't make us happy when we had it. One of my friends
likes to say that God teaches you lessons in two ways, either by taking everything you have away
from you and making you rebuild yourself or giving you everything you could ever want and seeing it
destroy you. The second point is that global civilization is in rapid decline. We can cope
all we want, but nothing can stop the world's population from collapsing by at least half by
the end of this century. The world today is beset by the generosity and bizarre social issues,
including most notably the West trying to commit suicide. All of that means that the 20th century's
idea of permanent growth and progress will end up just coming across as completely insane.
Thirdly, over the course of the 21st century, there has been a significant amount of research
into human nature, in many cases driven off advances in neurology or using the internet
to mine data. The idea that human nature is perfectible, that under which modernity and the
technological project is founded, is completely unbelievable now. Everyone in the sciences now
agrees that human nature is fundamentally flawed and animalistic. Even all the socialists in the
sciences at this point agree that half of human nature is genetic. This is indirect opposition
even to what people believed 10 years ago, that all humans are equal blank slates who are motivated
by social engineering. It reminds me of Bertrand Russell's history of Western philosophy, in which
he talks about how the rise of the great depersonal, Hellenistic empires at the expense of the old
city-states created mass alienation. With all the suffering and powerlessness, the world didn't seem
like a rational place to analyze or explain. Instead, it was a hard place to accept and live through.
A similar shift occurred across Eurasia before the Axial Age, when Lao Tzu, Confucius, Buddha,
and Socrates lived at the same time around 500 BC. Even in just the last 10 years in my short life,
people are losing the ability to think rationally. Whenever I listen to someone speak, I parcel it
in my mind. Are they making an argument or are they virtue signaling to their faction? The ratio
has massively gone to the latter with very little original thinking happening today. As this happens,
people will move from worldviews based off reason to those based on existing, from how to rationally
explain the world to how to deal with it. To be clear, before we go into explaining these four
different religions, that if you ask someone if they belong to one of these, they'll probably say no.
That being said in the Bible, they talk about how we all put up different idols in our soul
of things that we venerate above all else. For some people, that's money. For others,
God itself. For others, their families are fame. If you talk to people for long enough and do a
little bit of probing, you'll find out what's sacred to them. That thing which they truly
unironically believe in, which they believe pushes the world forward and gives their life
meaning. That's their religion. You find with absolutely every person that there has to be
something there in their soul and that it unironically completely controls their life. Ironically,
for one of these religions, their religion has devolved into the active battle for nothing,
in which their belief in nothing is held far more fanatically than any of the other religion's
belief in whatever they believe in. The human mind is funny like that. It needs to achieve
certain aims, with faith being one of them, and so if you obstruct it from doing so,
it will turn the rejection of faith into a form of faith. A large part of the population are fusions
of multiple of these religions, in the manner that in China it's not uncommon for someone to be
Taoist, Buddhist, and Confucian at the same time. As you guys listen to this video, keep that in mind,
and I think this principle will be even more true for the audience of this channel. I'm not going to
say which of these I belong to, but it is a fusion, and I'm curious to see, for the audience,
what they guess I am. Finally, for each of these, I will be giving a rough estimate of how much of
America's population they make up. To be clear, I am making these numbers up, since these are
religious categories I've invented. That being said, I did put a decent amount of analysis into
figuring this out, and I have a sneaking suspicion that if you develop the test to measure this,
that the results would be generally accurate for three out of four of these religions,
and I'd be really wrong on the fourth. That's what I generally found for my ability to guess
statistical patterns like this. I will start explaining these now from how popular they are,
or from smallest to largest. Number one, Darwinists at 10% of the population. This is a philosophy
which in my opinion should be vastly larger. That since Darwinism at this point is an almost
universally agreed upon principle that we use in science. I'm always shocked how little people
use Darwinism as a lens of human analysis. That being said, there's an obvious reason why this
is the case, in that Darwinism effectively became a heretical religion due to a certain Austrian
painter, and for the last 80 years, anyone who propounded a worldview, even adjacent to it,
was mass persecuted by the entire world. If you look back upon the time since Charles Darwin,
and see how little our worldview has incorporated Darwinism, it would come across as completely
insane. Our entire society is a direct rejection of Darwinism. Even if you say something as completely
innocuous or obvious, like that Europe conquered the world since some part of its society was
superior to the rest of the planet, you could have your entire life ruined. Our current social
sciences or theory of the world literally doesn't have any philosophic structure for superiority
or competence. If you succeed it since you must be oppressive, not since you're better in any way.
That being said, we all know that's ridiculous. We all know that some people are better at some
things than others. And the thing is that I think this is all intentional, in that the left realized
that Darwinism created an intractable ideological issue which would destroy their entire ideology.
Thus, the left made Darwinism completely taboo to discuss on any single level,
causing the academy to even the slightest hinting of it since I think they realized in a subconscious
level that they didn't have an answer to it. The Darwinists are the evil group our society
has allied against, thus being the social outsiders. This is both the greatest strength
and the greatest weakness of the Darwinists. Partly, it keeps them from growing or attaining
elite power, except until some point in the future. But also, at the same point, since the ruling
class is failing so hard as society is collapsing, the Darwinist's hands are completely clean of
the previous social failures. Darwinism hasn't been tested enough recently for it to be obvious
to the next generation of young people what its failings are. Thus, it can appear fresh or new.
Darwinism is currently in a place of flexibility in which it hasn't coalesced into being a
complete new ideology. The biggest reason people enter the Darwinistic worldview is since for as
long as anyone can remember, the regime has used the Nazis as the bogeyman to avoid and unify society
against. The problem implicit in that is that as the regime has treated its own subjects worse and
worse, it removes any incentive for thinking, why not be a Nazi? Darwinism is the smallest of these
philosophies now and the least developed, but I expect it to make incredible surges in the near
future, perhaps becoming the dominant philosophy. I say this partly for the reason I mentioned
before that as the regime grows weaker, the Darwinists stand to gain massively. Secondly, the
advances in genetic science over the 21st century have proven things that the regime's right to rule
is completely false. Anyone in the sciences today of any political stripe agrees that biological
race is real, that genetics amount to at least half of personality going down to things like
political affiliation, how fast you drive, or what music you listen to. We've completely proven that
social class, ethnicity, and sex have genetic components. Every year we find that genetics
is more and more important. The regime is holding an ideological line which is just insane. Here are
a bunch of books written by leftists or socialists that talk about all these points. Since the regime
shuts down reasonable discussion of these topics, that means that when people take the red pill and
start questioning the regime, the Darwinists take them in. The third reason is that with the new
discoveries in genetic engineering which have the potential to create god-like abilities,
including changing the fabric of life itself, is that the temptation to use said technology
will probably become overwhelming in the only way that you could explain it in a comprehensible
worldview is through the lens of Darwinism and improving genetics. Darwinism is based upon the
idea that the world is a violent and brutal place of continuous warfare and competition,
that our blood determines who we are, and that human nature is ingrained, not malleable. I think
the most advanced Darwinistic thinker today is Kurt Doolittle, who has pushed the philosophic
principles of Darwinism to their logical conclusion. Bronze Age pervert is another advanced
Darwinist thinker who has taken more so from the Nietzschean classical bent on this topic. The new
right is currently stuck between Darwinists and Christians fighting each other, often covertly
under the surface, and it's completely unclear which of them the movement will eventually go after.
Something a lot of you might not realize is that the red pill is the biggest gateway to Darwinism.
Entire generations of young men realized what they were told about women while they grew up
was a complete lie, mostly from their own personal experiences. Then they started learning about female
nature which inevitably leads to studies in genetics or human nature in general. Of the four
religions, Darwinism appeals to young men or the fighters of society the best. Without a religion
balancing it out, Darwinism naturally worships vitality. Vitality is a sort of vague principle
that glory or great action is the meaning of life. Nietzsche is the real prophet of the Darwinist
worldview. The problem here is that most people's lives are fundamentally boring and non-glorious.
Society is mostly NPCs who, if they don't get a place in that society, will defect from the system.
Darwinism is a direct reaction to the life-heating, envious, and egalitarian nature of our society,
which young men are understandably rebelling against. One of the biggest issues the Darwinists
run into is the inability to develop mindfulness or the conflation of brutality and practicality.
For an example of this from the Second World War, the Nazis in Japanese whenever they faced
the challenge just doubled down on aggression, which makes sense from their worldview which
glorifies vitality. That being said, this was retarded since they ended up declaring war on a
coalition of the most powerful countries in the world with 20 times their population at the exact
same time. At the same time, a lot of Darwinism is just a rationalization for killing people.
This ends up in weird places where lots of Darwinists will say,
we need to kill those ethnic minorities or invade this country for our people to survive.
The problem is that it's not actually true, and being aggressive all the time is a terrible
strategy. A nimble strategic thinker realizes that there are times for flattery, selling out
cowardice, cooperation, alongside courage, aggression, or dominance. If you look at successful
empires over history, they always find carrots and sticks to induce cooperation with the conquered.
Great empires do as much of their governing through indirect diplomacy as through violence.
Darwinists don't do this. If the Japanese or Germans found ways to cooperate with the conquered,
which is not unimaginable since at the start of World War II, most of Eastern Europe preferred
the Nazis to Stalin, or the Chinese have cooperated with foreign conquerors for thousands of years.
This is also true on an international scale where everyone else teamed up against fascism,
as it was so overtly aggressive that people realized they couldn't trust it. If the Darwinists
lose this time, it will be for the very same reason. That being said, we live in what's
probably the least wise age of history. People only see the outward trappings of ideas,
not what they actually mean. This is how they left a suicidal nihilistic death cult,
where they were able to take over all of society because we only saw their front of being kind
and caring, not the reality of what they were even publicly literally saying. I've seen
the Darwinists do a good job of putting up a new front of not being Nazis. As a figure on the right,
I know a lot of these people, and normies don't believe me when I say that there are legit Nazis
on the right, but there are. The irony is that this is 100% the left's fault for pushing people
to this. I see a lot of people on the right who have a worldview which is literally 95% similar
to Nazism, but since they gave it a new name, people don't notice. I think that this movement
will see the rise of a new leader in the next few years. I don't think anyone understands how
big a sentiment there is here, and it just needs said leader. I frankly don't think any of the
figures so far have this capability, and that people like Nick Fuentes or Bronze Age Pervert
have designed their brands to be memes, not serious people. That being said, it only takes
one Hitler, but once he shows up, everything changes. It's not an uncommon sentiment on the
right to believe that we should construct a racial caste system based off race and IQ.
Even if it's not that big a platform, expect it to grow exponentially every single year.
Before leftists get all self-righteous, keep in mind your people have unironically turned
society into a racial caste system, and your moderates haven't called them out. The left
has no clue at the demon they made, similarly to how the Nazis formed as a reaction to the
insanity of Weimar leftists. The Darwinists will make tough and brave fighters too. The greatest
issue the Darwinists face is nihilism. A principle I've developed is that if you believe in God
or the soul, you're not a nihilist, and if you don't, you are. This is since the soul disposes
a sense of inherent meaning independent from the material. The Darwinists generally larp as Christians,
but they actually are the least Christian of any of these factions, in that literally if you
tell them about Christ's teachings and compare their philosophy to it, they will mock them
while they pretend to be Christians as a coat, much like the Nazis. The Darwinists are obsessed
with aesthetics, in a reaction to the ugly monotony of our culture. That being said, they use glory
as a way to get around a meaningful universe. I prefer that to most other ways people cope
with the death of God, but it does inevitably result in pushing unhuman cruelties and authoritarianism.
That being said, if you push them on if they believe any values, you won't really get an answer.
Everything in their worldview is a rationalization for pushing their self-interest,
which is something a lot of they themselves would agree with. The thing that Darwinists
really need is a soul and God. Without that, they spiral, and with it, they can hold themselves
to moral standards. If you don't believe in the soul or divine, killing other people to bring
about utopia is the rationally correct endpoint to reach. Ironically, the Darwinists with religion
is literally what the entirety of pre-modern history looks like. Hey everybody, for a brief pause,
you guys should check out my second channel, History 102, where Eric Torenberg and I explain
various events in history, and we have 16 episodes so far where we go through the Middle Ages,
the fall of Rome, the world wars, and explaining history in easy one-hour segments.
Number two, machine worship at 15% of the population. You know when fantasy novels,
there are small orders of mages or secret societies which have massive outsized political or social
power but are numerically incredibly small. That's what tech is today. Tech today has an absurd
amount of power over the world and society, while at the same time being centered around a handful
of social groups driven off particular cultural norms or incentives which are completely alien
to the general population. Techno-optimism used to be a widespread and normal sentiment among
the population. Look back at the 1950s, where they had all of this science fiction about the
incredible technological advances that would occur in the future and how it would make their lives
so much easier. This sentiment is largely completely dead among the general public today.
If you ask anyone about what technologies they expect, they'll immediately drop a list of dystopian
black mirror stuff. When tech discovers something new, the populace assume it exists to exploit them.
At the same time, that doesn't stop the populace from using whatever technologies Silicon Valley
produces. Seeing how rapidly people have accepted AI and started integrating it into their daily
lives really shocks me. I told myself I would never use AI and now I do so all the time. Your
average person is a better relationship with their technology than the people in their daily lives.
Gen Z spends seven hours a day on average on just their phones. At the same time,
this change has bred remarkable resentment among the general populace. People hate the new digital
world. It's incredibly lonely, sterile, and depressing. The screens are basically as addictive
as heroin. Digitization has automated the middle class out of existence, creating the largest dating
crisis in history and allows the near permanent monitoring of the population. I have a lot of
friends in technology and it's so strange to talk to them in that they are constantly talking about
how powerful the tech industry is and also what new things they're about to discover. Meanwhile,
I have to frequently tell them, you guys are aware the general public is always about a week
from burning you all on the stake. That being said, I'm making the claim here that tech has
become a new religion, not that it's just a powerful social force. The reason I believe this
is that if you talk to people in technology, they have a remarkable faith in the idea that
technology will bring about the rapture. That sounds insane to tell normal people,
but there is a very powerful, kind of secret cult in tech which unironically believes that we are in
the verge of a complete breakthrough in world history, which has no parallel ever. This idea
animates almost all of the great men in technology in one form or another, whether Mark Zuckerberg,
Sam Altman, or Elon Musk. It's called the Singularity or that artificial intelligence
will hit a rate of exponential growth in which it breaks human history, ushering in a completely
new era. Look this up, it's a very popular theory which has had many books written about it.
Almost all important figures in this field have written about it and there are loads of serious
books which treat the Singularity as a real coming event, which will certainly change the
course of the future in ways that we can't understand. As a historian, I chuckle at this
since by studying history, I've come to realize that there are certain archetypes in human behavior
which you see repeated again and again in different garbs. These are edged into the human
condition and certain eras of history rationalize them with whatever logic their society uses,
one being the rapture or a point where we will reach a spiritual breakthrough in which those who
follow said religion are saved while the world completely changes. For the techies, their Singularity
is the rapture. These are people who treat religion as silly but they have so easily slipped into
their own version. A constant theme we'll find of all of these religions except the final is they
lack a tremendous amount of self-awareness and so end up acting out principles of human nature
which are far more primitive than the sheen they put on. Ironically, they have no idea they're
doing it. Artificial intelligence may have tremendous effects upon the world. In fact,
it almost certainly will, but to expect it to completely alter every element of humanity is
just insane. Look at the most inventions in world history, whether the industrial revolution,
nuclear bombs, agriculture, or metalworking. What happens in each case is that there are a
couple major variables which change, but the messy nature of the world in human competition
remains. What messianic ideologies say is that the era of suffering in human competition is just
going to stop, but that's never going to happen. You also see this across technology where it
appears as if Mark Zuckerberg believes himself to be a god who is creating a new world through
virtual reality. Elon is creating neural link to fight against the potential issues with AI
destroying humanity. Alternately, you see it with some of the most insane people in crypto.
Sam Altman wants to have machines replace humanity and that's not an uncommon sentiment
in a lot of these tech people of creating a more perfect creation than humanity through the machine
who will move past us in evolution. You've all know Harari has talked a lot about this.
In each case, they believe their technologies are going to usher in a utopia right around the corner.
The utopia thesis has been tested for a very long time over history and every single time it
fails. In fact, the utopians make things vastly worse in almost every case. The thing that scares
you at the tech industry is it fills with people who view context barriers human nature in natural
ecosystems with contempt. They want to rip everything up. They don't hold themselves to any
standard. This leads to a worldview capable of profound evil since the great totalitarians of
the past share every single one of those traits with them. They hold human nature in no kind of
sacredness. That being said, tech is a double-sided coin which in addition to this has incredible
promise to change the world in a very positive way. One of those is that the internet will
probably allow the defeat of the current wave of authoritarianism or totalitarianism flowing
across the world and it allows easy non-government communication and cooperation. This is the populist
world that has been created by the internet. We used to be completely dependent upon TV stations
which were curated by elites in the government. My friend biology has turned me around on a lot
of points in this topic. He splits the world into grays, reds, and blues which is a split I like
enough that I'll probably make a video about it at some point which are conservatives, leftists,
and technologists. The advantage I see in tech is decentralization and it has the smartest and
most creative people of any of these religions by a significant margin. Tech is also the most
innovative and creative and then it has the greatest ability to just invent something totally new
which changes the game. Tech has potential to pop up anywhere in the world as we've seen in El Salvador
due to how decentralized it is. It's not unimaginable to see random third world countries become new
centers for tech if they try hard enough or if they're pushed out of the first world.
Tech is divided between decentralized and centralized tech. The centralized tech is largely a tool of
authoritarian governments and has lost a lot of creativity. China or even the World Economic
Forum are great examples of that in that the weft is a fusion between machine worship and leftism.
We're currently in a race between tech as a force for freedom or servitude. I really do worry
that AI being a tool of state surveillance as a great example. The biggest weakness in tech is
its complete disconnection from reality and human nature. When I talk to people in tech it always
shocks me to see how split off they are from the public sentiment, often to an incredibly embarrassing
degree. Their arrogance makes them hated and increases the chances they just get slaughtered
by the general populace. The reason capitalism was so rare in history, only really flowering in
western Europe, is that it's too easy for government to just ally with the mob to steal money from the
capitalist. This has happened dozens of times in history. Also, the god that tech pushes is
fundamentally false. Firstly, I very rarely see people in tech push for things that the general
populace wants. Almost everything big tech creates is to push their power. Secondly, the tech ideas
they have just won't make the world a utopia. It will probably make things a lot worse. The
singularity will never happen and if it does it will probably be pushing some cynical agenda.
Their idea is that you can just engineer your way out of human nature which is wrong. Also,
tech has become rapidly a lot less creative where they put up this facade of creativity and they're
still probably the most creative of any of these religions. But their amount of creativity has
collapsed precipitously in the last decade as has their ability to think independently.
Where San Francisco is now one of the least free thinking places in America, tech will do its best
if it stays in a small scale based off actually inventing stuff. The raw creative ability of
this group is remarkable if tapped. That being said, they again need to have a soul or an idea
that they serve some broader human agenda rather than rationalize an inchoate drive for power.
Tech is one of the few places that actually makes new stuff in our society which is largely
boring and uncreative and sterile. If we lose tech, we're probably slated for another dark age.
Number three, Marxists at a quarter of the population. This story is so unbelievably bizarre
that I think our descendants will struggle to believe that it was ever real. Communism was the
ideology which killed the most people in human history. By a truly vast margin, it was tried in
every single continent, climate, and civilization. It killed more people than every other religion
and ideology in history combined. Then after that, they changed their name and were able to quietly
take over the institutions of the entirety of western civilization. The West didn't even really
put up a fight, sacrificing its economy, culture, romance, religion, foreign policy, or literally
anything else you could possibly imagine without even realizing it was happening. This degree of
idiocy should not be physically possible. However, that didn't stop it from happening. I'll explain
later why I think it occurred. That being said, we live in a society which is run by Marxists.
Every single institution that exists has been co-opted by Marxists. This is the case for Hollywood,
TV, the media, the government bureaucracy, corporations, the upper brass of the military,
the police, schools, academia, philosophy, religion, and literally anything else. They
have turned the entire hiring process into racial discrimination against the majority
population. Every single facet of our social code has been melded under Marxist philosophic
assumptions. You know a cultural form has been really important when its assumptions are so
baked into a culture that people don't even think about them. For example, our idea of the underdog
being good stems from Marxism, the idea that all people are equal, diversity is good, the sex is
being interchangeable, or that the government should take care of the populace, all stem from
Marxism. Communists will see that me saying this, but the US has a hybrid socialist economy,
since the US government makes half of the US's as a country's total economy. The Marxists did
this largely through verbal games. The communists maintain the exact same worldview as they had
before, in which the oppressed need to launch a revolution to bring about utopia. That being said,
they changed out the working classes for women, sexual, and ethnic minorities. This was since
the white working class was wealthy enough that they actually became satisfied with their material
conditions. Meanwhile, the groups above keep on asking for more no matter what they get. Our
society is foolish enough that we didn't even notice. The Marxist kept changing definitions
so that people never realized what was happening. We were indoctrinated through leftist dominated
media and schools not to notice. The Marxists socialized the populace to be NPCs who wouldn't
see what was occurring right before their own eyes. The left is completely evil. I used to feel
bad saying that, but after watching the actions of the last few years, I've seen the left completely
trash every single moral standard they could have held themselves to. They've become the party of
the rich, the powerful, they shut down dissent, they're trying to commit social suicide. I
have a game of trying to find a single moral degeneracy that the mainstream left hasn't
defended. It's impossible. Mainstream leftist media have written positively of cannibalism,
pedophilia, mass castration, a racial caste system, and have written against thinking for
yourself or having children. The reason I think all of this happened personally is that we're
living through mouse utopia. Mouse utopia was an experiment in the 60s which I made a video about
where they gave the mice perfect conditions to breed and then after their numbers going up massively,
the mouse social structure completely fell apart. Male mice became effeminate, female mice aggressive,
the mice stopped having children, became autistic, mouse society completely collapsed as bands of
thugs destroyed the mice who continued to breed. Even if you don't believe in that experiment,
historically periods of wealth or decadence allow societies to stop behaving in productive ways
and instead be degenerate. What's happened here is the left one, since they were able to create
an easy rationalization for complete degeneracy and social collapse to be morally okay. Imagine
what kind of ideology those mice would make up to justify mouse utopia. Wouldn't it end up looking
a lot like wokeness? Wokeness is making a turn now from kind of positive ideology about empowering
oppressed groups to legit death cult bent on social suicide. You can see this in that the
left is pushing more and more so for stuff like not having children, deindustrialization to stop
climate change, suicide, mass immigration to destroy developed countries, the end of heterosexuality or
other things which are exactly what a mental group would do to rationalize. The left has become
completely possessed by what is effectively the worship of mother nature as you can see with
their obsession with the planet or environmentalism or the noble savage. In the esoteric tradition,
the negatives of mother nature are chaos, irrationality, and an incoate desire to destroy
for its own sake. To make the world more simple, thus allowing future creativity, the left's main
goal is suicide. You can see that now the western left picks different issues to be suicidal about.
In the US, they pick African slavery. In the settler colonial countries which didn't have
slavery like Canada or Australia, they pick indigenous issues. In the countries the Europeans
are native to, they pick climate change or colonialism. In each case, they pick whatever
rationalization works for suicide. This is the great weakness of the left, that they are completely
insane and literally want to lose. The left is killing itself. The left doesn't do anything
anymore. They don't develop new ideas, have kids, make culture or art, have new philosophies, make
companies. The great worry is that the left brings down their entire civilization with them as they
fall. The left's great strength is they have all of the organs of society and have a fanatical
base of supporters who will die for them. This battle in my opinion will rupture into legitimate
wars in the western world over the next few years between the right and the left. Number four,
Christians at half of the population. Now for the religion which is by far the largest. Although it
may not appear like this, Christians are still demographically dominant in America, forming
between two-thirds and three-quarters of the population. I put the real number at 50% and I
think lots of people who say they're Christian in their hearts really have another ideology which
is actually more important for their thought process. Think of woke churches for example or
people on the dissident right who are really Darwinists but mask it in Christianity. That being
said, over 90% of Americans still believe in God and similar to slightly lower numbers pray or are
spiritual. This is different from Europe which is largely turned completely agnostic. Funnily enough,
the average American agnostic is more religious in belief in God or prayer than the average European
religious person. What this means is that there is a very significant amount of people who are
adjacent to Christianity who could be scooped up by a new Reformation if it were to occur. Christianity
is in a strong, if very precarious position. It's by far the oldest and best tested of these
religions, the only one you can seriously call a religion. It's also the most balanced and
intellectually developed. The other ideologies, largely since they lack belief in a soul, lack
self-awareness which creates huge intractable flaws which eat them alive. For Darwinism,
it's their absurd aggression. For communism, it's that their world view doesn't make sense
they're trying to kill themselves and for machine worship is that their technologies can't deliver
what they promise. That being said, Christianity has propelled multiple civilizations for thousands
of years sustainably. With all that being said, Christianity is a large empire built on weak
foundations. It's been declining around the world for centuries and even more so in the last few
decades. Just since the year 2000 until the present, almost all countries in West Europe went from
overwhelmingly Christian to something around only a quarter of their population and America
went from 90% to two thirds. The church is currently bleeding followers. If things don't change,
American Christianity could be dead by the end of our lives. Another interesting trend is that
over history, even with majority Christian populations, small agnostic elites have taken
over said societies and then secularized them. This happened with Soviet Russia, Jacobin France,
Fascist Italy, or Nazi Germany. That is what wokeism is attempting now and what the other two
religions might try. The problem that this runs into is that Christians today are too complacent.
Christianity has experienced a profound brain drain over the last few centuries. In the medieval or
early modern periods, the greatest minds whether St. Augustine, Isaac Newton, Thomas Aquinas, or
Descartes served the church. Recently, those people have gone into business, politics, or science.
This has resulted in the church constantly being outmaneuvered by other institutions.
This is why Christians haven't been able to adapt to the new scientific world.
Christian theology is stuck in the pre-industrial world, which makes it unrelatable to the general
public. The greatest issue Christianity faces is that a large part of the population literally
finds it impossible to believe in. The intellectual view of the world modernity has openly doesn't
believe in any non-material things, like God or spirits. Most people take this completely for
granted. Until that variable changes, the world's religions will continue to decline.
With all this said, changing the public's view on this, making them believe in a spiritual ideal
dimension, would be one of the most important intellectual breakthroughs in history.
I personally, and I know I'm biased on this topic due to my research in this area,
think there will be an intellectual breakthrough towards belief in the spirit world that will
take place this century. That being said, I think even if the evidence was irrefutable,
most people would reject it for a very long time. Getting it to become a new consensus would take
centuries. The fundamental foundations of most people's worldview are so mechanistic on a
really deep level. Christianity will keep losing in a mechanistic worldview against the other three.
The people who tend to be left in Christianity after all of this are the soft-hearted and those
who love tradition. These kinds aren't the sort of people who usher in great advances or fight
other ideologies. This has been self-reinforcing as the church becomes more of a white-bread place
for nice guys. The church runs into issues in which, since it tells its followers to follow
their moral code, even when it results in them losing, Christians get constantly outmaneuvered.
Christians today are completely incapable of realpolitik, cynicism, and power politics. You
often see Christians come across as overly sincere and cringe when they try to get involved in these
fields or they come across as completely out of touch with reality. Christians often end up
projecting their own attitudes upon their enemies, thus making their enemies' cynicism and power
hungriness completely unrecognizable. Christianity today is pretty cucked with the church being
feminized. The amount of young men attending church has halved since the start of the 21st
century since it's just not masculine enough. That being said, there has been a push to make
Christianity more masculine as we've seen with the Jesus-lifting culture, guns-and-god culture,
or figures like Jordan Peterson. Christianity, ironically, is the opposite issues of all the
groups above in that they err by being too cynical without a concept of the soul to give them internal
direction. For Christians, it's that they're too motivated by an internal sense of righteousness.
If you look at the worst Christian fundamentalist states over history, whether Puritan, New England,
Franco, Spain, or Savonarola's dictatorship in Florence, you find that it's pretty tame compared
to fascism or communism in which the Christians maintained independence for the family, the society,
very rarely had drafts, and there's not as much totalitarian interference in every single facet
of life. Thus, in summary, if Christianity doesn't do anything, it will continue to decline into
irrelevance. That being said, I think of all of these, Christianity has the highest potential for
winning, largely since Christianity has proven itself to be incredibly strong, or, as people say,
Lindy over its history, preferably by having some kind of internal revolution to make it more
adaptable to the modern world. Christianity has proven itself time and time again at being
incredibly inventive and malleable. This would be the most in-character for Christianity to do
of any world religion. Another important detail is that with the population crash which is occurring,
the religious are forming a vastly disproportionate amount of those who are procreating and continuing
the next generation. For educated people, this is even more extreme in which literally the only
educated people who are having children are the religious. This means that our society will
basically have to become religious over the next 50 years. The real question is what religion,
will they end up following? Eros of harshness like ours tend to push religion since people
need meaning in a difficult world that makes no sense. Of these four, Christianity is the best
track record of giving people mental models which actually help them live with their lives. All of
the other three effectively outsource behavior to the state or elites. It's their job to build
the utopia so you can be happy, not that you have to change your life to live a happy life as an
individual. With all that said, I'm still putting the highest bet on Christianity but I don't want
Christians to get complacent. Keep in mind your religion is still collapsing at record historic
rates in your home countries. Most people can't bring themselves to believe in traditional religions
even if they wanted to. If the natural order suggests we will become religious over the next
few centuries, it's totally possible that completely new variations emerge, maybe descended from the
other three ideologies. The world is a crazy place and is never going to be what you think.
In my opinion, the most likely victor is in fact some combination of these ideologies.
Darwinism and Christianity is an easy shot. We've already seen machine worship and Marxism
combined in the ruling ideology of our society. Except for Marxism and Christianity, which can't
combine due to both having belief structures which openly exclude the other, I find the combination
of Darwinism and Marxism hard to believe given once you believe in Darwinism, leftism makes no
sense. That being said, the left has proven they don't care about logical inconsistencies in their
worldview. I mean my short answer for who will win this religious war is probably no one. Anyone
who fills this void will have to adapt into something new. By the process of winning,
these ideologies would evolve into something completely different. Imagine a world where
Christianity really became a new state religion where spiritual technology or exorcism are back.
That's what a Christian victory as a total new worldview would have to look like. That's completely
unrecognizable to Presbyterian churches today. Just imagine if you showed up and told Marx about
what his ideology evolved into today being this corporate enabling for losers very wealthy ruling
class. Keep in mind we are players in this game. The result is still up to us. Are you ready to play?
