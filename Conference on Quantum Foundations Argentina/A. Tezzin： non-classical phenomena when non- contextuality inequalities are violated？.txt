Thanks, and now we move on to the next speaker of this morning's session, who is Alison Desin.
Please, Alison, if you can start sharing your screen.
Can you hear me? Yes, perfectly. And also, perhaps it's better if you put a full screen mode.
Okay. Okay, so the next speaker is Alison Desin from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil,
and he's talking about are we witnessing non-local phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities
are violated? Please, Alison, go on. Okay, so I'd like to thank the organizers for having
accepted my talk, and congratulations for this very nice conference. And it's a pleasure to be here.
And so, as you see, this talk is about a question, and the question is if we are witnessing
non-classical phenomena when non-contextuality inequalities are violated? And I would like
to begin this presentation by just finding this question. And in order to do that, I will show
a couple of examples of very recent papers where this claim is made. So the claim that
contextuality, which means by which I mean the violation of a non-contextuality inequality,
is some kind of signature of non-classicality. So these are the examples. So contextuality
is a non-classical behavior that can be exhibited by quantum systems. It's a non-classical feature
challenging everyday intuition. It's a non-classical purport exhibited by quantum statistics.
It's a key signature of non-classicality. And finally, it's the archetypal non-classical feature
of quantum phenomenology. So we know that this is a common view. And in order to contrast
contextuality and classicality, let me explain what I mean by classicality. And I will do that
basically by quoting this paper. And the main point is that, as I see it, a criterion for
classicality must have a phenomenological meaning. So as they say in this paper, a criterion of
classicality must allow us to say that in some sense, nature fails to respect classical physics.
So non-classical phenomena must defy classical understanding. And this is basically what I
expect from a criterion of classicality. So we can now rephrase our initial question,
just to be more explicitly. And we are asking if nature fails to respect classical physics when
non-contextuality and equivalence are violated. Okay, so now let's discuss non-contextuality and
equivalence. And this definition of contextuality that is the violation of non-contextuality and
equivalence, it's a very operational definition in the sense that it's a definition we apply for
experimental data. So contextuality. Wait, wait, there's something I will try to moot
Federico. Everyone, please moot their phones. Sorry, Allison, please go on. Okay, so as I said,
this is an operational definition, the sense that it's a label we apply for experimental data.
And this idea of contextuality as something that we can apply for data with no reference to
the underlying structure of the mechanism we are working with, it's a definition that arises in
the context of this model independent approach to physics. So I will discuss this model independent
approach very briefly, because I think some of you may not be familiar with it. And the core idea
behind model independent approach to physics, it is idea of a black box. And a black box is
a measurement setup. And we say we call it a black box because we assume that we can ignore
the underlying structure of this setup, and we can look onto the data. So as Popesco says,
according to this view, the entire physics should be encapsulated in the data.
And we can discuss, for example, locality from this perspective. So we can discuss locality
beyond quantum mechanics. So with no reference to quantum systems. So all we need are devices and
measurements that are outputs. And we can also discuss contextuality in this perspective. And
this is exactly the definition of contextuality that is based on non-contextuality in equities.
So contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities, just as
non-locality is the violation of the inequalities. Or we can equivalently say that contextuality
corresponds to the existence of global sections. So this is equivalent to say that
contextuality is the violation of non-contextuality in equities. So okay, and just to make it clear
that this idea of black box appears in contextuality analysis, I will show two examples. So here they
say that we have a black box and that the agent consumes the box by simultaneously performing
a subset of measurements. And a subset of measurements that we can simultaneously perform
is what we call a context. And here they say the same. So we have a black box that is a device
containing buttons and lights. And buttons represent measurements and lights represent
outcomes or outputs. And we have contexts that are collections of buttons that we can press
jointly. And okay, so these are some pictures representing this idea of black box in contextuality
analysis. So here we see that we have a black box with inputs that are buttons or measurements
and outputs that are represented as lights. So okay, so this is basically this model in
depended view. And now we will show a particular example of black box. And we will discuss this
example using the compatibility hypergraph approach to contextuality. That is one of many
model in depended approach to contextuality analysis. And we have to introduce a measurement
scenario in order to define a black box. And the measurement scenario we consider is a very
standard example of a measurement scenario in contextuality analysis.
And that is the device cycle. So in this scenario, we have only five measurements.
And all measurements of this scenario are binary. So they have only two possible outcomes. So one
and zero. And this is the symbol we call one. And this is the symbol we call zero.
Okay, and we also have to define a context. So we call that a context represents a collection
of measurements that can be measured simultaneously. And these are the contexts we consider in the
five cycle. So a context in this scenario is a pair of consecutive measurements. So for example,
a one, a two is a context. A three, a four is a context. A four, a zero is another context and
so on. So we have five contexts. And as I said, this is a very standard example of measurement
scenario for contextuality analysis. So these measurements are like the buttons of our black
box. And now we have to introduce a behavior for this scenario. That is the data our black box
generates. And the behavior we consider is a very famous example of contextual behavior in the five
cycle. And the behavior and it's this behavior. So by definition in contextuality analysis,
the behavior of a scenario is context dependent. So we associate a probability distribution for
each context. And this is the distribution we associate for a context in the five cycle. So
if we measure together ai and ai plus one, we will never obtain the same outcome. And
the probability of obtaining zero one or one zero is the same. And this is the data our black
box generates. So this is the behavior of our box of our box. And okay, and what we can say about
this behavior. So first of all, it's not disturbing, which means that according to this behavior,
it means that a measurement has the same distribution across all contexts. And more
over, according to this behavior, a measurement behaves like a coin toss. And this is one of
the reasons why we are calling this behavior a generalized coin toss. This behavior is an example
of stronger than quantum correlation, which means that quantum theory cannot predict this behavior.
And finally, this behavior is contextual. So it violates a non-contextuality inequality or
equivalently, we cannot define a global section for this behavior. So it means that we cannot
define a probability distribution, including all measurements of this scenario, that is capable
of predicting this behavior. So this is an example of a maximum contextual behavior in the five
cycle. And this is why this example is very famous. Okay. In the compatibility hypergraph approach,
contextuality and non-classicality are equivalently definitions. So according to this approach, if
our black box generates this data, then we have to say that our black box generates non-classical
correlations. Okay. So thus far, we have discussed contextuality from this model independent view.
And we have showed a very famous example of contextual behavior in the five cycle.
So this is the data our box generates. And this is the data we are going to analyze.
Okay. But now let's look inside the box. And to begin with, I would like to compare
bound equities with contextuality and equities. Because as I said, contextuality, according to
this definition, is the violation of non-contextuality and equities, just as non-locality is the violation
of bound equities from this model independent perspective. So let's compare these two definitions.
So suppose we have a bound scenario. So it's a scenario containing two space-like separated
parts. So each part has a black box. And each part is performing measurements. And they are
generating data together. And we analyze this data. And if this data violates a bound equality,
we can say that we are witnessing a non-local phenomenon. Which means that
a non-locality is a physical concept in the sense that we can define it in terms of physical
principles. For example, we can define locality using special relativity. And in this case,
so in this case, the data we have is intrinsically associated with a physical phenomenon.
And we can really ignore the underlying structure of these boxes. So these measurements,
they can be, for example, questions. He has no questions. We ask for these agents. And these
outputs can be answers they give. And if in this case, if these bound equities are violated,
we can say that we are witnessing non-local phenomenon. So there is this physical phenomenon
associated to the data we have. But in contextual analysis, we have no physical phenomenon
associated to it. Because contextuality, according to this model independence definition,
is not a physical phenomenon. Because we cannot define it in terms of physical principles.
So it would not be a surprise if inside a box generating non-classical correlations,
or contextual correlations, we had a simple classical structure. And I will try to show now
that this is the case for the behavior we called a generalized coin toss.
Okay. And before we go through the example, I would like to say three things about it.
So first of all, recall that we are assuming here that everything is encapsulated in the data.
So we can, in some sense, ignore the underlying structure of this black box. So a black box is
a very permissive concept. So it may contain an entire laboratory containing particles and
measuring devices. And also, the mechanism we propose is basically a coin mechanism for coin
tossing. And coin tossing is, according to many operational approach to physics,
it's a valid example of measurement procedure. So for example, people who work with specced
contextuality and journalize their probability theories, they are all the time using coin tossing
as an example of measurement procedure that is valid. So that's why we say that this mechanism
works along the lines set out in many operational approach. So according to these approach,
if we had inside a black box a coin flip, a coin tossing, it would be a valid measurement procedure.
And more importantly, this mechanism is something like a thought experiment. So we are trying to show
that unlike non-local data, non-contextual data can be generated by a simple classical mechanism.
So this mechanism should be understood as a thought experiment. So it's not a mechanism
that is interesting by itself. So okay, now let's go through the mechanism. And as I said,
it's basically a toy mechanism for coin tossing. And how can we describe
a coin toss using a toy mechanism? So we need an object. So in the real world, we use a coin that
is an object that for operational purposes has two sides. So here in this toy mechanism,
we consider for the safety of simplicity a 2D object, and each has two sides. So one side is
dark gray, the other side is light gray. And we have, we need to flip this object. So we fix an
axis passing through the center of this object, and we flip this object. And at the end of the
movement, we look to the side that is shown when the coin lands. So this is the real case. So in
this toy mechanism, we fix this side of the object. And we imagine that this is a sensor,
and the sensor can detect color that in this case is gray. And it can distinguish dark from
light color. So we have these two outputs. So these outputs are like heads or tails. So they are dark
gray or light gray. And the behavior we obtain if we perform these measurements, these measurements.
So if we flip this coin is the behavior of a fair conflict, because this mechanism is
constructed for this purpose. So okay, so this is a toy mechanism for coin toss.
And the point is that we can propose a straightforward generalization of this mechanism
that is capable of generating the behavior we call a generalized coin toss that, as I said,
is a very famous example of contextual correlation and contextuality analysis.
So in a coin toss, we have one binary measurement. So we need an object having one pair of
positive sides. But in the generalized coin toss, we have five pairs of positives. So we have five
binary measurements. So we need an object having five pairs of positive sides. So it could be
something like an unsided dice or something like this. But we are proposing just a toy mechanism.
So we consider a 2D object. And this is a regular decadent. And for each pair of positive sides,
we associate a measurement. And for each measurement, we associate a color. And okay,
the measurement procedure inside of this box is a coin flipping. But the flipping is
determined in this case by the context. So the context in this toy mechanism is an axis passing
through the center of the object and together with a sensor. And the sensor can detect color and
it can distinguish that from each color. So for example, if we want to measure
a 2 and a 3 together, if we press these buttons in our box, this mechanism will just flip this coin,
but with respect to the axis that they're mined by this context. So this is the axis,
this vertical line. And if we do that, we can obtain two possible outcomes. So we can detect
dark yellow and light green, or we can detect light yellow and dark green. So we can never
detect, for example, dark yellow and dark green because they are in a positive side of this object.
So this is a mere geometrical restriction of the object. And this is why we have this,
we have the correlation that is predicted by the generalized coin toss in this context.
And this is the mechanism we have. So each context is an axis together with a sensor.
And whatever is the context we consider, we have only these two possible outcomes and the
behavior is the behavior we call a generalized coin toss. Okay. And we also must be able to measure
single, to perform single measurements. And in order to do that, we have to fix a context.
So this is the general case in contextual analysis. So for example, if we want to measure
these measurements, A0, that is red, we have two options. So we have two contexts containing A0,
and we have to choose one of them. So we can choose, for example, this context,
and we just flip this object. And so we have two possible outcomes, dark red or light red,
and the behavior is the behavior of a fair coin flip. So to sum up, this mechanism, this time
mechanism, or just thought experiment, generates the behavior we call a generalized coin toss.
And okay, and what we can say based on this example, based on this thought experiment.
So first of all, let's discuss contextuality beyond content theory.
Okay, so the first point is that without clear specification of what measurement means,
contextuality has no phenomenological significance. It means that the meaning of
contextuality or the phenomenological meaning depends on what we mean by a measurement.
So in contextual analysis, the underlying structure matters. So we cannot say that,
I think that based on this thought experiment, I think this thought experiment suggests that we
cannot ignore the underlying structure when we are analyzing data from this perspective of contextuality.
Which means that in contextuality analysis, the entire physics does not seem to be encapsulated
in the data. So what we mean by measurement is important. And finally, contextuality,
at least beyond content theory, does not require a non-classical phenomenon.
Okay, and can we say something about contextuality in content theory based on this thought experiment?
And I think we can. So note that in our thought experiment, we are working with a classical
object. So it's basically a coin. So it's a classical object in the sense that it's a rigid
body. So it's just a time mechanism. So we say it's a 2D object, but we can imagine it as a real
body just as we imagine a coin as a rigid body. And okay, so we have this classical object and
measurements, our measurement procedures, are not revealing perverts possessed by this system.
And also we have context. So not all measurements can be simultaneously performed. So we have this
restriction that is an instrumental restriction. So this is part of our mechanism.
So it means that in our thought experiment, we are working with measurements that I like to
co-example, that are measurements that are not revealing perverts possessed by a system.
And we know that this view on measurements is a very common view on quantum measurements,
because we have Cauchy-Specker theorem. And Cauchy-Specker theorem says that
self-adjoint operators cannot be thought of as representing perverts simultaneously possessed
by a system. So Cauchy-Specker theorem suggests some kind of epistemic view on measurements.
So we have to accept that measurements are not revealing perverts possessed by a system,
or at least that they are not revealing perverts that are
simultaneously possessed by the system. But the point is that if the measurements we have
are epistemic, so if the measurements we have are not revealing perverts of a system,
then we have contextuality in the data. So the data our system generates will violate
non-contextuality and equivalence. And it's not because the system is non-classical or it's
classical, it's because measurements are epistemic. And the reasons that epistemic measurements cannot
be defined as random variables, sharing the same sample space. So we cannot define the
measurements because the measurements that are like coin flippings in our thought experiment,
we cannot represent those measurements as random variables in the same sample space.
And that's why we have contextuality in quantum systems, I think. And we must recall that
Cauchy-Specker theorem is about realism, it's not about classicality. So to sum up,
in quantum mechanics, we have, so in general, actually, if we have epistemic measurements,
so if we have measurements that are not revealing perverts possessive by a system,
and if we have context, so if we have these restrictions on what we can measure jointly,
then we have contextual data. So we have no ground for expecting non-contextuality in the data
because our measurements are not random variables in the same sample space. So I think that this
thought experiment suggests that those who accepted the epistemic view on measurements,
that is the view suggested, for example, by the orthodox interpretation of this, this is the view
hold by bar, and this is a very widespread view on quantum measurements in quantum mechanics.
So those who accepted this view, I think that should not take for granted that nature fails to
respect classical physics when quantum systems violate non-contextuality in the file. So it sees
that these violations are actually our consequence of the type of measurements we are considering,
and if we accept that the measurements we have in quantum systems are epistemic measurements,
then we should not say that nature fails to respect classical physics when these violations
occur. And that's it. That's what I had to say today, and thank you.
Thanks, Alisson. Thanks for this talk. So we have some time for one short question,
because now we are on 9.56. So if someone has a question, please go on.
So I have a question, or perhaps an observation, which is you can see the violation of
Bell inequalities as a particular case of a non-contextuality inequality, right? Because
and when you speak about model independence, it is not so independent of physical laws,
because in model independence, you have space-time structure. This is not the stress,
usually, in the literature about it, but otherwise, if you don't consider the space-time structure,
you cannot speak about a model independence analysis of an analysis on both scenarios.
You cannot even speak about space-like separation between measurements, you know?
And so what I think regarding your talk is that perhaps this space-time causal structure
should be taken into account into your analysis. I agree in that if you don't take space-like
separation, you can reproduce everything with a classical mechanism. I think that is accepted,
right? I mean, because you have examples of contextuality in, for example, in mathematical
psychology and so on, that I agree. But even so, I think that you can include the violation of
Bell inequalities as a particular example of a violation of a non-contextuality inequality.
So what do you think about that? That cannot be reproduced by any classical mechanism.
What do you think about that? Yeah, no, yes, I agree. So that's why I contrast, I compare
Bell inequalities with non-contextuality inequalities. So I know that Bell inequalities
are particular cases of non-contextuality inequalities. But I'm just saying that
this idea of black box works very well if we have space-like separated parts. So I agree with it.
But if we have a black box that is localized, so as the kind of box people use when they are
discussing, for example, resource theory for contextuality, so we have this box with many inputs.
So in this case, if we have contextual data, we not necessarily have a non-classical phenomenon
or something like this. So I agree with it. So if the boxes are space-like separated,
then we need non-locality. I see your point. Okay, I will check on the details because you
have a paper on this I've seen on the web. So I will check next week. But now we are on time.
So we thank again Alisson for this nice talk. Thank you. Thanks, Alisson. So now we call Diego
to share your screen.
So please, Alisson. Okay, great. So thanks, Alisson. So now we are on time for Diego's talk.
Great, great. So now we're glad to have Diego Boussandri from the Institute of Physics La Plata
and the National University of La Plata. And he will speak about revisiting maximal
fidelity of teleportation. Please, Diego, go on. Thank you very much for the presentation.
So let's talk. Diego, wait. Your sound is low. You could speak like this and it's good. But if you
could... Now? Now it's much better. Thanks. Thanks. Please, go on. Thank you, Fer.
Sorry.
No problem, no problem.
Now, okay, let's talk about fidelity of teleportation. This is a work we made with
Madeira Portesi and Anna Maftay. And so what did we do? We obtained the maximal average
fidelity of teleportation or the score of a given protocol for two situations, the standard
quantum teleportation protocol characterized by a particular measurement. So one second.
Now, we calculate so the maximal average fidelity of teleportation for the...
The sound is again low. I don't know if everyone is...
What happened? Now?
Yeah, now it's better. Yes. Sorry, sorry. No problem.
And then we obtained the average identity in two situations, the standard quantum teleportation
protocol characterized by a particular measurement in which there is a projection onto the bell
bus. And another protocol whose characteristic measurement is something in the middle between
the computational basis and the bell bus. But our differential feature is that we calculate this
for isotropic distribution of input states, not only the heart measure. I mean not only your estates.
So we are going to talk about useful protocols. Namely, a protocol is useful when its average
fidelity is greater than the classical one. Our key point or our main result is that
when you take an average of a more general distribution than the heart measure,
the quantum teleportation protocol can be useful when your resource has no quantum correlation.
So even for a classical quantum estate.
Well, what is the meaning of the identity of teleportation? Let us suppose that we have a
protocol P producing output estate given by Roy out with probability PI for an input estate or a
qubit estate given by Roy. And Roy is characterized by its block vector T.
And so if you want to know how well the quantum teleportation was performed, you can quantify
the similarity between Roy and the final output, calculating equation one. But this mesh
