Hello and thank you for watching this AutoHotKey tutorial for beginners. In this
video we're going to cover a lot of different topics. We're going to start
off discussing which versions of AutoHotKey to use, then we're going to cover
which editor to use. There's a lot of different editors out there and I've
tried a lot of them. The one I recommend is by far the easiest to start with.
Then we're going to jump into doing some some little pre-work. We're going to use
hotkeys which is actually a tool that you can use for AutoHotKey to launch
programs and stuff, but we're going to first use them to work smarter, not
harder. We're going to learn how to use them to edit our code and make it faster
as we develop code. Then I'm going to show you how to launch programs and
scripts and load a website with them. Then next we're going to jump into using
hot strings. The hot string as you can think of is like a text expansion type
thing. So you type a couple letters and bam there goes a lot of text whatever
you want to put in there. After that I show you a script where there's about
4,000 words in a spell check. What's great about AutoHotKey is any Windows
program you're in you can have this script running and it will spell check
across all your programs. It's another just a great example of hot strings. Then
we switch back to using a few more hotkeys where we show you how to remap
codes. Let's say you're using Outlook and you don't like a hotkey to launch a new
email. I'll teach you how you can hit a different key combination and it will
send the key combination that Outlook knows. It's a great way if you don't
like the programs you're using to remap the keys. Then we work on how to send a
mouse click to give in coordinates. Of course first you have to understand you
know identify where those coordinates are and then we send the mouse clicks
there. Lastly we wrap up on the programming side of being able to
compile a script and this is a really great thing about AutoHotKey. It's super
super easy to compile a script and that way you can use it on a different
computer where it doesn't have AutoHotKey installed or you can give it to a
friend and they can write it on their Windows computer. At the very end of
this script video I have a lot of resources where where to go when you
get in trouble. A lot of great sources where you have live support where people
are just willing to help you. The AutoHotKey community and forum the people
are just great and very helpful. My site I have a lot of tutorials on them but
this is places where you can go directly and get one-to-one help. In this
video you'll notice I mentioned a lot of stuff. There's a lot of pop-ups with the
actual links you know and hyperlinks of where you can go. Just make sure you
check in the description down below because I'm going to put in the time
codes of exactly in the video when it was and the URL there is too. So you don't
have to try to type the URLs right so make sure you wait for that and I
really appreciate you watching this video. Please like it if you think it
really helped you. I spent quite a bit of time on this video to make sure that it
really helps new people so I hope you like this tutorial for beginners. Cheers.
In case is the first video you've seen of me my name is Joe Glynes and I'm from
the Automator and I teach people how to automate their PCs. I love it's my
passion to help people work smarter not harder. Come to my site check it out. I
have over 600 videos on YouTube. I have three Udemy courses teaching Auto Hot
Key so all these are great resources. There's also some great Auto Hot Key books
out there but check us out. Also if at some point you want to get some work done
for you now I have people working for me that will automate things. So drop me a
note my email will be in this description and please like the video if you
think it was helpful and looking forward to get going here. Cheers. Alright so the
first thing we have to do is to download and install Auto Hot Key. So let's go
ahead and navigate to AutoHotKey.com in any browser. When you get there you're
going to see this button that says download. Go ahead and click it. It's
going to ask you which of these three options do you want. Always download the
current version. The other two I don't want to get into it. It's a bit advanced
to why. There's a lot of logic later that you might choose on but for now we're
going to download the current version. Go ahead and save it. I already have it
here on my desktop. It's a small file here. I'm going to save. I'm just going to
replace it and now once it's here I'm going to say open when done and it's
going to come up with the setup files that you want to install. Now Windows now
is trying to think that maybe this is a bad thing. Go ahead and click run anyway
and it's going to come up with this window. Now the default isn't this express
installation. For reasons I don't want to get into it's it's it's not what I
recommend right and most people say do the custom installation instead of doing
the Unicode 64 bit do the Unicode 32 bit and it's just it works with more
scripts you find online so it's just safer 64 a bit isn't necessarily better
it's just different and you can install it wherever you like. I'm just go ahead
and hit next I take the defaults on this screen as well. I take all the defaults
don't change anything and basically you're done. Now that we have AutoHotKey
installed let's work on getting an editor or an IDE. An IDE is short for
integrated development environment and I highly highly recommend you install
something. I'm going to recommend site for AutoHotKey. It's written specifically
for using with AutoHotKey. Technically you could use either notepad or
wordpad or almost anything that can edit a text file because the AutoHotKey code
is written in plain text and that just means when you open it you'll see the
actual characters and words there and you can recognize them and you could save
it. However there's a lot of functionality that using textpad wouldn't
allow you to do like relaunch the script or assist you in typing the code
you might want or hit F1 highlight a word hit F1 and bring up the support
AutoHotKey support. All of these things site will do for you automatically. Let's
go ahead let me share my screen here and on the main page that we're working from
I have a download for AutoHotKey site for AutoHotKey here so let's go ahead I'm
going to click this right now and we'll get it started here it's not a big
program. This is from my site I just make it for convenience because it might
disappear in the form at some point so that's going to download it we'll run
it here in a second but what I wanted to point out is if you come up here there's
this whole page dedicated to videos where I've taught people how to do looks
like I have at least 18 videos there. I'm doing some advanced stuff now I don't
recommend you start off here right because the great thing about site and
you'll realize this when we start programming it is it's super easy it
has a nice toolbar it has a lot of functionality it doesn't take a lot of
learning there's not a steep learning curve and yet it's very simple easy to
use so let's go ahead and install it I'm gonna I'm gonna hit Ctrl G and Chrome
that'll well let's see I can do it right here I don't have to do that I'm gonna
say open right so I don't have to navigate to it now it's gonna come up and say
do you want the quick setup install I'm gonna hit install just to see what it's
doing my default location is gonna be different than yours don't worry about
that install wherever you want it you should it'll find AutoHotKey's main
install file and that's where mine is and then you're gonna click install but
it's gonna come up and just say hey do you want to run these updates there's two
updates it'll download and just say yes and that's it and then sites installed
you have this nice toolbar up here it's a clean input interface so when you have
the vertical split on this vertical split leave it off I would recommend it
think it makes more sense to have it down here mine just happened to be closed
up so this is where you'll see output and this is where you'll see a lot of
debug information mainly the big one is like hey the scripted launch and there's
a problem like if we put something here and try to launch it oh it wants to save
it first well fine save hotkey script great now if I try to launch it it's
gonna tell me hey this file has a problem specifically hey what in the world
is our EFFD it tells you where it is right often they'll tell you the line
that the problem is on but this is this little stuff that it really helps you
understand what in the world is going on with your your script so I highly
recommend you install there's also notepad++ HK Studio which is the editor I
use now but it's more advanced and this is by far the easiest to install easiest
to pick up and use it's really a great advanced program for editing any kind of
text there's a lot of search and replace stuff you can do in it so now let's go
ahead and get into coding all right now that we have site and auto hotkey
installed let's go ahead and start working on our first script so we're
gonna jump in here and I just have a folder this folder to my temp directory
and it's just keeping all the files together for me so go in somewhere right
click and say new and I'm gonna say new auto hotkey script now this is gonna
generate a little bit of code in this file see it's one kilobyte it's not zero
and we're gonna call this thing test I'm gonna hit right inner key to save it save
the renaming and now I'm gonna right click again and say edit and because site
was installed it's the default editor it is gonna open this script in site for us
and so we can see several things here this is really helpful is that notice
this color coding if we open this file notepad this would just all be black
text and it's it's this is where having site installed is really helpful to
allow you to easily see this stuff things that begin with the pound sign
they're called directives and we don't need to get into all the advanced stuff
about that but I'm trying to point out they're a little different than other
things just no end it's it's we don't need to go into the explanation of it you
could comment it out you don't necessarily need it it's recommended but
you don't have to have it in there control Q in site will toggle so I could
I could highlight a bunch of these and it would toggle them but it'll comment them
out so that's control Q we'll leave it enabled it doesn't matter this sent now
these two are commands and send mode input this is the most reliable and it's
fast so we're gonna leave that enabled we'll use send a little bit later I send
command and the set working directory that basically says hey when I'm
accessing stuff use the the directory that I'm in is the default directory so
it's a good thing to have I definitely recommend having it notice this auto
assist this is why I love site also in in notepad you wouldn't have any of this
and it's really much more complicated so I'm gonna hit it enter to accept that
comma and we're gonna say force what this does it says hey only launch one
instance of this script so if the script was already running it would basically
relaunch it for you if it wasn't running a launch it if you'd launch it again it
will say hey there's already one running don't run two instance of this only run
one I don't understand why this isn't the default in every script it should be
it's used all the time right so I use this is 99.9% of my scripts it should
be in every script as the default you actually can go in a site you could
change that or you know somewhere and you can change that this is the default
value to have in there I highly encourage you to add it to yours and so this
gets us going and now I'm gonna stop here and then we're gonna switch to
actually working with hotkeys because we have a couple other things I want to
put in this but I want to keep these compartmentalized while we're talking
about directives and settings this is stuff that's for your script or other
things you could put in here and over time you might learn you might want to
have the next thing we're going to is actually creating hotkeys to do some
stuff that really helps speed up your coding
alright so let's jump into making our first script now before we actually do
some fun coding stuff I'm going to demonstrate a couple things to add to
your main script the one that you're working in to make it easier to develop
code so let's go ahead and start sharing here and we're gonna jump in now to
start off let me show you there's this script right now is not running I can
tell that one easy way is looking in here there's no green little green H's in
here so we're gonna say let's say message box hello world now I'm gonna save
this and when I hit this blue run it's going to or I could hit a five it's
going to launch this script so notice two things here one here's the hello
world message box this is the joseph's which script we're in and see this green
H down here right this is telling us this script is running the second I hit
okay here I also want you to notice something with this green H I hit okay
and suddenly it's gone right why is that well there was nothing else in the
script to keep it running keep it active and there are a couple things that you
could do to do that if you had a hot key or a hot string in it it would
automatically stay running you could add a single persistent a directive called
persistent and this would keep it running so if I save this we launch it the
message box comes up here's our green H when I said okay it stays running now it
wouldn't do anything because there's nothing else in this so we don't we
won't leave this in here but so we're gonna add that in our little pile of
things to keep in memory I'll just remember so this next one what we're
gonna do is let's say we wanted to be able to easily edit this script now
there's a couple ways we could do it right now because it's running and it's
down here I could right click on this and say edit so even if site was closed
yeah changes I can right click it here and say edit and it's gonna open to my
default editor which is site I could also come into the main script here and
right click it and say edit and it will pull it up but that would be really
tedious if you had closed site and you wanted to always edit it so what I love
to do and we're gonna do this with a hot key is a let's start dabbling in hot
key so there are things called modifier keys and those the main four are control
alt shift in the windows key those and auto hot key and so let's add some
comments here so the alt key is the exclamation point the the windows key is
the pound and I'm not yet the shift key is the plus sign and well control key
sorry and and this is the carrot which is above your six so these on their own
we wouldn't use these by themselves but they're called modifiers and that's
because you use them in conjunction with another letter or or or another key
so let's say every time I hit we'll do control H we want that to run message
box hello world now I'm gonna add a return here which basically tells
auto hockey to stop stop going forward after from that point on so I'm gonna
save this always remember you have to save and reload it or hit f5 so now it's
rerun it this is another reason this output window here this can tell you if
there's errors where what line the errors on so notepad doesn't have this and
this is where it's really nice so I can when I relaunch this you'll see it flash
also notice when I relaunch it you'll see it down here it blinks and so it's a
great way to make sure you understand the changes were absorbed or used so now
I'm gonna hit control H and bam there we go right and now if I hit enter it's
gonna get rid of it but look I can hit control H again and it pulls it up so
this is a hot key that's gonna launch whatever is between here and here I
could put a second let's say I wanted to do this so now it'll have two so if I
now I have to relaunch it again now this is the point of what I'm gonna show
here in a second is control H and it's gonna say hello and then world right so
we're using our hot key to use a message display a message box with a value in
it I'm not overly useful but you get the idea of I can trigger this we can also
trigger other things which we'll cover here in a minute but before we get to
that let's say I want to automatically reload this script instead of having to
come in here and launch it and then hit right click and say reload or relaunch
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna change this to control R so it makes sense to me
this is a really powerful thing in auto hot key I think it's really under you
know you don't understood of that I can make it what makes sense to me right so
I'm gonna change this to control R and I'm gonna add the command edit now this
is a special command let me also demonstrate here if I highlight if I'm
in a word and I hit F1 it will pull up the auto hot key help and that's built
into site also so this is a really great thing here the site document I'm sorry
the auto hot key documentation is excellent you can read about it and
then usually at the bottom it'll show you an example or two of how to use the
commands so I highly recommend again using site and then using that F1 when
you get stuck and don't not sure what it is so what is this gonna do well I'm
gonna save this and relaunch it so it takes it in now you know what let's
let's add here oh I don't want that that should have been reload there we go
and let's look at reload real quick so replaces the current running instance of
the script with a new one right so that's kind of what we're doing with this
f5 or relaunching it of course reload only works if it's already running but
I'm gonna save this rerun it now watch what happens if I hit control R it it's
funny it reloads it but it because it triggers the reload let me let me do
this a smart way so I'm gonna save this and now hit R control R and now when I
think control R so see it says it will reload now when I hit okay it's gonna
trigger that reload and notice the green H blink down here so again control R it's
gonna pull up the message box and then do the okay I just wanted the message box
to show you were actually in here right so now if I really hit just control R
it's gonna well the first time through now it's gonna reload it right so I can
just hit control R I don't have to come up here and hit f5 f5 is hard for me on
my keyboard to reach so it's a nice handy one to be able to say hey I want to I
want to make these changes and control R will do that for us because see how it
reloads it for us so it's a super helpful one to have in here I also want to
point out if your command is more than one line then you need the return if
it's not more than one line so let me comment this out this is only one line
right we can bring this one up here and a lot of these can be put on the same
line and if we do it on the same line you don't actually need the return so I'm
gonna say this hit control R again now it's reloading for us so it's great
because I can just hit control R and have it reload for me now another one
which is really helpful to have so we're gonna say control E to edit and now
this is the one that I was started to work on earlier here so this
so here are two that I will just love having in here so now I'm gonna hit
control R to take that now if site was not open I can hit control E and it is
going to edit this file it's gonna pull it up for us so these two hotkeys in the
main script that you're working on are in a D and again you don't have to use
control R right that's my example but it's super helpful for helping you speed
up what you're doing when you're coding because I don't have to come down here
and right-click and say reload or come up here with my mouse or hit F5 the
control R and E or whatever is convenient for you are super easy to do
and then what I often will do is I will use something to trigger so this is
this is often much more how hotkeys are used is let's say I'll do control M for
a message box and let's put that on the next line so message box world and now
because that is going on the next line I'm pretty sure let's just test it I
could have moved this up here and I'm gonna hit control R the say see this
asterisk up here that means there's been changes that haven't been actually saved
yet so now it's saved now control R will be logic and I can do control M for my
hello world control E to edit which is I'm already in it so if I was to close
this I can hit control E and they'll pull it up and control R you can see it
blinking down below in the bottom right so these are our three things now the
with this message box I want to demonstrate you can do other things
with hotkeys right so let's let's say I wanted to launch Chrome that one let's
start off with notepad because notepad's a little easier let's do control N now
control N is already a hotkey in site right now if I don't say this I hit
control N it's gonna open a new tab for me right but I want to use control in
in a different way so I'm going to say run notepad now I don't have I'll add it
here you don't have to have the exe and notepad especially you don't need the
entire path because notepad is in the windows path and so but I want to start
off with it to keep it simple so I'm gonna say control S control R to reload
and then I'm gonna say control N unfortunately it launched notepad on
my other screen here but let me bring it over here close it now if I control N
again yeah it remembers where it was so I just made a hotkey to launch notepad
but let's say we want to launch something that's not in the windows path
well you could we could say well I'm gonna come down here go to properties
I'm gonna get the full path and here this to the left I have mine running in
debug mode but this is the path to Chrome and so I'm gonna say and control C
would be a terrible one right because that's copy so we don't want to replace
copy so let's do alt C so I'm gonna do the alt C remember you got to use look
up here alt you know the exclamation is the alt key so alt C and then we're
gonna say run and here paste in this more often than not you don't need the
double quotes around it but let's let's leave them here so I'm gonna save this
reload it control R and alt C now alt C will launch Chrome for me right and you
can do this with almost any Windows program you can launch it this way get
the full path to it sometimes there's little things with you need to have the
set a given directory can run into some headaches or if you want to open a
certain file you can add a space here and add the path to the file after it
but being able to launch programs is a great simple thing and that's it for
this one let's let's do one other one so the windows key so windows let's say
windows G and what is anything that starts with G we'll just do something
to run grepwin so I'm gonna go to properties this is the path to my
file there we go now that one doesn't have the double quotes but it should be
fine I'm ready this is the portable version of it so I'm gonna save this sorry
save it reload it and now the windows key G will launch grepwin for me
grepwin is a search tool that will search across files in your computer it's
free highly recommended if you need to search text in inside files but anyway
you just see it now I use the windows key the alt key let's do one more with
shift so we're gonna do a shift and shift obviously the shift with a letter
would be bad on its own right because you want to capitalize letters but we'll
just do shift T and you know I'm just gonna be lazy and run calc I think it's
calc.exe so if I hit shift T oh I didn't I didn't save it save it reload it shift
T just ran my calculator so there I used the the four main modifiers shift
windows alt and control to demonstrate how you can launch programs you can
launch other scripts you can launch web pages you could you could actually you
know let me let me let me demonstrate that I launched a browser however let's
say we wanted to and you know what this will be a good one for the Windows G
is let's say we wanted to run a certain website so here I would put in you know
what I don't like I want to save this so we have it as an example but I'm gonna
comment to that you know what let's demonstrate this I'm gonna leave those
both there I'm gonna say run so I'm gonna save this when I hit reload notice it
says hey there's a duplicate hotkey you can't have the same hotkey in the same
script because it'll cause a problem it won't know which one to run so it warns
you that's another great thing about this is it warns you so I'm just for now
I'm gonna comment this out if it was running in another script it would have
launched and it would have just used the most recently launched one so so this
though what I wanted to demonstrate was oh you know what actually I called it
Windows G because I wanted to run Google there we go so control R now it
reloaded now when I hit Windows G it launches my default browser and takes me
to that web page so this is how I can easily do a search so let's that'll wrap
this up here with dealing with hotkeys and these these ones I like to add in
the just ease I put something similar to this in every one of the scripts I'm
working on that I'm adjusting I always have it running in that script and then
when I'm finally done with it I either comment them out or I'll remove them
because I'll have another one that I'm working on and I only put those in what
the active script that I'm trying to develop okay the next thing we're
covering are called hot strings or you can think of them as text expansion for
me they are the lowest hanging fruit the simplest thing you can learn today and
be using it and be more efficient at a computer they're so simple and important
and save so much time it was the first Udemy course that my colleague Jackie and
I built on Udemy because they just they're huge time savers they're way
overlooked by everybody and they're just one of those little things once you get
them you realize you do type the same things over and over and over and they're
really helpful so let's go ahead and start working on them what we're gonna do
is let's let's do a little example here so let's say I I hey I type my email
address a lot right so I'm gonna put in two colons and think to yourself what
what do I want to type as the abbreviation for my email address so I'm
gonna say JTA because this email address happens to be Joe at the automator
calm and then you put in the two more colons and then you type what you want
Joe at the dash to meter calm notice you make sure you put it in the case you
want like uppercase here I uppercase my a right because I want that to come through
but I don't want it here and I want my first name to be capitalized and so I'm
gonna save this since I still have this running I'm a hit control R now it just
absorbed it now when I type JTA period now it didn't do it right then but when I
hit a space a return or a tab basically any kind of ending character it swaps
that out for me right so it's it's a very simple thing to be able to learn how
to do you can replicate this to your hearts and this will work I could open up
after I have a hot key a control in will open up notepad JTA period space
there's my email address right it's it is just the simplest thing in the world
you could put in paragraphs of text like let's say also we wanted them let's say
we want to have it have a line break so I'm gonna do this till day which is to
the left of the number one till day in stands for like a new line feed is the
the actual character for it so and make sure if you do edit your own add it into
the script here that you don't try to save it or load it because that'll cause
an error so new Joe Joe with the automator is tick my tick in email to can
address I'm gonna save this I'm gonna control R to reload let's go back to
notepad now when I type JTA period space it put it across different lines right
it out of the line so if you wanted to have multiple things in here there is a
character limit on how many you can do in this structure however you can have
up to like 16,000 characters in a different way you can look at the the
hot strings help which on that way my win web page for this beginner course I
have a link to it about how to do continuation sections but it's really
that simple and so here let's get back I'm gonna hit control D which is a hot
key in site for duplicate the line and I'm gonna get back into my email address
where when I save this control R to reload come into notepad you know what I
think I can see if I can type down here yeah I can dump it in here so see that
space at the end well often I'm using my email address or in a as a user area in
username for a form and I don't want that space at the end because that of
course would break it so it's a simple change in auto hotkey is just add an O
in between the first two colons now when I save this and reload it when I come in
here and type JTA period now watch what happens when I hit space so notice where
my cursor is it's right at that M it didn't add the space at the end and so
it's it's a very simple thing to adjust where if I am using a email address or
maybe a password now you know do discretion if you're saving passwords
because that the password will be stored in a plain text file that's easily
visible by anybody right there's ways around it and I have a video on that
somewhere but it is they're not secure so just be careful with it but it's very
convenient to be able to do this so things like you know just some things you
just don't want to space out at the end sometimes you want to it might be a
plural sometimes not and this is an easy way to do it without having to back
space to get rid of that extra space another example that I want to
demonstrate in this will wrap up the basic hot strings is there are certain
characters because up here this windows key the the pound sign the alt key this
exclamation point this carrot is control auto hotkey interpretees is very special
characters right so you can't let's say we were doing this see the STB if you're
a Seinfeld fan you'll get this you have to see the baby exclamation point right
so I'm gonna save this reload it now when I come in here and I'm doing it down
here because if I do it here and I save it it'll break my code right so I'm
typing in here STB period space hey it sent you have to see the baby but no
exclamation point right why is there no exclamation point well that's because it
literally thought hey let's send the alt key right because it's a special
character so the easy there's two ways very simple ways to take care of it
there are other ways we're gonna handle two of them right here the first way is
to wrap this anytime you have a special character this wrap it with these curly
braces and save remember save reload reload watch that green H flash now STB
periods now see it has the exclamation point so that's option 1 option 2 is you
can leave this the original way but put an R in between here so I'm gonna save
this reload it there it goes and STB period space and that works also notice
here we have the space which is perfectly fine but I could put the O in
combination with the R save it reload it come down here space and now we have it
without the extra space right so even though this works like looks like the
word or it's not auto hotkey you can put multiple things in here and it's a
simple easy way let me do one more one more fun one that's it's good to know
is if you don't want to wait for that tab or space you want that hotkey to get
replaced right away you can use another one here is you put in the asterisk so
here is let's say HW period oh actually you know I don't want the period here so
there we go so this is gonna send hello world save it reload it now watch what
happens right when I hit the W so H now the second I hit the W it dumps it in
right I didn't have to hit that space or a tab or return after so those are three
things you can easily adjust in hot strings again hot strings to me this
may it might to some of you seem very simple and then oh maybe I'll use that
maybe I won't I can't stress how much you realize you type the same words or
same URLs or passwords or email addresses or names of companies over and
over or even entire paragraphs right so there's this is a lifesaver it just
saves so much time and in a second here we're switch over to launching a spell
check that will run again this will work in any program right I could have been a
notepad and it'll dump it in right any Windows program so it's running across
all of your tools some every once in a while you have a little problem sending
to it and that's also check out my my Udemy course or just read the search and
read the help you know I push my Udemy courses little just because they give a
good guide it's not that I want to make a ton of money it's I don't mind making
money but it's a it's that they give a nice flow and they cover things they
give you an order and some people really like having the structure in the order
so let's get into the next one with using a spell check all right this spell
check I found on the forum years ago and I tried backtracking it to get the
documentation where I found it but I couldn't find it anyway it has nearly
4,000 words in it and it's great because no matter what program I'm in and
Windows as long as the script is running it is doing the spell check for me
across all of those Windows anywhere I'm typing so let's jump into it you can
get it off of this main page and I'll put a link in this video too but on this
main page down here download spell check I'm gonna right click and say save link
as and here we're gonna save it for now I'm gonna save it let's go to the where
I have those other files saved
a key for beginners here we go and I'm gonna call it spell check that's fine
save it now it's gonna save it I'm not gonna launch it here what I want to do
is let's look at that directory and I'm gonna come in here and say edit oh
edit script and now this is gonna pull it up and I want to talk through a
couple of things before we launch it notice these here's the source just so
you have it here too this is where you can get it from and that no environment
we're familiar with they're ready single listens force absolutely send mode
input great this one is basically turning off because these are spelled
properly right so it turns off the back spacing for for some of these hot
strings so because those are often people the spell check will think it's
misspelled but it's not and so we're turning it off for that in here and I
hear examples and look how big this file is right like I said it has got 4,000
words that will auto correct for you so it's a really helpful script let's go
ahead and do a demo down let's pick the one I let's do America so sometimes
apparently people forget to see because I guess there's no seas in America maybe
few oceans but let's say America notice the star here so it's not going to wait
for us for an ending character right it's going to do the replacement right away
and but unfortunately I haven't I haven't actually launched this yet right and
right now in the system trade we don't have anything running right now this
one has been killed for now but let's go ahead what I want to do is to come back
into where we saved it and I'm going to get the path to this file so come in
here copy this go back to site here and this is actually going to cause a
problem but I want to demonstrate this as well so I'm gonna say run because we
wanted to run the script this is the folder and then it's what was it spell
underscore I can see it at the top there in the other tab check HK now if I was to
save this and we launched this script we see the one green H running here it's
just test right but hey why didn't that launch the other script well the problem
is we if we have a hot key or if I had a return this top part of your script is
the auto exec script and it happens up until you come down to like a hot key or
return anything that so what we want to do is things that we want to launch we
want to have it at the top part of your scripts and so now I'm going to save this
now if I relaunch this or hit ctrl R you're going to notice over here now we
have two green H's and it's unfortunate that it always puts in that same default
icon and and this is where it gets really confusing if you have a lot of
scripts running any given time I typically have like five to seven scripts
running at a given time all the time right for this example video I've ripped
everything out so I don't confuse anybody but remember this needs to be at
the top in your auto exec section otherwise it won't it won't get to it
basically it stops it it stops before it reaches it now there's an easy quote
unquote cure for this one is at the top here again if we don't want these two
green H's well hey the spell check I want it running all the time I don't it's
rare I'm going to edit that file so what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in
here and that's why I've added this here is this no tray icon if I save this and
and you know what I could launch it from here but let's come back in we don't
even have to be here I just hit control R and you'll notice the the green H is
going to go away so I'm gonna hit control R now that other green H isn't there but
the script is still running and I'll demonstrate that by coming in here let's
come back down to our America example there we go so I'm going to start typing
AMERIA and notice it put in the C right so the script is still running but we
don't have it in the system tray there's some some major benefits of this is that
if you have a lot of scripts going it doesn't get confusing down here the
drawback of course is I couldn't come in here and right-click and say edit so it
can make it it can be a pain and I have another script that you can use that
will it'll show you all running scripts I could go to my task manager and I
could find it from there and right-click and kill it or I could come back in here
and I could just you know go to edit it I could I could even find it in here and
right-click and say edit right so I can get to it that way but it just won't be
in your system tray and you can change the icons like in some of my other
scripts I have it where I change icons I even have a script to automate changing
the icon so Google that on my on my YouTube channel but it's I recommend
hiding you know only having one to two in there because otherwise it just gets
too confusing and so I only allow my one script I'm playing with to be there and
then I'll change it either I hide it or I change it to a different one so let's
demonstrate a couple other things in here notice down here at the bottom they
have abbreviations so I can type SCP period that's funny it was trying to
interpret that SCP period space and it puts in September for me right so this
would be a spell check or let's do this the days of the week I see Sun space
right so it has a lot of default ones of course you could either comment these
out or delete them if you don't want to have them in there obviously the word
may you know that one's gonna come up in a lot of sentences so they didn't do it
for that one but you get the idea right this is a great easy tool to have
running and it runs like let's go back to I don't have it launched I was gonna
say let's launch notepad which I just don't recall we got rid of that hot key
I'll just turn it back on save reload control in to launch it and I'm gonna
kill it real quick because I'll forget that I did that and if we do the SUN
period space there's Sunday AMER I know see a America in November right it'll
run in every program so if you're like me I actually have a couple tools allow me
a text from my computer it's so easy to be able to automate texting and
be using your hot strings to help type the stuff that you want to send right
so it's super simple super fast hot strings are there you know a really
really really great tool that I highly recommend also don't add too many the
spell checks one thing because it's doing automatically but the regular hot
strings don't add too many at once baby step into it also make abbreviation so
like mine what I do is for email addresses I'll put usually mine or my
own email addresses are different because I have about eight and I do them
differently but if if I knew let's say Abraham Lincoln and he had an email
address I would do Abraham Lincoln email oops and then a period so unfortunately
that one may not do because it looks like that's actually a word but and this
would be Abe at gmail.com right so oh and I actually look at that I messed up
that there we go that's better and this one of course I want the O in there so
I'm gonna save this reload it a e so it's basically the first two initial the
initials the there are the first two letters followed by an E and that went
in a period and so that helps me have a pattern and makes it easier for me to
remember all my hot strings because I have hundreds upon hundreds of them and
it can be it can be confusing but again they're super helpful and so let's get
going on the next section
okay so I want to do one more with the hot key just to demonstrate how easy it
is to remap keys in a given program let's say you know in a lot of programs
control H will do the search replace functionality and the control H to me
just isn't the most intuitive hot key so what if I wanted to send a different
you know hit a different hot key to send control H so let's say I wanted Alt R so
Alt R that's gonna trigger this now we're gonna send control H and make sure
you add the return because we're on more than one line so save this control R
will reload the script I saw it blink now I'm gonna hit Alt R and notice it this
came up which is the control H now control H still works in site because I
didn't replace that but now when I hit Alt R it sends control H which is what
the active program is gonna interpret as oh hey hit control H so it's a great
easy way to adjust something if you don't like the hot key or accelerator key in
the program you're in you can write it just to redo your own now when I was
actually doing this I came up with a little bit of a problem here let's let's
change the control R R R let's just comment it out so we don't have that one
for now you you could do this this works technically so control R is gonna send
you know what I want to leave that so we are we're gonna do control R to send
control H and before the control R was up here so this technically will work so
I'm gonna save this I'm gonna minimize that reload the script I think this
should we'll control I'm gonna hit control R now that sent the control H
however I got a caution you these modifier keys have to be the same so if I
was trying to hit Alt R to send control H unfortunately so let me close this
reload the script now I'm hit Alt R Alt R it doesn't work I just hit it it
doesn't work and basically what's happening is this is what gets passed
along the the control whatever modifier key was here is gonna be the same over
here it when they're the same it works fine when they're different then you need
to put it onto the next line and then add the return right so if you just get
in the practice of doing them on the next line then you're fine right if
you're gonna use the same modifier key you can have them the same line if not
then put them on a different line so I hope that helps it again just think about
it if you're in a program you don't like you know the the commands being sent
it's a great easy way the hot key that the program is associated with it you
can make your own and the other one I wanted to point out was you can make
context sensitive hot keys and I'll have a link in the the web page about this
but basically I could have it say if I'm in site and hit control R and do one
thing if I'm in notepad and I hit control R do another and if I'm in word and hit
control R do something else so they're they're context sensitive meaning they
understand what program they're in the active program and it's gonna do
something different they're not totally hard to do but be considering this is a
beginning video I didn't want to you know do too much in this video training
video to show you so that's it and then next we'll move on to our next section
okay now we're gonna work on sending mouse clicks to a given position and
before we dive into the code I do want to caution you because windows often are
you know are in different locations where they have something in front of it and
it's not the most consistent reliable way to automate programs there's a lot of
other ways I have a lot of we have webinars and tutorials on different
ways to approach this however this is easy and if you're controlling the
environment it's definitely something you can easily do set up and let's go
ahead and dive into it here so let's pretend we're gonna click this we'll
stick with the control H type thing this is the we activate the program here so
this is the replace button we want to get this down the problem of course is we
need to know the coordinates of where that button is right so the sending of
the click is easy there's a little bit of stuff we need to figure out where
we're gonna send it to so there's a really simple command it's a get no
mouse get position and it's gonna ask for the the two variables to store it so
you can see here output var x output var y those are suggestions so we'll just
call this one look x comma look why look why there we go that's all we need
there and to start off let's let's do a message box oh you know what well we'll
finish this here so message box and x is at and this is where we're gonna wrap
our variable name the thing we just had look x with percent signs and that will
make the message box display the value in the variable not the actual text that
we have there so x is there and y is at
that's why there we go so unfortunately right now I could run this but guess what
we don't have a hotkey to trigger it right so let's add a hotkey let's say
what let's say control oh I got a control M control P sure for position so I try to
think of them as you know meaningful so it control P to get mouse position now
we're of course this is gonna change later because we're gonna swap this to
actually click in the position but for now it's fine so I'm gonna save this
control R to reload oh I disabled my control R I think I I disabled it but
I didn't read restart it now control our works and this is where this I'm trying
to show you a little bit of the troubleshooting while you're going through
this right so control P is gonna get if I hit it right now it's saying x is at
384 and y is at 58 but that was down here right so we're gonna redo this come
up here now hit control P and now we have to remember 481 and 93 so actually
I'm gonna leave this up here by the way any message box and on a hotkey you
can come in here and hit control C and come down here and paste and it will have
the contents from that message box right so it's a nice easy way to get that
little insider tip there so this is gonna be the x is gonna be 481 so let's
comment this out and I'm gonna keep these numbers so x is 41 and y 93 so I'm
cheating here because the next thing is you know we'll just we'll cut make that
a comment and I'll have this and now we're gonna click so we're gonna say
click comma and now it's as simple we entered those numbers right so 481 comma
93 and that is that let's add a return so it doesn't keep going so I'm gonna save
this reload and now when I hit control P notice it moved my mouse there oh look
at that how did I get the wrong thing that's it I'm you know I we can go back
and watch a video I will bet you money I was on the wrong thing when I did that
so simply we will disable this re-enable this oops well I need to reload the
script make sure we're over the correct thing and this is why you know you'd
practice right walk it through so 435 yeah look at that I was off an 87 now the
y it's this way so that one probably can say the same but the 435 this should
have been 435 right because your x is going across and the y is the up and
down so now I'm gonna save reload and hit control P and there we go so funny how
I got distracted apparently and moused over the wrong item that I wanted to
click now again if I had a window up in front of this it wouldn't care oops hey
it wouldn't care it would have clicked you know and right here and this is why
that sending of a mouse click just isn't that robust or if I move this to
another monitor the coordinates are gonna be different or even if I move it
like this the coordinates are gonna be different right there's a lot of reasons
why this can break but this is just the simple way of hey sending a mouse click
to a given coordinates often we put our windows up we maximize them and the
things don't move so it definitely can work it's just not the most robust way
by the way I have a script called automate my task on my website and it
it eases the pain of getting these coordinates finding an image it actually
narrows it down by the controls it's pretty robust it it'll search everywhere
for you you just lock in the image and then say go click this or go send text
to this edit field so check that out if you're interested but that's it for the
sending of a mouse click to given coordinates
in this section we're gonna explain how if you want to share your code with
someone else or that you want to run your code on another computer you don't
have to install auto hotkey it's very very easy to compile the script in
auto hotkey and give it to someone else or just run it another computer so
let's go ahead and get started we come in here and go to explore this is the
easiest way highlight the script you want right click and just say compile
script right that'll actually create an executable program in the same folder
it takes a couple seconds so here now I have an executable program I can take
this to any Windows computer I don't have to install anything I just put it on
it and run it and when you run it it'll you'll have the you know if it had a
system tray icon it'll it'll have it down there let's do this with the test so
I'm gonna right click say in that one compile script I'll end up here with a
test.exe and that one because we have hotkeys in it and the icon is showing it
should show up here in the system tray and that's it right other languages this
can take a lot of work Python in particular I would compile scripts and
it was a process and it's just it's amazing that it's so easy not a hotkey
to compile script and give it to someone else and if they're running even down to
Windows XP Windows 7 Windows 8 Windows 10 it's very very consistent there are
some things with the pre Windows 7 there was no user access control and so
things were slightly different so XP might be just slightly different but
generally speaking they're very stable across all versions of Windows on
different computers now the program itself might be a little different
depending if you're sending mouse clicks in the coordinates right I mentioned
that earlier but the the heart of the program stays the same so that's simple
as we wrap up I wanted to share some helpful links and resources that can
help you automate everything and let me jump over here on this so in this
beginner page right which I'll have in the resources here there's the you know
absolute documentation commands and keys these links I have these three bookmarked
on my main default home page I use them a lot that documentation and
commands those are great the keys are when you're just getting used to
understanding what keys you want to send all three of these are just must-haves
that you use in and out the forum page the overall hotkey form it's an amazing
form the people are super helpful and nice you can definitely go there you can
find a ton of things already solved for you there's different forms let's
actually let's jump to it real quickly here and show you so the main page here
breaks down into different forms so there's tutorials scripts these are
completed scripts and functions here's where you go to ask for help and then
down below you'll actually see here are the links to the other languages so if
if English isn't your first language you can actually ask questions about that in
that language which is great and so I have those here discord is also it's a
live site well I shouldn't say life right but people hang out there and they
will they're more than happy to help you with with what you're working on and
then you can share screens and so it's a dynamic way to be able to talk to people
and get some help but you do have to use this link to create an account for it by
the way I like I said I have over 600 maybe so over 700 YouTube videos on
Auto hotkey now and I cover a lot of different topics so you can definitely
go there this tutorial on specific this playlist is specifically geared towards
people like you that are just starting out an auto hotkey there's not a ton of
videos in there but there is a deeper dive you know we skimmed over the
installing a editor and installing the program and discussing it I go a little
deeper in these and then there's we've given over 50 webinars on auto hotkey
and we have also I think now around 65 podcasts discussing different things
with automation I did mention earlier I have three Udemy courses here and if you
click them from here there's a coupon code that you'll get a discount for so
for the basically for the intro to auto hotkey hot strings like I said it's hot
strings are just amazing and the intermediate course these are all
they're roughly are between $10 and 13 1299 so if you come here you'll get the
best deal that there is and I'll get more of the money it's hard to explain
but you to me if you come in from other places I end up getting a tiny fraction
of the money instead of getting them from here so I appreciate if you click
these links at the same time it is going to be the cheapest price you can get so
that's why I have them here there are auto hotkey books by Jack Dunning Jack
it's been writing for over 30 years and he has a ton of auto hotkey books you
can go to his blog two of the books are free and then you can download or you
know order the other ones they're very reasonably priced usually between four
to six dollars I think and if you're one of those people that would rather have
you know it you know a step-by-step very minutiae work it's really great because
he also gives you a ton of examples of how you might use auto hotkey and that's
one of the things I do a lot of my videos as well as just talk through what
I've automated because it's easy to kind of get caught up in doing something and
not realize hey there a lot of the stuff I do daily can be automated so I hope
that helps auto hotkey is a very rich robust language we didn't even scratch
the surface of what it's capable of this is just to introduce you to you but you
can do things like web scraping I have a screen clipping tool it'll grab text you
can do regular expressions it's an object-oriented language so you can do
some pretty advanced stuff but the API calls are another great one I do a lot
of automating of Excel and Outlook so sending emails or automating reporting
in Excel anything with the Microsoft Office program you can basically connect
to programmatically and really well drive it so go ahead and check it out my
side alone if you come up to the main site here there's there's you know a lot
of different things in here that you can learn about what's using functions
where they so here's the functions controlling programs with controls that's
another really great one the web scraping I mentioned with either IE or now
with Chrome what you can see in here again it's web scraping Excel auto hockey
studio once you get a little bit more robust is an amazing editor it's a
default editor I use now but I do have all these videos on site on how to
customize site and to do some advanced stuff thank you for watching my video if
you found it helpful please like it now and share if you think that others will
benefit from it the more you share the more we get likes we get more videos
like this we can make and it just helps support us also if you're interested you
can go to my site and go sign up for our alerts basically we sent out alerts of
new stuff new videos new things we've learned new concepts of how to do auto
hockey and automation as well as just things you might want to automate so we
hope to see you there thanks again cheers
