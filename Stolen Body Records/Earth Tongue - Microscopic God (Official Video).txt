A, B, E, R, O, S, M, I, Chris Copic, or Demi-Service,
Causing harm to the delicate balance of the way things are connected
Leading off thoughts within plots and leading them to face the way
From the sun and set into a natural light
Causing them to live up to the above the dirt
Daepers, thinkers, are the single cellular scheming
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Daepers, thinkers, are the single cellular scheming
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Always multiplying single-handedly
Shifting the attention, turn to look away
There's only one but it's in every direction
Bloting upon a massive validity
Of the absolutely invisible entities
Wicing always multiplying
Daepers, thinkers, are the single cellular scheming
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Life won't stop at all
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Waste them, take a look behind the door
Waste them
