If you were not paying attention, you may not have noticed the revolution happening in the airline industry.
The days of attempting to build bigger and bigger airliners like the 850 passenger double-decker A380
and the 660 passenger Humt 747 are gone. The behemoths are simply being outcompeted
by a new generation of planes. Many mourn the slow demise of these iconic planes,
but you are benefiting from this change. The entire nature of air travel has changed
to benefit you and your needs. Your local airport has more direct flights to distant lands than ever
and the price of those tickets are cheaper than ever. Connecting flights are becoming rarer and
rarer as this new breed of plane takes over. The plane at the forefront of this revolution,
the 787 Dreamliner. A 30 billion dollar bet on the future of the airline industry.
Boeing sat at the poker table and pushed all their chips forward. An all-in bet on a radical
new future and it paid off. The 787 revolutionized not only how the airline industry operates,
but how the future of planes will be designed and built. This is the breakdown of the 787's
materials. By weight, 55% of the 787 is made from composite materials like carbon fiber
reinforced plastics, making it the first commercial airliner made primarily with this new age
material. The 787 is rivaled only by the Airbus A350XWB introduced four years after the 787 in
2015. So why are composite materials so desirable for the airline industry and how has the 787
made the most of their advantages? Composite materials are made up of two or more materials.
Take carbon reinforced plastics. They are composed of extremely strong carbon fibers bound together
by a plastic resin. Carbon fiber made up of thousands of tiny thin fibers of carbon
is incredibly strong in tension, up to five times stronger than steel and one-fifth of its weight.
But these tiny fibers can't create a solid part by themselves. This is an image of a human hair
beside a carbon fiber. The carbon fiber is the smaller one and just like a human hair,
they can bend and flex and separate very easily. So we need to first bind them together with a
plastic resin to form a solid material. Otherwise they just form a strong but flexible fabric.
That flexibility as a fabric is exactly what makes composites so useful when creating the precise
and elegant curves of a plane. With the right tooling and designers, composite components can
be made into almost any shape imaginable. In the past, a disadvantage of making large aircraft
components from composites was the time taken to manually lay up parts where layers of carbon
fiber and plastic resin had to be carefully constructed. It required skilled technicians
and was inherently difficult to scale to the production quantities Boeing needed.
To get around this, Boeing uses automated tape laying to produce massive aircraft sections.
The 787's fuselage is created by wrapping a carbon fiber tape impregnated with a plastic resin
around a rotating mold of the fuselage. This machine precisely controls the overlaps of the tape
and the orientation of the fibers to ensure we are getting the most out of the carbon's tensile
strength to resist the internal pressure loads and the longitudinal bending loads the fuselage
will experience. One of the problems with this manufacturing method is that the part needs to
be placed inside an oven to cure the resin. This hardens the plastic and creates a solid composite
structure. Ovens the size of a wide-bodied jet airliner fuselage are not exactly common and
this is often the limiting factor on parts made this way and requires massive upfront investment
to build a customized oven large enough to fit the part but the benefits are well worth it.
The first and most obvious is the strength carbon fiber provides. Previous generation
airliners are typically pressurized to an equivalent of 8,000 feet. That's the same height as Mount
Olympus in Washington State. High enough that the lower pressure would reduce your oxygen intake
and your stomach will bloat as the air inside is higher pressure than the outside. This is
uncomfortable and exacerbates the effects of jet lag but thanks to the 787's stronger fuselage
it can increase its internal air pressure to an equivalent of 6,000 feet 25% lower in altitude
and about 7.3% higher in pressure. That may not sound like a lot but it goes a long way in making
the journey more comfortable and at the very least the person next to you won't be farting as much.
Less farting is always nice but my favorite benefit of the stronger fuselage is the absolutely
massive windows. This is the 787 window and these are windows of some equivalent aluminium
airliners. They are absolutely massive. In aircraft made primarily from aluminium,
having holes this large in metal panels would result in the build-up of stress at the window
boundaries as the stress contours have to deviate around the window. This stress does not exceed
the material strength but over repeated pressure cycles, tiny imperfections in the metal can grow
into even larger cracks and eventually fail. Holes this large in an aluminium airliner would
severely shorten the plane's flying career before it needed to be fixed or disposed of.
Kind of like how cracks in McGregor's leg shortened his career but it's not a problem for the 787
thanks to Composite's relative immunity to fatigue. You could kick Dustin Purir's kneecap
as many times as you like with carbon fibre shins. The carbon fibre construction provides
plenty of benefits for the airline operators too because the fuselage is just one massive part.
Boeing was able to eliminate all joints and all the fasteners needed to join them together.
Sections that used to be made up of 1500 aluminium sheets riveted together using 40-50
thousand fasteners are now just one massive carbon fibre section. Carbon fibre strength to
weight ratio already makes the fuselage lighter but eliminating joints and fasteners makes it even
lighter again. The reduced weight reduces fuel burn but this fuselage is also incredibly aerodynamic
because it doesn't have thousands of little bumps and ridges all over it from those joints
and rivets. These surface imperfections make the plane's surface rough and cause it to
disturb more airflow, increasing parasitic drag. Composite materials help reduce drag in other
ways too. One of my favourite things about the 787 is its elegant wings. The main structural
member of a wing is the wingspar. Its primary role is to resist the upwards bending force
during flight. It's essentially just an i-beam, a shape optimised to resist bending loads. The
wingspar of the 787 are constructed from carbon fibre composites while the ribs, the structural
member is connecting the two spares and that support the wing's skin are machined out of solid
aluminium plates. The structure, the rear and forward wingspar's form with ribs running between
is called the wing box and it forms the main load bearing structure of the wing,
while also being a literal box for fuel to sit inside. The carbon fibre composite spare provides
the wing fantastic strength. Strength is quantified by the force required to completely fracture
material but carbon fibre composites have another important quality that makes them perfect for
aircraft wings, their maximum elastic strain. There are two types of deformation, elastic
and plastic deformation. Elastic means the material will snap back into its original shape after the
load is removed, like an elastic band. Plastic means it will permanently deform and won't return to
its original shape once the load is removed, something we don't want to happen. This is
permanent damage. Carbon fibre composites can deform further before they strike this plastic
deformation zone at about 1.9% while aircraft aluminium begins permanently deforming at less
than 1%. That means we can bend carbon composites further before we need to worry about permanently
deforming them and that means we can make our wings super flexible. During flight the wingtip
of the 787 can move upwards by 3 meters. That sounds like a lot, but in order to get certified
by the FAA, every plane needs to be able to handle 150% of the plane's absolute maximum
expected load during flight for 3 seconds. And during that test the 787's wing bent upwards
by 7.6 meters. That's a great deal of bending, despite carbon fibre composites being stiffer
than aluminium, meaning it takes more force to deform the same volume of material, but critically
787 wings are not the same shape as their aluminium counterparts. This ability to withstand
greater bending allowed engineers to make the 787's wings with a much higher aspect ratio.
Aspect ratio is the ratio between the wingspan and the mean cord, or wing width. A high aspect
ratio would be a long skinny wing like a glider, while a low aspect ratio would be a delta wing
of a fighter jet. A traditional airliner has an aspect ratio of about 9, like the 787's predecessor
the 777, but the 787 has a massive aspect ratio at 11. This is what causes the 787's wings
to flex so much during flight. Composites are actually stiffer than aluminium, but their ability
to withstand high deformation allowed the engineers at Boeing to create a much higher
aspect ratio wing, a longer, narrower wing that would bend more, but this comes with some huge
benefits. The planes with the highest aspect ratio are gliders. For an unpowered plane,
the highest priority is minimizing energy lost to drag. This allows the glider to stay in the air
for extended periods with no engine. These types of aircraft typically have aspect ratios greater
than 30, and these aircraft have the lowest drag penalties as a result of vortex drag.
This is the drag caused by air mixing from the high pressure zone under the wing with low pressure
air above the wing, forming vortices at the wing tip. By spreading the area of the wing over a
longer span, we minimize the pressure that drives this mixing at the wing tip, and thus minimize
the energy lost to the vortices. Normally, higher aspect ratio wings have lower internal volumes.
For an unpowered glider, this isn't an issue, but for a plane that needs that storage space for fuel,
it is. Less storage volume for fuel means lower range, and one of the primary goals of the 787
is to be an efficient, long-range aircraft, capable of allowing airliners to open new routes
that were once deemed impossible. Thankfully, modern planes like the 787 use a new kind of
airfoil, the supercritical airfoil. Older airfoils look something like this, a reasonably symmetric
design with a sharp nose and gentle curves on the upper and lower surface, and this is a supercritical
wing. The leading edge is blunter with a larger radius, the top is relatively flat, and the lower
portion has this strange cusp at the back. This airfoil has much more useful internal volume,
thanks to its blunt leading edge and larger thickness-to-cord ratio. Helping solve our low
internal volume problem associated with high aspect ratio wings, the supercritical wing was
first tested by NASA on a modified TF8A crusader, and you can really see the similarities in design
ethos between the experimental plane's sleek wings with the 787. But increased internal volume
is not why NASA developed the supercritical wing. NASA developed it to delay the onset
of shockwave formation over the wings. When air travels over a wing, the air on top accelerates.
This means that even though the plane itself might be travelling below the speed of sound,
the air over the wing may break it and create a shockwave. This shockwave decreases lift and
causes an increase in drag. This kind of drag is called wave drag, and planes need to fly below
the speed this occurs at. The speed is called the critical Mach number. The supercritical wing was
designed to increase the critical Mach number. The flat top of the supercritical wing means the
air does not accelerate as much as it would over a classic aerofoil. Of course, this causes a loss in
lift because that fast-moving air is causing a drop in pressure on top of the wing. To compensate,
supercritical aerofoils have this concave curvature underneath the wing which causes an
increase of pressure there to compensate. This increase in pressure does not affect the critical
Mach number, while the larger radius of the leading edge increases the lift generated at higher
angles of attack. This is because air struggles to follow the tighter turns of a smaller radius
leading edge which causes earlier flow detachment and stall. The larger radius delays this flow
separation. This aerofoil shape changes continually as you travel the length of the wing, twisting and
curving in computer calculated precision. Optimizing the wing shape to be as efficient as possible,
and composites provided the engineers with the confidence that these shapes could be manufactured.
The skin is simply laid down on a mold with automated tape lane once again. We don't have
to beat metal into shape each and every time we want to recreate these delicate curves.
The fibers of the wing have even been laid in specific patterns to tailor the stiffness
of the wing in different areas. This means the wing deforms exactly as the 787's engineers wanted to
as it gains speed. So the wing shape actually changes during flight to better suit the needs
at different speeds. This is called aero elastic tailoring and is the forefront of state-of-the-art
aeronautical engineering today. The 787 also features a novel device designed to reduce
turbulent flow over the tail of the aircraft. Two types of flow states exist in aerodynamics.
Laminar flow occurs at low velocities and is characterized by fluid layers flowing smoothly
over each other in neat orderly layers. Laminar flow is predictable and non-erratic and does not
create significant drag. Turbulent flow is far more common but still very little is known about
how to predict its behavior. It is very difficult to control because of the formation of small
vortices called eddies in the flow making the flow highly erratic. Turbulent flow occurs at higher
flow velocities and causes a significant increase in drag. At cruising speeds of 80 to 85% of the
speed of sound, turbulent flow is ultimately unavoidable but we can work to minimize it.
Boeing has developed a technology that helps them delay and control the formation of turbulent
flow called hybrid laminar flow control. Details on their implementation of the technology are
sparse. This technology is capable of reducing fuel burn by as much as 30% and so companies are
keeping their research extremely secretive to keep their competitive advantage. Here's what we
know. In the late 80s and early 90s NASA and Boeing began investigating a suction system on the 757
that would draw in boundary layer air that is the layer of very slow moving air that clings to the
surface of moving objects. The outside skin was permeable to air through tiny perforations too
small for the naked eye to see. Manufacturing the permeable surface while also keeping the tiny holes
clear of debris is one of the many challenges with this technology. The outer and inner skin
were then attached to an elaborate plumbing system that was connected to a turbo pump
which sucked air from the boundary layer of air that would form along the plane surface.
By doing this they could drastically delay and reduce the size of the turbulent flow
and in turn reduce the drag on the plane. There is no space for this ducting system inside the
wings of the 787 but from what we do know it is inside both the horizontal and vertical tails.
However the only clue of their presence are these tiny doors whose purpose are a mystery to me with
little to no information available online a testament of how advanced this plane is.
Composites give plenty of advantages but it does come with some disadvantages. When we examine the
plane's composition one material jumps out at me. 15% of this plane is titanium that's much
higher than normal. Titanium is an expensive material so they must have had a good reason to
use it over aluminium. Aluminium is typically corrosion resistant when it's left on its own
but when it is placed in direct contact with carbon fiber composites something strange happens.
The aluminium begins to corrode incredibly quickly. Something about carbon fiber causes
aluminium to oxidize and fall apart. Carbon fiber is like aluminium's kryptonite.
This phenomenon is called galvanic corrosion and it happens when two materials that have
dissimilar electric potentials or nobilities are placed in contact with an electrolyte like
saltwater. If we look at the galvanic series which quantifies materials nobilities we can see
that graphite is very noble on the fair end of the less scale while aluminium is quite fair to
the right. When this occurs an electric potential forms between the two materials that causes the
two materials to trade electrons and ions which results in the anode being eaten away. This effect
is made even worse when the surface of the more noble material the cathode is very large in comparison
to the less noble material the anode. Say for example when carbon fiber composites are fastened
together using aluminium fasteners. To avoid this corrosion the engineers needed to pick a material
closer to carbon in the galvanic series and the closest suitable metal was titanium.
This has been a huge source of cost in manufacturing. Boeing's production cost
was higher than its sales price for quite some time meaning they were making a loss on each
aircraft sold. This is fairly typical for new airliners as R&D and manufacturing tooling costs
take time to recoup and companies like Boeing typically spread these costs over a period of
time on each plane instead of just having a massive negative balance sheet in one year.
But because the 787 was so radically new these sunk development costs called deferred costs were
expected to reach 25 billion before Boeing even reached a break even point on each plane sold
where the cost of manufacturing equalled the sales price. In comparison the Boeing 777 reached
3.7 billion. To recoup costs as fast as possible it was essential that Boeing reduced the cost of
production and high on their list was the elimination of titanium parts where possible.
The frame around the cockpit windows for example were initially made out of titanium
but were changed to aluminium with a special coating to prevent corrosion
while some parts that were originally titanium were changed to composites like the door frames.
Other improvements were sought to make the manufacturing process for titanium less costly.
Many metallic parts used on aircraft start off as large blocks of metal that have to be
machined down into their final shape. This results in a ton of wasted metal as the metal is gradually
shaved away. Aircraft manufacturers quantify this wastage with something called a buy to fly ratio
and it's a huge source of increased manufacturing costs. Cost that Boeing has tackled by collaborating
with Norsk Titanium a titanium 3d printing company. Now making 3d printed metal parts is not easy.
Most titanium 3d printing involves a powder titanium that is melted together using lasers.
Researchers used high-speed x-ray imaging to visualize what happens during this process
and found a lot of imperfections. The track varies in height, the powder gets blasted away
resulting in varying thickness and separated tracks and even bubbles form causing pores in the
metal. This creates parts with a lot of micro imperfections and imperfections lead to decreased
life as fatigue causes cracks to form. We can visualize a material's fatigue strength by
plotting on an SN curve which places the magnitude of the alternating stress on the y-axis and the
number of cycles it survived on the x-axis. For traditional machined titanium it looks something
like this whereas for 3d printed parts it looks like this. 3d printed parts simply fail much sooner
because of these tiny imperfections. Norsk has worked to improve this. Instead of using laser
centering with powder, Norsk have developed a revolutionizing, painted, wire-based metallic
3d printing system for titanium that they monitor with 600 frames per second cameras for quality
control. These 3d printed parts are then machined down into their final shape reducing the total
titanium used by 25 to 50% and their printing method is 50 to 100 times faster than the powder
printing method. This process resulted in the first ever FAA certified 3d printed structural
components and they first flew in the Boeing 787. This plane is truly innovative. Titanium was not
the only material Boeing worked on removing from the plane's construction to save on cost.
Copper once formed an important part of the 787's wing where it was laid down in thin strips on the
wing surface. This is not a typical design choice for aircraft wings and once again it was influenced
by the 787's composite construction because composite materials are not good conductors.
Carbon fibers are great conductors but problems arise because of the plastic resin binding them
together as this resin is an insulating material preventing the passage of electricity which is
a massive problem for planes as getting hit by lightning is not a rare occurrence. One study
calculated that lightning strikes occurred once every 3000 hours of flying between 1950 and 1975.
A 787 was struck by lightning while taking off from Hitro. Upon landing in India 42 to 46 holes
were found in the fuselage as a result of resistive heating. The plane survived and was flown back to
London for repairs with no passengers aboard but composites vulnerability to this kind of damage
is a drawback and the repair process is more complicated than with aluminium.
However this strike could have been much worse if the electricity does not run smoothly along
the surface of the plane and exit it may cause a spark in the fuel tanks and cause an explosion.
This kind of accident was not uncommon in the early days of the airline industry. Pan Am Flight
214 was struck by lightning while it flew in a holding pattern waiting for a lightning storm to
pass at Philadelphia international airport in 1967. Its left wing fuel tank exploded causing the
plane to barrel out of control to the ground in flames. Since then the aviation sector has
implemented rigorous safety measures and lightning protection tests to ensure an accident like this
could never happen again. Early 787 wings were designed with copper strips to ensure the electrons
had a path of low resistance along the surface of the wing ensuring they wouldn't travel to the
fuel tank and cause a spark while also preventing resistive heating damage to the composite structure.
Fasteners were sealed with an insulating material to stop electricity from traveling down the
metallic fastener into the fuel tank and the fastener themselves were fitted with compression
rings and a sealant to eliminate potential spark locations caused by gaps and sharp edges. Finally
the 787 has a nitrogen inheriting system that fills the tank with nitrogen. Ignition can't
happen without oxygen. Boeing has since removed two of these protections in a cost-saving measure.
Removing the copper mesh and insulating caps which drew concern and criticism but Boeing argues that
between the nitrogen inheriting system and the other safety measures these expensive features
were not needed. Where composites couldn't be used other materials were chosen. The leading edge of
the wing and tail, the tail cone and parts of the engine cowling were all made from aluminium
or other metals. The leading edges of the plane needed aluminium because of composites poor impact
resistance. While composites have extremely high strength they can be brittle on sudden impacts
such as bird strikes which most commonly happen at the leading edge of the wing or on the engines.
Metals are able to deform on impact with a reduced chance of fracture instead of shattering as
composites would. Aluminium leading edges were also beneficial for the purpose of de-icing
because it is a good thermal conductor. If you have ever flown on a very cold day you may have
seen a truck spray fluid onto the wings of the plane. This is de-icing fluid, a heated mixture
of glycol and water. It's needed because most planes aren't capable of de-icing themselves on
the ground. The 787 can when fed with external power because it uses a new type of de-icing system.
The 787 uses electrically heated blankets bonded to the surface of the slats which are able to heat
the surface of the wing and melt or prevent any ice formation on the leading edge of the wing.
Traditionally ice is prevented by extracting hot bleed air from the engine and piping it
to vulnerable areas such as the leading edge of the wing where ice build-up could severely
interfere with the wing's operation. This draws valuable energy away from the engines and increases
fuel consumption while also requiring a complicated network of tubing and exhausts which add weight
and increases complexity of construction and maintenance. The electric heating system is
twice as efficient as the extracted bleed air system as no excess energy is lost through
venting air to the atmosphere and it also reduces drag as the exhaust holes for the bleed air on the
lower side of the wing create drag. The 787 is actually the first commercial airliner that has
eliminated this bleed air system which was a huge technical challenge and required a complete redesign
of several systems and an entirely new engine. In our next video we are going to explore the
incredible engineering behind the power systems of the 787 exploring the advancements in the jet
engine and the overall system architecture that allowed the 787 to become the most efficient
long-range airliner ever made. We will be releasing that video here on youtube shortly but if you
