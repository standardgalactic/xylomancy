Hi, everybody.
Hello, hello.
Welcome.
I'm so psyched to be here today.
Maybe before I even get started,
can I just get a show of hands?
If you're a creator, raise your hand.
Let's see, creators. Oh, my gosh, yes.
Okay.
If you're in the music industry,
folks in the music industry, management companies, labels,
okay, great. Cool.
And then how about if you're just in tech,
like anybody in tech, creator, economy, tech?
Cool. All right.
Cool mix of folks here today.
I've been thinking a lot about
the whole arc of the Internet
and how it's evolved
over the last couple decades
and then how I think it's going to evolve
and Patreon's place
in all of that.
And that's what I want to share with you today.
So,
I started making music and videos
and putting them on the Internet right after
I finished college
in 2007.
And I made a ton of movies in school.
I also made animations as a kid.
So, making stuff wasn't particularly new to me.
But I had just spent
at the time when I finished college, six months
and thousands of hours on a new record
called Nightmares and Daydreams.
I was living at my dad's house at the time,
working out in my old childhood bedroom,
and I was trying to figure out how to reach people
with this new record that I had worked so hard on.
Like, even the cover.
That guy on the cover is an actual clay guy
and I did a photo shoot with him
and I got a great shot, but then I had to use
the lasso tool and Photoshop to cut him out.
And this was before the magnetic lasso tool,
so I had to do that shit by hand.
And that took way too long, but none of that mattered
because I, by sheer luck, I happened to finish school
right when this budding technology called the Internet
was going through a massive shift.
It was just starting to move
from what people called Web 1
to Web 2.0.
Sure, everybody knows about this in this room.
Y'all are here at South by Southwest, so you probably know this.
Web 1 was essentially a read-only
version of the Internet.
In retrospect, people call this 90s version of the Web
the static Web.
It was like AOL, where you could browse Web pages
and read the news, but there was no easy way
for people to upload and share.
And then in the early 2000s,
a slew of new companies like YouTube and Facebook
and Twitter came onto the scene
and YouTube's motto was broadcast yourself.
The whole idea of Web 2
was that for the first time as a creative person
you could easily participate on the Internet.
You could post and tweet and upload
instead of just being a passenger.
And I thought that was fucking awesome.
Honestly, I still think it's fucking awesome.
It's so easy to forget how magical this is,
how special this is.
But this moment in history marked a shift
for humanity and for artists
and creators especially,
because for the first time on the Internet
you could do more than just consume.
You could create.
You could reach other people.
And it was in that moment
right here in 2007
when I had to graduate college
and finish my record Nightmares and Daydreams
and I was trying to reach people with it.
And at the time, my best bet was DMing bands
on Myspace and asking if I could open for them
at local bars up and down the West Coast.
I sent cold outreach to music venues to get booked
and then I got in my car because I couldn't afford
to rent a van and I drove up and down
the West Coast of the United States
and I played the dankest local bars
and I sang my guts out and I sweated
and I sang and I sweated and I sang
in the back of my car when my friends were all getting promoted
and high paying jobs and investment bankers
and I did that for years.
Tour after tour.
And I'm using the word tour lightly here.
Like there weren't people at my shows.
Like nobody came.
I had no fans.
On a good night there were a couple stragglers
who wanted in off the street
but I was playing empty bars.
It was so hard to reach
people.
So you can imagine how excited I was
playing a video of a guy named David Choi
singing with a guitar in front of his
webcam on a new website called
YouTube.
And this video had like 300,000 views
or something like that. I couldn't believe it.
David was reaching people.
This phase of the internet
had the potential to solve a fundamental
problem for me as an artist.
I felt like I had to jump in
and I did.
I immediately started uploading videos to YouTube.
Back then no one else was showing
it.
So I just filmed myself playing
instruments.
And then I layered them in the video with
split screens so people could see all the musical
elements coming together to form a song.
And it's funny because in 2023 this idea seems
totally obvious.
But nobody was doing that back then.
It wasn't a fancy recording studio with
millions of dollars equipment.
It was a bedroom with an M-Box audio interface
and a cheap version of a laptop recording
software called Pro Tools LE and an old Sony
camera.
And I had a bed comforter on the wall
to dampen the sound and broken symbols
that a fan sent me in the mail for free.
But I was making real music.
I was screaming my fucking guts out
and playing accordion and doing collabs with
friends and it started working.
People started watching my videos
and listening to my music.
I was reaching people.
My videos started getting thousands of views.
It wasn't millions of people at first.
But it was so much better than playing empty
and by 2009 I had made
43 YouTube videos of my songs
and I was feeling amazing because
for the first time in my life I was actually
reaching people with my work.
But the real
beauty of this new website
called YouTube
the most amazing thing about it
was that it had a subscribe button.
I only realized
how truly
special this idea was in retrospect.
But in my opinion this concept
turned out to be one of the most
important things about this new
era of the internet.
What people called web 2.0.
The subscribe button was foundational.
It changed YouTube from being a tool
to reach people
to being a way to reach them and then build
a following around my work.
The subscribe button allowed people
who liked my stuff to sign up
to see more of it in the future.
And as a creator it gave me a channel
of distribution to ensure
that my future work was sent to those people.
So it turned out
that web 2.0 solved more than just
reach, more than just
discovery. It represented the birth
of the follower. In my opinion
the follow is not some
handy feature of a social network.
The follow is foundational
architecture for human creativity
and organization.
The idea of a creator, an artist
or community of fans around them who want to see
their future work. This concept, the follow
it's profound.
Whether it's the following that I was
building as a musician or a podcasting duo
who talks about what it's like to be single moms
in a community of single mothers who finally feel seen
and understood or a science education
creator and students who didn't previously have access
to high quality education. The follow
was a system of organization
for the entire internet.
It was a framework for the
distribution of creativity and communication.
Not just reach
but a step past it.
Ongoing communication.
Connection. A sustained relationship.
Community.
And I learned just how magical the
concept of the following could be when I did
my first collab with my girlfriend Natalie.
We put up a video on my YouTube channel
in 2008. That was a song we created
together and it was different than my music.
It was way less screaming and
insane but it was more active
and fleshed out than her music. So we decided
to create a new separate channel
for our collabs and we called this new YouTube channel
Pomplamoose.
Oh, all right. Got some Pomplamoose fans
in the house. All right.
But we posted our first video.
The first Pomplamoose video was actually posted
on my channel and I had about
7,000 subscribers at the time and my
subscribers loved this new video.
And at the end of it we posted a little link
to the new Pomplamoose channel to tell people about it
and almost instantly the new Pomplamoose channel
got 3,000 subscribers.
That's what a following is.
People see your new shit. Literally they follow
you wherever you go on the internet.
So Natalie and I started making more videos
and more videos and within a year we got
18,000 subscribers and then in one video
we announced that we were playing a show
and we showed up to the show in San Francisco
and there were 40 people there and oh my
god guys, I cannot tell you what
it's like to have 40 people at your show
after years of playing empty bars.
Fucking magic. It was amazing.
It was so great.
That night was
such a great night.
I feel like I literally can like remember that.
Another time, Natalie and I
were filming a vlog to
put in one of our videos and my sister
happened to walk in like behind us
and she was holding a bar, she's a
soap maker, she was holding a bar of grapefruit
scented soap. Pomplamoose means grapefruit
in French and she said, hey guys
look I have Pomplamoose soap
and Natalie and I just saw that
and decided to keep it in the video and we
put it up in the video and our friends
were like oh my god Pomplamoose soap we want
to borrow Pomplamoose soap and so we made
another video and we said okay now you
can order Pomplamoose soap and we got
hundreds of orders for Pomplamoose soap.
Another time
when USB thumb drives were starting
to get huge we thought why do CDs
let's put all of our music on a thumb drive
and so we did
and we loaded up the thumb drives
we put up a video and said hey if you want
to buy a thumb drive you can buy a thumb drive now
and we were selling hundreds and hundreds
of thumb drives and we decided to sign
every one of them because we wanted to
be really personal with our fans
and it was kind of crazy
we had to figure out the packaging
we had no idea how to package that many thumb drives
my family
ended up helping out
my parents were freaking out, dad's
taking pictures and stuff
it was really fun, it was amazing
another time we decided to put our album
on iTunes, our first Pomplamoose album
in 2008
and we didn't have artwork so we asked our fans
like hey do you want to make the artwork
for Pomplamoose and we got hundreds of submissions
for the cover of the new Pomplamoose
album from our fans and they were freaking talented
their artwork was amazing
this is the one that actually won
Natalie and I just love this one so this is the artwork
for our first album it was made by one of our fans
another time we booked a show
at a laundromat
that's a sentence I just said
we booked a show at a laundromat
the idea was like a laundromat where there is
a cafe and a laundromat you could go order
food, do your laundry, eat
by the time you're done eating take your laundry home
that was the idea of the laundromat
and we booked the show
if you crammed people in there it held like 60 people
in this laundromat
and then we uploaded this video
and this was the first video that we ever uploaded
that went viral and it got
like half a million views overnight
and we showed up to our show at the laundromat
200 people crammed inside
the laundromat
and then 150 or 200 people outside
like spilling in the street cars were
swerving around them
and like there was no stage like it's a laundromat
so literally I'm playing music and there's a person
like
I'm like looking out of person's eyes while I'm playing
pompomous songs
it was insane honestly it was the first
night it was mayhem
I don't have any pictures tonight but this is what it felt like
like it was just like insane
this was the first time I was like oh my god this is going to work
like having a following
is amazing this is going to work
we're going to be able to be full time musicians
another time we posted another video
and at the end of the video we told our fans
hey we're uploading a song to iTunes
we decided not to ever sign
or enter the music industry
we did everything ourselves we negotiated
our own contract with iTunes directly
we posted our songs directly to iTunes
and so we kept almost
all of the revenue associated with that
and this album told our fans about it online
told our followers we sold 30,000 songs
that month
and we got 22,000
dollars deposited directly
into our bank account it was more money
than I'd ever seen in one place ever in my life
I was losing my mind it was so
incredible
applause
then pompomous started playing
shows and we started touring
and hundreds of people started showing up
and then many hundreds of people
and then thousands of people started showing up
and this is my wife
crowd serving because she's a fucking badass
and
that's what I mean
when I say that the subscribe button
is not a
silly feature
the concept
of the follow
changed my life
it made my dreams come true
as an artist
it took me from playing empty bars
to living out my fantasy as a musician
the follow is a piece of internet
architecture that felt closer
to magic than anything I had ever
experienced in my life
right around the moment that pompomous was starting to
work right through all of this
there is this genius named
Kevin Kelly
has anybody heard of Kevin Kelly founder of Wired yet
a bunch of people okay amazing thinker
and mind
he wrote an essay called a thousand true fans
and his premise
was simple it was that in the age of the internet
you don't need
millions of fans to be successful
if you can just find a thousand people
who are willing to buy a hundred bucks
of stuff from you per year
that's a hundred thousand dollars per year
which is a pretty freaking great business
as a creative person you just need a thousand true fans
who really connect with you
and believe in you
and this is different than just reaching people
it's even deeper
than followers
this is super fans
true fans, real fans
call it whatever you want
the idea is that there is this group of people that is your core
if reach
means people see it
and follower means people want to see more
then true fans are the people
who go to the shows and buy the merch
and download the record and pay for the course
and get the live stream tickets and all the things
and this idea
really resonated with me
we had fans showing up to
Pomplamoos shows
with tattoos of the band
we had
fans literally making custom
t-shirts of Pomplamoos
posters, drawings
artwork, cookies
we had a fan do icing
of my face on a cookie
I ate my face
we had a fan who made an oil painting
and me screaming my fucking guts out
I learned HTML
and I had a little
website
I used this link release software called eJunkie
and I cobbled together like a little mp3
store for myself on the internet
and I would sell original music
and I was selling 500 bucks a month
of my original songs on my own website
with my own shitty
thing that I made
fans were showing up
to buy things, to be there
one time
we asked our Pomplamoos fans
to come film
a music video with us on a Saturday
like show up to Dolores Park in San Francisco
just show up and be in this music video
and 50 people showed up they even learned this dance
and we shot this dance
the dance is in this Pomplamoos video
another time
we would actually always use this
software called StageIt
which is like a ticketed live stream software
so we could play our songs
people could buy tickets and show up live on the internet
and Natalie and I would just sit at home
and play these songs
for 45 minutes and people would buy tickets
and leave tips during the concert
and we would routinely make like 3 grand
in 45 minutes playing our songs
it's like these are true fans
another time Natalie
raised over 100,000
dollars for her record from just 2,000
people
another time
we made a Pomplamoos album
and we went online on YouTube
we have a new Pomplamoos album
it's not for sale
you can't buy it
the only way to get the new Pomplamoos album
is if you donate a book
to the Richmond school district
and then send us the receipt
for that book
and we will send you the Pomplamoos album for free
just donate a book, super easy
we'll send you the album in the mail for free
and the Richmond school district
ended up having to rent a shipping container
to keep up with the packages
it was like 7,000 books
that got sent to the Richmond school
it's like 140,000 dollars worth of books
it was amazing
it felt incredible to see that many people show up
for this
that's true fans
real fans
super fans call it whatever you want
but this was the concept that was rattling around in my head
when I started Patreon 11 years ago
this is actually the first sketch of Patreon
I called up my co-founder
to bring this into
what is now Patreon
and the idea was very simple
it's like a membership platform
where fans could sign up for a subscription payment
to the creator and the creator could run a membership
and get paid for their work
I'm not going to tell the Patreon founding story
I've told it a million times
but the company is now over 400 people
11 years in
we have over 250,000 creators
who have made over 3.5 billion dollars on the platform
which I think of as proof
that the true fans are there
and the true fans are ready
in the background
while Patreon was being formed
building over the last decade
the whole internet
was again starting to shift
and if you think of the 90s as Web 1
and the 2000s as Web 2
right around the 2010s
there was a new change happening
Facebook started experimenting with a new thing
called ranking
and I realize most everybody here knows about this
but what ranking did was essentially it took the feed
which you can think of as a list of posts from creators that I follow
and it analyzed
each and every post
for how engaging it was
and if it wasn't engaging enough
Facebook would then take that post
and push it down in the feed
in other words they started ranking
or ordering posts according to what was best
for their business
it was actually great for Facebook
it was the right business decision
for them and their company and their revenue model
but what it meant for creators
was that for the first time
since Web 2.0
my followers might not necessarily
see my posts
and this idea of a subscription
started to break down
if the person doesn't receive the things
it's not really a direct true connection
between a creator and their fans
it's not really a subscription
but the channel of distribution is broken
and it creates another problem too
around creative freedom
because now suddenly my post has to be better
than the other posts
according to a set of criteria
that I don't know or have control of
or even agree with
so instead of thinking what do I want to make
what lights me up
what is the output that I want to create
as an artist
what will my fans love
instead of thinking those questions
are in my favor
and that subconsciously
or consciously
changes my creative output
to achieve Facebook's goals
not my goals as a creator
and if it were just Facebook doing this
fine
creators would just leave and post somewhere else
but it worked
really well
it was great for Facebook's business
and people started spending even more time
on the platform
and YouTube launched the Cosmic Panda redesign
centering the entire company around
watch time
and Twitter and Instagram followed with ranked feeds in 2016
and we only saw it in retrospect
but now I think of the 2010s
as the decade of ranking
the decade when the original promise
of the creator led community
the true follow
was broken for the first time
I want to just do a quick
aside here because
I know there's this big debate in the world
about chronological feeds
versus algorithmic feeds
and I don't want to make it sound like I'm a zealot
on either of the two polarized sides
it's actually not the takeaway here
it's not how I think of it
I actually see problems with chronological feeds
because as a creator if it's chronological
and you have to keep posting to stay on top
so I don't think that's necessarily the best way
to build strong relationships either
the problem that I have is
if you're going to change that
if you're going to adjust the way
what is the purpose behind that
what is the intention behind that
are you trying to create a place
where you can build
strength of relationship with your community
where your fandom gets energized
over time where people are guaranteed
that subscription where you get a direct
connection with your community and your true fans
is that it?
or is it maximizing attention
is it maximizing watch time
those are two very different goals
and very different ways of organizing
a product as a technology company
this one helps me
as a creator
and this one hurts me as a creator
it hurts my community, it hurts my business
it hurts my creative output
I wish that it stopped there
but around the turn of the decade
a new company came onto the scene called Tiktok
and Tiktok had a much deeper
impact on the ecosystem I think anyone
saw at the time
it wasn't just short form vertical first video
that wasn't it, that's a red herring I think
it was much more fundamental than that
Tiktok said we want to make the most engaging
feed possible
this whole idea of a list of your subscriptions
forget about that, in fact forget about the whole
concept of subscriptions
Tiktok started from the ground up
with something totally different called
for you
where each of these posts are chosen for me
by Tiktok instead of me choosing
my feed
and this completely abandoned
the concept of the follow
but it worked
Tiktok had a billion users by 2021
and traffic on the internet started flowing away
from the legacy social companies
and toward Tiktok
so just like with Facebook and ranking
the other platforms had to compete
YouTube launched shorts
Instagram launched reels
and Twitter launched a for you feed as well
and within a couple of years
Tiktok started a new system of organization
for the internet
the creator led community
started to fade into the past
I have really felt this
personally as a creator
in the last four years especially
my fans don't see as much of my stuff anymore
it's harder to sell tickets to a show
it's harder to reach people with my new work
it's harder to build community
it's harder to build a business
it's harder to energize my fans
and the audience
are you feeling this too
are folks in the room seeing nodding heads
raise your hands
I just feel it
what's happening here
is we are in the middle of another
shift
and this is a big one
if the 90s was Web 1
and the 2000s was Web 2
and the 2010s was ranking
I'm worried that the 2020s
could become the death of the follower
I
I
got an email from a creator
that I was spending a lot of time with
a little while ago about a year and a half ago
and I got this email in my heart
just sank in my stomach
can we get the slide up
great
hey Jack
I'm writing this letter to you hat in hand
due to changes at Facebook overnight the traffic
to my links in my pages dropped by 80%
as such it looks like I'll have to sell my home
I'm dusting off my resume
and looking for jobs in social media management
this is now
I'm seeing more and more of things like this
and it's not just
happening to creators
it's happening to anyone who posts stuff on the internet
it's happening to media companies
look at what's happening to
Vice and Buzzfeed
and Rooster Teeth's announcement a couple weeks ago
this is a really hard
change to navigate for anyone
who's posting stuff online
and trying to build community and business
for the creators in the room I think it's really important
to remember that and to understand that
if you're
not connecting
as much as you want to with your audience
right now
that does not necessarily mean there's something wrong
with you
a lot of us as creators have this tendency to be like
what can I do better and that's a good impulse honestly
growth mindset
how am I contributing to this
what can I do better
and again I think most of the time that's really good
but there is also something happening in the background right now
it's a macro thing
that's happening on the web that makes
our jobs as creators
really hard right now
there's a lot of smart people
at big companies that are well funded
big media companies trying to figure this out too
and they're having trouble with it too
so as creators just know that
it doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong
with you here
I believe
that this problem
is the single most important problem that faces
creative people today
the weakening of creator led communities
of our distribution channels to our fans
this is the hardest, most challenging
and most painful issue threatening the present
and the future of creativity on the internet
so I want to be very clear
about this
I actually don't think
that this is going to happen
I don't think that we're actually going to see
the real death of the follower
that's not what I think is going to happen
I think the follow is too important
to die
I think it's too valuable to ignore
I think it's too useful and awesome
for creative people
for publishers, for media companies
and I think the next wave of internet
and media technology companies are going to surge on this problem
and try to solve it
and it's actually already started
and the incumbent social platforms
they're not going to be able to fight it because their revenue relies
on maximizing attention
to drive their businesses they're being forced
up towards discovery, towards
reach, personalization, algorithmic curation
these are the levers that drive attention
and therefore they drive their strategies
that's why there's a hole
already opening up
and why we're starting to see a whole new set of companies emerge
that look fundamentally different
from the legacy social landscape
the discord and kajabi and fourth wall
and gumroad moment which patreon acquired last year
the courses platforms, events companies
some people are calling this subset of companies
the creator economy
I don't even think of it like that
it's a fundamental shift in approach
and the hallmark strategy
of the drivers of these businesses
is the focus on deeper connections
as opposed to just more connections
the true fan
the real fan, call it whatever you want
it's the 5% of fans that drive
90% of the community and business
this is a direct to fan business
this is an ads business
this is about depth of connection
this is about maximizing attention
this is about deeper fans
this is about more fans
and what binds this new wave of emerging companies
is that their strategic focus is down here
the next decade of creative and media
technology companies will focus on building
direct to fan connections
and community strength
as creators we'll still need
the social platforms
we'll still need those companies up here
for discovery, for reach, we need that
but those companies will be one component
of the many tools
that we have as creative people
to help us run our communities and businesses
that's where the world is going
I'm sure of it
and personally right now
I feel
a sense of
responsibility through this
I feel a sense of responsibility because
um
I remember
what it feels like to be a creator
on the outside of these platforms
watching the internet move in a direction
that I don't agree with
and that I don't like and that I don't think is good
for my community and my business
I remember what that feels like
I remember feeling anxiety
I remember feeling fear
I remember being scared of where that was going
and now
through whatever
crazy life path
I have been on
as an artist I'm now
finding myself as a CEO
of one of these fucking tech companies
and
I feel this sense of
I want to help
build the type of internet
that I want as a creator
that's what I want to do
so I really don't want this talk to feel like a Patreon ad
actually I really hope it doesn't
but I do want to give you
a sense of how I'm thinking about
this problem given this seat
that I'm in and how Patreon
is now thinking about this problem
and what we think our place
is in it and what we want to do about it
and the headline is this
it's been
20 or 30 years
and the current version
of how art
and community
exists on the internet today
I don't think
is the right version
how community and art
exists on the web
I don't think it's the right way
and I want to, I want Patreon
to contribute to building
a better version of how art
and community could exist on the internet
we've oriented
the whole company
around this problem
and we've been building a lot in the background
over the last couple years
but we made some big announcements a couple months ago
about the next phase of Patreon
and how we're thinking about this problem
specifically
we started as a membership platform
11 years ago subscription payments
but we have built a lot
especially in the last three years
in an effort to take a more holistic approach to solving this
we built video
casting, better posting
a new media player, commerce
free membership which is essentially like a follow
gated on an email and live
and while this might look like a lot
it's actually just three things
media, community
and business
and we're now thinking of Patreon no longer
as a membership platform
where we started
but as this whole thing
the media community and business foundation
for the next decade of professional creativity
on the internet
organized around the concept of the true
follow
in an effort to build a better way that art can exist
on the web
that's the theory
that's what the company is setting out
to solve now
and in practice what that looks like
is a new set of products and tools
that we built into Patreon
this is our first foray
into community
and essentially this allows fans
and build energized fandoms
and creators to hop in there and talk with fans
it's a place for true fandom
why do we build this
what's the thinking, what's the strategy
and the idea behind this, here's why
as a creator on the internet today
I can get subscribers
and I can get views and if I can send my fans
to Instagram or TikTok and they can be there
but what I've noticed is those communities
degrade over time
they don't get energized
over time, they get de-energized
it's harder and harder to reach those people
I make a post, I reach 2% of my audience
I reach 1% of my audience
I lose touch with those people
and there's no way for me to find
those real fans, those true fans
the small portion of my fans
that drive everything for me as a creator
the way we're building this
and what I want as a creator
is a place where I can send my fans
and that fandom gets energy over time
that fandom gets closer
that fandom gets more vibrant, more connected over time
that's what I want as a creator
that's the space that I want to have
as a creative person
creators deserve a place like that
that is important, it's important
for the future of creativity
okay, another thing that we built
is commerce
commerce allows creators to sell
a digital thing, an episode
a bonus episode, a download
a course
anything that you can sell online
any digital thing
why did we build this, why did we build commerce
because
creators
send lots of people to their patreon
millions of people to their patreon pages every month
what we found is
a lot of those people are true fans
they're like the really intense, interested
excited fans
but not all of those fans
are ready to pay with a subscription payment
in fact a lot of them don't want to pay
a subscription payment, a lot of them
and why, why don't they want to pay
either they have subscription fatigue which is a real thing
or they're not in the right financial situation
or they don't want to commit to a payment every month
but they're still true fans
and rather than having those true fans
leave the creator
we want to give creators a way to
start forming connections with those fans
to build businesses with those fans
and so we built commerce as a way for the fans
the true fans that aren't yet ready for a subscription payment
they can now participate
in the creators business and community
through this commerce product
and meanwhile the creator can build an awesome business
along the way too
the logic is very similar for free membership
why do we build free membership
what is free membership by the way
it's a follow gated on your email
so it's kind of like an email capture almost
as a creator
it allows a fan to follow your page
without paying
in exchange for giving them your email
and it's the same logic as commerce
creators are sending their true fans millions
every month
and we want to give creators a way
to reach that portion of their fans
that they go to the shows
they have the merch, they have the hat
they're true fans but for whatever reason
they don't want to buy one of the things you have digitally
and they don't want to pay a subscription
and this allows creators
to continue forming relationships with those fans
and what's super exciting about this
is we have found that about 40 to 50%
of these fans
actually say
that they intend to pay the creator
in the next few months
have high intention to be a part
of the creators community and business
and this gives creators a way to start
building community with those folks
okay we also
acquired a live
experiences platform called
moment and
I don't even want to call it ticketed live streaming
because it's so much more beautiful than that
Arjun and the team did such an incredible job
building this place
for creators to sell tickets to these
live experiences and they can debut their work
a stand up special
a movie that they've made
a special episode that they know
is going to be a total banger
whatever it is it allows creators to
sell tickets to that experience
and then have community with those fans
while they're all watching it together
and they've launched amazing creators
Tam and Paul and Bieber and they've worked with folks like
Andrew Schultz and it's just an awesome way
for creators to have that live community
experience and start gathering
their work
okay so
all that to say
the way we're thinking about it and the way we're
thinking about this next phase is that
we're not just a membership company anymore
we're a true fan
company we're a creator company
we're building a better way for art and community
to exist on the internet
because I want Patreon to build
an internet where creators have
true creative freedom
I want Patreon to contribute to a web
where creators have control of their businesses
and their careers
and I want it to feel like fire
to be part of a creators community
I know what it feels like to be part of
an energized community
I remember it
and I have that same conviction now
that I did back in 2013 when I started Patreon
I know that it is possible
to build an internet where fandoms thrive
and where professional creativity is possible
for anyone
I believe this in my bones
it's not optimism it's just deep
down what I actually know to be
available to humanity if that is the path
that we choose
okay
that's what Patreon is doing
it's how we're thinking about this future
and Patreon's place in it
but for the creators in the audience
we don't have to wait
creators don't have to wait
for this
after the last decade
I've talked to thousands of creative people
I've had my own creative projects
I've learned a lot
and I want to share just a few thoughts
about navigating the shifts
in the internet
and how we can all
prepare ourselves
and our communities for those shifts
and we don't even need to wait
for any of the tech platforms
to catch up
can I get next slide?
the first
invest in those true fans
invest in
the depth of connection
not just new
it's not all about new views
new subscribers watch time up into the right
it's about depth
it's about quality of interaction
it's about finding that small portion of your fans
that are your engine
that are your core
and then figuring out how to reach them
by the way sometimes when I talk about this
does that mean like DMs?
should I be talking to individual fans?
no, not necessarily
that's not actually what I mean
finding those people
and building real connections with them
in whatever capacity you have
and my team will probably kill me for saying this
but it's not even using Patreon
there's like a bunch of ways that you can do this
you can do it via email lists
you can get a Discord
you could get a Patreon if you want
I'm a little biased but I think you could
find a place where you can build
that community with your true fans
the point is find those people
and invest in that community
that is the engine that will drive your business
slingshot your business
through these shifts in the internet
okay, the second thing
make beautiful things
there is so much tension
especially right now
to make for the algorithm
and I've seen the diagrams
I've seen the charts
I've even drawn them in my history
make for the algorithm, make for yourself
and then make the things that help you build a business
and you sort of do this a Venn diagram
little center part and that's the sweet part
I've seen all that
and I get that
but the gravity
the gravity everywhere we look as creators today
the gravity is just pushing us
it's just pushing us toward
making for other reasons
than why we set out to make things in the first place
it's so important
to remember to make beautiful things
to make things that light you up
and to make things that you care about
there's a wonderful metaphor that I love
it's a business metaphor
but it makes sense for creators too I think
it's a metaphor of the business
of the hot dog stand under the Eiffel Tower
or the local restaurant
and the hot dog stand in the Eiffel Tower
gets thousands of new customers
coming through their hot dog stand every day
it's just tourists just coming through
and they know they're going to get lots and lots of new customers
and none of those people come back but it doesn't matter
because they're just always getting new customers every day
because of the Eiffel Tower
and they just make hot dogs and sell them
and some portion of those customers buy their hot dogs
actually don't even have to be very good hot dogs
they just sell hot dogs and they know they're going to keep making money
and that business works
like it works it's an okay business
there's another business which is the local restaurant business
where the people there just focus
on making great food
and having great service
and they actually are not in a place that gets a lot of foot traffic
so they don't get lots of new customers
but everybody in like a five mile radius
eats there twice a month
and they just get lots of repeat customers
because they've built trust
and they've built depth of connection with those people
and people know that restaurant
and love it and know they're going to have a great time when they're there
that is a great business
you don't have to get
lots of new and billions
and acquisition
that's not the only type of business
you can build as a creator
there's this wonderful group of creators
oh my god I've fallen in love with them
anybody heard of the YouTube New Wave
somebody heard of these folks seeing some hands
it's this group of creators
they make these wonderful 30, 45 minute
long form
films, mini documentaries
about their lives
and their struggles coming into the world
and quitting college
they're beautiful, it's incredible
they're patient, they're slow
the films are long
but oh my god
the depth of the message
in these films is incredible
and they're building such a strong community
around their work
people just love what they have to say
and can't wait to see the next one
that's a real business
that's a real community
it's different than what we're incentivized to do
everywhere on the internet
but that works
okay, the last
the last thing
ooh that was loud
know what you want
the hardest lesson
I have learned as a creative person
and as an operator
and CEO over the last 10 years
is to
know and trust
what I want
and to be true to that
over time
that's easier said than done
don't let somebody else
tell you what you want
because then you'll end up
with what they want
instead of what you want
a good example of that is as creators
we open up our
our dashboards
and we see these
metrics on what success is
this is a dashboard that someone else built for us
and it tells us what we want
and the weird thing is
after a couple of years
we start to believe that
like our minds get reprogrammed
and we believe this is what I want
this is success
and we chase that
if you went back in time
and you said
what do you want
what's your goal
as an artist
what matters to you
do you think
Bowie would have said
my goal as an artist
is to maximize the amount
of human hours spent
consuming my work
I don't know what Bowie wanted
I'm not going to pretend to
but I can tell you what I want as an artist
I can tell you what matters to me as a creative person
and what I know will matter to me
10 years ago
now and 10 years from now
I want to say something
that matters to somebody
I want to say something that only I can say
because
of whatever experience I've had
in my lived experience
something that is uniquely
pointed to me
I want to say that
I want to figure out how to say that
I want to find that core of human truth
in my experience
and communicate it eloquently and clearly
and have it be true and feel true
and have someone else see that
and have that person think
yes
that feels true
and it feels true to them
and I want that person to feel connected to me
even though we've never met before
in our lives
because they felt like there was another person
who had that same experience
I want to make things that are timeless
I want to make things that feel true
now I want to make things that feel true
in 50 years I want to make things that
still feel true 500 years
after I'm dead
I want to figure out how to use my
short years on this planet
to find that kind of truth and say it
that's what I want
as an artist
and that's a very different goal
than watch time
that may not be what you want
as an artist and that's okay
but the point is to know
what you want
what matters to you
what are you trying to achieve
as a creative person
we have this tendency to look outside
for those answers
I do it too this advice is honestly more for me
than it is for anybody else in this room
we want there to be a Yoda
we want there to be a leader
or a manager or a voice of authority
that can tell us what we want
because it's a scary thing to ask
but that does not exist
what we want comes intrinsically
not extrinsically
it comes from in here
that's where we find it
so as we navigate
this next phase of the internet
as creative people
as we go through these ups and downs
of the web
in its ever evolving state
do not forget
what matters to you as an artist
do not forget what fills you
with pride to make
do not forget
your purpose for making things in the first place
don't forget why you wake up
in the morning and devote your time
and energy to your craft
don't forget
what gives you a sense of meaning
as a creative person
and lastly
don't forget to scream your fucking guts out
thank you everybody
appreciate your hand
thank you
thank you
thanks
thank you
thank you
