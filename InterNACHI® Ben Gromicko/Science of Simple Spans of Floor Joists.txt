Maximum Joy Spam seems like a pretty simple concept but there's obviously a natural limit
to how far wood can span without breaking under a particular load but when inspecting a house
we don't want to see any floor joist getting anywhere near that breaking point.
We don't even want a joist to bend all that much so when we talk about maximum joy spans as the
international residential code defines them we're not really talking about pushing things to the
limit. We're largely talking about what it takes to have a functional floor one that doesn't overly
bounce or won't rattle when we walk on it. Check out this sketch about joists spans load
compression and tension. Loading a joist creates bending stress that puts wood fibers at the top
in compression and at the bottom in tension. The height of the joist and the species of the lumber
affects how well it handles these stresses. Taller joists and denser species deflect less
and allow the span farther. The IRC span tables make it easy for contractors and inspectors to
pick up a joist to bridge a simple span one without intermediate supports or cantilevers
or to get the biggest simple span out of the wood available but span is just one of many roles
relating to joists. There are other rules for blocking, notching and bearing lengths.
In all of these roles can be read alone but when taken together and mixed with a little science
they start to make sense not as arbitrary roles but as the means to reach the expected ends.
Home inspectors don't need an engineering degree to understand how these various
joist related provisions in the code work together so let's discuss them informally.
The first step in designing a floor system for a house is to determine how much you expect it to
support and that's load. The heavier the load imposed on a joist or beam the shorter the distance
it can safely and functionally span. This shortening isn't because the code is concerned
about the floor breaking. It doesn't want it to bend too much. The flexion rather than strength
is the foremost limiter to span in conventional wood frame construction. Maximum deflection
is the most a building system or component is allowed to bend under its maximum design load.
Floors have historically been held to L divided by 360 where you divide the joist length and
inches by 360 and you get the maximum deflection allowed for a given span. We can refer to table
r301.7 in the IRC. We can also take internet cheese free online structural issues course
for home inspectors to calculate deflection of a joist. As an example for any 14 foot joist the
deflection limit is about a half an inch that's 168 divided by 360 approximately. The L divided by
360 deflection limit for floor joists exists for at least two good reasons. One it should prevent
the drywall or the plaster ceiling below from cracking. It's also about how stiff the occupant
expects the floor to feel when they walk on it. While a trampoline can support the 40 pound per
square foot live load prescribed for residential living areas it would make a rather impractical
kitchen floor. If more deflection than L 360 were allowed the allowable spans would increase but the
floor wouldn't be as stiff. If you span less than the maximum allowed for a given joist it will
deflect less and feel stiffer. So what gives a joist stiffness? When a load is put on a joist the
fibers in the top of the joist compress and those in the bottom are under tension and in the middle
what engineers call the neutral plane these forces diminish the zero. The ability of the wood fibers
to resist being scrunched by compression or stretched out by tension directly translates to how much
a joist deflects and is why denser wood species can span farther. They're better at resisting the
stretching and the scrunching and therefore they deflect less. Still height can make up for the
deficiencies of a species. The more mass is distributed away from the center of a joist
or toward the tension and compression edges in other words the taller the joist the better it
resists deflection. Thus a two by ten can span farther than a two by eight of the same grade in
species and this is also why eye joists can span extreme distances without a major increase in depth.
Much if not most of their mass is in the top and bottom flanges. These tension and compression
stresses are also what moves the load to the ends of the joist for transfer to whatever's below
typically beams hangers or plates and for this transfer of load to work the joist must be held
in a state of stress. A joist not stressing is a joist deflecting. Joists will lay down on the job
if permitted to and a joist laid flat like decking can't span very far without bending along its
thickness. Given the way houses are built that isn't what happens. Instead joists especially when
overspanned or overloaded try to flop over in the middle of the span. Joist thickness is a large
part of what presents this kind of flop. While the height handles the stress the thickness of the
joist helps keep it upright and handles the stress. The ratio between thickness and height
is important and most obvious in beams where additional plies and larger sawn thicknesses are
common. Sawn joists on the other hand no matter how tall are always one and a half inches thick.
So even though a sawn joist can handle more stress as it gets taller it also gets harder to keep it
upright. Thanks to other code provisions and common sense the width of the joist doesn't
have to do the job alone. Blocking rim joists or joist hangers at the ends and bearing locations
are what ultimately keep the joist upright and stressed. Our 502.7 in the code will help.
Other than hangers which also support the vertical load these other features do almost
exclusively that. Blocking and rim joists resist rotation. When the height of the joist compared
to its width is greater than 212 the width can't hold the joist upright along their length
and bridge blocking is required within the span to prevent the joist from rolling over.
Home inspectors are not code inspectors but home inspectors can get out the code book
and look at the science. If you want a stiffer floor with less deflection you just need better
stress management. You could use larger joists height denser wood species or closer joy spacing
or you could add bridge blocking with the span to reduce mid-span rotation of the joist. So let's
say you have a 2x10 joist that's slightly overspanned. Its primary failure is excessive deflection
and the usual reason for that is it wants to flop over in mid-span. The same principle is that
stiffen of floor to above code deflection limits can stiffen an overspan floor up to the deflection
limit. The code won't tell you this but we will. Bridge blocking can bring slightly overspanned
joists to within deflection limits and that's a more reasonable alternative recommendation
than to replacing the 2x10s with 2x12s. After deflection shear is the next stress that joist
need to be able to handle but it typically isn't a major consideration in wood joists.
Shear stresses are distributed opposite of bending stresses. They are greatest along the
horizontal center of the joist. That neutral plane an increase towards the ends. Shear failures in
sawn joists typically appear as cracks that start at the ends and propagate along the neutral plane
in other words along the grain and this kind of failure would be problematic because two small
joists aren't equivalent to one big joist. Each smaller piece deflects more than one big one wood
but it's highly unusual for a sawn joist to fail in shear along its length. Shear across the grain
is even rarer if not unheard of because of the way the grain is oriented. It's much easier to
split wood along the grain than it is to chop across the grain right? Research has shown joists
will fail in bending long before they fail in shear which is why despite the shear stresses
being largest at the end of the joist the IRC allows joist ends to be notched up to one quarter
of the depth of the joist. No notches are allowed in the middle third of the joist where the bending
stresses are the greatest and in the rest of the joist where bending stresses are smaller
they're limited to one sixth of the joist depth. Holes meanwhile are allowed two inches away from
the edges anywhere in the span which tells you how little there is to worry about when it comes
to shear stresses. We also have to think about bearing. Once joists are loaded they have to
transfer the load vertically. The key here is preventing the joist or the member that the
joist is bearing on from crushing. Wood crushes more easily across the grain like where the ends
are located than it does parallel with the grain such as a post. The size of the bearing area
required to prevent crushing is directly related to the strength of the joist, what it's bearing on
and the total load being transferred. Distributing the load over a greater area reduces the load on
any one point which can in turn allow for greater loads it's just like how snow shoes distribute
your weight to keep you from sinking in the snow. This is another engineering fundamental the IRC
simplifies. For joist bearing on wood or metal section 502.6 of the code requires the full width
to bear with at least one and a half inches of length. This minimum area of wood necessary to
transfer the loads that a floor designed using the IRC's prescriptive tables can generate without
overstressing the joist and crushing its ends. The minimum bearing length on concrete is three
inches but this longer length isn't about the wood it's about the concrete. A joist bearing on
concrete creates stresses that can cause the corner of the concrete or masonry to crack and
spall or break off under the joist and the three inches of required bearing spreads the load over
a greater area to reduce the chance of spalling and leaves enough area behind the compromised edge
for the joist to bear safely if it does spall. This information was provided by Glenn Matheson
