Financial stress on the parents translates into physiological stress in the children.
They didn't inherit anything in terms of a disease.
They're just reacting to the environment.
People call Dr. Gabomate the people whisperer.
Legendary thinker and bestselling author.
He's highly sought after for his expertise on addiction, stress, and childhood development.
The evidence linking mental illness and childhood diversity is about as strong as the evidence
linking smoking and lung cancer. And the average physician doesn't hear a word about that.
It's astonishing. I can give you the example of Donald Trump.
I mean, his father was a psychopath.
You are the enemy of the people. Go ahead.
For him, these were not choices so much as survival techniques.
And that's the mark of a traumatized child, a denial of reality.
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?
My grandparents were killed in Auschwitz and my mother and I barely survived.
And then my mother, to save my life, gives me to a stranger.
The sense, I guess, that I'm being rejected and abandoned because I'm not good enough.
How did that rear its ugly head throughout your life?
Any number of ways.
See, trauma, as I define it, is not about what happens to us.
It's about what happens inside of us as a result of what happens to us.
It's costing us in terms of our physical health, our relationship, our mental health, and so on.
How does one go about correcting that?
It's a multi-layered answer. First of all.

Without further ado, I'm Stephen Bartlett, and this is The Diary of a CEO.
I hope nobody's listening, but if you are, then please keep this yourself.
My dear little man, only after many long months do I take it in hand, the pen,
so that I may briefly sketch for you the unspeakable horrors of those times,
the details of which I do not wish you to know.
Those are words that your mother wrote into her diary in the 1940s during the Holocaust.
She wrote those words in April of 1945, three months after the Soviet Army expelled the
Nazis from Budapest, which is where we live.
So she was referring to the previous year and the beginning of that year, late 1944,
and early 1945.
And in those diary entries, she's addressing many of them to you directly as a baby.
She wrote a diary to me directly, as if it was like an account of my life addressed to me.
You talk so much in all your books and much of your work about the importance of that early
context. It's really been, I mean, the centre point of all the writing that I've read recently,
and I know because it's so evident in everything that you've done,
your own early context has been a key inspiration for why you've taken such an interest in these
topics. What was your early context?
What do I have to understand about your earliest years to understand you?
So it's just a fact about human beings that the template that forms us will affect how we see
the world, how we understand ourselves, how we relate to other people.
And that early template is our earliest months, even in Utah, already in the womb,
we're being affected by the environment, but certainly in the early years when our brain is
being formed and our personality is taking shape. And so that forms our worldview.
My worldview was, in my sense of self, was shaped by the fact that at two months of age,
when I was two months of age, the German army occupied Hungary.
Hungary was the last country in Eastern Europe where the Jewish population had not
been exterminated. And that was our turn. The day after the German army marched into Budapest,
which was March the 19th, 1944, the day after my mother called the pediatrician to say,
would you please come and see Gabor, because he's crying all the time. And the doctor said,
of course I'll come, but all my Jewish babies are crying. And so that the fact is that when
mothers are stressed or in pain, the infant feels all that and takes it personally, and it
becomes part of their template for how they view the world. So that's when that year began,
in which my grandparents were killed in Auschwitz, and my father was away in forced labor, and my
mother and I barely survived. And it's a story I've told many times, but that's when my brain is
developing, and that's when I'm forming my sense of myself. And then my mother, to save my life,
gives me to a stranger. And I don't see her for six weeks. The sense I get is that I'm not wanted
and I'm being rejected and abandoned because I'm not good enough. That's how my life began.
So your mother gives you away for five to six weeks in order to sort of save you from starvation
in a ghetto that she was going to, right? That's right. This is after your grandparents were killed
in Auschwitz by the Nazis. How do you know in hindsight that that moment of those six weeks
created that sense of abandonment in you? I wouldn't say just at that one moment.
The children very much view themselves through their interaction with their parents.
Now, first of all, I had no father because he was gone. I hadn't seen him, except very briefly,
when I was a month old, but there was no father in the picture. My mother was grief-stricken and
terrorized and full of war and worry about what's going to happen to us and just the task of surviving
each day. She's not playful with me. She's not smiling at me very much. She's worried looking.
She's stressed looking. The infant takes everything personally. That's just the nature of the infant.
As infants, we're a narcissist. We think it's all about us. When things are great, hey, we're great,
but my mother is unhappy. It's because she doesn't want me or I can't make her happy or I'm inadequate.
That separation from my mother certainly set a template for some of my relationship interactions
with my spouse decades later, but the sense of not being good enough and being responsible
that was inculcated in me throughout that whole first year of life. So much so that in this book,
The Myth of Normal, I actually talk about an experience with the psychedelic mushrooms
with the therapist. This is not that long ago, seven years ago, maybe, when I'm at least 70 years
old and I'm in this therapeutic session with the cytosyben, the medicine, and the therapist,
and I know that I'm 78, 70 years old and I know this is a therapy session and I know her name
and I know who I am in the world, but at the same time, I'm experiencing myself as a one-year-old
baby and she's my mother and I start crying tears come down on my face and I say, I'm so sorry.
I made your life so difficult. Now, that was an unconscious memory of my sense of myself
as a one-year-old that I made my mother's life so difficult, because that's the way the baby
interprets it. So even if your mother loves you, which mind did infinitely, not that she always
treated me the best way possible, but she did love me and can you imagine what a great act of love
even giving me to a stranger in the street would have been for her. But because of her own unhappiness,
I can only conclude that I'm not good enough and it's my fault.
As 70 years old, having that cytosyben experience coming to that realization or having that sort of
having that response to your therapist, where they take the role of your mother and you're a
one-year-old, how does somebody at 70 years old go about correcting that sort of interpretation
you had of that traumatic early event? Well, by bringing up to the conscious level,
then when I noticed that sense of guilt or responsibility in me, I say, oh, that's what
it's about. So it's a meaning. See, trauma as I define it is not about what happens to us,
it's about what happens inside of us as a result of what happens to us. And so the wound in my,
and trauma means wound. So the wound in this case is my sense of deficiency or not being good enough,
not being worthy enough. Once I realize that, oh, this has got nothing to do with anything except
this interpretation that I made with my own experience all those years ago, then when I
noticed it, I can no longer believe it. I don't have to any longer be a subject to that interpretation
of myself in the world. So awareness is one step. It's not adequate, but it's an essential step
towards letting go. That one belief that you weren't good enough, how did that
rear its ugly head throughout your life? It made me a workaholic physician,
because I had to keep proving my worth. And it doesn't matter. No, I don't know if you ever had
an addiction, but the nature of it is that we're trying to get from the outside something that
only can arise and fulfill us from the inside. So when you're looking at it from the outside,
it's addictive because you get it temporarily, but then that internal emptiness, that whole
never goes away. So it has to be filled over and over and over again. It can only be done
so temporarily. So it becomes runaway, addictive. So then, you know, work becomes an addiction
because I keep trying to prove my worth. And it doesn't matter how many times,
you know, I may show up in a positive way at the beginning of someone's life, at the end of
somebody else's life, or anytime in between. It never fills that emptiness that my sense of lack
of worthiness creates. So that's one way it shows up. Another way it shows up is if in my relationship,
I don't feel as satisfied. My wife doesn't please me the way I like her to.
Then I get angry. But why am I getting angry? I'm getting angry because it's my sense of not
being good enough. That's being now revealed. It gets uncovered, this self-acquisition.
But I get angry at her because her job is to make me not feel that. You know, we get into this
relationship for all kinds of reasons. Some of them are conscious, some are not, some are
positive, some are come out of trauma. In my case, I want that relationship to prove to me how good
I am. So when it isn't proving that, then I get upset with my partner, you know, well, except
the gap is inside me, not inside. It's not coming from her. So it shows up, it showed up in my
parenting. It shows up all over the place. I mean, I think both of those examples sound a lot like
me, especially the first one. The second one as well. In what sense? In the sense that I'm definitely
a workaholic. And I thought, I think in the earlier phases of my life, I sacrificed everything in
this pursuit of becoming a millionaire and having all this stuff and really getting this validation
sacrificed, meaningful connections, everything in the pursuit of this one thing.
Well, part of the toxicity of the culture that I talk about in this book is that it actually rewards
that kind of emptiness or that desperate seeking to fill that emptiness because, you know, you
get rewarded. You make a lot of money. A lot of people admire you. You get to feel good about
yourself. Mind you, my guess is that good feeling is only temporary, at least if my example is any
guide, you know, that feeling good, customary from the outside values, you is only a temporary
self for the, for the wound that's inside. But the world actually rewards it, you know. So
your workaholic doctor, great, you make more money and all these people respect you. Meanwhile,
you're hollowing yourself from the, from the inside and you're not available for your family,
you know, so that that's part of the craziness of this culture.
And it's like the, it's like the hedonistic treadmill in a sense, because you just never,
enough is never enough, as you say. So the last achievement needs to be surpassed by a
greater achievement for me to get an applaud or a clap. I've never really made the connection
that the reason why I'm a workaholic is because I am trying to prove to the world that I'm enough,
but I think that it's entirely true. Yeah. So in your case, like, like race and class
in this society of inequality are certainly traumatic, potentially traumatic inputs,
as I pointed in this book, and, you know, to the degree that it affects people's physiology,
you know, but also then I don't know your family version or what kind of relationship you have
with your parents, but there also may have been a sense, like I got with my mom for, you know,
reasons and for whatever might have happened in your family, maybe you got the sense as well
that even in your family origin, you weren't good enough somehow. So my mom would scream at my dad
for like seven hours a day. My dad would just sit there. Okay. And so my early memories of like
looking at my mom and dad are this kind of violent verbally, not like physically, this
incredibly stressful screaming one person screaming at the other. That's what I remember,
but from reading what you've written in this book and from what you've said now,
I actually might have learned sort of learn to that I was the problem to some degree.
Children interpret it that way. That's just the whole point. That's what I mean about kids being
narcissists. I don't mean that in the negative sense. I just mean, actually, they think it's all
about them. So if your mother is unhappy, it's your fault, you know, and you're not good enough.
So then you have to go out and work to prove yourself, to prove to the world and to yourself
that you're good enough. So that going back to your first question about how these things show up
in our lives, that's how they show up. And so 12 years old, you emigrate to Vancouver. Yeah.
By 28, you joined the medical profession. Yeah. And you spend the next 32 years roughly working
in medical degrees. Well, at 28, I went back to medical school. Actually, I took a detour. I was
a high school teacher for and then I was 27, 28 when I started medical school at age 33. I think I
began my medical career of 32 years. And in those 33 years, what was your practice? What did you
specialize in? What did you focus on? So I was a family physician, which meant I delivered a lot
of babies and I looked after people's problems from beginning to the end of life. I also worked
in palliative care. I was the director of a unit at the hospital, which looked after people with
terminal disease. And I did, that was 22 years or so of my practice, 20, 22 years. And then,
then I switched gears altogether and I went to work in the downtown east side of Vancouver,
British Columbia, which is North America's most concentrated area of drug use. We have more
people coming from anywhere in the world are shocked by what they see. There are thousands of
people in the streets injecting, selling, using, inhaling, ingesting drugs of all kinds and people
are suffered the consequences of drug use in a society that doesn't understand drug use. So it
punishes it and excludes it, ostracizes it. So people get HIV from dirty needles and hepatitis C.
So this is the population often they're homeless. So that's the population I worked with for 12 years
to the end of my medical work. That experience working with patients that were in palliative care.
So that's for anybody that doesn't know that's patients that are approaching the end of their
life that have terminal illnesses and that are aware that they're going to die. What did that
experience teach you? It took an acceptance of one's lack of lack of omnipotence as a physician
because you go into the you want to cure people you want you want people to heal and now it takes
the tremendous acceptance to say you know we've reached the limit of our knowledge and that doesn't
mean we can't help people but we certainly can't cure them you know and so it taught me how to be
with the inevitable and and and you're working with people who are in the process of dying
I mean by the way who isn't in the process of dying you know but but people whose time is more
limited than the rest of us. Acceptance you learn a lot of acceptance it challenges you to do your
best when you know your best isn't going to be saving anybody's lives but it's to help people
live a life of as little suffering as possible and as much dignity as possible so it really
challenges the best parts of you to to show up patience acceptance intuition personally taught
me a lot to listen to people interesting enough people really want to be heard when they're dying
they want to make sense of their lives they want to tell their stories that I want their stories to
be heard and so I listened a lot I just sat by the bedside and I listened all that when you listen
did you did you hear any themes relating to regret or things that actually mattered because I always
imagine in if I was given such news that my life was coming to an end and there was an approximate
date it would be quite a powerful way of finally realizing what truly matters and what never did
it you know people react to their impending death in different ways so there were some people who just
fought it to the end you know they didn't really want to accept it but most people
were more along the lines that you describe where they really get to see what's important and so
I mentioned this a number of times it sounds strange and I don't recommend it but I've had
patients say to me doctor I don't know how to tell you this and I can't even explain it perhaps
but this illness that's going to take my life is the best thing that I've happened to me and
look by men they meant a couple of things by it they meant what you just said about finding out what's
really important in life in this book the myth of normal I into you a young man called will pie
who wrote a book called blessed with a brain tumor you know what kind of blessing is that
so I said I asked well what's the blessing and he said it made me appreciate every moment
it meant every time I talk to somebody this I knew this might be the last conversation I'm gonna
have with them so it better be a human genuine interaction so that was that aspect of it the
other aspect of it was that again my view is as I pointed in this book and in previous works
who gets sick and who doesn't isn't isn't exactly accidental there were certainly
personality patterns based on traumatic experiences in childhood that make disease more likely
and people very often realize that throughout their lives they had abandoned who they were
they lived a life that didn't wasn't meaningful for them and around that they reconnected with
themselves in an authentic way and that seemed to be worth a lot to people again I don't recommend
that way of going to reconnect with yourself but people have certainly I certainly saw it so
those are the two big lessons after your 33 years in medical practice you you described that you
had a bit of a you kind of tuned into a creative calling which was writing well I began to write
when I was a physician so my first book on ADHD after I was diagnosed with it was published
in 1999 now so that was 23 years ago now so I began to write and even before then I wrote because
I wrote columns for newspapers but yes there was a time in my life where the writing impulse which
had been with me all my life was stifled and stymied and so was I because I had this frustration
in fact they had the sense that there's something I needed to express
but I didn't know what and they didn't know how and at some point I realized oh yeah I need to write
so that began before I finished medical practice but it certainly
has been essential to my ongoing unfolding as a human being I was so compelled by that when I
read about that because I've started to really understand the value of creativity in all of
our lives regardless of whether we have the luxury of being called an artist or not and
so what in your view is the importance of well you're you're singing my tune here if I may say
that way because I code in this book there's a great Hungarian Canadian stress researcher
called Janos Selye and Selye is the one who actually coined the word stress in the sense
that we use it today and he's the one that showed in the laboratory how stress diminishes the immune
system and this one is this organizes the hormones and and also rates the stomach and all this kind
of stuff but Selye also said and I quote him here what is in us must out what is in us must out
that we all have to follow our cave urges in a way that nature prepared for us otherwise we
can be hopeless hopelessly hemmed in by frustration I'm paraphrasing it very closely so
we are created in an image of God I mean as you know what are your religious views are but that
sense that we created in images of God means that we are creators because the essence of God is
creation in fact we call God the creator and we call the result of that creation if we're created
then if we're if we're offshoots of that creative dynamic in the universe then it means that it's
in us to create and whatever form that takes I mean you know you don't want to see me do art you
know unless you I can do a pretty good stick figure you know but by merit to a nurse so that
creativity doesn't have to take the form of formal art but it does have to take some flow of something
that's inside you that needs to come out otherwise as Selye says you get hopelessly hemmed in by
frustration and so in that sense everybody's got that creative urge and that may take the form of
social intercourse it might take the form of gardening I don't care community with nature
athletic expression I don't care what but it but but there's somebody everybody's got it and if
people don't realize they have it it's only because life has hemmed them in and they're too busy
and sometimes they are trying to make a living or trying to survive or to disconnect it from
themselves but it's in all of us and to the extent that we don't give it expression we suffer
one of the things that really hems it in is is the prospect that we might not be good at it
because we think to express ourselves creatively we kind of join a competition of sorts and that's
that's a trap we can fall into so if I'm gonna DJ I need to become a good DJ yeah but in social
comparison or else I don't want to but what I've come to learn is in fact the act of DJing alone
in my kitchen at midnight is is the reward regardless of outcome or whether there's a
crowd there it's just me and my dog listening that is the expression is the reward not the
achievement or the medal that I might get although yeah not the external well look I went to that
in the writing of this book so here I am this you know writer who writes about you know trauma and
you know healing and all of a sudden I'm in a panic because I'm writing a book and I realized
the problem was that you talked about identifying with your work so I had identified with this book
so the problem wasn't the book because let's say I write the book and it's not a success I mean
okay big headline in the sunday times book not a big success you know how big a big deal is that
in the history of the universe but if I identify with the book and it's not going well then if
the book fails then I'm feeling as a person which then goes back to my very earliest concern about
not being worth it you know so once I disidentified once I said no this is just a book it may be a
good book it may be an important book maybe a book that doesn't hit the mark but it's only a book
and how it goes says nothing about me or my worth once I could decouple that then I could
confidently and much more comfortably go back to the writing of it but I went through that crisis
it seems like a bit of a paradox that the lack of self-worth would motivate someone to create
great things because they want the approval but at the same time make the process so agonizing
because their self-esteem seems to be on the line yeah all this sense of self-worth is on the line
well that dynamic was in me once I realized it I let go of it you know so it didn't it didn't
dominate me in the end and honest to God by the time I finished the book I'm not just saying this
in retrospect it's it's the best seller now in several countries but I actually said to myself
and I meant it now I've done the book that's what matters I've said what was in me to say
how the world reacts I can't control and it doesn't actually matter it on a fundamental level
it's not that I don't want this book to be excess I mean success of course I wanted to sell
10 zillion copies but that doesn't define my self-worth or how I function in the world or I
feel about myself honestly it does not and I I understood that by the time I finished working
on it so once it's done it's out there doing its work or not doing its work but I don't have to
hang my own sense of self on how the book does because at that point that's an outcome you
can't control right so trying to control that would be yeah anxiety and yeah oh yeah well you
can't control it no 10 years this book yeah took you to write took me to prepare it took
about three years to write yeah you describe it as a calling yeah the myth of normal yeah
what four words to to sort of pull people in into in some way summarize a 550-odd page book
why why those four words why that phrase can I pass from him to find a quote on my cell phone
100% yeah yeah I just so this is um are you familiar with the work of Eckhart Tolle
oh Eckhart Tolle yes okay yeah so Tolle lives in Vancouver like I do and in one of his books he says
the normal state of mind of most human beings contains a strong element of what we recall
dysfunction or even madness you know so um in medical um parlance uh normal means healthy
and natural so there's a normal range of blood pressure normal temperature it's a range outside
that range there's no life there's no health either too high or too low you're gone so normal means
it's it's equivalent with synonymous with healthy and natural however we make that same assumption
that out in society what we used to what we call normal is also healthy and natural
which is the myth because I'm saying that in this society what we consider to be normal
is neither healthy nor natural in fact it's hurt hurtful to us so that we're using the word normal
in in a way that doesn't apply in a narrow medical sense it's accurate but in a broader sense that
which we're used to in this society to be considered normal is just not good for us you know and norm
is kind of a statistic or it's a kind of a um average so if everybody you have a dog if everybody
in London mistreated their dogs and if you didn't then you'd be abnormal you know so it's a myth to
say that what is normal is healthy and natural that's what I mean by the myth of normal that's one
one thing I mean the other thing I mean is if we understand the actual science of the unity of
everything I'm not talking about spiritual insight here I'm talking about you know physiological
science that our physiology and psychology is very much affected by our life experiences being
in utero childbirth early childhood and throughout the lifetime it also follows that illness and
health are not individual attributes they are actually manifestations of our relationships
and our situation in the world and and and our history that also means when these circumstances
are abnormal you expect people to be sick you know just as if you gave animals something
that wasn't healthy for them they'd be sick that'd be what you'd expect so this idea that the people
who are ill either physically or mentally abnormal I say no these are normal responses to an abnormal
set of circumstances and rather than being sort of those abnormal ones and the rest of us it's
really a spectrum that we're all pretty much all on it so in those three senses this idea of normal
is a myth and it's one that keeps us from seeing reality and we're all abnormal in some way yeah
so if you maybe my maybe my attention is different maybe my you know my my interpersonal
relationships are abnormal but in some way I'm going to be abnormal as it relates to treatments
how do you think that the medical profession and the psychological profession would respond
differently if we remove this idea that there is a normal how would how would our approaches
change to treating people well that's it's a multi-layered answer first of all we would recognize
that our diagnoses are not explanations for anything so you know I've been diagnosed with ADD
you know legitimately so as my first book was on it but but it doesn't explain anything so
so I tune out easily very easily you know and sometimes when I don't often when I don't want to
but you know unless I'm highly motivated so so you might say this person has ADD how do we know
because he tunes out a lot why does he tune a lot it's got ADD how do we know he's got ADD
because he tunes out a lot so so first of all we have to understand that our understanding of normal
and what's outside the normal they don't look doesn't explain anything they can they can describe
if you describe my mental functioning as that of somebody who's got an automatic tendency to
tune out you'd be accurate so the description it's helpful as an explanation as to why this person
isn't behaving quote unquote normally it's doesn't explain a thing now if you understood
that I spent my infancy under very difficult circumstances where I was very stressed because
of all the stuff I already talked about and that tuning out was a normal response to to those
circumstances as a way of protecting myself from the stress of it all and this was happening when
my brain was developing then you'd understand there's nothing abnormal but by tuning out in fact
it is the normal response to a set of abnormal circumstances so that's the first point and
I could go through the same kind of dialectic with all manner of physical and mental diseases by
the way so-called the second point is why do you say so-called
well look the disease model is as long as we understand it's a model it's okay
when we think it describes reality fully it doesn't so
for example we call you talk about mental illnesses
and we're assuming that there's a kind of definite pathology there just as in rheumatoid
arthritis you can describe the inflammation of the joints and the blood levels of certain antibodies
being abnormal and hormonal levels being disturbed you know we're making the same
assumption in mental illness there's no such evidence in mental illness there's no physiological
parameters that you can say somebody's got mental illness there's just been a study
a few months ago of thousands of brain scans of people with mental illness diagnosis there's
nothing diagnostic about them about the brain scans it's not like I can take an x-ray of a lung
and say that this is this lung is what we call consolidation or fluid indicating inflammation
there's nothing like that in mental diagnosis there's no blood tests you can do and so on
so illness is a model I mean it might yeah somebody's really depressed
um even suicidal perhaps and then might need pharmacological intervention which would really
save their lives that may be true and in that sense you may say that they're ill as long as
we realize that this is a construct that we're applying here but there's no actual measurement
of that that's at all similar to what we call physical disease but even in physical disease
we make certain assumptions um for example somebody has rheumatoid arthritis
no that nothing wrong with that statement on the face of it but there's an assumption there
the assumption is that there's this thing called rheumatoid arthritis
and this is a person called me and this person has this thing no you know the example I often
give here's my cell phone I'm holding it in my hand I have a cell phone it's not part of me
it says nothing about me it just it's a discrete object its nature doesn't depend on my nature
nothing is that true about rheumatoid arthritis or is it more true to say as I found out that this
is a condition that shows up in people with certain life experiences in certain ways of
functioning in the world and that because of the science documented unity of mind and body and the
impossibility of separating the activity or emotional apparatus from same or immune system
because it's all one organismic unit therefore the when the immune system turns against the body as
it does in rheumatoid arthritis the immune system actually attacks the body is that a thing that's
got a life of its own or is there a process that's happening inside that person because of certain
aspects of their lives now if I say it's the thing that happens to you then that thing has
got a life of its own and that's how most doctors see it they see somebody with rheumatoid arthritis
they say okay this is the kind you've got this is what's going to happen this is this is the only
thing we can do is to mitigate the symptoms I find that's not true I find that the rheumatoid by
them not just I find it the science finds it that rheumatoid arthritis is very much related to stress
and trauma and the more stress there is the more likely it is to flare up and if people deal with
that stress if they know how to prevent it their illness abates which means that it's not a thing
that's separate it's a process that happens inside them this is a subtle concept I'm wondering if I'm
explaining it clearly no you are and it's really making me question how much we misunderstand the
relationship between the mind and the immune system yeah because that's the real that's the
important connection to understand if you if you are to accept all the things you've just said yeah
which we don't we don't understand I don't think typically we understand that my mind and my immune
system has such a close relationship well the there's a whole new science that studies those
relationships it's called psychonorminology which studies the interlinked unity of the emotional
apparatus of our brain and body with the immune system with the nervous system and with the hormonal
apparatus I mean it's just so obvious I could change your hormonal state in the split second
right now without touching you just by screaming at you and threatening you that would necessarily
create a change I mean it's just clear that our emotions are inseparable you know and and the other
funny thing is well several funny things how do we treat most conditions in medicine by the way
inflammation if you go to a dermatologist with inflamed skin if you go to a rheumatologist
with inflamed joints if you go to a gastroenterologist with inflamed intestines if you go to a
respirologist with inflamed lungs if you go to a neurologist with inflamed nervous system as in
multiples grosses they're going to give you steroids to settle the inflammation but what are
steroids they are stress hormones and you would think that as physicians we would ask ourselves
gosh we're treating everything with stress hormones the stress maybe has something to do with this
condition now when you look at the scientific literature yes yes yes and yes so there's a great
canadian physician actually knighted by queen victoria one of the great medical teachers of all
kinds sir william osler and he said in 1890 that rheumatoid arthritis is a stress-driven disease
the the french neurologist jean mattin charcot first described multiples grosses he said this is
a stress-driven condition and since then there's been so much research so what i'm saying is that
this this way of looking at what we call disease is a process it's so much more accurate scientifically
actually and understanding the mind-body unity and then you know naturally when people traumatized
that has a huge impact on their physiology their psychological trauma has a huge impact on their
physiology it's just science but it's science that's not taught to medical teachers medical
doctors it's just for some strange reason well the average physician never hears a single lecture
about say trauma and his relationship to illness and yet the studies internationally thousands of them
showing those relationships so there's this strange gap between science and and medical
practice but it would it would change medical practice for the better because what would happen
if you went to a physician and you presented with your symptom and they'd say okay look we'll give
you such as this medication to deal with your symptoms and then let's look at your life in the
context that you live it and see how that the stresses that you may be taking on the traumas
you may be carrying might be affecting the physiology of your body no they don't have to be all
trauma therapists to do that they just have to raise the question and to start and then to begin
the inquiry that'll make a huge change to that person's life and to their disease process
and clearly to their kids lives as well because i remember reading in your book about the study
with the rats yeah and how they could you tell me about that study how the stress study with the
rats and how the parents treatment of a child impacted their stress response and then also
they passed that on which i think was yeah that was a very interesting study i was done in canada
at margill university i think maybe something in the last 20 years early 2000s i think and
they looked at how mother rats interacted with their infants their newborns and some and this
is a process called grooming in which the mother rat licks the infant are in the perine perineal
or perianal area you know in the genitalia this is shortly after birth these mother rats just
start licking their infants some of the rats did it in a more efficient and caring kind of way
than other mother rats those that had the better kind of caring the better kind of grooming
grow to be calmer and respond to stress in more functional ways than those little rats who
as neonates had not been given that same kind of efficient and quite as caring grooming
and what they found out in the brains of those adult rats who had been groomed one way or the
other as infants the stress apparatus was different certain receptors for the stress hormones
so one of them could call themselves more easily than the other what was interesting is you might
say well so what that's just genetic the calmer mothers passed on their genes to their infants
no they didn't because if you took the infants of mothers who groomed beautifully and put them
with mothers who didn't and conversely you took the infant rats of mothers who didn't groom so
well but you put them with mothers who did it changed it changed the brain for the adult it
changed the brain it changed the genetic functioning not the genes but the genetic functioning this is
called epigenetics how genes are turned on and off by the environment and then those mother and
those rats who were groomed well as infants doesn't matter what the original mother was but
those rats were groomed well they went on to groom their infants in exactly the way they'd
been groomed so this is how we pass on our parenting stuff from one generation to the next
both behaviorally but also through the turning on or off of certain genes so in essence the
how nurturing our parents were has a big impact on our own ability to handle stress positively
or negatively oh absolutely and then we pass that down how stress appearance or how they reacted to
our own stress as as infants you know that has everything to do with how our brains handle
stress later on and so some people just don't handle stress very well they don't handle a
frustration very well you should have seen me this morning at the hotel when the swinging pool
didn't open in time you know but I I was a lot better than I might have been years ago you know
but yeah our stress responses are very much programmed by our early developmental experiences
speaking about our early experiences the first word in this sort of subtitle of your book is the
word trauma um it's a word that I've I've talked about a lot on this podcast and I've you know I've
had a lot of people hear that have opened up about their traumas how how do you define trauma I know
society's defined it in its own way but how do you define it I define it very specifically um
it's not something bad that happens to you it's not some it's not that you know I went to this
movie last night and I was traumatized no you weren't you were just sad or you were
had some emotional pain but you weren't traumatized trauma means a wound that's the literal meaning
of the word it's a Greek word for wounding so trauma is a psychological wound that you sustain
and um it behaves like a wound so on one hand a wound if it's very raw if you touch it it just
really hurts so if I have a wound around not being wanted then or the belief that I'm not
then decades later if anything reminds me of that it hurts as much as it did when I originally
incurred the wound so in in one sense trauma is an unhealed wound that touched we get triggered
that's what triggering means by the way some old wound gets activated or touched and the other thing
that happens to wounds is that they scar over and scar tissue has certain characteristics
it's thick it has no nerve endings so there's no feeling in it so people traumatized disconnected
from their feelings um scar tissue is rigid it's not flexible so we lose kind of response
flexibility so when something happens we tend to react in typical stereo typical predictable
dysfunctional ways because of the rigidity and scar tissue doesn't grow like healthy flesh
so people are traumatized tend to be stuck in emotional states that characterized
their development when they were traumatized so when somebody says to you do me such a baby
doesn't sound very pleasant but there's some truth to it it means that you're probably reacting
according to the lines of some wound that you sustained as an infant and now you're you're
reacting as if that wound was happening all over again this is what one of my friends in the trauma
world Peter Levine calls the tyranny of the past so something happens in the present and we react
as if we're back there in the past when this first happened I mean not in the present moment at all
and I was trying to figure out how many people as a percentage of the population have a
have trauma but then I you know I read this that 60 percent of adults um say that they've had a
sort of a traumatic early upbringing or whatever or traumatic events from their childhood but then
I thought maybe everybody has trauma it depends on how we understand trauma so if we understand
trauma there's only the really terrible things that happen to people which do happen to people
you know in the book I talked about a British friend of mine of what now living in Canada
they are a yoga teacher and a meditation teacher and a psychologist and an artist actually
and they grew up in some orphanage here in Britain where they were racially taunted every
every morning you know words that are in the book by her permission which I'm not gonna cite here
publicly and that gave her a sense of deficient a sense of self that I'm just not good enough that
I don't belong and so on there's those obvious traumas or the obvious trauma of being sexually
abused so men who are sexually abused according to Canadian study have tripled the rate of hard
attacks as adults you know and all kinds of physiological reasons why that should be the case
so there's those self-evident large big T traumas that we call big T trauma T with a capital T
trauma with a capital T there's a certain percentage of the population much larger than we think
subject to that if you include all the known factors such as physical sexual or emotional abuse
spanking by the way has not been shown to be as traumatic as harsher forms of physical abuse
spanking which is still recommended by so-called experts who surely named remain unnamed for the
moment the death of a parent violence in a family violence parental violence against each other
a parent being jailed a parent being mentally ill did I say a parent being addicted a ranker's
divorce these are the identified big traumas big T traumas not not to mention poverty not to mention
extreme inequality war and so on but then if you remember that trauma is not what happens to you
but what happens inside you is the wound people can be wounded not just by bad things happening
to them but small children can be wounded in loving families where they don't get their needs met
I mean that's obvious in the physical sense if a child doesn't get proper nutrition
that their body will suffer their mind will suffer we're also creatures with the emotional needs
as important as our physical needs so when the child's emotional needs are not met that child
is wounded that's what we call small T trauma which is not the big ticket events such as I described
but just the child's need to be loved unconditionally to be held when distressed to be responded to to
be seen to be heard to be allowed their full range of emotion without them being stamped on in the
name of so-called discipline the right to play creatively spontaneously out there in nature
not with these damn digital the gadgets that subvert and hijack the child's imagination
but spontaneous play that's essential for brain development so what I'm saying is that when these
needs are not for the unconditional loving attachment relationship when those needs are
frustrated children are also hurt and I call that trauma as well because it shows up later in life
as the impact of painful wounds so trauma in this society for all kinds of reasons
is far more common than we imagine from sitting here and speaking to I don't know
somewhere over a hundred different people that come from all walks of life but specifically
people that are successful in their industries and you talked about you know how an anomalous
early upbringing can create sort of abnormality in an adult a lot of the people I sit here are
successful because of some kind of abnormality or at least their interpretation of some kind of early
event that caused them to have some sort of abnormal belief about themselves that they're
not enough so they become a billionaire or a gold medallist or whatever it might be
one of the things that I thought I could predict is I thought I could if they told me
I thought after doing a hundred episodes if they told me the traumatic event they've been through
I could predict the outcome in them but there's a disconnect there because you know I'd sit here
with a guest who went through one of your tall capital T traumas like domestic violence and
one of them might become incredibly angry and one of them might become the most peaceful loving
person I've ever met and that taught me that there's this thing in between the event which
is what you call interpretation yeah and I found that really I found that as that kind of makes
it really difficult to diagnose well no look so the two examples you gave um that really peaceful
person may be really peaceful for genuinely good reasons such as they found the milk of human love
flowing through their veins and they've had some spiritual um reconciliation with the world
where they may have let genuinely learned compassion for themselves and others but they
could also be very nice and peaceful because they're suppressing their healthy anger because
they're actually sitting on their rage unconsciously which is going to show up in the form of some kind
of health manifestation I guarantee you later on so you can't tell from the outside without asking
some questions or I can give you the example of a Donald Trump who had a really traumatic childhood
I mean his father was this as described by his psychologist niece Mary Trump his father Trump's
father who is Mary's grandfather was a psychopath and who really demeaned and harshly treated their
children so Trump decides unconsciously that by the way I'm not talking about his policies here
I'm not this is not a political debate and in the book I point out that his opponent was also
traumatized Helio Clinton so this is this is a ecumenical view of trauma and politics I'm not
choosing sides I'm just saying that you can see his trauma in every moment he opens his mouth
his grandiose cities need to make himself bigger more powerful aggressive and eats as much as said
in his autobiography that the world is a horrible place a doggy dog place where everybody is after
you everybody wants your wife and your house and your wealth and this is your friends never mind
your enemies but that's the world he lives in now that world that he lives in reflects his child
at home he developed that world view he came to it honestly you might say because that's the world
that he lives in and he gets to be really successful in this crazy world you know financially although
people question you know was he really as big a success as he says he was but he certainly was
successful politically if by success you mean the attainment of power his brother on the other hand
Mary Trump's father Trump's niece's father drank himself to death and there were both responses
to the same you can never say it's exactly the same for two kids but there was that there was a
toxic home environment one ends up dead as an alcoholic the other ends up at the pinnacle of
power and when I look at them both I see dysfunction there significant dysfunction there
so one of them it's one of those the consequences of that early upbringing was it materialized
itself as sort of addiction and the other got the same psychological reinforcement or the thing
missing from power and work and money well Donald Trump learned that the way to survive is to be
aggressive and harsh and competitive and to get the other before they get to you which is a faithful
reproduction of his early childhood experiences so for him these were not choices so much as survival
techniques and when they talk about his lying well I don't know when he's lying or when he's not
but my sense is that often he actually believes what he's saying and actually he's a biographer
or the person who co-wrote his cause the autobiographical the out of the deal this this writer says
that he's never met anybody who's so capable of believing something that's not true to be true
if he wants it to be true but that's the mark of a traumatized child you know a denial of reality
it is an inauguration there was a certain number of people that came to the
he couldn't stand it that there weren't as many people there as came to
Barack Obama's inauguration there were a much smaller number of people there
he created this reality where many more people came to his inauguration
now what age behavior is that that's a four-year-old where more kids came to his party than my party
that can't be true but that's Donald's way of dealing with reality it's not a moral
failing as such that's how he survived and these survival mechanisms then we get the
former personalities and again in this world sometimes they pay off in certain ways is that
is that often the case with pathological lies they've learned to lie as a way to survive
oh absolutely the the the German philosopher writer Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche said
people lie their way out of reality who have been hurt by reality and so I've lied you know like when
I had my shopping addiction I relied every day to my wife you know and even afterwards
when she tried when she stopped trying to change my behavior I said just tell me
me if you're going to shop you're going to spend another thousand dollars on music just tell me
I still couldn't because I was so ashamed of it and so the lying became like a
way of survival for me defense against reality it's a defense against reality and it's a defense
against being judged you know well that says something about my childhood you know nobody's
born a liar as we say in this book there are congenital liars but there are no congenital liars
no one day old baby tells any lies no one day old baby pretends anything if we end up pretending
in any way at all to the extent that we do it's because we had to learn that's what we must do to
survive you said something at the start when I gave the example that I have this I sat with a guest
here who went through domestic abuse yeah and they are the calmest person and then you said well
maybe they're suppressing it and in fact the minute you said that it reminded me of something they
said which is they said to me on this podcast that they had angry outbursts all the time so
sometimes their child will come up to them yeah and want to play when they're working and they'll
snap yeah and they're trying to they're trying to deal with that yeah that's what I meant that
they're sitting on this crater of volcanic crater of anger which sometimes bursts out of them so
their their demeanor is like a really developed suppressed way of handling rage which rage
when they were children had they expressed would have got them into more trouble so suppressing
it repressing it became their survival it's all about survival you see so it became their survival
mechanism no that person as long as they keep it that way they're at risk they're at risk for
mental health diagnosis like depression because what do we what is depression it means you're
pushing something down that's what it means what do we push down our natural emotions why do we
push them down because we had to survive so that that person I don't know I can't prognosticate
what's going to happen to them but if they don't work it out in general they're at risk for some
kind of mental or physical manifestation that's my experience quick one some of you may know we've
got a brand new sponsor on this podcast American Express and you've got a brand new exclusive

and say over the last really it's been about two and a half years it was really um post pandemic
how much my health has become such a huge priority in my life Huell has been probably the most
important partner in my health journey because I've been in the boardrooms I've been to their offices
tens and tens and tens and tens of times I've seen how they make their decisions on nutrition
and that's why it's such a wonderful thing to be able to talk to this audience about a brand
and a product that is so unbelievably linked to my values and the place I am in my life
of valuing the gym exercise movement my mind my breathing and all of those things and most
importantly my nutrition that is the role Huell plays and so every time I get to read these ads
I do it with such passion because I really really believe every word I'm saying and I absolutely
love the brand so if you haven't already tried Huell and you've been resistant to my my pestering
then give it a go and let me know how you get on it talked about expressing one's emotions and
something you've talked about in this book but also previously is this idea that there is such a
thing as healthy anger yeah it's one of the seven a's of your of healing as you say the first
being the topic a topic we've talked about already which is acceptance yeah the next being awareness
well awareness that we should have put into this book what we didn't not into this book
in this book I put four a's and I left out awareness and that was an omission on my part
really yeah I was I'm sorry but it was so in the book you have authenticity
anger acceptance agency and agency yeah and yeah acceptance yeah so awareness you've said
before before this book that awareness is the starting point yeah I found that to be so true
in my life but it's not very easy I feel like awareness is a is a luxury or a privilege that
is very hard fought yeah because you're guessing yeah you're guessing based on pattern recognition
so I was guessing 25 years old I can't get into relationship anytime a girl comes near me
even if I've pursued her I run off and to figure out why I was doing that to even identify the
behavior pattern go that's not helpful that's not going to lead me to feeling whole yeah
where does that come from took 25 years and a lot of like introspection but but most people
they're living unaware of the puppet master yeah of trauma that is driving their life that's a
really good analogy is the trauma really is like a puppet master behind the scenes or any unconscious
pulling your strings and you're not aware of it you know do you remember Pinocchio yeah so you remember
what Pinocchio says at the end the way when he finally becomes a real boy yeah he says how fully
shell was when I was a puppet and to the extent that we're being activated by these unconscious
strings that are traumas pulling behind the scenes and we're acting in our lives and we think we're
autonomous free beings but we're actually being controlled by something in the past
that we haven't worked out we're puppets we're actually puppets and and and there's not there's
not much freedom in that there's no there's no freedom in it at all so I mean I suppose the
opposite of trauma if you want to revisit that question is is liberation interesting
liberation and and by reconnection by reconnection but liberation from the from the inexorable power
of the unconscious which is like cutting the strings in a way kind of brings me to there's
kind of two ways I want to go with that but the first question I have about about trauma and the
puppet master analogy is do we ever do we ever really cut the strings or do we just kind of
learn to pull against them when they try and tell us to do something with more force than
they're exerting in the opposite direction that doesn't work very well pushing against it because
they're still reactive you're still not in charge you're just in automatic resistance mode to something
there's no freedom and not either you know so yeah but awareness that you mentioned is huge
because once you're aware that there's this see the thing about these strings may not
fray right away but once you wear that ah this reaction of mine it's not about what's going
on right now there's something old being activated here that awareness alone weakens the it slackens
the strings a bit no you know they're no longer is taught they're no longer is automatically
capable of pulling on you so it does have to be beginning with awareness of them ultimately
if we realize that this puppet master is just a desperate little person trying to get you to
survive the only way he she they knew how when you were small whenever small if we make friends with
it but we relieve it of its duties so thanks very much but I can handle it now it eventually
becomes our friend rather than sort of our master on that first step of just acknowledging just
understanding that there is a puppet master they're controlling us and exactly which strings that
puppet master is pulling in our lives how does one go about awareness the process of awareness is
that I mean is it introspection keeping a diary therapy what what is it well all that I mean
all or any but even when you ask how you go about it what is the it well for you to say how to go
about it you already must have some degree of awareness if you didn't you wouldn't even be
asking the question so that's the very first step of realizing that there's something here to work on
there's something here to work through it does not need to be the way it is that already is the
biggest step the Buddha said that that to recognize the source of your suffering is the first step
towards relieving the suffering and so as soon as you ask how you go about it you've already taken
a huge step because a lot of people don't even know that there's an it they just think this is
a reality that this is life so realizing that this it doesn't have to be the way it is that's
already a huge step now beyond that yoga meditation nature therapy of all kinds body work of all kinds
like like like somatic experiencing or or creating your sacral treatments or even massage therapy
it's incredible what can be revealed just through body work like that then all kinds of forms of
therapy the ones I teach the ones other people teach journaling certain exercises in this book
that we recommend like just ask yourself where you have trouble saying no in life to things you
don't really want to do and working that through on a regular basis so there's a lot of ways once
you open the door you know I have a chapter on psychedelics here which is again it's not like
a panacea or for everyone but certainly it's a helpful modality for a lot of people so some people
may actually benefit from taking pharmaceutical medications if their situation is dire enough
but not as the final answer but as a way of getting respite that allow them to go to work on
real issues that cause them to be depressed or anxious or tuning out you know so any and all
of these things a lot of people don't even want to open those doors though because they there's
so much pain associated with maybe going back or revisiting an early experience that they just
think it's better keep the doors shut yeah and get to tomorrow that's true to which I have two
answers one is it's true it's painful because all the pain you didn't want to feel and you've been
running away from through your compensatory behaviors like like your addictions or nothing
but an attempt to escape from pain that's all they are that's all you know they're not a disease
they're not a genetic whatever it is addictions are very simply an attempt to escape pain
which create more pain but that's what they are and so we get addicted to work to sex to
pornography to gambling to the internet to shopping to eating to power on that point I
find it so fascinating that when you mentioned in your previous book that you know you classified
things like food yeah social media yeah shopping yeah porn and work as types of addiction that was
that in and of itself was a bit of a revelation for me because I never saw work as an addiction
the minute you said it was and I kind of link it to you know heroin addiction which is providing
a you know a certain psychological or physiological benefit to me yeah temporarily
temporarily yeah of course it's a fucking addiction of course work is an addiction
well I have that addiction well work can be an addiction yeah work can also be sacred
it can also be fulfilling in the manifestation of your creative urges but it's so it's not the
but it's strange to say not that I recommend it but it's possible even to use heroin in a
non-addictive way I don't personally get it and I would never want to but the addiction is never in
the behavior itself it's in your relationship to the behavior so if the particular activity
gives you temporary relief or pleasure and therefore you crave it but it causes harm in the long
term and you can't give it up you got an addiction and I don't care what the activity is could be
drugs and all the other things that we mentioned and it employs the same brain circus by the way
the workaholic is after the same brain chemical that the cocaine addict is after dopamine
you know and people can be even addicted to their own stress hormones like adrenaline
the so-called adrenaline junkies there's such a thing you know so almost anything can be addictive
if it serves the purpose of temporarily easing some distress but causing harm in the long term
is escapism the right word to use then for it if we're because it it doesn't sound as much like
we're escaping but rather than we are seeking something we're seeking relief from a certain
mental state like like I just gave you a definition of addiction so I don't know what
addictions you've had or haven't or haven't besides you know but what did that do for you
temporarily it gave you something it made me feel like I was valid and I was pursuing
a sense of accomplishment and validation could give you a sense of worth yeah I was worthy
no is that something that people need or not yes yeah that's a good thing but the real question is
why did you ever get the idea that you didn't have the words why did I get the
that didn't have the word that's what trauma comes because I was called the n-word when I was
eights by a kid in school exactly and then I'd know and because your mother screamed at your father
yeah you know and so all that together and so and that's emotionally painful like what's it feel
like to be not to have a sense of worth that's painful and so that's why my mantra is don't
ask why the addiction that's why the pain and if you want to understand why the pain you have to
look at that person's life and what the benefit of the addiction is that's something that you say
in previous book that I found it's a flipping of narrative where you say we should be asking what
the benefit of the addiction is yeah well like in your case yeah it gives me a sense of worth well
okay I'll say to you if you come to me because you say like I work all like it's causing some harm
in my life it's keeping keeping me from intimate relationships it makes me stressed and tired whatever
it is it's the first thing I would ask you for you of you is what is it doing for you and you
say a sense of worth and I'd say you know what you deserve to have a sense of worth I told you
understand why you'd want to engage in an activity that gives it to you but given that it's causing
you harm let's look at why you don't have a sense of worth and how else you might develop it that
isn't harmful to you you know so but you start with what's right about it what are you looking for
and what you're looking for is always valid and how one would go about how would one go about
getting that sense of worth I'm asking for a friend
well that would be a matter of some form of work people meditate often deal with that issue through
the meditation not always certainly therapy you know by recognizing also that what you're doing
to get the sense of where it doesn't really do it for you just by getting honest about it you know
so there's all kinds of ways but the first step is the recognition
that's the first step that you say is missing missing from the book which is that sort of
awareness yeah the next thing which I've been it's been really front of mind in my life recently
because I've been asked this a few times on stage and I've been trying to find the words to really
articulate the importance of it is and this is one of your forays in this book about how to heal
is authenticity yeah really interesting concept because I've been trying to articulate why the
fact that I've just shared all this stuff with you and the fact that I do this every week yeah I'm
getting close and closer to that sort of authentic self where there's really the mask is kind of
dropping on me why that's been so healing for me why is authenticity such a good way an important
way for us to heal it's much more than a way for us to heal it's actually who we are like what you
are really asking is why is it important for a creature to be true to its own nature because
that's what we're meant to do we're meant to be heroes ourselves you know and and and when we
not ourselves because we had to abandon ourselves or betray ourselves or disconnect from ourselves
in order to survive we lost connections with our essence and I mean how does it feel to
be a successful CEO and you know more than realizing your financial dreams but to be a
workaholic and and and not to be available to yourself in areas of your life that really matter
to you as opposed to being honest about your stuff sharing with other people dropping the veil
dropping the I mean to answer your question what does it feel like I mean can you sense the
difference in your body feel the lighter well yeah expansive exactly well that's the answer
yeah that's why it's so important it's so many of us so many of us um live in authentic lives
because as you said it's it's because either because from an early age we were escaping
um some kind of you know reality in order to help us to survive or then the other thing that happens
a bit later on in life is we develop an identity which becomes a career which becomes a social
circle which becomes a prison of our inauthentic selves we get trapped in there you know because
I was good at something or because I you know I felt accepted in this job as a lawyer so I am now
living inauthentically as this robot in this prison and it's a it's a there's often a real
perception of risk and loss and danger of trying to get out of that prison of trying to get close
to our authentic selves we feel like we'll lose our friendship circle we'll feel like we'll we'll
let our parents down he wanted us to become a lawyer you know all of these things I guess you see
that a lot in your in your work well that there's that risk and but here's the issue as a child you
had no choice but to go for acceptance and being approved of and being received um under any under
any conditions no matter what you had to give up of your authenticity you had to give up your
authenticity you had no choice in the matter at a certain point as adults we get we learn that this
lack of authenticity this disconnection from ourselves this separation from our gut feelings
is costing us it's costing us in terms of our physical health our peace of mind our relationship
our mental health and so on you'll never be as vulnerable again as you were when you were a child
you never be as helpless as dependent as resourceless no it's true that if you develop the whole
set of relationships based on your authentic inauthentic persona some people in your life may
not like it if you gradually move towards authenticity that may not like it it's not what
they wanted from you you're gonna find out who your friends are you're really gonna find because
your real friends will say oh i'm so happy for you people waiting for this other friends will
say uh it's not what i signed up for you know the question is you still have to decide as an
infant as a young child i had no agency in the choice of you know authenticity and attachment
no i do which one do i want to go with what is the cost of being inauthentic i can't make that
decision for anybody else nobody can make that decision for anybody else but most people will
find that choosing authenticity has benefits way beyond whatever they might lose that's what i find
and you said the word that agency which is the second of the four a's on how to heal now agency
when when you when i read that word i i hear like personal responsibility taking personal
responsibility yeah over my life exactly which also means not letting you know you don't use
you don't wear trauma as a badge you know or you don't use it as a get out of jail pass in a
game of monopoly oh i was traumatized so i can't i can't be any other way you know i mean giving
all the power to the puppet master yeah yeah exactly so agency means actually i take responsibility
not for what happened to me not even how i interpreted the world as a result going backwards
but how i interpret the world from now on do i still want to interpret the world
and my role in it based on some decision i made when i was a one-year-old
that's where agency comes in agency also means that if i have any kind of dysfunction or illness
it's not just that i put my hands in the hands of a put my my fate in the hands of a a physician or
a healer but i i have agent i make the decisions i listen to your advice i accept some i don't
accept some but i'm the one who's making the decisions along with what seems right to me
so agency it's interesting in your in your work throughout your work you use
alliteration as a lot as a way to kind of summarize and make ideas really memorable
it really helps it's a little trick it's a trick it's a writing trick right well it's it also works
you know before ways or before i don't i don't want to say you know i'm i'm i'm denigrating
my work if i say it's a trick no it's just something just the way things occur to me
that's all it is one of the one of the um alliteration devices you use is also relates to
limiting beliefs and how we can undo yeah self-limiting beliefs with the five r's yeah
relabel reattribute refocus re revalue and recreate yeah now from what i understood of those
relabeling is the story and the belief that is limiting to us um so well well it takes something
like um your work algorithm yeah i need to go to work i need to do this work yeah relabeling is
i don't need to do this work i just have a belief that i need to do this work okay so that
relabeling just takes a degree of separation from the behavior and and actually it's true it's not
that you need to do all this work you have this belief so relabeling just says it for what it is
by the way i have to acknowledge that i these these five r's only one in his mind i stole the other
four from a psychiatrist that's just i i mentioned that in the book but i find it very helpful technique
but it was developed for people with obsessive compulsive tendencies so the relabel is not that
i have to wash my hand a hundred times i just have a belief that i have to wash my hand a hundred
times that's the context in which it was developed i think it works for all kinds of beliefs all kinds
of uh dynamics and then if i and then so i've relabelled it i don't have to work to feel a sense
validation but i have a belief that i do that's right and then i reattribute it which is the
second r which means i get clear on where it's come from yeah so let's say you have the belief
that you're not worth it it's not two that i'm not worth it i just have a belief that i'm not worth it
okay or it may not be two that i'm not worth it but i do have a belief that i'm not worth it
reattribute means this is an old brain circuit sending me an old message it's got nothing to
with reality it has to do with some experience that i had a long time ago that's the reattribute
you just say what was actually coming from there's a circuit in your brain that's wired with the
message you're not worth it and it's going to keep repeating that message well you say okay that's
where it's coming from until i refocus which is the third r yeah so refocus is just to give
us some space so if they ever say uh i need to go to work uh okay refocus means well for five minutes
maybe in five minutes i'll go to work for five minutes i won't i'm gonna put on some piece of
music or go for a walk or meditate or whatever so you refocus you put the intention somewhere else
i just just so that to prove to yourself that you actually have some agency over your brain
if only for five minutes if you have this belief that i'm not worth it
well you can go back to it in five minutes if you want just for five minutes though consider
all the ways that you made a contribution consider all the ways that people have acknowledged your
benign the presence in their lives the times that people have told you that they've loved you or
that you told somebody else just for five minutes hang out with that five minutes later you want
to go back to this belief that or if you can't help going back to this belief that you're not
worth it well that's okay but at least create some space it's all about creating space between
yourself and these beliefs or these behaviors and in that five minutes you're you're basically
accepting new evidence to be true or you're proving that other evidence is true i didn't
need to go and work well you're also proving that you don't have to spend all your time
subjected to those beliefs you can take a hiatus from it at least for a while and they are not you
they're not you yeah and then revalue um revalue revalue it really what it should mean or
maybe more accurately devalue because you say what has it been the actual value this
belief that i'm not worth it what has been the actual value of it in my life or this tendency
of mine to be a workaholic what has been the actual value oh it made me tired it made me alienated
or it keeps me depressed or it keeps me hopelessly trying to prove something which i can never
prove to myself anyway through external activity so the you actually look at what has been its
actual impact on your life what has been its real value um sometimes the value is positive though
right like i think about my own workaholic workaholism if that's the term i think there's some
there's some positives here yeah a lot of negatives yeah well is the positive do the
workaholism or is it due to your capacity to work hard in in on behalf of a goal they're not the same
your capacity to work hard to achieve a certain goal is simply a gift that you have
and something that maybe takes some discipline and application on your part that's not workaholism
that's just a strong positive work ethic the workaholism when you're driven to work you actually
don't need to it's funny because it reminds me of an analogy i've been talking about in the last
couple of episodes of this podcast the the distinction between being driven and being dragged
yeah it's like am i which side of the lorry am i flying down the motorway am i tied to the front
and am i running and pulling the lorry or am i just like my ankles attached to the back of
the lorry as it flies down the motorway because i'm being dragged but if i may i would say that
neither of those are particularly desirable but but but but it's the distinction that i made before
between being driven and being called yeah because if you're called you see if i call you
say steven would you come and have dinner with me you can say yes you can say no i just gave
you a call and you can say literally i'm talking about calling on your telephone you know you can
say yes you can say no the decision but you're the one who's making the decision yeah when you're
dragged or pushed or pulled you're not making the decision i'm a slave to the decision to that
to the activity one of the um one of the really interesting things i wanted to talk to you about
is is adhd yeah um i've had a few of my friends and my close friendship circle diagnosed with adhd
recently um and then i looked into some of the statistics around adhd and i found this statistic
that said in the 1980s one in 20 u.s children were diagnosed with adhd today the number is roughly
one in nine yeah um and just generally you know around me there's it feels like and this could
just be because of my own little narrow circle or it could be because of a wider thing happening in
society it feels like there's been an increase in diagnosis of mental illness and things like adhd
and the causes when i spoke to my friend about what he believed the cause of his adhd was and he's
posted this on linkedin and talks about it very publicly now um it seemed to point to he seemed
to believe it was relating to some kind of genetic or yeah heritable um factor yeah now the issue
the issue that i've sort of been contending with myself and why i spoke to yohan harry about this
and others about this is if i if i am to accept that then i am i feel like i'm accepting that
we're being born somewhat broken and this is almost what yohan harry talked about in in the
early stages of his teenage years where he he was made to believe that there was this chemical
imbalance in his brain and therefore he was born broken and here's the medication to solve it yeah
so but i don't want i don't believe that i don't i don't personally believe that we're we're born
broken well um anybody interested in the subject might do what i think yohan actually does to
read my book on adhd it's called scattered minds and um i was diagnosed within my 50s and so were
a couple of my kids but but i never bought into the idea this is a genetic disease or that it's
a disease at all genetic or otherwise um now as for the rising number of um people being diagnosed
with it there could be two reasons at least one is we're better at diagnosis so before we wouldn't
have noticed it but now we are or genuinely there's more people who are having trouble in certain
ways such as with attention and impulse control and so on but either way the fact is that many
more children are being diagnosed and medicated for this condition particularly in the u.s but also
increasingly uh here in the uk as well and in china and elsewhere now um as i said earlier if we
the fact is here's the actual reality nobody's ever found a gene for adhd nobody's ever found a
gene that says if you have this gene you're gonna have adhd no such gene has ever been found
no group of genes have ever been found that says if you're gonna have this gene you're gonna have
this condition nor ever will be and no such gene or group of genes have ever been found that if
you don't have these genes you will not have the condition now there are some diseases that
are genetic one runs in my family muscular dystrophy if you have the gene you're gonna have the
disease. My mother had it, my aunt had it. That's a genetic condition. And if you have a gene,
you'll have the disease. Very rare, those kind of diseases. No, there are some genes that the
more of them you have, the more likely you are to have any number of mental health diagnoses,
ADHD, depression, anxiety, even psychosis, bipolar illness. But there's no group of genes or set of
genes or gene that themselves determine any one condition. As a matter of fact, you can have
those same genes and not have any condition whatsoever. So something is being passed on,
but it's not any kind of condition that's being passed on. What's being passed on is sensitivity.
And the more sensitive you are, the more you're going to feel whatever's going on in the environment.
So you take the same sensitive care that these genes that confer greater sensitivity out of them,
and sensitive means to feel, from the Latin word to feel, sincere. The more sensitive you are,
the more you're going to feel. The more you feel, the more bad stuff happens, the more pain you're
going to be in, and the more compensating you're going to have to do. At the same time, with those
same genes, if you treat it well and you grow up in a healthy environment, you'll just be creative
and happy and joyful and a leader or an artist or a shaman or a very creative CEO or whatever you're
going to be. So the genes don't determine. They make you more sensitive to their environment.
Now, if you go back to what I said about the tuning out, it's simply a defense. So the more
sensitive you are and the stress in the environment, the more you're going to feel the stress,
the more you're going to need to escape from it by tuning out. So you didn't inherit ADHD,
you inherited a sensitivity that makes it more likely under stressful circumstances
that you revert to tuning out when your brain is developing, which, by the way,
is an organ that develops physiologically under the impact of the emotional environment.
So if there's a lot of stress in a child's life, and what I'm saying is in this society
is that more and more parents are stressed, not because they don't love their kids,
not because they're not doing their way out most to provide for them, but because they're
more stressed to all kinds of social, political, economic reasons than if you look at inflation
in Britain, which is a high risk right now, more people are going to be stressed financially.
Financial stress on the parents translates into physiological stress in the children.
Both children may want to tune out because there's too much to be in the present.
Some of them will be diagnosed with ADHD. They didn't inherit anything in terms of a disease,
they're just reacting to the environment. So if we're diagnosing more and more kids these days,
I think it's because the parenting environment has become much more stressed.
And that's backed up in this book where you mentioned that study of 65,000 parents
and their children with ADHD, right? There's more trauma in their lives.
Yeah, so the children, they do a study with 65,000?
I forget, you're better than I am. It was 65,000, I read it three months ago.
Yeah, but many thousands of kids, yeah.
So because I found that to be really, really sort of supportive of what you just said,
where again, I'm saying this from memory, but a study of 65,000 children and their parents,
and they found that those parents who had more adverse traumatic events in their lives
ended up having a higher chance of having a child that had ADHD.
Well, look, if you look at the United States at least, poor kids and kids of so-called color
are much more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.
Interesting.
No, why would that be the case? Because they're living with so much more stress.
Men as well, right?
Men as well. Adults, you mean?
Men, yeah. So I've read that more men or boys are diagnosed.
Yeah, more men are diagnosed partly because in men, the symptom of hyperactivity seems to be there
more often. So when a kid is sitting in school and the cancer is still, that's obvious.
The teacher will notice it. The girl who's kind of dreamy and tunes out
kind of fades away at the back of the class. She doesn't create any problems.
So that's one of the reasons. But also, funny to say, but young boys, infant boys,
are more sensitive to environmental pressure than girls are for some strange reason.
So they're more likely to be affected by these factors.
Seeing a boy like that in the class, that's a fidgety that has a poor attention span,
bad response to stress. We medicate. What is the impact of that approach to treatment,
medicating super early?
I used to, when I worked as a physician, I would certainly prescribe medications sometimes.
It's a question of who's prescribing and what intention.
If I understand that the real problem in this child is not that there's anything intrinsically
wrong with the child, but that they were developed in a stressed environment,
and those stresses are still acting on them. And one of the stresses is the parents don't
understand the kids behaviors and they tend to react rather harshly. Then if I change,
if I can help the parent understand the sensitive nature of their child,
which also means that when positive changes occur in the environment,
the kid will be very responsible to that as well. If the parents can create a positive,
accepting, understanding atmosphere in the home and work on known stresses,
so they don't unconsciously pass them on to their kids, that kid will change very quickly.
And I say, well, if in the short term, the child wants the medication to function better,
and no child should be forced to take medication, and medication on never the final answer that
the very most there stop cap, there's no proof whatsoever that medications help anybody heal
from ADHD. They simply suppress symptoms, which may be helpful in the short term, but for God's
sakes, go to work on the long term development of that child. And what does that mean?
Create the conditions in which healthy development takes place. That child will do very, very well.
If you think the problem is a disease, they're just going to medicate away the symptoms of.
What about for adults? I'm thinking of my friend there. He's in his 30s and he got the
diagnosis of ADHD in his 30s. He's been given this medication, which he presumably has to
take for life. He's told me the medication has helped him focus. Has helped him focus.
You guys, yeah, it's been a game changer, Steve. Yeah, I've taken medication myself for ADHD,
and it helped me focus. It helped me write my first book. I didn't take it for this one.
As a matter of fact, more recently, when I was beginning to write the medication,
I thought maybe I would take a bit of stimulant like I used to. And just to see if it helps me
write the book better, all it did is give me side effects. My brain has changed. I don't need it
anymore. So I would say to your friend, if the medication is helping you right now,
and it's not causing you side effects, I got nothing against that. And you might want to
give it a break every weekend. If you don't, you might want to use it for when you're having to
work or having to concentrate, but it's up to you if it helps you function. Take it,
but go to work on the traumas and stresses driving your ADHD, going back to your childhood.
And I may say my book on ADHD scattered minds does outline some ways to do that.
You might find that you don't need the medication so much anymore or not at all. Perhaps
number one, number two, even if you do, your life will be so much fuller and so much more
less stressed if you deal with the underlying factors than if you simply mediate the symptom.
Is there, I always think in life, there's a cost for all these things we use to medic,
medicate and stimulate ourselves. And so I always, I always ask myself, like, there's
got to be a catch here. And even for coffee, I'm like, what's the catch? We can't just be all
up and positive. And with my friend, when he said, when he had the conversation with me about
being on this medication for life, my first thought is like, okay, what's the cost?
It's going to make you really focused and better at work. But what is the long term cost of?
I'd have to talk to your friend. Those are good questions to ask.
When I took medication, it made me a much more efficient workaholic.
You know, it did nothing for my workaholicism, just made me much better at it because I could
stay up later now and I was more focused. I could even more things done, you know. So
you got to deal with these other issues. Did you? I did. Did I deal with them? Yes, I have.
And there's so much more, like dealing with the trauma. Like I'm telling you, if your friend's
got ADHD, I can tell you he had to stress early for years and his parents were stressed.
His parents were stressed. So deal with that. Deal with what conditions are you creating now in
your life that create more stress for you? Are you taking care of your body? Are you exercising?
Are you eating well? Do you get out there in nature? Nature has a sort of harmony to it,
which actually calms the mind, you know. So are you doing all these things? If you're not,
all you're doing is medicating a symptom. If you are taking the medication specifically to
help you focus, but you're working on his other issues, you'll have a much full life and you
may find you don't need the medication after all. You came off the medication for your ADD?
Yeah. Because I'm just not that medically well versed. What's the difference between ADD and
ADHD? It's, you know, it's a kind of a confusion. ADHD simply means that the hyperactivity is present.
Okay. So you can have ADD without hyperactivity. Okay. So the actual, you know,
proper way to divide it is ADD. And in brackets, HD, so that indicating that the
hyperactivity may or may not be there. Got you. So you, you, you were on medication,
you did the work, you know, not on medication. Do you still have the symptoms of ADD?
To a certain degree, but not in a way that anyway, blights my life. Like one thing I can
really be sure that I'm going to go on a speaking trip, I'm going to lose something. I'm going to
lose my, my portable electrical tooth cleaner. In this case, I left my rain jacket and Budapest
when I came here on, you can take it for granted that my attention will just not notice something
that I haven't packed yet. That's okay. I'm going back to Budapest next week. So I get to get my
rain jacket back, but sometimes it's the cost of being me. So what, you know, so no, not in every
way, but that's not the point. Nobody's life has to be perfect. It just has to be a life that I
want to live and I can enjoy living that I have, you know, so who cares if sometimes I forget
something or I lose something or even if I'm listening to a symphony and I can't keep my
attention on it. Okay, so I can't. You talk about this some toxic society.
Do you think society is getting more toxic? And if so, why? What measure shall we use?
If we use the measure of a number of kids being medicated,
a number of adults having chronic illness, autoimmune disease, number of students,
university students being depressed, contemplating suicide, number of children in the United States
killing themselves, the number of people on medications of all kinds, the degree of safety
that people have in society, the ranker or piece that characterizes political discourse in this
world, the intolerable fact that eight people in the world I think own as much as the bottom half
as the bottom 3.5 billion. You know, if I look at all those things by those measures,
if we look at what's happening to the environment, if I look at the fact that the people who are
the worst polluters in the environment also happen to be the most successful people
by a certain measure of success. By any number of parameters, if I look at
racism still affects the lives of so many people and not just affects it in an emotional sense,
but actually physiologically, you know, then yeah, this is a toxic society and those measures
are getting worse, they're not getting better and inequality is getting worse here in the UK
and elsewhere. So yeah, I think it's getting more toxic. What's the antidote? What's the antidote?
Well, how about we go back to this word awareness, like people just have to get that this is how it
is. And in the last chapter, I don't lay out a political program, you know, I don't see that as
my role to do that. I have my own political ideas and preferences, but I don't want to impose them
on the reader. But I do say, first of all, we have to lose our illusions that this is that this
normality is actually healthy or natural. You have to just get cognizant that what we consider
to be normal is actually bad for us. Number one, number two, just if we introduced the concept
of trauma into healthcare, the average doctor again, strange to say, doesn't hear a single
lecture in their medical training about the impact of trauma on physical or mental health,
which is astonishing. Given that it was a British psychologist, Dr. Richard Bentall, who pointed
out not that many years ago, that the evidence linking what we call mental illness and childhood
adversity is about as strong as the evidence linking smoking and lung cancer. And the average
physician doesn't hear a word about that. It's astonishing. Education, teachers, if they understood
child development, brain development, the developmental factors that children need,
that I cite in this book. And if they understood how trauma affects kids' capacity to learn,
to pay attention, and to behave in functional ways, the Daily Telegraph here in London,
not that long ago was bemoaning the fact that kids aren't caned anymore in schools.
I mean, what they were moaning about is that we no longer traumatize kids quite as harshly as we
used to. That's all it does, caning. So if teachers understood that the behaviors on the part of
children are actually manifestations of the emotional dynamics of frustration and needs not
being met, and very often of trauma, that would change the educational system. If the legal system
understood it, that most people facing the criminal justice system are actually traumatized people,
they could actually be rehabilitated and healed if we understood that, instead of just exposing
them to harsh punishments, we actually treated them like human beings who may have done things that
are unacceptable. But that came from traumas they couldn't have helped, and that they can be helped
back to healthy functioning, as we know from lots of experience. Just that little trauma
information would change society. So that's what I can offer as a physician.
What about parents? What do they need to know?
Yeah, well, if parents actually understood, first of all, that the first three years are everything,
that if they get the template right in the first three years, they can hardly set a foot wrong
afterwards. But on the other hand, if we're not present for kids emotionally, if we don't understand
them, if we don't see them, if we don't attune to their emotional states, we're going to hurt them.
And if they understood what the needs of children are, when I mentioned some of them,
for play, for experience of all emotions, for unconditional loving attachment,
for the child being able to rest from having to work to make the relationship work. So the child
doesn't have to be good or nice or beautiful or successful. They just have to be. So we don't
impose conditions on our approval and acceptance on them. If parents just understood that,
and if they understood how important it is that they take care of their own emotional needs,
so that a child doesn't have to take responsibility, like perhaps you did for the parent's stresses.
If parents understood all that, and if society actually understood how important parenting was,
and it supported parents who needed the support to be there for their kids,
it wouldn't be financially costly. It would save us a lot of money, not to mention we'd have a lot
more happier kids who don't need to be on medications. So yeah. And lastly, schools.
Schools. Well, again, like I said about educators, if educators, well, here's the thing.
If you look at how does the human brain develop, I quote an article
from the Harvard Center on the Developing Child that appeared in a journal, Pediatrics,
Official Journal of the American Pediatric Academy in 2012, February. The article said
that the human brain develops through a complex process that begins before birth
and continues into adulthood. Okay. Now, that means, A, we take care of the emotional needs
of pregnant women. Number one. Number two, if it continues into adulthood, continues into adulthood,
then the job of the schools, if they understand it right, is not to teach kids what year the
battle of Austerlitz took place or the battle of Waterloo or algebra. Any of that stuff.
The most important job of the schools is to promote healthy brain development.
With a child who's with healthy brain development will actually be naturally curious.
They'll want to know about history. They'll be keen to absorb the skills of algebra. They'll
want to know how to use a computer and they'll want to know how to write properly. The kids will
want to do that spontaneously because mastery and learning, these are human hungers. They're human
needs. So in other words, the most important job of the schools is not to cram the kids full of
information, but to help them develop healthy brains. What does that require? Safety above all,
lack of pressure, healthy relationship with nurturing adults. And if the kids are not going
to spend their time with the adult, with the parents, which they can't in this society,
like they used to throughout human evolution, let them spend their time with adults who are
emotionally nurturing and emotionally penetrating the attentive to the child's needs. Now you're
going to have schools that are going to really teach kids something and where kids will want to
learn. And it's very simple. It doesn't take more training and it doesn't take more. Well,
it takes some training perhaps, but not more than what teachers are getting now. So that's
sort of a take in education. I was thinking there about the importance of doing certain
psychological tests on certain teachers, because if they are also passing on a generational cycle
of their own at a time when my brain is still being developed, they can have a huge impact
positively or negatively on my life in the same way that my parents could. Absolutely.
It's quite remarkable. Teachers don't know how much power they have because of the vulnerability of
the young brain. And well-meaning teachers will sometimes behave in ways that are really
hurtful to kids, just because they don't get it, not because they don't mean well. So I've had many
adults sit in my office, say with tears in their eyes, it was something a teacher said to them
three decades before. The class will continue and Johnny comes back to earth. This kind of
sarcastic little dig can undermine a child's dignity and sense of self so easily. So if teachers
just understood how powerful they are and how important they are in helping to promote healthy
brain development, I think their profession would take on a whole new meaning that would be much
more satisfying than it is right now. It's not the fault of individual teachers. We're talking about
a system that is toxic. Gabo, we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the previous
guest asks a question for the next guest. I didn't get to see it until I opened the book. So there's
a question written here for you. Before I ask you this question, I did have a question of my own,
which was you're in your 70s now. What are you still working on in terms of your own traumas?
Is there anything, even though you're in a later stage of your own life that you're still
sort of struggling with as it relates to that puppet master pulling on the strings and
that kind of analogy that we gave earlier? Yeah. It's a sense of peace when I'm not doing anything.
Just being the capacity just to be. That's something I'm still looking for. Not
looking for like, I was looking for a lost puppy, but I'm still searching myself for it.
And where exactly does that come from in your own diagnosis?
How about if I tell you when I find out? I mean, I can give you a textbook answer,
but it wouldn't be authentic. Thank you. So you don't know?
Entirely? I have some senses. I have some ideas. It really means being okay with my mind the way it
is and not needing it to be any different. That's what it would mean, which means if I'm sitting
there for five minutes, I don't have to reach for a cell phone to occupy my mind. In the midst of
this busy book tour and all the speaking I do, I don't do enough to take care of that quiet
little voice inside myself. I don't. I think it would take some attention.
I can't either, though. I can't sit for five minutes. I couldn't sit for five seconds without
grabbing my phone. It's weird. I noticed the other day that I was like going to the toilet,
and I had no intention of using my phone in the toilet, but I went to get my phone to go to the
toilet. You can't be alone with yourself. I can't be alone with myself. I can't,
sitting for 30 seconds, you know, my brain, is that because they've built these algorithms to
stimulate my dopamine? Or is it because there's something in me? I guess it goes back to a
point of addiction. Well, it's both. I mean, they certainly create algorithms to stimulate your
brain and get you hooked on that dopamine hit. They're sure for sure. They call that neural
marketing. Neural marketing. Can you get that? Neural marketing. They work on your brain to get,
you know, to get you addicted. But it also comes from an earlier discomfort with the self that predates
any cell phone use. It goes back to earliest childhood where it couldn't have been comfortable
to be just with yourself because of circumstances. Interesting. Yeah, because I've got friends that
don't have the same addiction with their cell phones that I do. They can take it or leave it.
They put it outside their bedroom when they go to bed charging in the kitchen. I have to
hold mine like my pillow. Yeah, exactly. Well, like your little safety pillow.
And what's the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning?
I grab it with one eye open and all that gunk in my eye. I'm like trying to just, you know.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, how have both of you and I work on not doing that so much?
Okay. I'll give you my number. You should discuss why I phone how we're getting on with this.
That's just another reason to use my phone. But next time I speak to you in person,
you can update me on how you're getting on with that. I am working on it. I'm working on it.
I think I've got to become more cognizant of the cost of that addiction.
Well, exactly. I know one of the costs is meaningful connections and presence with
and the cost to interpersonal relationships. But maybe I haven't had the cost
impact me enough yet, maybe. The question left for you,
but I don't know the signature, so I'll have to figure that out later, but is
what's your selfish dream?
I'm not sure how to sit with that question because I'm not trying to get out of it,
but I'm just kind of looking at my own reaction to it.
At this point, I don't have too many. What does it mean selfish, by the way?
Let me ask you that. What does that mean? Something that is for me at the expense of others?
I don't think I have any dreams like that left. I might have it. Not might have. I did have.
At some point. But if I have a dream for myself in that sense of self-enhancing dreams,
something that enhances my ego or something, well, if this book sold a billion copies,
that would be a nice selfish dream. But I don't know how else to answer that.
I do have dreams, but they're more about the state of the world that I'd like to see.
The world I'd like to see future generations inherit.
Selfless dreams.
Yeah. Well, I don't have to self-less because it certainly involves my own history and
certainly would make me feel better. So in that sense, it's selfish, you might say.
But they don't have to do with personal. I have enough. I've done enough and I have enough.
So I don't have anything lacking that I need to dream about.
All of our self-less dreams are also very much selfless, selfish in that regard as well.
They're going to help us.
They're selfish in a different sense. I mean, any dreams I have about a better world
certainly have the function of making me feel better, of maybe even
the stuff that happened to me or the stuff that happened to you.
It would mean a lot to me if they didn't happen to any more children.
So in the sense that it would mean a lot to me, you might say it's selfish.
But it's not purely about me. It's about something larger.
I'm not trying to paint myself as some kind of an altruistic saint.
I'm just saying that would make me feel better.
If I really knew that kids in Gaza didn't have to face any more bombings,
if kids in Israel didn't have to face any more danger of terrorist attacks,
if not that I see inequality there, but I'd like that for both of them.
If kids in Ukraine didn't have to live under the threat of missiles falling,
if people in Russia didn't have to live with the fear of perhaps a nuclear conflict
or the young men being conscripted into a war, if kids in Britain didn't have to live in poverty,
would not make you feel better. So to the extent that it makes us feel better,
you might say it's selfish, but is it?
Gabel, thank you.
Well, my pleasure. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much for writing such an important book.
I think my only wish is that I discovered this book sooner,
because I think so many of my, I think it would have liberated, that's a good word,
liberated me from a series of things that would have helped me to live a much better life
and to understand myself. That's the point of awareness that we talked about.
I know that your advanced age is over, isn't it?
I think we all want the answers even sooner, because we reflect on some of the consequences
or the mistakes that we made. Not that I'm imprisoned by any of those, but it's so wonderful
that this book now exists. You're a name that I started to be peppered with by my audience
over and over again, specifically in the last 12 months, people, really, really young people
were messaging me and asking me to have a conversation with you about the topics we've
talked about today, things like ADHD and their trauma and so much. And, you know,
I sit here every day talking to a lot of people on this podcast. And I think my understanding
of trauma has forever been redefined by both this conversation today, but also by your book.
And I'm so thankful to you because I think that will help me speak on the topic with more accuracy
and therefore hopefully help other people understand their own trauma in a more meaningful way.
It's just such an important book. Well, thank you so much. Thank you so much for giving me the
platform to talk about my work and just the opportunity to meet you. Thanks a lot.
And it's written in such an accessible way, which is so important because that means it
can reach even more people. Thank you so much. Okay, thank you.
