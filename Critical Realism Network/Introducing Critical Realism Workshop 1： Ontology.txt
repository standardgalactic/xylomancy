Okay, brilliant. Shall we make a start then? I think most people have joined now, so welcome everybody to the first session of the introduction to critical realism webinars.
Today we're talking about ontology, and this is the first of six and the following sessions will engage with epistemology methodology approaches to analysis, key concepts and critical realism as a framework so
make sure you do join the other sessions as well. So just a few very brief bits of housekeeping. So firstly, please use the Q&A tool during the webinar. So if you have any immediate technical issues or want to make a comment, use the chat box.
But any questions that you have for us, please put them in the Q&A section. And if you do that throughout the session, we'll try and pick those up and make sure that we're answering all the questions. You can also comment on questions in there and vote the ones that you really want to hear answered.
Okay, so I think it'll be good to start with some introduction. So I'll introduce myself. First of all, I'm Jack Newman from the University of Surrey.
My broader research interests are around British politics, social security policy, local government.
Although my interest in critical realism goes back about eight or nine years to when I was doing my master's degree, and coming from a political science background, I came across critical realism through the structure agency debate, and I'm trying to find a suitable
argument or solution to this problem of structure and agency. So that's my background and how I came to critical realism. Caroline, John, to introduce yourself to.
Yes. So I'm Caroline Kuhn and I work at the University of Paspa as a lecturer there in the School of Education, and I'm very interested in the combination of, I would say, technology education from a sociological perspective, I would say.
And so I came to critical realism in a, in a later stage in my PhD where I, when I started to make sense of the data, I just couldn't with what I had at hand, it wasn't possible for me and I was really kind of struggling and I realized I need something to help me
here, some theoretical kind of. And so I came across in a conversation with someone at the University of Cape Town that they were using critical realism in when they were exploring open educational resources.
And once I started to read and read and read, it was quite difficult at the very beginning.
But I realized that was really what I needed to make sense of what I was seeing in the data, particularly things that weren't there present that weren't that they weren't showing but they were there.
And yeah, so I started to study it by myself because my supervisor didn't know anything about it, but he trusted me.
And it's a long journey into critical realism, and I think it is incredibly worthwhile our time. And so that's how I came into it. Yes, that's me.
Brilliant. I'll just say a couple more things and then we'll hopefully get some introductions from from you guys the audience. And so yeah just to just to be clear, if you have any technical issues or want to make comments or introduce
any questions, please use the chat function. If you have any questions, please use the Q&A button, or you can raise your hand as well. And during the discussion section.
So here's how today's going to run. We've got three parts to the webinar. Part one, we'll ask what is ontology.
And I know that this you many of you will know what ontology is but we're trying to make sure we kind of keep everyone with us and it's worth going back to I think for those who do not know already.
And then we'll talk about what a critical realist approach to ontology is. And then we'll conclude in the third part by looking at the implications of a critical realist ontology.
And hopefully we'll be taking questions throughout and we'll have some discussion and we'll leave some extra time for discussion at the end, and we're due to finish in about an hour and a half time.
Okay, yeah, I'll come back to you Caroline.
I was just wanting to ask the audience if anyone is keen to just introduce themselves, what do you do, do you study, do you work and in a way what brought you into critical realism.
We're a lot of people, it means we can't, not everyone can take the mic, but it would be lovely to hear from some of you, so that we have an idea of who is in the room and the rest can write it in the chat which I see is already happening.
There are lots of introductions in the chat so anyone who would like to take the mic that would be great.
Yeah, that is, is what we would like to happen.
I'm relatively new to the field, I mean, years ago, when I probably doing my masters and I was sort of this thing called the internet had just been discovered and I was my supervisor was very much into sort of delusional guitaries sort of bodies without organs.
I'm not a bit kind of radical so I kind of moved from that more to sort of constructivist view my field is education, particularly health professional education, but very, so it felt quite limited by what constructivist approaches to educational and particularly
informational settings, you know, you know, trying to get sort of systemic change in the health professionals education sector.
that you know the lack of sort of you know sort of theories or sort of big models and I guess then
through a colleague I was sort of introduced to critical realism it seemed to be a sort of
really fit good fit it seemed to be not rejecting some of the sort of the
positivistic post-positivist sort of positions but critical of them and seeing them in a very
different way and yet not seeing everything is sort of socially constructed there are
noble things out there but we've just got fallible knowledge so it just kind of fitted for me and I
guess the work that I've been doing at the moment with colleagues is more at that kind of the first
you know the first sort of possibility of naturalism kind of approach with this stratified
ontology I was thinking I was got some more to the you know meta-reality it was just getting
further and further away from a comfort zone although the recent IACR that Frederick Van der
Berg was talking about you know how can you not want that project of emancipation a kind of
sort of utopia in the air and so shouldn't we consider the whole body together and that's
to the moment. Thank you Chris that's great and I would say I mean Deleuze and Guattari is so
different than critical realism so it's just really fascinating how you know how theory really in
philosophy illuminates from different standpoints and different people from very different angles
so great and it's thank you Chris anyone else well I see a lot of activity in the chat so great
shall we then um Jack? David has his hand up yeah thank you I didn't see it
David go ahead oh is that uh was that for me yeah um yeah so I'm David Palmer I'm I'm an
anthropologist at the University of Hong Kong um and I do a lot of work in relation to the
anthropology of religion in China and Asia and um I also um my work also goes into the sociology
of religion and I know Phil Gorski and he's been kind of promoting critical realism for the past
many years and I'm actually in a sense from a post-colonial perspective I'm quite interested
in looking at how can we seriously take take different ontologies seriously and what are the
ontological foundations of sociological theory and sociological methodology so I'm I'm I think
it's extremely important to really have a a deep awareness and critical thinking about the ontological
assumptions of our own discipline and the implications of that and now moving directly into
a project that I'm working on now I'm actually working on a book and a course actually that I'm
going to be teaching just in a couple of hours um on science and religion which I'm co-teaching with
an experimental physicist who is a Christian um so we we take uh and I take more of the Asian
like Taoist kind of perspective so we're really um in trying to construct a framework for rethinking
and reframing the relationship between science and religion um we've come across a lot of concepts
that are very that are very uh seem to resonate a lot with critical realism so I would like to
really get a more systematic understanding of this approach thank you David that's that's great
thank you so interesting yes Jack was saying so many you know so different points of view
and different needs as well I think that is fascinating thank you so much um I can't see
hands up or anything um and and also conscious of the time I I shall um we shall start our
presentation and and you know we're welcoming the chat because we read it then afterwards and um
yeah thank you so much I'm reading here Hasuki Keinde so interesting thank you um shall we start
then Jack I um so Jack will go with the first part about what is ontology in general terms
and um I'll follow then um what is the critical realist understanding of this concept of ontology
and then some um practical and physical three philosophical implications brilliant thanks Caroline
yes so um let's get started with the question of what is ontology and I'm sure some of you have
an idea some of you might and think you have a good idea and so let's just go through the basics
of what this what ontology means um and I want to start out with this um definition that you
always see in the textbooks here so ontology is the philosophy of being and existence now I remember
reading this in the textbooks back when I was a master's student and not really having a clue
what this meant I think quite often it's a useful definition if you already know about ontology but
not very good as an introduction so I just want to unpack this a little bit so when we talk about
philosophy in this sense um what what we're thinking about so we're thinking about assumptions
that's it that is beliefs that people hold um they might not even realize they hold these beliefs
um we're talking about controversies so areas of disagreement or debate um and we're talking
about theories so systems of thought they might be approaches to social science or they might be
religions perhaps so ontology is a is a set of assumptions controversies and theories what are
they about moving to the right hand side of the slide there we're thinking about being and existence
so what do we mean by being an existence in this context so when we're thinking about being we could
think about the essence experience or state of consciousness of living things what it is to be
a person in the world or perhaps what it is to be an animal or non-person in the world
and then much more broadly than this and perhaps more importantly to ontology is also about
existence in general everything that is in some way real beyond our perception of it
so yes it's about our experience in the world it's also about how the world actually is
um outside of our experience so yeah when we're talking about um ontology we're thinking about
the assumptions controversies and theories that are about um reality in general I suppose
okay so I want to introduce a couple of skeptical challenges just to get us start thinking about
ontology I pulled out a couple of quotes from Descartes here who is um kind of one of the key
um philosophers of western philosophy of modern western philosophy and he argues in his or
writes in his meditations and there is the fact that I'm sitting here seated by the fire
attired in a dressing gown so that's what that's what he was when he was writing his meditations
but and here's where the challenge comes in how often has it happened to me that in the night
I dreamt that I found myself in this particular place that I was dressed and seated near the fire
whilst in reality I was lying undressed in bed so Descartes raises the problem of how we know that
we're awake and not dreaming and if you go to menti.com there and enter the code some of you
have done so already if so go on to the next slide and it'd be great if you could answer the poll
that's on there just to have a think about this yes and I'm here waiting for your answers to just
see what you think if you're dreaming or if you're not dreaming or if you're if you're not sure about
what's happening because the the interesting thing here is to to kind of challenge our our
thinking about whether our day-to-day perception of reality is really giving us a true window or a
true insight into how the world really is around us I'll just give you a moment to have a think about
that one yes I'm here sorry Jack what was the particular question again so if you go to menti.com
there and enter that code it should give you a question for you to answer the current question is
are you a hundred percent sure you're not dreaming right now there we go okay so I have
six people that are not dreaming seven eight and then I have two people that are not really sure
and two people that are dreaming so we have 12 now that are not dreaming and we're still have
two that no three now that they are dreaming yes i'm 13 that 14 that are not dreaming three that are
not sure so I think the tendency is to think that you're not dreaming okay so you guys have a fairly
a firm out certainty that your perceptions are giving you a true indication of reality perhaps
okay let's let's take another another similar question then just to get us to think about
this this question of our immediate perception of the world around us so I don't know whether
anyone's seen the film The Matrix I recommend it if not it's a good film but I just want to
introduce a premise here and in the top picture there this chap neo is living in living in the
world day to day and he gets met by this person morpheus who who explains to him that actually
he's not living in the world he's really laid in one of these tanks that you can see in the bottom
picture and a simulation of reality is being pumped into his mind so that's the kind of premise of
the film there so morpheus says have you ever had a dream neo that seems you seem so sure it was real
if we're unable to wake up from that dream how would you tell the difference between the dream
world and the real world now I'm not trying to again you can go to menti me to and answer the
question there I'm not trying to convince you that we're all living in a simulation far from it
I'm just trying to open the prospect that our day to day perceptions don't give us a kind of clear
picture on what reality is really like and reality may be other than our perception of it
on a day to day basis and chris is saying in the chat I'm not dreaming that I cannot connect to the
menti major pool sorry chris yeah it not always works I have it in front of me it is active
and I'm sorry if it doesn't work it's just that sometimes happens but I like your answer
it's a good answer I also quite like maritio's answer that in his in dreams I don't pay bills
and that's how I know yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I'm here I'm keen to see if it's possible to live
one is saying I'm no it's not possible to live in a simulation and another one says yes it is
and then we have two people but three people that don't think four that we were living in
a five that we're living in a simulation five people and and six people and then we have three
that that yes we can live in a simulation so it's eight nine and three so nine are more no we can't
um and three that yes and then 10 no um so yeah 11 um 12 it's a tendency again here isn't it but um
yeah that people don't think it's possible that we're living in a simulation 13 and three has
stayed stable in the yes answer so yeah it's um it's interesting really to just think about this I
would say four say yes um yeah so a lot more a lot more certainty in this group than yesterday's
group yesterday's group were all very skeptical and worried that they were dreaming and worried that
they might be living in a simulation you guys are a lot more sure of your place in reality okay so
thanks for taking part in that and I think it's useful to start thinking about these ontological
questions but I just want to distinguish between two sets of questions here between ontology on
the one hand and epistemology on the other hand epistemologies will be covered in next week's session
actually so when we're thinking about ontology in relation to to many of the issues we've just
been discussing we're thinking about questions is there a reality beyond our experience of the world
and then what is the nature of that reality is it for example a simulation or or not could be
one such question and and what is the difference between reality and experience anyway even is
there a difference whereas epistemology is very much more looking at questions of knowledge
what counts as knowledge how is it that we can come to know anything and and can we be certain of
anything and what do we mean by truth these are questions of epistemology that will be
tackled next week now some approaches kind of reject the distinction between these or
try and blur the distinction critical realism tries to to look at the two separately
and this week we'll be focusing on ontology so I've got one more problem or question for you
which is about friendship the idea of friendship now do you think that friendship is just a way
of describing the thoughts and actions of two individuals or is a friendship between excuse me
two people also a real thing in its own right so just to rephrase that I'll say it again
is friendship just a word we use just as shorthand to describe what two individual people are doing
and or do you think that friendship is a real thing in the world is it some object or real
thing so I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts about this either put your responses in
the in the chat box or raise your hand perhaps and we can get one or two people responding on
the microphone so yeah do share some thoughts on this while we wait here I just wanted to take
something that I find quite interesting in the chat those critical realism offer the red pill
so we can see what is really happening behind the simulation and I just why do I pick this
because this is an interesting question that you will be kind of fleshing out throughout the six
sessions and I think today maybe it points to that I don't have the answer but it's interesting and
I hope that you can find some some pointers I think in in these six sessions
yeah so here we have it's ideationally real I think friendship is real but it is bound in time
friendship is not an object but it's real so it's an entity yes okay or a real yeah the effect of
friendship are real yeah there we have the effects um friendship is like wetting your pants everyone
can see it but only you know it's real warmth that's a good way of describing it um I think friendship
is real and has many layers um yes social cultural and personal layers yes it's about the layers
that's that's a good point it appears and disappears but when it's there it's certainly there
um yeah great thank you so many answers um yeah quite quite a lot of people who are giving critical
realist answers as well and I just want to to clarify what that means just with one final
slide here um from a critical realist perspective how do we know something is real so a kind of
traditional um criteria that Baskar points out is the perceptual criteria for reality
so if the phenomenon say friendship can be perceived then it is real but Baskar argues that that's not
enough um that's not enough to to decide whether something is real or not because there are some
things we we perhaps can't perceive but still want to insist they're real so there's also the causal
criteria for reality and I think some people were getting at this in the chat box for something to
be real it needs to be causally efficacious um that means it needs to be able to cause an effect
in the world it needs to create an outcome um so it may not be um a cause that is triggered so it
may not be a cause actually has an outcome but it could be a cause as the potential to have an outcome
so this causal criteria for reality is one we could apply for friendship as somebody said there
in the chat box so a friendship has effects in the world and this could be the basis of which
we argue that is real okay that's that's me done for this section on what is ontology and I'll just
give you guys to a moment to ask some questions if you want using the Q&A feature or to raise your
hand and come in on the microphone if you have any questions or want to to share any thoughts
at this point and then in a moment we'll start the next session the next section
any questions
there's one hand up from Mauricio okay yeah Mauricio
uh hi uh I think one interesting question would be like who cares or why care about
the reality of reality from a critical realist perspective thank you okay um
do you have any thoughts on that before we we answer uh yes in I'm come from sociologists
discipline so to me the fact that something is real in that critical realist viewpoint
means that it is in a way oppressive it's something that happens whether you want it or not like paying
bills and therefore it is important because things that are real are the things that can be analyzed
can be described and so on and I think it is important to distinguish between what is real
and what is not and to in order to give enough um I think credence but also weight but also
uh analytical importance to to things that are real beyond the objective objectively
perceptive and so on so for me that's uh I study how a constitution was made so to me
looking at that mechanism is important because it's a real mechanism that has real effects
on the social structure for example okay brilliant yeah I think I think you've answered the question
very well I'll just add one other thought which is thinking about a kind of a discipline a social
science discipline and going about establishing the theories and deciding what to research there
and I think when we're working out what isn't isn't real it's very important for deciding what
the main concepts are going to be for the discipline what are we going to investigate
what aspects of the world are we going to ask about or focus on and so I think that would be
another aspect that builds on on your thoughts there okay brilliant Caroline any of the thoughts
or any of the questions yeah I there are two things here I want to say that um one of the
things that critical realism really um advocates for is emancipation and and and and to be honest I
think what it really offers us is a theory of social change I mean I'm I'm I'm simplifying this um
not only it's a philosophy of science but I think it is really geared to to to to be able to to to
intervene in the cogs of the machinery of society and I think yes it is it is important to to ask
the question you know who cares and why should we care and and and there is where critical realism
offers us um tools and ways of thinking that we can then enact some change um yeah I there is an
interesting question here about friendship and structures if if it is a structure although it's
only between two people I mean can we say friendship is a social structure even only
between two people and that's an interesting question um Jack I'm not sure if you have any
thoughts around this um is this really very nuanced things that that makes us be confused at
moments is it a structure because it's only between two people is one individual a structure how is
that I think there are very differing um or my reviews that there are very differing understandings
of the word structure in the literature so you always have to be careful when you're reading
the word in a social sociologist or even a critical realist um so I I think Popora who
someone mentioned earlier gives one of the best critical realist understandings of
social structure and he talks about relational structures and between kind of social positions
in society Tony Lawson is another one that gives a good understanding of structure here
so I would say that a friendship is part of the social structure is part of relational
social structures whether we say it's a structure in itself um I think I don't know I think that
depends on on how you're using the word really but um I would certainly say that friendships are part
of the social structure relations between between people positioned people and I think it will also
when you do your research and if you are researching friendship in particular you will then be reading
different definitions and you will see what suits your investigation as well so I think that that is
something that is important um so yeah it's fascinating so many um there are other questions
in the chat um there is one which I think might be interesting about the difference between ontology
and metaphysics um I would say um this is a broad question that um it might take more time
than what we have to clarify um if there is any I don't know um short answer there Jack I'm not
sure I think it's a really broad and deep question um yeah and maybe just just one quick thought on
the difference there would be that um ontology tends to be concerned with the category categories of
things that are real so what are the parts of the world that we define as real and how do we
kind of organize those categories whereas metaphysics as a whole um is a is kind of tends to be thought
of as a larger um concern that includes those kind of skeptical questions I was asking at the start
and is a broader question about the kind of underlying natures and structures of the universe
although there are clearly overlaps between the two um significant overlaps between the two
that's one way of thinking about the difference perhaps yeah um okay so I I believe um and again
aware of the time and conscious of the time um that we will continue with our second part um which
will be more focused on the critical realist ontology and what what is it um in critical realism
um that is is is defining of realities of what is real and so if you go to the next slide please
Jack um yeah so to begin with we have always these two worlds the natural world and the
social world and um Pascal already in his critical naturalism says that these two worlds are not
apart and he didn't want to make kind of a sharp difference nevertheless he said we can't reduce one
to the other in so far that is critical so the social world can't be reduced to the natural world
and it has its properties and it it is we have to study it as as an as a as an something that
really emerges as part of the natural world and so one of the things I think here that I I um you
can see um underneath this pictures is that you in the natural world would do experimentation
so you have a closure really you your experiment is like a closure of that natural world and then
you want to predict um and then find these causal laws whereas in the social world you would be
exploring um and you can't do any closure because it is an open system and we're going to go into
into that open system definition um in the next slide and but what you can do really is explain
but you can't predict I think this is one of the key things in in in critical realism
and if we go to the next slide Jack please um so here I would say are these kind of three main
tenets of how social reality is defined in critical realism and it's really stratified
thus it's deep so we don't have a flat ontology which is only what we can see it's an open and
complex system so stratified and we I'm going to I'm going to explain these three things in detail
but just um stratified means that we have levels of reality an open system means that this social
world is really multi-determined so we have multiple causalities and we don't know accurately
these causes which counter the other which reinforce others which cancel others so it's
really this kind of very multi-determined space and that's why it's an open system
and emergence um is the property that emerges from systems that are complex and so in in I would
say and please this is a simplification yeah um there is a lot of explanation um deeper and so
that's the reading that you do but this is just kind of to pinpoint main things so you can't really
rely on on empirical data if you want to answer your research question from a critical realist
perspective because the world is much more than than what we can see perceive and and you know
what catches the eye and the next one um Jack please and here this um this metaphor of the iceberg I
think not me many think that it's a very good metaphor to explain this stratified or stratification
of reality and and although I'm going to start from the bottom up because I think in the in this
kind of the iceberg really tells us that if an iceberg is to stand there for million and millions
of years it's because it has a strong um mass underneath the water and it gives its solidity
and I think that's a really good thing to think about when we are investigating um social reality
under a critical realist perspective so these generative mechanisms which are those um that
make things happen in the world they live underneath of what we can see they're really invisible most
of the times at first sight I'm in here um then what happens is that these generative mechanism
interact with each other and then events happen but these events not necessarily can be observed
all the time so they live also underneath the water but they happen although we can't see them
when these generative mechanisms interact with each other and then what happens is at the empirical
level are these events that we really can observe but this is only just the 10 of that reality that
we're investigating so again I think the main takeaway here is don't trust what you can see
and just go deeper yeah the next one please and so this is really again just kind of putting
together these ideas of we start with the empirical level because yes it's what we can see
it's what we talk with our participants is what we find out about the reality we are interested in
but this only opens the door through then using theory that allows you then to go to this deeper
level where the structures and this generative power or mechanism are I would say hidden most
of the times and that's why emancipation I think for me at least is something that we really thrive
for when we use critical realism what is that invisible thing that is and someone said oppressive
yes these structures normally are oppressive so how can we really see them the next one please Jack
and and the open system that I was mentioning before is I think I don't have to explain that
much but what it really means is that the social world is a causal network of interacting forces
that counteract each other reinforce each other cancel sometimes so it's very difficult to really
say something in a predictive manner so A will if A is here B will happen it's not necessarily the
case and so you can't really make any closure you have to be always aware that you can only say
so much about social reality the next one please Jack and and what this really brings us to think
about that we are not working with causal laws we're really doing multiple causality that's
what we're looking for are these multiple causes that are responsible for the event that we are
investigating and human beings are themselves open systems and I was thinking about this when
you ask about the the question of structure and friendship so we are open systems and we're capable
of communication creativity and resistance this means that there is always the possibility of
something new happening and this I think is an evidence that we really can't predict because
there is always something new happening there is always some creation that we have not expected
or that is not we couldn't really predict for that the next one please Jack and the phenomenon of
emergence I think is quite interesting because it refers to the properties that arise when
different parts constitute a whole and the flock of birds is an example that I have
used to illustrate this because I think it really makes the case of how when when birds are together
things arise so an emergent entity is constituted by the parts how are how they are arranged in
relation to one another and they unique properties the whole holds due to the arrangement of the
parts of what we can see here there I would say three important things the parts the arrangement of
these parts how are they arranged and then they form this whole and what is this whole and if we
go to the next slide there is a more precise explanation of this which is it's really this is
from National Geographic a study about flock of birds and what I want to take from this example
is that so I'm going to read the left hand side while it sounds like waves spread best in bigger
flocks the waves transmitting information about direction spread best in smaller flocks so here
we can see how the size of the flock matters for the effect or the property that is going to emerge
namely how they change direction when they do their emigration or also sometimes when they
arrive to a particular space so smaller flocks tend to have a more rigid behavior if you wish
because the waves travel more quickly so what I want to stress here is that the way in which
these birds are arranged is there a big flock is it a small flock really determines the effect
of the transmission of the information about the direction and I think that is key although this is
in the natural world but Pascal said they're not different they're you know they're not they are
in a way different but they are as well together so the next slide please
and the same thing happens here with fish shores it is exactly the same how they behave together
is completely different than what they do by themselves and the next one please Jack
what is really the aim of social science and offsets researcher is to discover these emergent
properties so the entities the agents the structure and their emergent generative power this is really
or the mechanism what social science is about all of this is within a critical realist perspective
and this in society if you go to the next slide Jack what it allows us really to see
here and I'm not going to read all of that I'm conscious about the time I'm going to just go to
the last bit a context where the resources are allocated on evenly will have different effects
on the individuals that operate within it and here we see the whole is the society how the parts
which in this case are the resources are allocated how these are arranged in a society have effects
and they have different effects if you think about Latin America I'm going to talk about
Venezuela particularly my experience to not generalize resources are incredibly unevenly
allocated now how society lives there is incredibly different than if we think about Norway
or England although I know things are changing but nevertheless the resources are allocated in
a different way than in Venezuela and we see how society and its individuals have completely
different effects in how they live and then that does as well as we are you know that then brings
to different and different consequences and so I think with this I think that that if you
go to the next slide I think this is that the yeah that the so what I believe is important
here is that we look at these three things so how can we go to these deeper layers of society
or social reality sorry how we should not stay in the empirical how we always need to be
conscious that what we are investigating is an open system and in every open system
it's we have this complexity when things just yeah come together and in the coming together
and here is I think the social structures as Toni Lawson defines is the this is really about
the positions of these parts so I think here yeah those are the three things that we should kind of
take into account when we investigate and these generative powers are really the object of analysis
what are they and what are they doing and I yeah if you have any questions I think this is
a good time to just break a bit the talking and any question if someone would like to take the
mic I think there are some questions yeah so there's there's a few questions that have
that I've dug out of the chat so if you do have questions please pop them in the
the Q&A section it just makes them a bit easier for us to find an answer especially when there's
a few coming in at once but just I want to go back to a few that came out of the chat from
earlier on and so we have one from Stephen with the that I think builds on the discussion of
friendship saying wouldn't this imply that ideas are as real as objects and I think that's a really
interesting question and I would I would personally say yes I mean it depends what you mean by
as real as something but just just to kind of just define and back the answer up and if you think
about the human individual and argue that the you or I as an individual person is real then we
could say that actually we're just made up of smaller parts as Caroline has just been saying and
that those are real and that those are made up of smaller parts and those are real so unless
we believe that there's some bottom layer of reality from which that is the only thing that's
real if we want to claim that we as people and other objects we see around us are real and I
think it makes just as much sense to say that ideas and social structures that emerge from us
are real objects and one final thought on this building on the causal criteria for reality is
that critical realists talk about reasons being causes and the way that the reasons we do things
the justifications for things the ideas we have about things can be causes so hopefully that answers
the question but do come back in the chat or by raising a hand if you if you want to
Caroline were there were there other questions I have a couple more here but I don't know if
if you have any at your side I'm just looking at the Q&A but I think we'll leave them to the end
is that right okay yeah and Daniel has a hand raised Daniel did you want to come in I just
would be interested I know that Baskar Baskar is making a difference between a transitive
and intransitive dimension would not that will be an important concept to discuss friendship
okay just want to elaborate on that a little bit just to clarify
sorry I didn't understand what do you mean yeah could you could you just say a little bit more
just to be clear on on why that you think that relates to friendship um yeah right I'm just
okay I'm not I'm not totally sure but I would say that that Baskar would say that in a friendship
has as I as I wrote wrote in the in the chat that there are different layers of friendship
and and perhaps regarding a personal friendship I have with somebody there is a that's something
that can change quite quickly but the the concept of friendship what we do think of of friendship
is something we have in our culture and that's not that easy to change our ideas and I think
if I understand Baskar right he would even say that behind the concept and our cultural ideas
about friendship there is something deeper in reality and a lethic level where friendship is real
and does not change would you agree okay yeah no I think that's yeah I think I would agree that's
that's really interesting so we have the transitive dimension being the dimension of knowledge and
knowing and the the tools of understanding so to speak the way in which we understand and
explain the world and the intransitive being the world itself the thing we're studying and looking
at so I'm really just repeating your answer back to you here Daniel but just for clarity for some
of those who are listening and so when we we're talking about the transitive we're thinking about
yeah how we see friendship as a society perhaps how we see friendship as sociologists maybe
as well and but then there is something real going on as well underneath there there are
causal mechanisms that mean that a friendship between two people can have effects in the world
it's real regardless of whether other people acknowledge it or notice it or study it or not
so I think that's the idea of the distinction there and hopefully that's answered the question
please do come back if not Caroline is there anything else to to pick up on no well I think
that if it has effects this is one thing where we then need to say okay wait let me go deeper here
let me think about this I think this is really the the kind of first thing where you say okay this
has effects then and that's the criteria that we used in our last slide to when something is real
and when it's causally efficacious so I think that is really something to think about but
yeah brilliant oh even um yeah Daniel was saying it right um we've got quite a few of the questions
here should we take these or should we take the next section and come back to them all at the end
um I suggest um yeah we don't have that much to go so we could um take the next section
and then we start with our Q&A and in our last half an hour I would say that would be great
okay that's it that's a good idea so we don't have yeah we only have a couple of slides left each
so we'll we'll say this and then we'll open a bit more space for others to come in and to answer
some of these other questions that are in the chat and Q&A brilliant okay so thinking about
the implications of a critical realist ontology I just want to quickly look at a few philosophical
implications there are perhaps a lot more than I've than I've summarised on this slide here
um but just to raise a few so firstly one implication is that there is a reality beyond
our experience of it and so that I think that's um I suppose might be obvious to some people but
is an important point to make um when we're conducting social science and to be aware of
that there is a reality beyond our experience perhaps more controversially
the the implication of critical realism is that there's a reality beyond actual events
so there are potential causes that could have been triggered or could have happened that didn't
and we can think about these um as being part of the real um these causal mechanisms or called
properties of entities and there's this point that reality is not necessarily how it appears
to us which raises that that problem about whether we can be sure um about the um the world around
us and about reality which gives us that fallibility that the although we can generate
knowledge on the basis of assumptions we find compelling we can't be a hundred percent sure
we might always be wrong so and then finally I just want to go to these bullet points at the
bottom of the slide and and highlight that when we're conducting research um we need to consider
both causality and meaning so traditionally positivists um have focused on causality and
interpretivists have focused on understanding meaning critical realism calls for us to to do
both to try and explain society and explain causality and to understand meaning as well
we need to focus on both structures and agents so both the social context in which people live
and their unique kind of creative powers as individual agents to to make change in the world
we need to understand relations between people so those friendships we were talking about but
maybe also those or maybe more importantly those economic relationships like landlord and tenant
for example or um employer and employee um but then we also need to understand and think about
relations between ideas and the way in which two ideas might contradict one another and this might
have um causal consequences in the world archer talks a lot about this in her theory on culture
and uses examples from religion where contradictions um arise in the bible and that has a causal
impact on how society develops and then finally we need to think about both the natural and social
um so um as caroline has said critical realism insists that um that we need a kind of general
philosophy for understanding both and although the social world is very different in lots of ways
we need to be aware of both and when we're studying society or our various disciplines
in social science we need to be aware of um our bodies and the physical world around us
as well as the kind of ideas and discussion and language and discourse etc okay and so those are
just some a quick run through some philosophical implications hand over to caroline for the
more practical implications yes and um thank you jack i i i want to again insist that these
implications um particularly the practical ones are um going to be kind of unfolding along the
seminars so i do encourage you to go to all of them because i'm just kind of you know i'm even
touching the ice the tip of the iceberg um because the the there are epistemological
implications which are going to be addressed in the second seminar one thing that in my experience
i i i i i have experienced myself is very important is the critical realism so that
philosophy of science has an immediate implication in my research design or in our research design
what is the methodology which are the methods i'm going to use to collect which data is it enough
does it allow me to go deeper or does it open the door to then go deeper um and i think that
is one of the key things that that um yeah one one one one needs to be aware if i'm if i'm using
this okay what are the implications for my methodology for my design of my investigation
and it's always important to ask what is the nature of the object that we are investigating what is
it made of what are the constituent parts was it what you know what what are these how are they
what i think um jack was saying these kind of basic concepts which are they i need to really
be very aware that that is very very important um and um if you read i think someone made that
comment in the chat at the beginning the guide that tom fryer did which is really an amazing work
that also i think signals at least for me a deep understanding and that's why he's able to do the
comics of it because it's a deep understanding that has been really put to and brought to another
level so you don't go looking for something that doesn't exist and so you don't ignore the full
reality of the world and if you set up off with a bad theory of ontology um you really are risking
that you'll end up with a math project or yeah or just um yeah it can go really wrong i have to say
if if our ontology is not well determined and defined and if we have this this kind of yeah
this position that we are clear about and and i think in this this seminar of this morning
we have very experienced people with with not only phd student but people that are um more
experienced nevertheless i would like to just um make a comment um i arrived quite late to critical
realism and i came also from a very practical space i was a math teacher which i'm i'm still
but i worked a lot in this kind of teaching environment with a more pragmatic approach to
what i was doing and when i confronted myself with doing a phd and um thinking about ontology
and epistemology i would say i i i think i didn't took i didn't take it that seriously at the time
because i was ignorant really um and and i changed at a later stage but i took a year
to understand what is this ontology really about and once i have it clear then i could
do all the rest and so i just want to say that yes it is important to have a clear ontological
stance and being aware of what are these implications and and i think with this we we've
come to an end um and and we yeah and we go to our q and a i think it's it's great with um
with our time yeah it's it's it's and we have some questions here in the q and a so um
yeah any questions i think from this or shall we just and yeah someone was asking about a
reference and i just said they are here in these slides um and we're gonna put the link to the
slides in the critical realist network site um at the end of today
so yeah uh there's so much going on in the chat
sorry i was just trying to find my unmute button there yeah just before we um go to the q and a
i think we've picked up everything in the chat if you have if you've asked questions in the chat
and we've not touched on them please pop them into the q and a and we'll make sure we get to all
those there i just want to pick up on one other um that was asked by christopher which is whether
objects have agency um and this um this depends on how we use the word object and i just want to
say that you will find the word objects and and objective used in so many different ways
in the literature about ontology and epistemology so be very wary when you see that word and try
and read around it to understand what the author is saying um in my own kind of understanding
i would say that yes objects can have agency because we are both objects and agents our body
has a physical existence in the world that makes it an object and that can kind of knock against
things or we can walk into things etc but also it has an internal existence that is able to think
and um has a kind of unique creative capacity in the world to observe and um to make change and to
kind of accept or reject ideas etc so i would say that's one way in which objects have agency
and then there's various kind of um guess guess work about what other objects have agency we assume
animals have agency to some extent as well and then i will leave it up to your own imagination
to see how much further you want to take that some people might argue that society as a whole has
some consciousness or agency i'm not personally convinced by that one but that is a position that
some people argue and i suppose is one of the reasons that critical realism is is um often
compatible with religious approaches though i'm not myself religious other people within critical
realism are so that's quite a broad question answer to your question but um hopefully that's
helpful and caroline did you want to pick up yeah i think hindi i'm not sure if i'm if i'm
pronouncing well the name but had a question that i asked and again him or her i'm not sure if
the name because i'm not familiar with it but if you can put that question in the q&a
because it was a question about structure and agency which i think is quite important it's about
how can social structure be applied contextualized at individual level so the micro level in relation
to human agency so you're specifically talking about structure and agency relationships at the
individual level and um yeah i just wanted to say i think the work of margaret archer is
illustrative for this um she her her work on uh reflexivity and the inner conversation
she has two books about that the the one of yeah i think it's 2017 if i'm not wrong but
so she offers um and her as well i think her morphogenetic cycle really allows you to think
about the agency and this kind of how your inner conversation um is something really important
because it's what mediates your agency now i would suggest there is another um baolo donati
who has worked with her in um the relational subject and i think donati has a more social
approach to reflexive engagement what the inner conversation there is a critique that we don't
talk only to ourselves we talk with others and the inner conversation is not it's not the only
thing that mediates agency there are other other conversations if you wish so um i hope to answer
that question kihinde i think that will allow you to to explore this this question deeper um
with our archer's work yeah thank you jack for putting that reference there
can i just also say that i know there are a few people here who've read quite a lot of critical
realism so i don't want this to be the case that caroline and i the experts and you guys are all
asking the questions if you have any contributions to add to what we're saying that would be great too
so please raise a hand and jump into the to the discussion um okay so shall we pick up another
question here um uh question um from mateus do the natural and social overlap some social
structures may be influenced by the natural yeah absolutely so i think one one way of thinking
about this is in terms of emergence so the idea that the social emerges from the natural
um and when we use that word emergence we're not necessarily talking about over time here
and we're thinking in any particular moment there is the natural world that includes our
bodies and human made objects for example but from that that natural world of atoms and cells
and biology emerges the social world of um agency and thought and then social structures
and ideas etc so that would be one way in which they overlap that one emerges from the other
but then thinking introducing time into the equation and thinking about this over time
we can say that of course they interact constantly um on um you know a second by second basis the
natural and the social world are interacting and i think exploring the interaction between them
is a really important kind of approach to to social analysis so yeah really good question
please come in um and raise your hand if you want to add anything to that
um christopher i'm not sure um jack if you if you did answer this question because i'm not that
great at multitasking and hearing and reading at the same time but i think it's an it's a it's
a question that is interesting can we distinguish the stratified levels of actual empirical and real
in data so for example interview data document analysis when doing qualitative research about
a particular social phenomenon um phenomena so do you have any any particular answer to this jack
first to begin with i i sorry i was in the chat there just give me a moment yeah so i think
in and i believe that this is our task as social researcher is to find the tools we need to be able
to if the data does not allow us to go to that deeper level which i think it doesn't necessarily
happen so for example if i if i if if my entry point would be focus groups and i do some discussion
using a particular you know activity and i want to um trigger some conversations about um digital
engagements for example with tools how do you engage with what you engage why you engage um
that data will only allow me to uncover um this 10 percent the empirical level if i want to go
deeper and explore these mechanisms that are there i certainly need to put the theory in the
context of my research yes i can't just say you know forget about my data and then go and look for
the theory that will allow me to identify which are the mechanisms that are responsible as we
know in an open system for these for example in my case the lack of engagement um then i think you
need to with that in mind and your data you need to go to the theory and there is where that combination
your experience as a practitioner in the field and having read quite a bit about the structures
that you're exploring i think you put them together but not necessarily the data allows you per se
to go deeper into those level that's how i see it um i'm not sure if there is another and again
as jack said if anyone in the audience would like to chip in we're happy um to do that because yeah
is that's kind of yeah my my experience with it
okay so um i'm reading some of these questions in the yeah i'm just just looking at the questions
to to to think of um which one to answer yeah brilla is saying here how do we know that we are
actually unpacking real as that unpacking is dependent on our perceptions and this is a
question i ask myself a year and a half and every day you know how how how do i know that what i'm
doing um is real and yeah jack if you want to jump into that one yeah and so two thoughts on that one
the first would be perhaps a bit of an unsatisfactory answer but would be to say that critical realism
does insist on the fallibility of knowledge i think i mentioned this to someone in the chat
earlier that critical realism is not offering um a kind of hundred percent certainty in everything it
does rather it's trying to find the most compelling and convincing understanding of reality using
introspection and logic and as well as kind of our existing theories and empirical understandings
of the world so it's trying to build the most compelling case on the basis of that
um on the other hand perhaps or hopefully giving um a slightly more convincing um or
slightly more satisfactory answer hopefully is that um i i think if we look at bascar's argument
that there are underlying causal mechanisms uh in reality i think there is i personally find that
quite compelling because he asks what how does the world have to be for us to kind of experience it
this way how does the world have to be for science to be possible he argues so i would say that um
although there are those skeptical challenges we were talking about earlier there is um a degree
of security we can have in our beliefs even if we can't have certainty because our experiences
of the world especially when we talk to others and they have similar experiences do help us
see or help us kind of follow the logic that bascar's arguing and yeah not a fully satisfactory
answer i'm aware but hopefully that helps and i'll be interested to hear the thoughts on that too
um yes i i think it's it's yeah it's not and again you know i don't think i think the fallibility
something really important here and that's going to happen the epistemology you're going to in the
next seminar you're going to explore that deeper um but that's that i think that is an important
part of the answer um just picking another question um from the q and a um which is again is is this
is quite blurry but the question is quite interesting regarding objects of study the motto don't go
looking for something that doesn't exist seems sensible but what about concepts that are intensely
contested or that many people would question the basis of and i think here critical realism is
interesting to to work with contested um ideas are they real are they not real and and and i would say
this is kind of reducing again the complexity of this philosophy of science making a reduction in
this instant that i'm talking to you which means this is not the only answer to this but i think
there is this question is it real and if it's real then i will study it using critical realism again
i'm in this philosophy of science so if it's not real then i need to go for what is then the
real aspect of this phenomena that i'm investigating i think that's how i would approach this and now
i myself i'm i'm i'm looking at the datafication as a phenomena is it real and why is it real it's
very contested what is it what is it not so i i think yeah you know and and the basis of the real
the basis of the real again what you can say about is not definite is not uncriticisable or
academically on you can always critique it and find a better explanation where you can say well
you know what i think this is not real because that i'm here i'm offering maybe this aspect of
it is real and that's why it is i think that is the way to go thanks and can i just pick up on
the question from gonzag here and apologies by mispronouncing that and why do social researchers
still not use critical realism in their inquiries what likely explanations could you provide on this
issue so it's difficult to to kind of explain why others aren't using your theory and i think
that's always a problem with with any kind of belief but just to share a couple of thoughts on that
one would be from my own discipline political science at least and i'm sure it applies to others
the that there isn't as much critical reflection about our underlying ontologies and epistemologies
as there should be it's something that lots of us learn at master's or phd level and then when
lots of social scientists go out to conduct research and the pressures of the academic world
perhaps and and lots of other reasons might mean that they focus a lot less on their underlying
ontology and epistemology so there's a kind of general lack of criticality that we could think
about that would be one side of the explanation and i think the other side of the explanation
comes from the influentialness of post-structuralism and particularly the work of Foucault and others
and those who have built on Foucault's work who rejects the idea that the world contains
objects with essences who reject the idea that the world contains structures and instead emphasise
the fluidity and contingency of the world to the extent that there is no there are no entities
within it and i think there are lots of problems without philosophical approach it's been very
influential via Foucault and Judith Butler and others i would would personally disagree with it
but i think that's one of the reasons that critical realism isn't more widely used because
those who do reflect on their ontology and epistemology are often taking this alternative
post-structurist approach so i think for those engaging with critical realism as a theory in
thesis or research that debate between critical realism and post-structuralism i think is very
helpful in outlining and defending a critical realist approach yeah and Stephen is saying that
his supervisor says it's a cult and i'm reminded by Ben Manskey who is who is part of the group
of people and organising the seminar saying that in the united states where he is working it's the
same thing it is something that is very very much criticised as a cult and you know again
i think there is really here for me my experience at least it needs to catch you it needs to really
ring a bell in your when you're doing your research you just kind of say wow this really
is what i was looking for this allows me to explain what the unexplainable until i got this
this kind of this philosophical approach to social science so i think also you need to really be
you you you're always going to be uncomfortable because i think that is really what knowledge
generates in us when we are creating this thing that we really don't know we're in this kind of
really space where we don't know but i think critical realism it you know it can be for
different people different things and don't let yourself um how do you say be deterred from
from using it because everyone you know there are people that defend um you know let's say
new materialism which has been a new um which which also has a part of realism because um
Barat talks about agential realism um but there are you know there are people critiquing this
fiercely others taking it and writing books and and and so it's it's really i think what you
your hunch your your inner investigator voice what is it saying to you and then you go and
explore it deep and you will be able to answer questions and you know and argue for your position
it's not an easy one yep go for Caroline after you no go ahead go ahead and yeah i just wanted
to come in and add to that um which is i as i said earlier that quite a lot of people who use
critical realism um also hold religious positions and although i don't myself i'm personally an
atheist i think that often puts people off and people um almost take the attitude that religion
doesn't have a place in um social theory but i would suggest that if you're religious then
religion does have a place in social theory because it um is about your ontology and how you
understand the world to be and we should be making that explicit and debating and discussing it rather
than um trying to keep it separate so that's that's one point and i i think the other is the
maybe some critical realist texts focus too much on only the critical realist tools of understanding
whereas actually i i think the majority of those using critical realism are exploring it
in relation to other social theories in relation to other social ontologies they're engaging at
those boundaries and building those bridges and i think that's where the really interesting
workers is being done um so um so yes that would be some some thoughts on that question and i just
want to very briefly say something that a few times in the the chat people have been talking
about abduction and retroduction if those words are confusing you we will come back to those in
future sessions um i'm sure that'll be picked up in the methodology perhaps the epistemology
session and perhaps others as well so we shall come back to those issues yeah um and you know
i think social science is contested and that's the beauty of it um and that's the richness as well
and i think the religion example is brilliant because i'm on myself and agnostic as well so
but it and and when i started to read about it i really was puzzled with it and i was saying you
know um it stopped me in the sense of it made me read with more care and i it made me read more
to say okay let me see if this is really aligned with my ontology of the world but
i think we it's it's it's it's our position that we need to be able to defend it in our if
you're doing your phd in your viva i for example in mine had quite um quite quite hard questions to
answer um but i i knew it because i really didn't understand anything about it when i started
and i think that is the important thing it doesn't matter if the people that are
evaluating your thesis believe in it or not i think what is important if you have been so
coherent that you are arguing your methodology your explanation your findings the way in which
you look at social change and non-deterministic all of that if that is in line you'll be able
to defend it and is it that you're doing a research project or your phd or you're doing
something as a professional researcher it doesn't matter but you will be able to
you know to make a sound case i think that that is key
excellent and i i think we have answered the questions in the q and a as far as i see it but
i'd be very keen for people to raise their hands if they want to come in with
comments or other questions we have eight minutes left so if you do want have other
comments you'd like to make or questions you'd like to ask please type them in or raise your
hand and come in on the mic it'd be great to hear from some of you um are there any other
thoughts we'll just give a minute or two to see if anything else comes in before we before we wrap up
yeah Thanos i think your comment is is is is really to the point um so your supervisor said
you're crazy and at the end it's a great thesis i think it allows really to to to make um because
it is really you have to read to understand you have to really go into it it really allows
it to make a sound work i think it is it was my case as well um and and maybe just one other thing
on that is that it doesn't necessarily have to be the case that to use critical realism you
read everything that is written by critical realists and mobilize it all as some kind of gigantic
structure i think it's fine for you to be pulling out key ideas or key concepts that you find
particularly useful as long as you're paying attention to ensure that there aren't kind of
key contradictions between that and other parts of your theory then it's okay to take parts from
from critical realism and include that in in your research i don't think we should be concerned
about whether you're applying critical realism as a whole or not so yeah and and there our other
sessions are going to be great i think the last one talks about the framework and how you know
you then are able to include in your scaffold structure these theories that make sense to your
work and and um there is there are people trying to build bridges between one thing and the other
Frederick Fund and Berger being one of them so there is a lot of work going on in in in
in the social science and how can we you know communicate different um maybe ways of looking
at the world who's using critical realism and the strength it offers yeah and just a another
question or comment from Christopher about the relationship between Paulson and Tilly's
realist evaluation and the kind of more bascarian critical realist tradition so um despite coming
from the University of Leeds as both a masters and PhD student i'm not that familiar with Paulson
and Tilly i have read realist evaluation um but i'm not that familiar with their work or its influence
but um i would say there's an interesting divide really um that is there there's a kind of blurred
boundary there there is an international association of critical realism conference
and there is a realist evaluation conference so on the face of it they look separate but
actually you'll find people um using both at different session at different each conference
and you'll find people trying to um overlap them in various ways um i i think they're basically
different frameworks for social analysis that broadly accept some of the same um ontological
positions um would be a way of understanding it perhaps like so i don't have the knowledge to
go into a huge amount of depth about the precise differences between them um but just as a more
general comment is that Paulson and Tilly's realist evaluation tends to be more widely and easily
applied to um to policy and to more um empirical research and Bascar's work tends to be more
theoretically um elaborate or in-depth but is more a challenge to apply um as some of you
probably discovered but hopefully the rest of the sessions um in the series will will make that a
little easier yeah and that realist evaluation i think what it really does it it it uses um these
kind of concepts of generative mechanisms the outcomes um and the context i think it does really
use that but then they use it in the way that is useful for them um but i think they're the again
i don't know a lot but i read two papers when i was trying to put this causal pathways together
from my own work and it was illustrative in the sense of of how do you you know how do you make
your your your causal pathways if you're explaining something what is where are these mechanisms
really interacting and producing the outcome that i can see um it is helpful but it's yeah we we
don't need to take things like um lots of of activity going in the chat yeah which is great
just just to say that there's been one of the question about when the realist evaluation
conferences i don't know but here's a website that should take you to um the details of the
last conference and hopefully through there you'll be able to find information about the next one
yeah and thank you for sharing your resources which are quite useful as well so thank you for
that it um yeah it enriches the space so i think without any further questions um i think we can
we can draw the session to a close here i just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who's
asked questions and contributed in the chat there's been absolutely loads going on there
and loads of great exchanges of ideas and thank you all for for attending and make sure you come
along to the next session on epistemology and to follow the whole course through to the end
and we'd really appreciate your feedback as well so please drop us an email or get in touch with
feedback and use the forums that are on the Critical Realist Network website to ask questions
and take the discussion forward as well yes thank you very much it was a pleasure and it's
always so much that one learns being in these um spaces so i'm grateful for your being here and um yeah
