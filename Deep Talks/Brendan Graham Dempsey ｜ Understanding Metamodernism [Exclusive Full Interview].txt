Hey, everyone, welcome to another episode of Deep Talks,
Exploring Theology and Meaning Making.
Today, I'm joined by Brendan Graham Dempsey,
who I have to confess for those of you
that have gone through my lecture series on Meta-modernism.
I'm indebted to.
I referenced Brendan's work quite a bit.
He's got a great series of YouTube videos out there,
but not just YouTube videos.
He's also a writer and author,
and he has written a seven-volume series
called Meta-modern Spirituality Series,
and most recently, Meta-modernism,
or The Cultural Logic of Cultural Logics.
And so, Brendan, I really do consider to be,
maybe he wouldn't think of himself this way,
but I will heap some praise on him.
I consider Brendan to be one of the leading voices
addressing what's happening in our cultural moment right now
with the Meta-modern shift.
And so, many of you have been really fascinated
by this topic in subject matter,
so I thought I want to bring on an expert.
I don't claim to be an expert,
but I'm gonna bring on an expert here
to discuss what's happening.
Many of you are feeling like
as you're engaging with storytelling and the arts,
and you're seeing these spiritual shifts happening,
these religious shifts happening,
you're going, what is going on?
And so, Brendan is here today to help,
maybe try to put a name to some of that,
help us understand where we've come from,
where he maybe predicts this is all headed.
So, Brendan, thanks for being here today.
Thank you so much for having me.
This is great.
I'm excited.
I've been watching your videos,
really enjoyed the conversations you're having
with people like John Brevake and Paul Vander Clay.
And yeah, just think you're putting out
some excellent content.
And yeah, I'm excited to see what we dig into.
Yeah.
Okay, so for me, Brendan,
I don't think I had a name for this right away.
And it took me a while to give a name
to what I felt I was picking up on,
in particular in pop culture,
noticing like aesthetic shifts,
shifts in storytelling.
I have, I think, first found myself intrigued
by what seems like a shift
from Charles Taylor's secular age
into what I consider to be like a kind of a new epoch.
We're like on the bleeding edge of it,
what I've called the post-secular age.
We're also emerging out of the,
what I think is probably the death
of the new atheist movement
into this new era in the West.
And then I started noticing this shift
in storytelling, aesthetics, the arts.
And I found philosophers and people like yourself
describing this after post-modernism shift
as metamodernism.
When and where did you first become aware
that something was shifting in the philosophical landscape,
the worldview landscape, the religious,
the cultural stories that we're telling?
When did you first become aware of it?
And maybe what were some of the things
that first tipped you off to,
oh, something different than post-modernism
is happening here?
Yeah.
So for me personally, I would say I discovered metamodernism,
which is this term that people are talking about
to give a name to some of these shifts.
I discovered that back in 2013.
And to be honest, for me, it was in the context
of really seeing still a lot of,
very much kind of the post-modern zeitgeist
all around me in the arts.
I was raised on very post-modern films and television
and whatnot, as well as,
there's kind of an interesting dance
between that stuff coming in,
but also I was raised in a very Christian family,
growing up rather conservative Christian family.
So those things kind of mixed in an interesting way.
But it was out of my sort of dissatisfaction
and kind of a disaffectedness with a lot of
the contemporary zeitgeist that I went looking
in the first place to see what people were talking about
that might be out there that was beginning to emerge.
I mean, I was, from a young age,
actually really interested in the films of, say,
Wes Anderson and some other interesting stuff
that was starting to emerge
that had a slightly different kind of vibe to it.
But I certainly didn't have any kind of a name
or rubric to use.
So it was around 2013 when I was traveling,
I was living in Europe at the time
and was trying to just make sense around
the aesthetic shifts that we would really now call
post-modernism, like the shift that had become very,
there's just permeated society in terms of,
yeah, the aesthetic register that was operating
with that so-called cultural logic.
And seeing, is this where this ends?
Is this where this all culminates?
Or is there something past the post-modern?
And that's how I discovered the work
of these Dutch cultural theorists
who were talking about metamodernism.
And what's been partly fascinating about tracking this
is that it's been over the past, gosh, what, 10 years,
that seeing what was sort of initially kind of hinted at
or beginning to be described at that point
has really kind of flowered and come to fruition
in a big way in the last decade.
So yeah, for me, it wasn't so much looking around,
seeing big changes and then being like, what's this called?
It's more like getting intimations of some shifts
and changes and myself being kind of an evidence
of sort of like an exhaustedness with post-modernism
and a looking beyond it and then finding this thing
and then seeing it really kind of increasingly
accurately describe the kinds of shifts since then.
So yeah, that was my experience with the term.
You mentioned already here a couple of times, I think,
you just used the word exhaustion
about the way that the post-modern frame
was impacting you.
And I think as, I'm 40, much of my formative teenage years,
like you growing up in a very conservative,
evangelical context, I was still engaging with the broader,
I mean, we had our evangelical subculture with all its DC talk
and tooth and nail record bands and things like that.
And I'm sure you probably got into as well.
But within that subculture, of course,
we're plugged into a larger culture,
the culture, the meta-culture over the top of that.
And of course, much of what was going on
in my formative heyday where movies like Fight Club,
even in many ways like Seinfeld,
was a shift away from modernist forms of comedy
into something that was self-aware,
was, I think Larry David famously had a line on the set
that we're gonna make sure that there's no hugging
and nobody learns anything in each episode, right?
Which was such a critique, maybe a comedic sort of nihilism,
but a critique of the sitcom genre.
So I very much can identify with that.
But when you talk about it leaving you feeling exhausted,
can you put your finger maybe on what was producing
that sense of exhaustion or dissatisfaction
with that worldview, the worldview that was supposed
to be the critique really of all worldviews?
Yeah, I mean, at the aesthetic level,
there's just a sense of, it becomes a tired trick
after a while, right?
It's just you've seen it so many times
and once you start to have some language for it,
you're like, oh yeah, there that is again.
So that's largely what I mean by exhaustion,
just the sense of like, oh, this again.
And by this, I mean things like,
you walk into an art gallery and there's like,
I don't know, glitter and paint smeared on the ground.
And then there's like a little artist statement
that's like, untitled number 18.
And the little artist statement says something like,
this piece seeks to problematize our relationship
with that, that, that, that, that.
And when that stuff first starts to show up,
you might be like, oh, this is kind of interesting, right?
But like the opposite of interesting is boring.
And so what I think happened with a lot of postmodern art
was it just reached this point of saturation
in the culture that it wasn't interesting anymore,
which is sort of its claim to fame.
And instead, it was just increasingly boring.
And so that's mostly what I mean by exhaustion.
So there's that, though, there is a worldview component
to that as well, in the sense of to the degree
to which those sorts of aesthetic strategies
are connected to the sort of broader worldview
of sort of the nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, right?
There is a point in which that is itself kind of a tiredness.
A lot of the things that characterize
the postmodern period or its sense of an end,
I think Jameson described that as, right?
Everyone was talking about the, oh, the end of art
and the end of this and the end of the death of the author
and the end of history and everything was ending.
And so everyone was sort of exhausted about everything.
It was sort of a cultural logic of exhaustion.
And a lot of the kind of aesthetic strategies,
I think, reflected that.
So you get exhausted by exhaustion
and that's a kind of meta move, I suppose,
that sort of starts to gesture towards, you know,
what's beyond that?
What happens when you start becoming skeptical
of skepticism in a bit cynical towards the cynics, right?
It's sort of inevitable that you're probably gonna lead
towards something a bit more affirmational,
positive, exuberant, idealistic, et cetera.
So, yeah.
How do you understand, and I've talked about this
in my series, but I think it'd be helpful
to hear another vantage point on this,
how do you understand the shift from modernism
into an appetite for that sort of aesthetic art
and storytelling?
What do you think the primary factors were
that led from that modern shift to the post-modern shift
to make it probably something at some point
which had some value?
I know, I wanna be clear,
because there's a lot of conversation,
particularly in the sorts of internet spaces
that might be adjacent to your work and our work,
where there's a lot of kind of post-modern bogeyman stuff
out there, right?
Which is like, this was the worst thing
to have ever come about,
and it was all because of this weird cultural Marxism,
whatever that means.
Was there any validity to the initial shift from modernism?
What were the post-modern storytellers, artists,
and thinkers, what were they trying to grasp at?
And do you see there being any continuing value
for any of what post-modernism was grasping at that you see?
This needs to continue, and in the metamodern shift,
it seems to be continuing to be held onto
as something valuable.
I think it's a great question, it's an essential question,
and I feel like you won't really get metamodernism
if you don't get that that's an important thing to be asking.
So I think you're exactly right,
there's a lot of easy bogeymanning
and strawmanning of post-modernism.
And to be fair, these are big terms
that are supposed to encapsulate
a whole bunch of different things, right?
So a lot of the time, I think we're often
just talking past each other.
And so we should be aware up front
that these are big categories, they're fuzzy,
people will be using these terms slightly differently.
But I think that, yeah, if, as I'm sure we'll get
into in a minute, if metamodernism,
which is what comes after post-modernism,
is doing so by means still of post-modernism,
then we have to take seriously the notion
that something from this reaction carries forward.
And as for what that is,
there's so many angles you can take on this.
And I think they're all relevant, they're all valid,
and I don't want to get too much into the weeds
or too much over people's heads
and try to deal with too much here,
but I'll just name a few components of it, right?
There's at least, let's say a historical cultural moment,
which I think really pushes us in this direction.
And it largely comes after the World War II.
So let's step back a little bit, right?
The modern, of course, is in itself kind of responding
to the traditional worldview and a religious worldview
and a lot of what had come as sort of the emergence
of modernity and modernism,
it was about sort of trying to,
trying to, you could call this sort of the modern project,
like create something after the dissolution
and the rejection of maybe more traditional
religious narratives, right?
So you get new kinds of grand narratives about reality,
that it's about progress,
that there's this evolutionary direction
that sort of leaning cultures towards new heights.
You see this and then this glorification of technology
gets wrapped up with this.
So the modern is about the new and the novel
and the technological utopia
that we're sort of all gloriously heading towards
and sort of providing a new grand narrative of history
that is not the sort of kind of classic Christian narrative
that had been the one to prevail
throughout the entire medieval period, essentially.
Now it's a different narrative
and it's rooted in the this world
and all those things I just said.
And I think that once you see what happens with World War II
and how it just sort of just cuts the legs out
from under that, I think that's really important
for understanding the rise of post-modernism
because a number of things happen there.
Basically this utopian aspirational dream vision of history
doesn't lead to utopia, it leads to the gulag
and to Auschwitz essentially.
And so, and technology starts being very seen,
very much clearly seen for the ways that it destroys
as well as creates the way that it alienates
as well as brings people together.
And so, yeah, really just the whole period
from World War I to World War II,
which is really sort of a big colossal one war
with sort of an interim period.
A half time.
Yeah, basically.
And it's just this utter destruction of the old world
and I think that that creates a sense of disenchantment
with the entire modern project
and forces people to reevaluate the ideals of liberalism
and enlightenment values
and supposedly this emancipatory project that modernity was,
it seemed to lead to this iron cage.
So you get after World War II,
people who are critical of these sorts of things,
critical of the ideals and all that.
And yeah, that leads to an attitude of skepticism.
It leads to an attitude of cynicism, right?
It's sort of like, oh, whose big narrative
are you pushing at me today, right?
You know, it's like, we've been here before.
There's this, yeah, there's this profound distrust
or hermeneutics of suspicion, right?
So it makes sense to people like Freud and Nietzsche
and Marx come in to try to, you know,
but even of course, and this is where part of this issue
around like the cultural Marxism bit
becomes really problematic.
Is that like, even Marx had a grand narrative, right?
So what's so interesting about this postmodern moment
is like, no, even the Marxists are out the window
because they're pushing some story.
And so, you know, once you've eschewed-
And still has great progress too.
Exactly, yeah, it's just, you know-
It's taking that Hegelian dialectic
and moving it into a materialist frame.
Yeah, and certainly a lot of those ideas
had a direct link to what you see happen
in World War II and then of course,
the aftermath of the Cold War.
So you get, I think, a profound disenchantment,
disillusionment with this whole way of looking at the world.
And there's a kind of self-protective element
that goes with that as well.
It's sort of like, all right, I won't believe anything,
you know, and so nihilism, of course,
is sort of a natural product of that.
So anyway, there's a kind of cultural historical moment
that sort of makes sense for why those ideas
would start to be on the rise.
There's also, you know, technological things
that happen, there's, you could say,
sort of evolutionary complexification,
developmental angles that can be brought to this narrative.
I could go on and on.
So there's really a whole set of things
that kind of explain why all of a sudden
you start seeing this emergence of these ideas.
But maybe more importantly though,
to get to the heart of your question,
which is like, what sort of carries forward from that,
that is a value?
And I will say this, that like a big thing
that these critiques did was they forced us to be
more sort of demanding of what we took as true, right?
It's sort of like, you know,
there's this critique of authority
and these appeals to, you know, oh, well,
this is the story, this is the narrative,
or this is the, you know, the political message
or what have you.
There was sort of this sort of standing back
and being like, well, no, we're not gonna just, you know,
buy whatever bill of goods you're selling.
We're gonna really interrogate them, ideally, right?
And so one of the positive things that does come from that
is a critique of certain modern presumptions
that had been taken for granted,
which are now start to be sort of exploded, right?
Because once you start asking,
well, for who is this story, you know, serving,
or to whose benefit does this particular message work,
then you're starting to become more aware of, you know,
the exclusionary dynamics that go into selling stories
and grand narratives and sort of like,
who's being left out, who's being oppressed,
who's being used and exploited.
So these issues become very salient
to postmodern critiques of things.
And basically in the absence of,
this is the true story of history,
all you've kind of got then is critiques of power
and privilege to be able to fill in that gap.
And so some of that is legitimately very valuable.
I mean, we need to be doing asking those kinds of questions.
And I think that the things like the civil rights movement,
movements that come in the 60s, you know,
are a big product of, you know,
those cultural forces shifting really much of the kind of
cultural and sexual liberation and revolution kind of
is a product of some of these, you know,
presumed axioms of sort of modern thought being sort of
exploded and having new opportunities
to be critiqued and whatnot.
So anyway, I could say a lot more about that,
but I guess I would just say that
I think we should be asking more about systems, right?
What are the contexts that we're operating in?
Let's see the things that we were using
to make sense of reality and examine those, right?
So there's this moving back and stepping back
from the ideologies or the frameworks
that you're using to make sense of reality
and interrogating those.
And all of that I find to be very useful.
And so when you start getting into metamodernism,
there's certain aspects in which
we can't just throw that stuff out.
We shouldn't.
There's profound insights to be gained
from appreciating that we are in social contexts
that humans do a lot to construct those contexts
and that we shouldn't just take a sort of natural givens,
things that we are enculturated into
and we should interrogate them.
And that really starts to set you up into a new place
where you're able to see cultural logics
as objects of analysis and not just things
that you see the world through.
And then that can really start to put you in a position
where you have a cultural logic of cultural logics,
which is kind of what the book is about.
The core of cores, right?
I don't know if you saw this or have seen this trend
on YouTube and TikTok called the core core.
No, I haven't.
So, okay, so this is really fascinating.
And I think this has connection
to the aesthetic interests of metamodernism.
So, side tangent here,
and I want to come back to some of the stuff
you said about postmodernism and connect it here too,
but the core core movement is this,
again, like a really a vibe as my kids would say.
It's a aesthetic vibe that gets at,
so you might have genres on TikTok and YouTube,
like YouTube reels, for example,
or YouTube shorts of these different cores.
You know, I'm gonna butcher some of the other ones
like home core or these different cores that are trying.
And so, the core core, yes, exactly, right?
And of course, in music,
you had hardcore music, metal core.
You know, what's at the core.
And so, core core is trying to get at like,
what is at the core of cores?
And these are really fascinating vignettes
into, I think, like the psyche of Gen Z right now,
which tends to, from my vantage point,
address the meeting crisis differently
than millennials and Gen Xers did.
Many of, much of which I think has been marked
by a sort of like comedic nihilism,
where Gen Z is much more,
this is when I saw, I noticed a shift happening, Brendan,
it was probably my last few years of teaching
in a classroom.
The biggest thing I started to notice
was how differently Gen Z was engaging the subject
of September 11th from old millennials like me.
When I noticed that they were comfortable,
not only comfortable, but like,
they loved sharing like 9-11 memes,
you know, and getting humor out of them.
It was like a strange form of gallows humor, you know,
whereas that would be almost like a sacred,
untouchable subject to millennials and Gen Xers
in particular, like that was so devastating.
And I noticed boys in particular, 17, 18 years old,
like passed along 9-11 memes,
which I like found offensive,
but it was kind of their way of processing
the anguish of living in this particular moment.
But Corcor, these videos are often set to like,
just a really, they seem to be not coherent scenes
spliced together, but there's a general aesthetic
or vibe of melancholy, very depressing underneath that.
And you might see spliced together scenes
from kind of these like sigma male anti-hero figures
that you see in like the literally me videos out there,
like a Patrick Bateman and scenes from those sorts of movies,
but it's set to, it's fascinating
because you're talking about the cultural logics
of cultural logic, like what's at the core of cores
and to me, I see that connecting to what seems to be happening
for those of us who post-modernism maybe was our native tongue.
And so all we knew was primarily irony, cynicism.
I mean, this at a folk level, as you mentioned already,
post-modernism is far too complex,
but folk post-modernism, you know,
the fight club post-modernism,
the maybe the Rick and Morty post-modernism,
that genre, seeing at the end of that people feeling
that they have in some sense taken the sledgehammer
of deconstruction to their overarching stories,
to their guiding stories, deconstructed them all
for many people.
And, you know, I don't know much of your personal story,
but I'm sure there's a sense in which we can both identify
with the disillusionment
that many people are age experienced
with traditional religion
and feeling as if there has been a use of those stories
to continue to victimize people.
And when you combine that post-modern critique,
that overarching stories, mask a play for power
to continue to oppress and victimize,
and then you've actually seen firsthand improper moral,
immoral behavior, you've seen scandals,
it seems to only strengthen that case.
But I think, from my vantage point,
that that exhaustion that we feel at the end of that
still leads us to this deep desire
to actually live in some sort of story.
How is the metamodern shift attempting to address
that desire, that exhaustion,
and that need to live in some sort of story
that provides positive reconstruction,
that provides you a way of actually speaking sincerely
without throwing out all of what have been
really valid critiques of post-modernism.
How does it use the language and aesthetic
of post-modernism to attempt to inhabit a meaningful story,
to say things that are true, good, and beautiful once again?
How do you see that working from your vantage point?
Yeah, well, I think that what you're naming
is a really significant dynamic of metamodern thought.
I think once you see that that kind of thing is going on,
that, I think, is sort of the answer to the question,
but it's sort of like it happens in different ways.
So if, broadly speaking, this post-modern move
is to deconstruct and to subject to interrogation
and hermeneutics of suspicion,
and it can do that in multiple ways,
including, well, we'll leave it there.
So that's one thing that it's doing,
but it does differently.
I think the metamodern move is sort of an attempt to say,
okay, yes, okay, now what?
Let's reconstruct and let's try to, as you say,
maybe live in a story while owning it's a story
or what have you, and recognizing that that happens
in different ways.
So one way that I see that happening
is in, well, okay, so there are different instances.
I'll use one as an example.
One is everything, everywhere, all at once,
which is a kind of explicitly metamodern work of art.
The directors, Daniel's said as much.
They're like, yep, we're aiming for a metamodern thing here.
And if you watch the movie, it's all about meaning.
It's about nihilism, all right?
It's about how do we make sense and purpose of our lives
in the context of this infinite multiverse
in which anything could be anything.
And one sort of the kernel of the response there
is, comes at the end of the movie,
which is something like, nothing matters, be given that.
Therefore, everything can matter.
And some people might find that rather unsatisfying.
I wouldn't entirely blame them if they did so,
but that is one thing that you see.
And there are elements, actually,
speaking of Rick and Morty in which that shows up.
It's like, hey, no one's supposed to be around purpose.
There's no plan.
Just come and sit and hang out with your family,
sort of a thing, right?
So there's this move towards what you see also
at the end of everything, everywhere, all at once,
which is the main character chooses to be
with this particular family, at this particular laundromat,
in this vast galaxy of universes,
because this is her world, essentially.
So there's, I think, a move towards sort of reaffirming
the value of sort of local meaning making
and sort of recognizing that things could be
an infinite number of other ways,
that there's no sort of foundational ground,
and yet we can affirm the value of our lived context.
You could say we can choose the story
and then put a lot of weight onto that story.
Very existentialist move.
It is, it is.
It's, I think, it even goes a bit further
than the existentialist to the degree that, I don't know,
I get the impression from a lot of existentialists
that there's a sense that there's still something
inherently of value in making meaning,
that somehow the meaning-making thing is the thing,
but in this it's sort of like, nope,
even that is just sort of, you can deconstruct that,
but we still need to do these things.
So there's an element to that.
I see that narrative crop up in Meta-Modern Spaces.
I see kind of similarly this sort of approach
around owning the social constructedness of things,
but again, sort of affirming that,
well, this is the condition of all knowledge,
so this is just kind of how all knowledge works.
And so, you know, I grew up in this story
and you grew up in this story.
I think I've seen you mentioned some of these kinds
of frameworks here in some stuff you've said.
And there's some recognition that that's how things work
and then just sort of owning and accepting it
and then kind of living into that story.
That's another approach.
I'm very interested in trying to find
sort of places where meaning actually does
have some kind of a, how would I put this?
It kind of grounds out in some significant way still.
So it's not just to choose your own adventure.
It's like, oh no, like this is kind of how this works,
even though it admits of a lot of variability.
So like for example, very kind of simplistically,
if you want to say that like older forms of meaning
where like meaning just has objective existence,
just is, right?
Like things mean.
Maybe that has a very kind of naive,
traditional religious kind of flavor to it.
And then sort of modernity comes around
and it's sort of like, well, wait a second,
we look for meaning in the world
and we don't find it there.
Therefore, meaning isn't objective.
It's actually just purely subjective, right?
Which is an idea that I think post-modernism
takes even further in some of the ways
that we're talking about.
Just like, yeah, we all just live in our own story.
There's a third answer to that,
which is that meaning actually is real,
but it's neither purely objective or subjective.
It arises in this sort of dynamic,
transjective relationship between an entity
and its environment.
John Revecki just kind of talks a lot about that, Brendan,
because I find that fascinating.
Because part of my vantage point on this would be
to say that part of the modern shift
was critiquing traditional metaphysics.
And then as we move further away
in the epistemological problem
of how do I know anything at all,
metaphysics seems to play less and less of a role
in philosophy and practically in people's lives.
Where it's like, we can ground this in phenomenology
or other places, but whether that's sort of
an agnosticism about metaphysical claims,
where it's like, how could we ever know
any of this at all to a more post-modern distrust
of metaphysical claims?
So help me understand a little bit more
when you're saying like, you're not satisfied
from your vantage point, you're not satisfied
with a sort of like Sisyphusian approach to just say,
all right, I got to push this boulder
up the mountain once again,
but I can choose to make it valuable
by just simply deciding in this internal state
that God's can't control my internal state,
so therefore I can decide that this is valuable.
Are you saying you're not satisfied with that?
And you'd like, you feel there needs to be
some other grounding beyond the self.
And are you saying there's a search for that?
Do you feel like both for you individually,
but also within maybe the broader metamodern shift,
are people kind of going back to metaphysics for that?
Are they turning, what are they turning to
to find that maybe that grounding outside of the self?
Yeah, yeah.
No, and this I think is, this is the thing
that so many people are grappling with right now
in a million different ways, right?
And so, all right, yeah.
So the danger as I see it would be
that we do just sort of like become aware
of all these dynamics around the modern turn
and the postmodern turn and then say,
ah, but we still need stories or something like that.
And then just sort of kind of,
we don't carry the ideas forward.
We kind of just then conclude,
we have to sort of fall back on something,
more kind of existentially primitive
to how we were enculturated or something like that, right?
So I find that unsatisfactory.
I also find sort of other approaches
that do something very similar
to be missing something really crucial.
And so, I guess I'll just say the way I look at it,
and this isn't formed by folks I just mentioned
like John Vervakey and there's some great conversations
between John and Greg Enriquez
who has a wonderful sort of meta theory,
unifying theory of knowledge.
People like Bobby Azarian
who are all operating in this metamodern space.
I think that there's a shared solution space
to these sorts of issues.
And this is how I see it.
It's something like there's an entity in a context
and in order for it to continue to exist,
certain conditions need to be met, you could say.
And those are real, right?
Like I can't, I mean, unless you wanna be totally
solipsistic or skeptical to some extreme degree
and just deny the existence of, I don't know,
anything, any kind of world or something, right?
You'd have to admit that like, yeah,
no one even the most ardent sort of relativistic
post-modernist anti-realist is gonna step outside
while it's raining and just say, it's not raining.
You know what I mean?
Like that doesn't fly.
So if it is raining, then you have to consider the fact
of like, okay, well, this is gonna make me cold
and miserable and probably I might get a cold or whatever.
So you have to like do things in relationship to reality
in order to continue to successfully be an entity
in the world, right?
So you're talking like emergence and emanation
in some sense, right?
Yeah, well, certainly there's an emergent component
to this and the emergence emanation bit,
maybe I can come back to that and see if we could plug it
into that kind of a framework.
But the basic idea that I find really helpful
can actually ground out in some things like as fundamentals
like information theory, thermodynamics, where you've got,
okay, I am an informational entity in order to continue
to exist successfully.
I need to be processing information about my environment
and I need to do that accurately.
And if that information actually is helping me
maintain my viability, then that information
is meaningful to me, like full stop.
Like that's just, you know, someone can't be like,
I'm just gonna go walk off a cliff, you know,
and deny that that it's like, nope,
you won't be around anymore, right?
So the knowledge of if I walk off this cliff,
I will no longer be around, that's meaningful.
And at a certain point, you just can't
kind of deconstruct that anymore.
You can't kind of, you know,
interpretively, hermeneutically work your way around,
ah, but it could mean this or it could mean that, right?
There's a, to the degree that information
about the environment affects the viability
of the continued persistence of a thermodynamic entity
in context, that's, you know,
now what becomes really interesting about that though,
is that that's a very crude, simplistic notion of meaning.
I mean, you know, the kinds of meaning
that we really mean when we talk about meaning
or things about like, what's the meaning of my life
and relationships and all this stuff, right?
So there's, you've got to get from this sort of
very simplistic notion of meaning
that you get from thermodynamics and information theory
to the kinds of existential, philosophical,
spiritual, religious meanings that we're talking about.
And so then you have to appreciate
that there's a complexification process between the two.
And that's where things really start to get interesting
when you can situate yourself as the long end product
of billions of years of complexification,
where information and entities sort of have been
this continual dance leading to increasing information,
increasing complexity of organisms,
increasing complexity of the relationship between the two
so that meaning itself evolves and complexifies.
And that's kind of the stuff I'm exploring at the moment,
which again, dovetails very much
with a certain kind of strand of metamodern thought.
But it's, to ground this all back,
this is the same, we're trying to resolve
the same issue here, right?
Which is like, how do we make meaning in this world
that we supposedly have come to realize
is fully deconstructible and totally constructed and whatnot?
And are we simply making it or are we discovering it?
I think that's an important question too, right?
Yeah, I think that a lot of what is coming out
of the metamodern discourse space
is taking these seeming binaries
and then realizing the way that it's not either or,
that there's always sort of this both and component to this.
And so I think that once you have that in mind,
you can look back and see how a lot of our going astray
on a lot of these issues has come about
because we absolutized a particular way
of thinking about something, right?
So like you go back and it's like, oh, something is true.
And that's just, it's just true from the beginning of time.
It has a priori, you know, reality to it.
And, you know, there's some platonic ideal
that exists in this other world, right?
And it's like, and then over time,
that all gets sort of critiqued and deconstructed.
And then you get the sort of Kantian thing of like,
ah, no, it's just the mind, right?
And the, and reality conforms to the mind.
And then you get this radical relativism
and the sort of like total, you know,
the potential for total social constructivism.
It's just sort of whatever the mind thinks is real.
And both of these are very extreme positions, right?
It's sort of like, well, maybe both of these
are going on simultaneously.
Like maybe there are real things,
but the mind needs to construct its ability
to be able to understand and relate to them.
And, you know, there are frameworks
for thinking in these terms,
like Piaget's constructivism
and the whole tradition of developmental psychology
is like this continual equilibration
between entity and field, coming to learn each other
more and more so that it's both there's a reality
and the mind constructs or participates
in constructing its relationship to that reality.
Both of those are true.
We don't have to choose between them.
So I think a lot of the meta-modern conversation
is like really trying to find those points of synthesis,
which is often a synthesis between modern
and postmodern extremes.
I see what you're talking about here, Brendan,
is also having a point of connection to what
maybe both modernism and postmodernism were doing,
especially in American culture
with the elevation of the atomized individual, right?
So if in modernism, the individual,
well, you know, we could take this all the way back
to the Protestant Reformation,
where Luther trusts his gut over and against
the hierarchical institutions of the past,
which were the place in which you did have access
to the truth, that was the narrative, right?
So the rejection of locating it
through the hierarchical institutions
and in the individual gets us obviously to Descartes.
But then the postmodern impulse has been to
not only critique, you know,
we're not just doing like Descartes,
I think therefore I am, but there's also the sense
in which because all narratives are a play for power
that maybe, especially as this takes shape
in American culture, that I can author my own narrative.
I can radically self-author in a way
that there is no necessarily external reality
to which I have to conform to.
The only thing I'm trying to conform to
and maybe even conform the world outside of me
to actually match what I believe my internal state is.
Yeah, yeah.
No, and you see this all the time
with the way that language has become so important.
We have to police language now
because there's this thought that, you know,
oh, well, if we just change the words, we'll change reality.
Like if someone doesn't have a word for something
and we just obliterate that from our conceptions,
then this will lead in, you know,
some miraculously better world.
And so there is very much like that kind of, you know,
the way that we are tone policing and word policing
and canceling each other and sort of not engaging
with these ideas and sort of just cutting off conversation
at that level is a direct outgrowth of a certain worldview
which says that we create reality.
And so if we can change people's minds
and we'll change reality.
And so obviously that is misguided
and not entirely true, right?
But there's a kernel of truth to it.
Like we can change the way we speak about things
and maybe that would have a moderately better impact
on society.
So again, it's just this escape from either or thinking
of like we have to choose one side of this polarity
when in fact what I see is very emblematic
of all meta-modern thought as sort of this continual moving
between these different polarities.
And this is a sense of what the word meta means actually.
Meta can mean between.
And one of the ways that the original Dutch theorists
use the term related directly to that is that the meta-modern
mind is always oscillating is the word that they use
between sort of these post-modern views of things
and these modern views of things.
And for the record too, I think also it's important
for the context of this conversation,
not just the modern, I mean like,
let's say other cultural logics it's oscillating between.
On the one hand, it can kind of take that social
constructivist angle, but then when that starts getting
too extreme and just sort of ridiculous in terms of where
it falls apart with reality, then it can kind of reaffirm
that well, no, there is something here, right?
But there's this back and forth that's sort of continually
setting those different lenses in relationship
to each other so that you're getting some dynamic third
thing rather than just one of these two extremes.
So I think, yeah, you see that in all areas of sort of,
this meta-modern shift.
Do you think maybe, I'm just kind of spitballing here
at the top of my head as we're talking,
do you think there's any possibility that maybe what
we have learned is as we look at the kind of Hegelian,
here's the synthesis, here's the antithesis,
and we've seen as we've gone back that how strongly
people have said the antithesis is the truth,
up against the synthesis that maybe what meta-modernism
is trying to do is try to like predict in advance
where the new synthesis is going to land,
maybe by doing that oscillation between the thesis
and the antithesis.
In this case, it would be the primary thesis
and antithesis of modernism and post-modernism.
So modernism, and maybe even going before that,
the traditional storytelling, traditional worldview,
that you have that sort of thesis, post-modernism
being the antithesis and meta-modernism obviously seeking
to find the synthesis in advance instead of just
letting this collision maybe devolve into a total state
of war and anarchy and complete disillusionment.
Do you think there's any merit to that possibility?
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a very helpful way
of thinking about it, that it's becoming aware
of the dialectical nature of this
is at least the crucial part, right?
If you are only able to conceive of opposite binaries,
you're in a different position.
If you're able to cognize, oh, I'm between a rock
and a hard place, I'm between two opposite poles,
and they might actually relate to one another,
and they might actually maybe even sort of compliment
each other or have a kind of opponent processing factor
that maybe, you know, and once you're in that mindset,
you're, I think, already, you've already made that move.
And I think you're right, I mean,
there's an anticipation factor of like, okay,
well, then what does it look like to sort of, you know,
bring together these seemingly opposite things?
So anyway, that's a very helpful framing.
There are all sorts of ways of framing it,
and I don't want to reify any particular one
as like this is the right metamodern,
because there's, you know, these dynamics
that are very deep and we can represent them
in different ways, modern, or a thesis into this,
a synthesis is one way of doing that,
but we can also do, you know,
more traditional Hegelian dialectics,
we can talk about, you know,
basically things going meta on themselves,
or I talk about eternal recursion,
the sort of continual standing back
and self-reflecting on what was before.
But I think broad, what they all gesture to, right,
is that it's aware of the fact
that we are presented with these contraries
and building that into the perspective itself,
that like perspectives are often mediating
what came before in terms of seeming opposites,
and they need to, you know, ideally bring these together
and find where they can productively relate to one another.
Okay, can we circle back around
because when you're talking about,
I think the desire to find meaning outside of the self
in something, I don't wanna go as far as to say
objective truth, but to ground it in a,
let's say using other philosophical language,
the recognition that I am not necessary,
but I am contingent and I'm dependent
on some other necessary necessity beyond myself,
I think that is part of the awareness
that there are forces at play.
And this is where for me,
I wanted to circle back around to what you're talking about
because it seems like this dance
that Viveki has been talking about for quite some time
between emergence and emanation, right?
So emanation being kind of like the top down,
the thing outside of ourselves that provides
the constraints, the playground, if you will,
for which we can conform and have that bottom-up causality.
But the bottom-up causality isn't that,
and I think this is really,
I know this is gonna sound for some of my listeners,
like we're getting too far into the philosophical weeds here,
but I do think there are practical, existential,
daily life stuff connected to this,
that if we see ourselves as having nothing outside
of ourselves to conform to, like there's no reality,
there's no playground, there's no fence to inhabit,
there's no space, there's no container to be poured into
that it creates what, again, like Viveki
has called combinatorial explosion,
which is part of our problem.
Like we feel like we can,
I don't know if you follow any of like,
what's his name?
Byung Chul Han, any of his work at all.
Golly, I'm drawing a blank on his book titles.
But he's talked about this shift
into an achievement society,
an achievement society in which we feel
the constant need to optimize ourselves,
but the problem is that we have
seemingly endless options for optimization.
So there aren't constraints,
and we feel like as part of our narrative,
we can make ourselves whatever we want,
but we don't know what good thing to make ourselves to.
So there's like a,
there is the recognition of some sort of
top-down constraint, top-down thing to adhere to.
Is that a fair way of maybe assessing
what some of what the meta-modern impulse
is to find some proper container
while still recognizing the critiques of postmodernism
that I recognize, and I tell this to people, Brendan,
like I'm a pastor, I recognize that if I was born in Somalia,
the statistical likelihood of me being a Christian pastor
is infinitesimally small.
I recognize I was born into the story.
I'm self-aware of the story,
but I am also trying to be honest about,
okay, given that I can't live without a story,
I have to adhere to some structure,
and I'm earnestly searching to allow myself
to adhere to some structure that I see is true.
I'm not trying to be blind to it.
It seems like what I've noticed in our generation
is like the tiredness, the exhaustion
of nothing but cynicism, nothing but irony,
irony that isn't like leading to sincerity,
and we have this new impulse that goes,
all right, I'm still gonna use my ironic language,
but I am trying to find a container.
Like I'm trying to find the top-down force
that I should adhere to.
Yeah, so, okay, this will get a little trippy, maybe,
and maybe a little weird, all right, so.
It's trippy.
So I remember this episode of Boy Meets World,
where- Yes, let's go there.
Well, one of my favorites.
Yeah, yeah, speaking of, yeah.
And all right, so in this episode, it's the older brother.
I wanna say his name is Will,
but maybe that's the name of the actor.
I forget the name of the older brother, but-
Is it Eric?
Eric, yes, Eric.
Cory's older brother goes off to Hollywood
because he's gotten into acting,
and while he's there, he stars in a television sitcom pilot
called Kid Gets Acquainted with the Universe, all right?
And on the set, it's all the same characters
from Boy Meets World,
but they have slightly different names,
and he's playing a character named Derek or something, right?
So it's this, and sorry,
so this is what you would call going meta, okay?
And on some way, right?
Now, when you watch this,
you're like, this is a spoof, it's a joke.
It's sort of like a, there's no way to,
they're being cheekily self-aware, right?
And they're breaking the fourth wall and all this stuff,
and all these things have characteristic elements
of post-modern art.
You see this a lot in post-modern art
of just being very hyper-self-conscious,
where a book becomes about reading the book, right?
That sort of a thing, or like, you know,
the author is telling you
that he's writing the current sentence that he's writing,
right?
These are all meta moves that you find
in kind of classic post-modern works of art.
And a lot of the kind of immediate takeaway
from some of that stuff, right?
Is, oh, okay, yeah, all this stuff is kind of just silly,
and it makes me very aware of this thing.
It's sort of, I don't even have the illusion
of like, you know, suspension of disbelief.
I'm just like, it's putting it all in my face,
it's a construct, it's not real, all that.
And that can be sort of disenchanting and disillusioning,
and sort of, yeah, then you're kind of being ironic, okay?
But now here's where I want to kind of get a little
trippy with this.
Then you kind of really go with it,
and then you work with that move,
because you do see it as a move.
Like, that's what post-modern art is doing all the time,
in all sorts of things.
You know, like, what, the Simpsons have other television
shows on that, like, dinosaurs or family guy
that they have send-ups of,
because they're like, hey, wow, these guys
are so much like us, right?
It's sort of like, okay, we're gonna do this meta move, right?
So this is a move.
But once you see that it's a move,
you have a new enduring container, right?
You have a new thing that exists.
And so then you can say, oh, well,
what is the nature of that container?
Well, it's this recursive move
that has a deep kind of structure to it,
and it repeats itself and it reflects on itself.
Now, once you have that, you're like,
this is a real thing, right?
I'm not just like, we've deconstructed something,
but we've deconstructed it using a thing
that is not deconstructed, you know?
It's a real mental move that you make
that is, it's the container for deconstruction.
You see what I'm saying?
So it's like you've gotten beyond deconstruction,
meta deconstruction, because you're actually seeing
the very container that deconstruction needs
to even be able to do what it's doing.
And once you're there, you can start to say,
hey, there are things that exist
outside the context of just infinite,
you know, sort of cultural constructivist deconstruction.
There are the containers in which these things happen.
And that provides a new kind of solid ground to work with,
but you have to go through it to get there.
You have to deconstruct in order
to get outside of the container.
So what I posit is that this post-modern moment
is very much where we're still stuck
in the deconstructing move.
We haven't kept going, we haven't gotten beyond it.
And so we're stuck with the disenchantment
and the disillusionment and the cynicism and the irony.
But if you keep going, then that very stuff
is what allows you to find a new kind of meta-level container.
So that would be a way of beginning to think
about the sorts of moves that go into these sorts of things.
And I can say more about meaning as sort of a,
you know, a similar move,
but that would just be one way of framing it.
Okay, so then if modernism is trying to find
the container that holds the deconstruction.
Yeah.
Is that a fair way of summarizing that?
And sometimes like it's like-
Yeah, I think, I mean, as I say, right?
All meta-modernisms or the meta-modern quintessentially
is about going beyond post-modernism
by means of post-modernism.
So whatever you're gonna find on the other side
is going to be somehow a meaningful product
of post-modernism, but it's going to also transcend it
as well.
And so this is a classic example of how that would work
because you have to go through the deconstruction process
to then find the new stable structure.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that all forms
of meta-modernism are somehow about trying to do this.
I think that this is a, this is, this is,
and I do, I mean, this is the case I'm making in my book
because to talk about a cultural logic of cultural logics
is kind of where you get on, you know,
get to on the other side of this stuff
is that you see that, oh, there's a structure
to how cultural logics themselves evolve, right?
So meta-modernism is also about this move
in the sense that it's aware of how this process unfolds.
So it's able to see that, oh, post-modernism
is actually a necessary step in this process
because it's key to how this whole thing operates.
But then you're able to contextualize that
and you're able to relativize relativism, you know?
You're able to be skeptical of skepticism
and you're able to deconstruct deconstruction
because you put it in a wider frame.
So that to me seems to be like a really necessary,
you know, way of thinking about all this.
And when I synthesized all the different ways
people were talking about post-meta-modernism,
that is sort of the underlying structure
to all these different kinds of discourse
seems to be this basic move.
So that is the basic idea.
And I think what I would say though,
so I wanna tie this into the meaning issue
which I think would be valuable,
but I also recognize that there's a lot to all this.
So I don't know if we wanna, you know,
get a little bit sure first.
Yeah, no, I'd like to talk about that.
The only other pressing question I have, Brennan,
and you can pick which one you'd like to address first
is thinking about what sorts of implications
that this getting at the core of cores,
the container of containers.
What this shift, this impulse,
what kind of impact it has
on like traditional religion in America.
Because I've wondered how much of the shift
towards a little autobiographical,
and then you can choose which way you wanna take this.
You know, so I think back to my parents,
my parents who were, my dad was raised kind of nominally
Catholic, my mom was raised devoutly Catholic.
They saw that in some sense as the thesis
with all of the flaws that they perceived in that thesis.
And then when they got into their early adult years,
they chose this kind of new thing at the time
which was this born again Billy Graham,
evangelical experience, very personal.
So we're gonna move away from, you know,
at the time there already shifts happening
because it's post Vatican II from Latin mass,
but they wanna hear the Bible in their native tongue
and they wanna read Bible translations
that sound like their cultural context
and the music that's going to happen in church
isn't organs and from the medieval times,
there's not doing the smells and bells,
we're not doing that stuff.
We actually wanna communicate
with the cultural vocabulary of our day.
And so they very much grew up in that.
I'm a product of that, but I see a lot of people
that their parents went through that sort of change
and then they grow up and then they go to like
Eastern Orthodoxy or Catholicism
or the more high church liturgical expressions.
There's a lot of different ways we could frame that,
but I'm really wondering how much of that,
is that simply kind of,
you can kind of see these recurring patterns
throughout time of people going,
hey, I came from this and I wanna go back
to something before that.
Is that metamodern, what sorts of impacts do you see
as these stories disseminate in through popular culture
as the aesthetic changes and those aesthetic changes
begin to impact, not just guys like you and me
who are reading this stuff and not to pat ourselves
on the back, but we're not normal when it comes to,
when it comes to like picking up on these trends,
I'd like to think that I'll speak of you
that you're very much on the front end of this bleeding edge
and this, I don't think if you asked your average person
on the streets, like what metamodernism is,
they'd be like, I have no idea.
So as that moves more into the mainstream
and moves into the broader culture,
what sorts of impacts do you see it having
on traditional religion?
And you know, feel free if you feel like that connects
to what you wanna say about the pursuit of meaning,
I'm sure there is something there.
Yeah, no, I'll tackle that one.
And it's so interesting too,
because you described that whole thing you described,
I have a direct experience of that as well.
You know, my previous, well, my parents basically
had that experience, grew up in, you know,
mainline churches, found the evangelical thing,
because it was the antithesis to the thesis.
And I was that next generation that was very fascinated
by Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
I mean, one thing I'll say is, you know,
they say that every problem looks like a nail to a hammer,
right?
So I'm a metamodernist thinker.
So there's a danger of trying to interpret
all these sorts of patterns and culture
as somehow, you know, whatever.
And I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna over.
Hammer away, hammer away, Brendan.
This is what I called you here for.
But so, yeah, I wanna avoid the trap of, you know,
of doing that.
I will say though, there's an interesting way, right,
about how like the attraction, say, to Eastern Orthodoxy,
after coming from an evangelical context,
is different than if you made the reverse move.
Do you see what I'm saying?
It's because, right?
Like, I do think that there's this metamodern aspect here
in which there's a deep pragmatism as well,
that I think informs a lot of metamodern thought,
which stems from the same insight, right?
Of like, well, we gotta live with some story, right?
You know, so it's sort of like a pragmatic realization
that you're, are between a rock and a hard place
and you just gotta choose,
because you gotta get on with your life
and you have to have some meaning in it.
So there is a pragmatism there.
And I think that there is a kind of attraction
to certain kinds of religiosity
from the standpoint of, damn it, I wanna be religious,
you know, and I, it's almost like, you know,
I don't wanna say it's as flippant as, you know,
flip a coin literally, but there's some sense of like,
I need this element in my life and I want to choose this
and I'm attracted to these aesthetics, right?
And so I will engage with this thing
as it gives me this value.
But that's a very reflective stance
to like adopt a religious tradition for.
It's very different if you were to grow up
in the tradition itself and just like,
get the experience of this is the truth
and this is the way that reality is,
you'd have to deconstruct that
before you'd even be able to get in the position
where you could authentically,
agentially, volitionally choose the thing that you're in.
And oftentimes to be fair,
a lot of the places that we're coming from,
we're often trying so hard to distance ourselves from
that it's gonna be very unlikely
that we're gonna end back in the place
once we've done all that work
that we have done so much to get away from,
though some people do.
And I could very well conceive of, you know,
a situation where people leave
or let's say that people find just,
well, that people find a form of the religiosity
that I left and affirm it from a metamodern standpoint
for all the reasons that we're talking about.
But you have to see and the point I'm making
is that they're different then, right?
That it's a different and a lot of it has to do
with the degree of reflection, which is again,
the sort of recursive reflection
and this reflective move that we're always doing with things.
It's sort of we're learning from them.
We're able to take them as an objective analysis.
We're able to, you know, not just look through our glasses
but look at our glasses and then go from that vantage, right?
So I think a lot of, you know, the move here is
when you grow up, when you're enculturated
and when you're learning things,
like your whole formative period of life
for the first say 20 years,
a lot of it is just being taught how to see
through a certain pair of glasses, right?
And then in time, you might very well come to realize
that that way of seeing isn't complete,
that it is a pair of glasses
that you can take off and analyze.
And then you do that for a while
and maybe that occupies a lot of your, you know,
I don't know, early 20s and whatever.
But then eventually you're like, okay, yep,
that's how this whole thing works.
And, you know, now it's like,
which pair of glasses am I gonna wear and why?
That's right, because you can't go without that lens.
There's always the interpretive lens.
So the awareness of that to me seems like a differentiating
factor between just like, I'm leaving this thing
because I'm upset or I'm hurt for valid reasons
or non valid reasons, whatever the case may be.
And I'm running away from this thing.
That seems very different than going,
oh, I've taken off my glasses.
I realize I have an interpretive lens.
And then you go and you take that one set off
and then you put on another pair and then you realize,
oh shoot, wait, this is also has these filters, right?
Yes, no, no, no, this is where things start
to become very interesting as well though,
because all right, a couple of things here.
Let's say I have some rose colored glasses on, right?
And I'm like, ah, yes, the world is so rosy.
Now, of course I wouldn't say that
because everything is rosy.
So it's all contextually viewed through that lens, right?
But then someone comes around and they tell me,
hey, actually you're just viewing
through a pair of rose colored glasses.
And to the degree that I don't just immediately
shoot them away because they're challenging
my sense of reality and get very defensive
about that and actually take it seriously,
then I might go through the whole thing
of like learning to take them off, look at them,
find another pair over here and this has a green lens
and then try those on, right?
And I think that, I guess one of the things I wanna say
is one, that movement I think is the movement
from sort of naive traditionalism or naive religiosity
into a sort of modern critical stance
where we're able to take religion itself
as a subject, as an object of criticism and study.
And so that would be starting to do this, right?
And then the post-moderns come along
and they're like, oh, okay, yeah,
but here's all these other glasses you could choose from.
And so it's all relative, right?
It's all totally random, right?
Now here's where the thing really starts to click, I think,
is that then once you take that seriously,
you're like, wow, there are all these different kinds
of glasses I could be wearing.
And then you say, I can put them all on
and I can compare them.
I can put them all on and adjudicate between them.
Some of them are showing aspects better than others maybe,
maybe some prescriptions closer to my eyes or whatever.
There are certain aspects in which I'm getting new elements
of what is there through different kinds of glasses,
but even bigger than that,
one becomes aware of this whole meta move,
that it's the case that we're all wearing glasses,
we can all become aware of it,
we can all take them off, study them,
and then see the ways in which we're wearing
various forms of glasses.
And that that then becomes, you could say,
a new set of glasses that seems like it's absolute,
that now you're looking through the world
through the lens of lenses, right?
You've got a cultural logic of cultural logics,
because that's what this is.
It's sort of like, what are these different lenses?
They're different religions, they're different ideologies,
but more than that, they're different sort of degrees
of perspectival awareness, you could even say.
And so you start to see that what all of these things
have in common is that it's better to have more knowledge
of more glasses and to be able to go through the process
itself of adjudicating that,
and that there's something that feels closer to like truth
about that whole meta process, right?
And so you're able to-
Because that would allow you to have some sort of comparison.
If you say, as I've tried on 12 different sets of glasses,
I notice some similar features shared.
Maybe that's pointing to some core of cores here
that actually is revealing something
that is true across these perspectives.
Right, there's not only the fact
that you can then compare perspectives
and see what they have in common
and then be in a better position to say, well, that's real.
And I think to some degree, modernism
has already kind of engaged in projects like that,
but I think what's even the bigger move
is seeing that there's this meta pattern of lens analysis.
You know what I mean?
That the whole thing itself provides a way
to adjudicate between perspectives.
And because, right, when you put on a pair of glasses
and you can't see that people are wearing glasses,
those glasses aren't telling you as much about reality
as a pair of glasses where you put them on
and you do see that, right?
This is where the analogy falls apart a little bit
because glasses can't do all this,
but you understand what I'm saying, right?
That there's something intrinsically valuable
about the art of deconstructing a worldview
in a perspective in order to then see beyond it.
And then to get to the meta perspective
of seeing the process of worldview construction
and deconstruction itself,
which then provides you some solid thing
that you can compare all worlds to, if that makes sense.
So that gives you this meta pattern
that's sort of a new rubric or a new measure
or universal scale or something, right?
And this is what I mean when I talk about meaning
and the complexification of meaning and all this stuff
because this is something quite different than, you know,
oh, we all just live in a story,
so we might as well choose one,
which is still very inflected by postmodern relativism
to, well, we've gone through postmodern relativism
and now we're able to relativize it within a broader process
that is sort of a still actually universal process.
Now, hopefully one, people are with me on any of this
and it's making sense.
Two, I wanna qualify that as well
because I don't immediately, once you see
that this is this process, you see that it keeps going, right?
There's no clear end to this process.
It has a kind of self-transcending quality to it.
And so there should be some epistemic humility
that we have here that even though we have
this sort of universal scale, like well,
how many perspectives can we see and that that's real
and that that's not just, oh, you know,
whatever you wanna believe,
we also shouldn't say that even this whole perspective
won't be transcended in some other meta, meta level
where we put on a new set of glasses.
And I can understand how that might make people uncomfortable
because it seems like the solid ground
that we just got from this sort of thing
is now immediately then torn out from under us.
But I also wanna invite people to think about this
as a mystery, as the mystery of reality
that I think personally I see as a sacred process.
And when I start marrying this idea
of how the development of knowledge works
and the connection with reality
to certain forms of apophatic mysticism,
there's fascinating connections there to be made
in terms of like an eternally disclosing world,
a reality that is becoming more and more clearly known
by people, even as it's also always receding away
in this ultimate mystery, which I think is,
if you're a believing person,
shouldn't be any great discomfort either.
There's just, there is sort of this,
and so this is what I wanna tie back
into the emanation bit, you know?
So what I'm talking about is emergence.
Every time you take off the glass
and come to this whole new conception of reality,
you've like gone through an emergent phase shift
and you're seeing things in like a totally different way.
Things have new, your knowledge has been restructured
and reorganized and you've got a new, you know,
that's emergence, it's bottom up kind of self-transcendence.
But there is this thing that sort of on the other end
of this whole process that we're moving towards
in doing that, and that's the emanation bit.
And that's a lot harder to speak about, right?
And that's where I wanna locate that emanation aspect.
And you can call that God,
you can use the imagery of the Bible to talk about it.
And I think we should draw on the experience of the mystics
and the mystical literature,
especially in the Christian tradition to think about this.
But I think that that's the mystery of it to me.
And I think where this stops being a purely sort of
cultural analysis or kind of epistemological speculation
and starts to become a kind of devotional relationship
to the ground of being
and the infinitely self emanating abundance
of the fullness of the one or something like that, you know?
Yeah, so with that mystery,
there's maybe a couple of different existential responses
to that, to the confession of the ultimate transcendence
of the ground of being, right?
That there is in the Eastern Orthodox tradition,
you're more apt to use the apophatic language
of what God is not than what he is,
so that you don't constrain the possibilities
of the transcendent.
And yet there's a real problem there
with combinatorial explosion, with decision fatigue
and a sense of decision paralysis,
where you can get to the point
where the mystery becomes so grand
that you don't know where to take a first step.
And I think that would be a concerning feature of,
okay, so the metamodernism,
metamodern shift, if you accept some of these presuppositions,
if you accept where,
what's the word I'm looking for?
If you accept where the,
because it's not even just,
I don't wanna reduce this to like,
here are propositional,
here's propositional knowledge about the world,
because it's very much connected to,
when you watch these core core videos, for example,
it's not propositional, it's aesthetic.
It's a vibe, yeah.
It's a vibe, yeah, so where's the vibe?
Where's the vibe leading you?
I'm very optimistic about the possibility
that in this moment,
people are very open to positive reconstruction.
That for me is like a win,
but I'm also confessing my conviction of location on this
as somewhat of a Kierkegaardian Christian,
in that I'm like, yes, there is something,
there's something at the edge of this dock,
and this is maybe to use another metaphor or picture
that we can, let's say, take the reasons for believing
that there is something positive to reconstruct into,
that there is a core of cores,
that there's a container of containers.
No, I think I know where you're getting at,
so well, and I don't wanna interrupt you though,
so please finish your thought, but I think I know.
Okay, so let me just throw this out there then to you,
Brendan, then you can please provide
your feedback and comments on it,
but for me, the way I picture it is this sense that
there is enough general revelation
to use my Christian theological language
to lead me to, as like what Paul would argue in Romans one,
that God's invisible attributes are on display
within the material world that's been created,
and there's enough reason to believe
that there is a core of cores,
there's a container of containers there is,
and you could go through all the Aristotelian,
the five reasons of Augustine or not Augustine of Aquinas,
and Aristotle for believing in all of that stuff,
but it still leads you to this point
of which irrationality is not enough,
that you have to enter into the super irrational,
and this for me is again kind of a Kierkegaard disciple,
this is where that leap of faith
from the edge of the dock into the ocean
that stands in front of you is the only way
that you can know whether or not you will swim,
is when you actually move from here,
the propositions that I've been built upon,
and now I have to actually like give of myself,
and so for like Kierkegaard,
this is the only way that one actually truly comes
to know Christ, to know God,
is in that decisive leap of faith, the actual movement.
So I think you're probably tracking with me on this, Brent,
and the question then for some that come out of this,
and they go, I want to reconstruct,
I want to positively reconstruct,
where do I take the leap?
Is there a leap?
With that leap also comes the risk,
I don't want to leap into the wrong thing.
I still have to hold to what we've learned
from postmodernism that maybe that story I'm leaping into
is just simply masking a play for power.
I think the one for me, Brent,
and I have no problem talking about this,
this is me confessing that I know I'm situated in a story,
is like the Nietzschean critique
that this is nothing more than slave morality,
it's a poignant critique,
that this story is a great story
if you want to remain on the underside
and the bottom side of history all the time.
And so to encourage people in my vocation
to take that leap, I take it very, very seriously.
So mystery, the searching for the core of course,
the meta beyond the meta,
how do we move beyond the sense of paralysis
and decision fatigue into actually stepping into something
that we could positively reconstruct,
name that we're positively constructing,
or are we just kind of stuck
with our same old epistemology problems?
I think there's a couple of related questions in there
and I'll tackle one first and it might answer all of them,
I'm not sure, but I actually love this image
of the core of course.
So we'll take that in a very sincerely ironic way
and like really run with it, okay?
So like imagine a mandala, right?
It's sort of a series of concentric circles, right?
And when you think about that structure,
you can see that it's sort of like a,
you can also think of it in sort of a Venn diagram way
that like, what's at the center
is sort of in all of the things, right?
Now, if you think about this complexification thing
I've been talking about,
and which relates directly by the way
to being able to see more and more perspectives
and more and more lenses,
that you see that the complexification
of meaning gets us to these places.
And so we're taking in more and more perspectives.
But then the question is, what's the core of cores?
If there were core of cores,
then we would have good cause to,
let's say always be able to rest in something.
I wanna come back and qualify this in a second,
but what I wanna suggest is love.
It's not, I don't think of this so much as a leap of faith,
which for me still rings with all this propositional logic
and maybe even some kind of relational,
interpersonal logic or something.
But love is the vibe, okay?
Love is the vibe.
And what I mean by that is that it's true at all levels,
that there's no point where you can get
to the complexification of something
or you get to a new perspective
and all of a sudden you're totally justified
to be an asshole, doesn't work that way.
There's like, you can go down to the most simple
or pure or whatever kind of language you wanna use
for this kind of even very naive faiths
and you'll find agape and Eros
and other kinds of love, Filos,
but you'll find this sense of connection,
of harmony, of wanting to bring together and to unite
and then you can start getting into theologies of love
and everything, which Kierkegaard did too.
But you can also then zoom out, right?
And you can also see that this operates too
at these levels that we're talking about
of metamodern self-reflexive recursivity
and all this stuff, but it's like,
we're still engaged in a connection
that is not lost or torn asunder
by the complexification of it all.
And that actually, as you're able to see more and more
of reality and see more and more perspectives
and more and more of the truth
and as that reality discloses itself to you
and you have more pieces and parts to work with,
the love is what is binding all those pieces together
so that you're seeing just more and more of the way
that love, as Dante would say,
causes the planets to dance around the stars.
So that would be my initial answer is that the vibe is love
and the core of cores is love
and that you can think about that as being the thing
that binds a little bit together.
Now, fascinating or maybe bizarre as it may sound,
this was something I've got
from synthesizing metamodernisms.
At least, you know, a pattern I was picking up
in a lot of people talking about this.
You've got Alexander Dumitrescu talking about,
you know, this sort of kindness and Jacob's ladder.
You've got Vermeulen and Von Doniker
talking about Eros and sort of the Metaxi
binding the different finite and infinite.
You've got, you know, the Hansi Freinach stuff
and the whole complexity aspect of this really kind of
filling in this neo-Aristotelian-leveled ontology
and connecting that to psychology
in the ways that this sort of complexification
leads to increasing degrees of embrace, I guess,
is what Susan Cook-Royder would call it,
but the increasing levels of intimacy
and connection with other people
and that that becomes sort of the telos, you could say,
that like whatever that is,
is simultaneously the core of cores,
but it's also that emanating reality
that's sort of unfolding more and more of itself
and that somehow in the great paradoxical vision
of the mystics, the center is also their circumference
and the origin is also the destination.
So that would be kind of a metamodern mystical response
to that question, which I think begins more immediately
from like a practical concern of like,
how then shall we live our lives sort of a thing?
So the first answer I think is just sort of like,
well, and this is the end of one of the great takeaways
of that metamodern film I mentioned
everywhere, everything everywhere at once,
which is be kind, be kind,
especially when you don't know what's going on
and we don't know what's going on
and we can expect that we should always have our lenses
ripped from our faces and we see a whole new level
of reality and that our senses of ego and worldview
get deconstructed and we've got to rebuild.
There's always so much that we don't know
and this profound uncertainty in the chaos
that's beyond our minimal complexity
to be able to make sense of.
So that's always gonna be the case,
but there's always this enduring sense of be kind.
And if you can start there,
then you're probably doing the most important thing.
And then we can, you know, talk about
whether any of the other stuff makes any sense.
Yeah, that's beautifully stated.
That does remind me of what Aquinas argued
that keratoss was the highest virtue
that there was some superlative virtue
up above all of them.
And I do think at the end, maybe this is kind of still
kind of like an existentialist wager here
that I've always looked at that Brendan and gone.
All right, what would be the worst,
and maybe this is some sort of like Pascal's wager
sort of deal here,
but what would be the worst that would come of my life
if I actually gave myself in love
to seeking the good of the other when I encountered them?
And if I made that,
and if I actually trusted that at the core of course,
that that was the thing that brought everything to be
was a desire to connect, a desire for communion.
And at the very center of it was loving communion.
I mean, there's certainly,
I'm not saying Christianity is the only story that has that,
but I do look at that and go,
these are the sorts of things that for me, Brendan,
I go, all right, I'm very aware that I'm in a story,
but this one, at least on those levels,
it matches up for me, right?
And if at the end, I end up being wrong,
I think I still don't think I would have as many regrets
as if I rejected that premise.
I rejected the way of love.
I rejected seeking the good of the other.
If I rejected that and pursued my own selfish ends,
I think I've been bedside for people who,
pardon me, in those dying moments of life,
and have been bedside with people
that have given themselves to that.
And if in the end, it's just all,
you just head into the void and that,
what was it in everything,
everywhere all at once, the everything bagel of,
yeah, the everything bagel of nothingness,
if that just consumes us all in the end,
I know there's a point in which,
the possible argued, if there is no resurrection,
then we are to be pitied among all people,
and I'm pretty much an idiot for giving my life to this,
but I still think there's probably something of
a Paschalian wager that,
not the way it's often used in cliches,
but the sense that what you're talking about,
I don't know, but I know the difference in my life,
when I've given myself to my ego,
versus giving myself to truly seeking the good
of my neighbor, those around me,
of loving God and loving other people,
and believing that at the very core, of course,
that there is Stanley Grenz's book,
Theology for the Community of God,
and this is his argument that one of the distinctions
for the Christian story is the story of,
at the very core of cores,
you have a communion within a Godhead,
and I'm not asking, you do agree with that,
or listeners to agree with that sentiment,
but for me, I find that picture compelling,
that there is loving communion at the center
in which we are being enveloped into.
If in the end I'm wrong, I don't know,
what's the worst that come of me, I suppose?
Yeah, I mean, yes, for me,
the Kierkegaardian leap was really
a crucial transition moment in my life
for getting out of nihilism, let's say,
and I think that that leap,
Kierkegaard had a stage model of faith,
basically, of the other religious life,
and it begins in aestheticism,
and goes into the ethical realm and into religious religiosity.
So he was using a stage model,
and I think that there's something
about what he's talking about
that actually does fit into a certain stage approach
to the religious life.
I think for me, where it resonates most, though,
is it's what you do when you're at the,
in the bottom of the abyss of nihilism.
That, to me, is where you make the Kierkegaardian move,
and one of the things that I find interesting
about that, though, is part of what happens
with those stage transitions is that,
by the time they've sort of played themselves out
and gotten, they've sort of,
there's like a seed there that then grows into something,
and the thing it grows into is very different
than the thing it was, if that makes any sense.
And so I think that while that leap of faith move
is crucial, I think that, at least in my experience,
it was doing that in that moment
that then got me in a place where I could sort of climb
out of the abyss and then look back and be like,
oh man, I used to be down in that abyss, right?
But I would never have been able to do that
had I not made that leap of faith.
And so in that new leap of faith,
it was a genuine moment of actual nihilism, really,
because, and this is another interesting way in which,
logics in a kind of Hegelian way negate their own negation
and then turn into different things, right?
Because nihilism itself gets you to a point
where you can then affirm anything, including faith.
You can become so meaningless in your life
that you can then just choose meaning.
And it's fascinating that if you actually do that
and play that out, you can get out of that abyss,
look down and be like, oh yeah,
I used to believe in no meaning, that's wild.
But you got there because you made a ladder for yourself
and you climbed on top of yourself to get out.
Or someone could say you were climbing
on top of more than that.
So yeah, I guess the point I wanna make is that,
I think that what you're describing is very real
and important, but I think I wanna encourage people too
that I think that there's also something beyond
the leap of faith that it's like you're leaping,
you do, you can, let's say, land somewhere
that might not be an eternal landing place,
because again, in the sort of endlessly shifting sands,
that they do keep changing, but you do land somewhere
and that the leap in retrospect becomes something different
from that vantage than what it was when it was initiated.
And so yeah, I guess I wanted to make that point.
Yes, that's great.
I'm glad you bring that up, Brendan,
because there would be some confusion there
for some that might think,
and maybe this is part of what we're processing
in the Meta-Modern Age is like,
is the answer simply to go back, right?
To go back, like re-enchantment.
Is re-enchantment simply going back?
Do we just need to somehow get back
to the medieval worldview and mindset and like,
no, there's a reason why we had to come out of that, right?
This isn't to fall for the trap of the inevitability
of progress, I'm not suggesting that,
but there is even within, for me, the Kierkegaardian model
and for me, within the Christian story,
there has to be a recognition
of their perpetual transcendent nature of God.
And so you have these signposts
and you can't settle for the signpost
lest they become the idol, right?
So you move beyond that,
and there's a constant moving beyond,
but it's not a moving beyond that should lead you
to feel like I could never take a first step.
And I think that's the thing I'm trying to like work through
and help people work through is like,
the first step out of the pit, out of the abyss.
And I think that's where like John
has been really, really helpful.
I haven't been, I'm gonna word this carefully.
I have my disagreements with kind of Peterson's,
maybe post daily wire kind of turn,
but I think Peterson's greatest strength
was at least helping people go,
take the first step out of the abyss.
Like there's an abyss there, like make a movement.
That is a kind of, that's Camus,
that is kind of the existentialist impulse,
like radically rebel against the abyss in some way.
Yeah, and I think, I mean, this might be,
hopefully I've somewhat ingratiated myself,
but here's where maybe I've become very challenging as well,
because like part of me sees the process itself
as destroying our idols, which means sometimes,
no, I'm not gonna say sometimes,
it means destroying various forms of Christianity,
maybe very, very precious forms,
those earlier inculturated forms that we grew up with
that was our place where we had a firm foundation.
For me, the spiritual life and spiritual development
is about being able to grapple
with having your whole religious worldview crumble,
and then get out of that abyss onto a new place,
but then also accept that like,
it's not like, okay, now I'm safe.
It's that if we really accept the eternally
kind of self-transcending aspect of the divine,
then we have to take seriously that every solid ground
is gonna be liable for deconstruction basically.
And I guess I'd wanna invite people to see that process,
not as an inhibition towards growth or faith
or any of that, it's just, that's the faith journey.
It's like, you get closer to God, I think,
by continually killing God,
if I can be so violent about it,
but I mean, the whole death of God notion
that Nietzsche presents us is in a post-modern moment,
lands as this abyss of nihilism,
but when you see that it's actually the recursive movement
of the killing of God that actually is what teaches you
that there is a God beyond God,
there is a God beyond every single idol that you set up.
And I highly recommend the work of Jean-Luc Marion,
who is very helpful for me on this bit,
of God without being, which again,
puts us into a new area of sort of apophatic mysticism.
He draws a lot on pseudo-dionysius,
but the whole notion is that we have these conceptual idols
and that we need to really take seriously the idea
that every single notion, do I wanna say that?
I think so, I'll be absolutely autistic for a second.
Every single notion that we have of God is wrong
and that we should be okay with that,
that this is the upside of deconstruction, right?
And I wanna obviously qualify that
with some of the things I was saying about the core,
of course, and you know that there's love.
So I'm not trying to say that we can all find out
that God's this evil monster or something, right?
That's not my point.
My point is that if we are using images and symbols
and myths and stories and worldviews as our story
that we are affirming, great,
but then we know that we're using the story
and then also be open to when the cracks show up
in that story that we can push that story over
and transcend to some new thing.
And that's gonna be a storyless moment for a while.
It's gonna be falling through a vertiginous space
of nihilism potentially or confusion, disorientation,
but that is part of the recursive process of reflection
and that in the process we're getting closer
to that emanating truth of reality,
not farther away from it.
So I would throw that out there and it's a very,
it might seem, I don't know, bleak or something
and maybe it is, but I mean, there's an element to which
if we really take seriously the sublimity and the grandeur
of ultimate, you know, divinity,
then we should be epistemically humbled to see
that pretty much everything that we're using
to kind of gesture towards that is the crudest
of representations and ultimately they are representations
and therefore they're ultimately idols.
So there's a metamodern notion from,
I'll just say the last thing.
So Hansi Freinacht is a metamodern thinker.
He talks about the image of the headless God
as sort of his icon for the divine
because it's that God that can continually have
its head chopped off, so to speak,
that can keep coming back that is really
what deserves our awe and reverence.
Yeah, I hope people get a sense of how
what seems like the end of faith and religion
and just this total consummation
of a nihilistic postmodernism can be worked through
in a way that recursively reaffirms itself
to a point that you can see that there's a deep structure
of meaning under all of this.
Yeah, I think maybe I'll throw out a couple
maybe different words and maybe we're in agreement,
maybe we're in a disagreement on that
it's totally fine to be in disagreement on it as well.
Maybe instead of...
You're saying there are different perspectives?
What are you talking about?
No, sorry.
I would maybe frame it as like our pictures are incomplete
instead of all idolatrous.
Idolatry, I think for me would be at the core of idolatry
is settling for the image as the final, right?
And so where it becomes idolatry is not in the announcement
of it being true, good, or beautiful,
but in the finality of that particular picture,
which is I do think like at the core of the Hebrew tradition
which is really fascinating why the prohibition
of making images of God is so fascinating
given the cultural context.
Now you could say, well, they still made the Ark
of the Covenant and things like that,
but still there were very, very strong prohibitions
on trying to come up with a particular like idol
that would represent God in the same way
that you might see across other cultures.
And I think there's something to that.
And yet I think my, I don't know if I'd say pushback
or maybe it's a qualification or a point of like point of
seeing if we're on the same page in this or not
is to say, okay, but I also don't want to do the move
where I have to be the, you know,
all of history begins afresh with me, you know?
And so I'm starting without any received tradition,
without any sense in which, yes,
affirming the transcendence of God,
but also affirming the imminence of God.
So God has wanted to make himself
at the nature of love would be some desire of intelligibility.
To me, this grounds all of our scientific endeavors, right?
Is that the world is to some degree or another intelligible
because it's given to us as a gift.
And with that, there are images
that may still need to be corrected.
But I think, I bring this up because I think I've,
as a practical point, I know a lot of people
have personally found some sense of transformation
and actually revisiting old practices from their past
that they maybe thought there was no value to.
I think of even something simple as the practice
of someone revisiting an old song.
So quick story and I don't want to respect your time too,
Brendan, so we won't take too much longer here,
but there was a guy at our church who several weeks ago,
maybe a couple of months ago came up to me
and he's like, I really appreciate the songs
that we sung together
because they brought me back to this moment
and he was a guy that was a Vietnam vet
and he showed up at a Billy Graham crusade one time
just to, because the girl that he was interested in
was going to the Billy Graham crusade
and he spent the whole time at the Billy Graham crusade
mocking it until finally the infamous Billy Graham
altar call happened and for some reason he tells the story.
He's like, I was making fun of the whole experience,
the whole time.
All I was there was just try to get with this girl
and at the very end I found myself compelled
for something beyond me to run to the altar
and my entire life changed in that moment
and when I hear these songs,
they bring me back to that moment of transformation.
I would be reluctant to say that the journey
of perpetual transformation would require
that we have to disassemble all of those experiences
down to the studs.
And it doesn't seem like that'd be what you're saying
is instead maybe like maintaining a posture
of epistemic humility to there being limitations to them
because otherwise I think,
I don't know how we would get beyond the point of
there would, how do we, yeah.
And then there's this dance here to get to a journey
requires a belief that there is some place to go to
but it also requires the knowledge that you have
accumulated for how to use particular skills
and resources to even make a movement
in a particular direction.
And so I think that's the tension I experience in this
because I do see a lot of people that,
especially in our generation and younger,
who might say, okay, I recognize that all of these stories
and all these images of God are always going to be broken.
So one of my choices here is I will never plug into
any sort of traditional religious community
because everything that came from the past
is ultimately gonna lead me.
And what I often see just as a practical point
is a lot of people get involved into
the kind of like DIY spiritualities
in which they're continually functioning
as like I'm the self author.
And then we're kind of like back at that same sort of point
of the atomized individual who now of us can come
and then they get involved in some sort of weird cult
where you think the sex scandals
that go through churches are bad
wait till you get involved in some of these guru sex cults.
So yeah, that's just kind of like the back and forth
I'm experiencing the tension about the images of God
and the idolatry that can come with them
but also recognizing like I don't have to start from scratch.
There's received and inherited wisdom
that we are actually referring to these people
who we say they've got some glimpse of it
and that gives us a vantage point to stand on
and gives us some sort of,
gives us a house to live in as opposed to constantly feeling
like we're always remodeling all the time.
Gosh, I mean, you just outlined some such important things
and I feel like this could be the beginning
of a whole new conversation or not a new one
but there's at least an hour and a half to talk about this
but briefly, I mean, to tackle some of that.
Yes, I get that.
I think that I probably do skew a bit towards
the, how do I put it?
I mean, yes, you're identifying something
in what I'm saying, which is true, which is this,
there's this recursive deconstruction process
and when I think what you're saying is like, yeah,
but like we have to live somewhere
and like can't we eventually kind of like be okay
with where we're at and all that
and I want to honor that.
Be on that, Brandon.
I'll just throw this one other point is like,
especially when you think about raising children,
grandchildren, is then what do we pass on?
Not just individually, but how do we help our kids
enter into a story that we actually think leads
to their good and their flourishing?
And I don't want to see my kids go through
like perpetual deconstruction.
I don't like, I want them to come face to face with idols
that are unhealthy, that are leading to disorder,
to ruin in their lives and the lives of other people.
But I wouldn't, the things that I've gone through,
I wouldn't wish on my children.
Yeah, I know, but it's also like, you're a great guy.
So like maybe you had to go through some of that,
you know what I mean?
Like honestly though, it's like,
I've had this conversation, well, broached this conversation
a couple of times with people in terms of like,
this is partly the issue of suffering, right?
I mean, you know, I, yeah, the idea that experiencing
your kids experiencing suffering is suffering.
Yeah.
But at the same time, like puberty sucks, man.
You know what I mean?
And like growing up is hard.
And so there has got to be some allowance for like, you know,
but I think what you're also naming though
is something really important, which is that our,
whatever, let's say you use the word images, I guess,
because idols can be very loaded.
And I do want to collapse a little bit,
some of this hard distinction between idol and image, right?
Because it's like, I think we should also be okay
with the fact that we're not getting the absolute, right?
We might be selling, you know,
it's like, the perfect shouldn't be the enemy
of the good sort of a thing, right?
It doesn't mean that like just because we can't continually
bask before the eternal face of God in the Imperium
doesn't mean that like we, you know,
should just give up on the whole religion thing.
So, but what I was going to say was that,
I think you're naming a really important dynamic,
which is the notion of development,
what role development plays in all of this.
And by development, I mean psychological development.
I mean, the journey that we make from being an infant
to a young child, to an adolescent, to an adult,
and then to a mature adult, et cetera.
Like that is an arc and that faith is going to look different.
Religion is going to look different.
Our God concepts are going to look different
along that journey.
And for this, I mean, you know,
James Fowler has done great work.
There's excellent work on this topic
that I think people should be taking very seriously.
And all this ties directly into actually
to what I was talking earlier about
successively de-centering and acknowledging perspectives
because it's the same mechanism that allows
our God concept to evolve and change and grow.
So I want to name all that.
And I also want to name that different people
are going to sort of, you know,
settle in a particular spot on their developmental journey
in different places than others, right?
And not everyone's going to be called
to a life of mysticism.
You know, not everyone wants to be a desert hermit, you know?
Whether or not desert hermitage is even, you know,
an ideal is a different topic.
But like, let's just say the religion
religion has always appreciated the fact
that like different people are on that journey
and doing different aspects of it
and following it to different degrees.
There's esoteric and esoteric elements to this
and all that people have even challenged me
like is apophatic mysticism a legitimate basis
for religiosity?
Like how do you cohere a bunch of people
around an absent center?
I mean, I think you make a compelling connection
to the idea of, you know, an iconism in the Hebrew tradition
that literally did just that.
So I think there are models for it.
So I want to say all that.
I also want to say that I do think
that there can be very healthy expressions of DIY religion.
And I have a whole way of thinking about this,
which, you know, might, yeah, again,
goes into different terrains,
but I see God as continuing to evolve.
And that might be maybe a kind of strange
or even heretical idea to some folks.
But if you really do take everything
that we've been saying seriously about this,
you know, unfolding disclosure,
you could even call it unfolding revelation,
then of course our concept of God
keeps changing and evolving.
And indeed, when you look back in history,
you see that the notions of God do change and evolve,
and that they do move from, you know,
more kind of mythological versions
to more kind of moral philosophical visions
to transcendent and then into, you know.
So, and interestingly, those pair very, very fascinatingly
with the kinds of developmental trajectories
that we see at the individual level too.
So, but again, different story.
So what I'm saying is that it might be very serious
that some people feel like they are called
to sort of push into new terrain
and in almost prophetic calling,
try to speak new elements and new aspects
of the divine into the world.
And that there are interesting and important ways
that that kind of work can be done seriously
and not just sort of a new age DIY buffet style
pick and choose approach, right?
So I'm just hitting a bunch of points here.
But to get back to the main thing,
I guess I just, I do maybe because I've gone
through multiple deconstruction experiences
tend to be okay with the hard reality
of owning and even valorizing,
even sanctifying the inherent iconoclasm
that goes into a life of faith
because God is always calling you to, you know,
break down those images.
And I've had to reimagine and re-understand
divine experiences in my life
and things that have happened
and these sorts of things that were very meaningful to me
that set me on a whole new path
and gave me a whole new sense of my life,
meaning and purpose and direction
to have those five years later be like,
oh, nope, sorry, that wasn't the thing.
And then like to have that happen multiple times, right?
It's sort of like, so I guess I'm just naming all that.
And I'm saying that, yes, not everyone needs to feel
that the answer to all of this
is somehow like to just give up on this,
on any notion of stability or anything like that,
but that there are ways of framing a lot of what I've said
in social containers around development, education,
building developmentally informed approaches
to teaching, you know, catechism and faith
and that really is appropriate to where people are at in life.
And to also, I guess this is the,
maybe this is the point that I'm really getting at
is I think most people will be okay with that.
People do, I think, eventually get not okay
with challenging received images, symbols, rituals,
paradigms, stories, myths.
And that's most of what I've had to bump up against
in my own deconstructions and in, you know,
what's happening with people around me
and the people I care about
and how I relate to them and all that.
And I guess I just always wanna plug the idea
that like when people are deconstructing,
when they are going through something radical
and a worldview shift, like there's a default assumption
in religious communities that this is a falling away.
It's a regression, it's a, yeah, the fallback,
I forget, there's kind of-
Hostacy.
Yeah, well, certainly, yeah, all right, so there's,
that's just, I think we religious communities
are misoriented around those sorts of life events.
And I think if we were to take them much more seriously
and be able to appreciate that they are
the dynamic living moments in the evolution of faith,
not just for individuals, but for society
and what can come out of those experiences,
we would be better off.
And the last thing I'll say, because I'm rambling,
is that I totally agree that we have this rich tradition
to draw from and we shouldn't, you know,
Gerta said he who can't draw 2000 years of history
is living from hand to mouth.
So I'm not saying that like, oh, down with all the idols
of the past either, but we should also take seriously
that part of what we now have available to us
is all the other religious traditions, right?
You know, the Vedanta and Neoplatonism and Zen
and you know, all these different traditions that,
again, I think people maybe are a bit uncomfortable
thinking about was like, well, yeah, we have tradition,
but not those traditions, right?
And so, you know, I think that there is profound wisdom
out there in a lot of different traditions
that we might wanna consider folding that in as well.
So yes, how do we navigate the tension
and between moving beyond the limitations of the past,
but not throwing out the baby with the bathwater?
That's a perennial issue.
And how do we find a sense of stability
and a continually dynamic world upending,
potentially, you know, situation of flux, perennial tension.
But these are the questions that we should like
sort of be inviting the wrestling with, I think,
as I've heard you talk about things
and not just sort of, you know, immediately precluding them
from the religious life.
Yeah, and I'm really thankful for you sharing
your perspective, Brendan, on this.
And I'm glad, you know, even, you know,
as the opponent processing happens,
that's where a lot of this growth takes place.
If we are serious about confessing our own limitations,
our finitude, and even, you know, from a Christian,
you know, historically Christian perspective,
we are confessing not just our finitude
as an inherent feature of being human,
but some sense of like the depravity
of our own condition to sometimes bend things
towards our own will to bend things
towards our own selfish output.
Then we have to be open to having these sorts of dialogues.
People aren't like necessarily eye to eye,
but there's an openness to actually going,
hey, I think there's growth happening.
I don't want to affirm that,
just I'm thankful for this dialogue, Brendan,
and I'm thankful, hopefully listeners experience it
from wherever context they find themselves situated in
as a positive thing that produces growth in their life
and allows them to say, hey,
let me take my lenses off for a second,
try some others on, and without doing that,
I do think the sort of like naivete
that leads to the kinds of stories
that are used in oppressive, abusive ways,
ways that don't have adherence to reality.
If we're not checking up against this stuff,
then we can be blindly participating in that.
I just came to my head maybe sometime,
I don't want to throw this out there and impose upon them,
but I was just thinking, boy, this really gets at,
I think it'd be really fun
and maybe I can invite them into it.
It'd be fun to bring like John Vervakey on
and someone else like Paul van der Klee to talk about,
like the merits of kind of staying
within a traditional religious tradition
versus kind of like Vervakey's project
and what it seems like is in keeping
with some of your project is to say, all right,
can we take some of these and move them outside
of the walls of traditional religious institutions?
Which methodologies are better?
Are there pitfalls or things we can learn
from both strategies?
And I think that might be fun if John and Paul
are listening, open invitation,
and I don't know if you'd be open to doing something with that,
but I think it'd be an interesting dialogue.
Of course, I've been, I mean, that is the conversation,
one of the major conversations that needs,
conversations that needs to be had.
I've started to get into elements of that
with my own conversations with John Vervakey.
I'm actually, yeah, I have an open correspondence,
meaning I've reached out,
I haven't heard back yet from Paul Vanderklein.
So we might, we were thinking of talking anyway,
but this would be a topic that I think would be perfect
to dive into.
And so, yes, I'd definitely be open to that.
One last thing I wanna say too though is just that
the images that we use of great value
that come from our traditions,
also we're always deepening our understanding
and our interpretations of them, right?
I certainly, you know, a minister of say 70 years old
is gonna have a very different conception of Jesus
even than, you know, a five or seven year old, right?
So like, and that we can take those changes seriously
and yet they still continue to persist
and give that sort of continuity and stability
even as there is evolving shifting notions.
And then one of the challenges is how do we,
how do we make sure that we're in harmony
when someone's using this word in this way
or this concept and yet this is a,
again, a perennial issue in any religious context
as people continue to work with the ideas
and deepen in their understanding of them.
But that seems to be personally for me,
the hardest thing to do myself
with some traditional material is how to work with it
from a new perspective or a new vantage
that I can still affirm, you know,
are we ever in a position to be like,
you know, that's totally,
we can't do anything with that one, you know,
or what have you, because it's, you know,
people speak very eloquently often,
including yourself about drawing on this tradition
and interpreting some of its ideas in a way that I find,
yes, you know, like I'm there with you,
but then maybe enter a congregation
and you're expected to affirm a certain notion,
theological notion or, you know,
a creedal or a dogmatic notion that's like,
well, wait a second, that's not quite what I meant
by God or salvation or love even so.
But yeah, so, yeah, yeah.
You've nailed it, you've nailed it right there.
I think deepening is a really good word.
I think that might be a word that you could find harmony
between people within the traditional religious community
still and those that might be kind of trying to work
outside of the bounds of that.
Because deepening is I think a helpful picture
that combats, I think something lots of
traditionally religious people are suspicious of.
And I'm not saying it's accurate
and good for them to be suspicious,
but I'm confessing even my own suspicion
of the kind of narrative that progresses any movement
in any direction as long as we're moving away from the past.
Yeah, right, of course.
And so that notion seems to be not helpful in many regards.
So maybe there's a deepening.
And like you're saying, the deeper we get
in some subjects and some pictures,
the more we realize, yeah,
there might not be any goodness, truth, or beauty
in this image to hold on to anymore.
And but we only get that through these sorts of dialogues,
Brendan.
And I think the dynamic you just named also
is to bring this back to the Meta-Modern conversation.
I think that that's informing a lot of people's perspective
in the sense of it was a very modernist notion of,
anything moving ahead and away from the past is good.
And of course, you get that deconstructed.
But I think people in a Meta-Modern's position
are certainly skeptical of that.
They're skeptical of the skepticism of tradition as well.
And so I think you're seeing a lot of openness and interest
in traditional forms of religiosity for that reason.
People don't feel like it has to be,
again, that kind of false binary.
So yeah, this has been really wonderful.
I really appreciate you having me on
and getting to talk about this stuff.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks for your generosity with your time too, as well.
Before we recorded, you were asking how long this goes.
Hour to hour and a half,
but if we're really cooking close to two hours,
so I guess we must be really cooking
because we're cooking close to two hours.
So thanks.
And I'm serious,
I would love to maybe find some other time
to have continued dialogues,
bring some other partners in that can help enhance
and expand our framework here.
This has been a blast, Brendan.
Thank you so much.
That sounds great.
At the very least,
you're welcome on the Meta-Modern Spirituality Podcast
and we can continue this conversation.
But yeah, keep me posted.
I'd be happy to talk with Paul and John for sure.
Cool.
Great.
Thank you, Brendan.
Thank you, man.
