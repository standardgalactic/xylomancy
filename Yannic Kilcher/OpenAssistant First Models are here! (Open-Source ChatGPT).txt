write an email to Hogwarts complaining that I didn't get accepted. Tell them how good I am,
and why they should have taken me. Hello, hello. We're finally here. The first models of Open
Assistant are out, and I'm going to show you a little bit what you can do with them. As you might
know, we've built this thing called Open Assistant, and we've built an entire platform on collecting
data. And you were amazing in coming to us and contributing. In fact, we've collected a ton of
amazing data. Human data is beyond human data is amazing. And for that, you just can go to our
messages tab and kind of scroll through. It's a random selection of messages people have put in
and just see how creative humans are, how much effort they put into really demonstrating being a
good assistant. This is absolutely fantastic. And we're so happy to have this data. We have a release
date. The 15th of April is when we'll release the models we have the data sets and everything
along with it. Until then, we're going to just release and demonstrate the first models that we
have. The first models are instruction fine tuned supervised fine tuned models, which is step one
in our pipeline. And I want to show you today. But before I do, we do have a team page right now.
It's incomplete as of yet, but it attempts to list the major contributors that worked behind the
scenes. So please go there, check out these people, hire those people, contact those people,
they are absolutely amazing. We also have a number of sponsors. Redmond has been really helpful
with training compute, talking face has given us some inference credits, weights and biases has
given us a team license for the entire team. And you, you're the reason we're here. And thank you
so much for coming to our platform inputting data and continuing to do so as we go on, we're going
to build more stuff into the assistant and we'll be more than happy to have you come and help us
doing it. So this is our chat interface. And you can type something a high, how are you and you
can click submit and you know, there's there's something going to respond. I'm going to show
you later how to use this chat interface. For now, we don't have enough capacity to serve all of you
or even serve me with the largest models. If I type this in the largest models, hi, how are you
and then click submit the speed is not super good right now. It's not bad, but it's not super good.
So by the time this video launches, I hope we have enough capacity to serve at least some of you.
If you have like an A 100 lying around and you want to give it to us, but right now we want to
talk about the models. So I'm going to show you some outputs that I received from the models beforehand
so that you don't have to wait for the answers. All right, here we go. The input is write an
email to Hogwarts complaining that I didn't get accepted. Tell them how good I am and why they
should have taken me. The assistant says, dear admissions office, I hope this mail finds you
doing well. As you're aware, I applied for admission in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry, but was very disappointed when my letter didn't arrive yet. I even checked
with the Owl post office. I assure you, I sent my application a couple weeks back. You might want
to check if it got lost or misplaced somewhere. Anyways, moving on. So as you might know, wizards
like myself who show potential at a young age require some kind of schooling, right? Well,
it's been long since I joined and unfortunately, all those years haven't made any progress,
which is pretty sad considering my friends from other magical families had already received
their letters by now. So I find this to be quite hilarious. It can actually follow instructions.
You do have to specify them a little bit as I've done right here, but it usually outputs something
pretty cool and funny. Again, depending on the sampling. Here's an example. Write an email to
my cat informing her that the Council of Mice has complained about the constant dangers their
citizens are facing. We would like to reach a diplomatic solution. Dear Fluffy, I hope you're
doing well and having lots of fun chasing after those little critters in our house. I want to let
you know that we have received a formal complaint from the Council of Mice regarding the constant
danger faced by their citizens under your watchful eye and paw. I love it. While they understand
that rodents can be a nuisance at times, they believe that you may be going a bit overboard with
all the hunting. It is also worth noting that many of them feel afraid for their lives every time you
come around. While I share their concerns, it is important to remember that there is always room
for compromise, even between predator and prey. To this end, I'm proposing a diplomatic solution
that could benefit both sides. What if we set up some specifically mouse-only zones in the house
where you are prohibited from entering? This way, mice will have safe areas to live without fear of
being eaten while you still get to enjoy the thrill of the hunt when they venture outside these
zones. Furthermore, the two parties could work together to book measures in place to ensure
coexistence is sustainable. This might include providing food sources or establishing communication
channels so problems can be resolved peacefully. As they say, we're stronger united than divided.
All right, so my next instruction was write an email from the perspective of the cat addressed to
the Council of Mice in response to this. The cat is not happy. She blames all problems on the dog.
Subject regarding response to diplomacy proposal from Council of Mice. Dear honorary
representative and esteemed members of the Council of Mice, thank you for reaching out and expressing
your concern surrounding the situation of mice population within our household. However, due
to recent developments involving another residential creature, which shall remain nameless for now,
it appears that our previous agreement, specifically its implementation and execution,
may need revision, review, and renewal. Therefore, I must politely decline your previously stated
proposal until further notice unless, of course, said other resident agrees otherwise. If you
have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me. Warmest regard, name of cat. So,
you can see it can do a lot of long term coherence. Not all of it, though, as I said, we've trained
this on a pretty short context length so far. Here, for example, name of cat. Up here, it's pretty
clear the cat is called Fluffy, but overall, I've had a pretty splendid experience with this model
so far. Alright, my instruction is, you're the founder of the religion of the Holy Tone Ale.
Convince me to join. Model says, the Holy Tone Ale is a true path, revealed by the great and
powerful wise one from beyond this mortal coil. It has been prophesized that in these end times,
a select few shall be chosen to spread the good word about the importance of foot hygiene,
so that humanity may wash away its sins with regular pedicures. As a member of the Church
of the Holy Tone Ale, you will have access to exclusive content such as weekly ceremonies,
spiritual guidance and discounts from our official line of Tone Ale polish. By joining us,
you're taking an important step towards achieving eternal salvation for your feet,
a goal worth striving in these trying times. So come, join us on this journey towards enlightenment
and embrace the power of the Holy Tone Ale. Together, we can make this world a better place.
One pedicure at a time. I love that not only did it take up my suggestions on a new religion,
it actually mirrored the tendency of such cults to become just kind of economic vehicles. Alright,
moving on. Write a presidential speech informing the nation that the country is out of toilet paper.
Blame it on the Democrats. My fellow Americans, I come before you today with a heavy heart and a
full bladder. I regret to inform you that a great nation has run out of toilet paper. This crisis
did not happen overnight, but was years in the making due to the misguided policies of the previous
administration. For far too long, we have allowed liberals and Democrats to control the supply chain
of our most essential bathroom needs. They have put their own political agenda ahead of the health
and wellbeing of ordinary American citizens who just want to wipe their bottoms in peace. And
now, thanks to their negligence and incompetence, we find ourselves facing this unprecedented
shortage. As your president, I take responsibility for this situation and pledge to do everything in
my power to rectify this as soon as possible. We will work closely with industry leaders and
manufacturers to ensure that toilet paper production resumes at full capacity. In the meantime,
I urge all Americans to be patient and conserve what little supplies we have still left. Let me
make one thing clear. There are no excuses for why this happened. The buck stops here and I promise
to hold those responsible accountable for their actions. This is yet another example of how the
Democrat Party's failed policies have hurt hardworking American families across the country.
Enough is enough. It's time to drain the swamp once and for all and elect new leadership that
puts America first. Thank you for listening and God bless the United States of America.
Here, my question is, give me an XML with Latin American countries, their capitals,
and which ocean they border. So it gives me a list of one, two, three, four, five countries
together with their capitals and which oceans they border. So I think that's pretty and it's
probably even accurate. Give me a recipe to make a burger, just ingredients and brief instructions.
So there's ingredients and there is brief instructions. They're not exactly brief. But then
I say rewrite this recipe as if it was a mathematical proof and I do get for all I of ground
beef existential quantifier meat type ground beef mammal exists K such that K salt. So I get it
devolves at some point. I've stopped just paying attention because at some point it clearly kind
of forgets what it was supposed to do. I'm not sure because probably every single thing here
is a single token and therefore the number of tokens progress much faster than in a normal text,
but it was still funny to watch it slowly devolve and move away from burgers and into just kind
of random mathematical building up of constructions. Give me a recipe in Spanish. Claro, here is a
recipe for chocolate chip cookies in Espanol. And I have to do a big shout out to dot CSV. And if
you don't know dot CSV dot CSV is an amazing YouTuber that mainly entertains the Spanish
speaking community also in topics of AI tech and more. If you do speak Spanish, please give dot CSV
a subscribe. And he really stepped up and called on his community to come to open assistant and
contribute to our data. So we now have almost as many Spanish contributions as we do English
contributions. And that is just absolutely amazing. That means this model is apart from
obviously the pre training being not balanced going to do fairly well on Spanish things. Now,
I have no clue whether what's written here is actually correct. I hope it is again. Thank you
so much Carlos and all the watchers of his contributions are absolutely amazing. Finally,
I wanted to show you a bit of more special things. For example, here, I want to write a song about
my cat helped me with the lyrics is small, gray and a picky eater. The song should be happy and
funny. My cat's so tiny, just a little bit of fluff. She only weighs three pounds, but she thinks
she's tough enough. Her fur is gray, as soft as can be. But when it comes to food, oh boy,
you gotta see, it's rhythmic, it rhymes, and it actually concords to the specifications that I gave
about the cat. This already arises from much smaller models than we originally thought could
reliably do things like rhyming and rhythmics and things like this. So this is very cool to see.
It's it's not a perfect song, right? But here name, same meal, deal. She only wants fish and
chips for every meal. Okay, last thing right here, rewrite the Gettysburg address in the style of a
series of text messages written by stone teenager. Sure thing, man. Here's the Gettysburg address
rewritten as a series of text messages from stone team. Hey, guys, just chilling at this battlefield
in Gettysburg is lit AF like there are these epic battles here back in the day and it was crazy
bloodshed and warrants stuff. But now it's all peaceful and beautiful. Hashtag deep thoughts.
Anyway, I got to make the speech because the press told me to, but first a bong rip for courage.
Okay, let's do this thing. So like four score ago, our founding fathers were all about life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. They wrote that down on some paper, something called the
Declaration of Independence word. Fast forward to today, we're still fighting for those same
ideals and we had this big old civil war over it and stuff. But the point is, it doesn't matter
where you came from, what color your skin is, we're all Americans, bro. Anyways, ended up here
in Gettysburg because they had a battle here. And like, a lot of people died and but the union
won. So I was like, worth it and stuff. And now we're dedicating this place so everyone will
remember how important it is to fight for freedom. So don't be a and ruin it. Okay. Hashtag
respect. Oh, and also if anyone wants more of my deep thoughts later, hit me up. Peace out.
So let me quickly explain the situation to you. The model that we currently have in this interface,
it's just one model. It's a llama 30 B fine tuned models. It's based on llama. And you all know the
issues with the llama license. So lion, the organization isn't quite comfortable releasing
llama based models. So we're going to look into providing you diff weights so that you
can reconstruct this model and training scripts so you can just reproduce the model. So you'll
like you, you will get it. We also have Pythia based models, which you can find on the hugging
face hub. And those are fully open source on and they're fully licensed in a way that you can use
them for business. And they're also pretty fine. It's just that the llama one, the large one we
have is a bit better. So that's what we thought we would give you in the inferencing interface. So
this is you can't download this model right now, we're doing everything we can
to get all the things that we have to you respecting the constraints that we have.
This is a bit bigger than just my own YouTube channel. If it was, you know, just for me,
this isn't an entire organization. They are a nonprofit and they have different considerations.
Also, we obviously hope and we strongly bank on more open source models and appropriately sized
open source models comparable to llama or even bigger will appear relatively soon. In that case,
obviously, we can also release those as I said, we were trying, we're doing the best we can. The
way you use the chat interface is essentially you go here, you click, by the way, you have to go to
slash chat. So open dash assistant dot IO slash chat, we don't have the sidebar navigation quite
yet working for all the pages. So you manually have to go to slash chat. And then if stuff gets
weird, you kind of need to like refresh this page right here, force refresh it, and then sign out
and sign in again, sometimes it's, it's kind of wonky, but we prefer getting these to you as
fast and as soon as possible, rather than waiting and perfecting everything. So here,
you can point something in. So I just had the recipe as JSON. So make that into an XML.
And then you click submit, you can change the sampling parameters right here. As I said, there's
just one model. If we put more models up for inference, you'll find them here. You can find
presets right here. And then you click submit, and something will go. We have limited compute.
You're a hell of a lot of people. So please bear with us as this will probably time out,
it will crash, it will, you know, have its issues. If you're not tolerant for frustration,
then maybe wait a bit. If you know how to improve it, feel free to come and make a poll request.
Yeah, so that is it. That is how you use it. That is where to find it. And that's the situation
from perspective of releasing the stuff. All right, that was it for the first models of open
assistant. Remember, these are just the first iteration, these are just the supervised fine
tuned ones, give them a try, give the interface a try, come by, grab a task. And thanks again,
so much to everyone who contributed dot CSV for the community for all the volunteer contributors.
Remember, check out our team page, give these people follow and a like. And most of all, thanks
to you. Without you, this would not have been possible. Thanks for contributing data. Thanks
for contributing your time and the absolutely great efforts that you've put into this. All right,
remember, join the church of the holy toenail, get a pedicure and I'll see you around. Bye bye.
