Ted Cruz tweeted a segment, uh, video
that he likely didn't realize was from our show.
About two years ago, we went out and truly asked people.
We asked random people passing by
if they could name a country on, uh, a map we set up.
And many of them could not name a country.
It had nothing to do with their political affiliation.
But Ted Cruz posted it, and he wrote,
This is Bernie's base.
The same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great
because free stuff is cool,
and they have no idea how many countries have tried it
and utterly failed.
The antidote, facts, truth, and substance.
Of course, the guys talking about facts, truth, and substance
made that all up.
They were not Bernie supporters.
We don't know who they supported.
We didn't ask Bernie wasn't even running when we shot this.
But in fairness to Sweaty Teddy,
we decided to revisit this subject.
We went out in the street and we asked people
who do not support Bernie Sanders.
Sanders, in fact, quite the opposite.
We asked them to name a country, any country,
and this is how they did.
