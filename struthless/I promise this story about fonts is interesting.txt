Some of them are formal, others playful, some are scary, ironic, important, timeless,
trans, weird, wonderful, and some of them should not be used as subtitles for Avatar.
This is the story of Fox, but it's also the story of civilization, creativity,
innovation, power, obsession, war, love, and human connection.
Okay, I can hear it in my voice, and if right now you're thinking, dude,
that sounds like way too much to derive from jokemen, don't worry.
Because before I made this doco, that's what I thought too.
Also, just want to say a big thanks to Shopify for sponsoring this video.
More on them later though. For now, let's get weird.
So this video started because I asked myself a pretty simple question.
I was looking at the fonts on my computer and I just thought,
where do all of these fonts come from?
I thought the answer would be simple.
I thought it was just people designing stuff for word processors.
I pulled that thread and it was long before the computer,
so I was thinking, yeah, maybe it starts at the printing press.
But then I was like, well, how do we have all those symbols?
How do we know what to put in the printing press?
So then I pulled that thread, then I pulled another thread,
then I pulled another thread, and you know what?
Let's just say we have to go back. Like, way back.
Our story starts 10,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia.
Yup, we're starting at the start.
Basically, imagine you're a guy, you've got some goats,
they've got some chickens, but really what you want is oil.
Because you can't make a trade immediately,
you need something that represents chicken, goats, wheat, oil,
all of the stuff that you would be trading.
And so the ancient Mesopotamians made something called clay boulet,
basically big clay symbols that would represent various things.
They had them in about 16 categories.
So imagine you've got a goat stone or a grain stone or an oil stone.
Now, the reason that this is important to our story
is because of the mechanic that is going on here.
Things are being represented by the image of things.
Instead of chickens, you have a clay rock that says chickens.
And this idea of representing things with symbols
would go on to form the basis of cuneiform.
This is an actual fish. This is a pictogram of a fish.
This is that pictogram sideways. Here's it abstracted.
And this right here is cuneiform for fish.
Graphic symbols depicting things.
Cuneiform is some of the earliest forms we have of a formal written language.
In terms of font property,
is one thing that we can note here is that cuneiform was often read left to right
and the leading thesis is that more people were right-handed,
so they wouldn't smudge the clay that they were carving in as they wrote.
It's kind of cool.
But what is also very cool is that cuneiform
would eventually become one of the most famous ancient alphabets,
the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt.
So at this point in the video, you might be thinking, cool, man,
but what does this all have to do with the fonts of my computer?
Well, let me get there.
So time ticks on, various civilizations rise and fall,
and we get all of these cool little examples of alphabets popping up
in various forms of writing coming across the globe.
But our next stop in this history tour comes in ancient Greece.
What the Phoenicians did is they took a good look at the hieroglyphics,
now like, yeah, love that.
But what if we made the symbols even more abstract?
And what if we atomized their value
so that they could form larger words as opposed to just being symbols?
These 22 letters, these symbols carved into stone,
are called Greek lapidary letters.
It's an amazing innovation because you could write so many things,
and these stone carvings right here
are among the first formal use of Western letterforms.
Now, there were a couple of problems with this early alphabet from the Greeks.
They only had uppercase, and while it was written in rows,
the way that you would read it would change.
Sometimes you'd read left to right, other times right to left.
This is a format known as bustreffadon,
or as the Greeks called it, as the ox plows.
One second this way, one second that way.
You just wait till they hear about palindromes.
Do nine men interpret nine men I nod?
I wish so.
But yeah, basically there's a couple of kinks to be ironed out.
Enter the Romans.
Welcome to Rome.
Ancient Rome took those Greek lapidary letters,
and they turned them into their own alphabet.
The Roman alphabet, the Latin alphabet,
the one that we still kind of use today.
Now at this point in the story,
I've mostly been talking about alphabets,
but the Romans also did something in terms of font.
When they had their characters written out,
they gave them little hats and little feet.
These hats and feet are what we call serifs.
More on that later.
For now, let's talk about mass production.
Like with so many inventions, as the old phrase goes,
there's always something pretty cool going on in dynastic China.
What you're looking at right here is a movable type system.
It was invented in the 11th century in the Song Dynasty in China by Vixiang.
It was a typing machine that was made from ceramics
that allowed the user to reprint words onto clay.
It saved them time and meant that you can mass produce messaging.
Over the next four centuries,
there were certain innovations that were made
to this, mostly using materials.
The earliest metal ones that we've seen are from Korea in 1230.
But the machine that really got things going,
as you guessed it, was the printing press.
The year is 1440, and a goldsmith named Johannes Gutenberg
invents this contraption right here.
This printing press was a machine that could mass produce lettering.
The way it worked was you'd have these letters
that you'd put into a machine,
and it would almost act like a stamp on the paper,
and then that paper could go off and form books.
But books were around before 1440, I hear you say.
Yeah, that is true.
But those books were made from paper,
yeah, that is true.
But those books just weren't printed.
They were actually written by hand.
Imagine writing a Bible by hand.
In fact, this is a task that was done by monks,
and when they did write those Bibles by hand,
they would use a calligraphy style,
which we now know is black letter.
And because that was Gutenberg's reference for books,
his printing press's first ever font was a black letter font.
A grandchild of this might be like the old English font,
you know, the one that people get like their birth years tattoo on them with?
That?
In any case, what you are looking at right here
is the first ever printed book, the Gutenberg Bible,
with the first ever printed Roman typeface.
Black letter.
So I've got the printing press going on,
and it has its one typeface.
But 30 years later, we get a new innovation.
A fella called Nicholas Jensen comes along,
and he's like, man, I don't reckon that black letter stuff.
I just don't think it's that legible.
What if we changed it?
He was inspired by some of the cleaner letters,
the serif letters from the ancient Romans,
and so he created what he called a Roman typeface.
This less cluttered, more legible style
was naturally an immediate hit.
In fact, it's still kind of a hit today.
Open up a random book in your bookshelf,
and you'll probably see a Roman type font.
Now, as you can imagine, once this new font drops,
all of these other designers and innovators,
they also want to put their mark on history.
They want to contribute.
And what we start to see is a rise in foundries all over Europe,
places whose job it was to make typefaces.
The humanist spirit that was driving the Italian Renaissance
also came with its own style of writing.
Curse of a humanistica.
The thing that paved the way for italics.
So meanwhile, right, in mid-century 16th France,
there's this other fella, this designer called Claude Garamond,
who kept writing like this.
This elegant style was so revolutionary
that we still actually use his font to this day.
Garamond. Great work, Claude.
So over the next few centuries,
we see designers like Fleishman, Baskerville, Bedoni,
but all of these designers had one thing in common.
While their fonts were amazing and brilliant,
they were still riffing on a familiar theme. Serifs.
It's a variation on the same font that the Romans were using,
almost two millennia prior.
But what about something simpler?
Sands. Without. Serif. Serif.
They didn't have serifs.
Also known as grotesque.
Now, Sandserif was actually used,
but it didn't enter the printing game until 1816.
And this is partially just because people didn't see it
as formal enough to warrant its own typeface
in a printing press.
Until this guy enters, William Carlson IV.
What up?
What you're looking at here is Carlson Egyptian,
the first known Sandserif typeface.
Pretty cool. I actually really like it.
So 12 years later, right?
This other dude, Vincent Figgins,
he makes the second ever Sandserif typeface.
And as you can see, they are completely different.
The first obvious difference is the line weight.
The Figgins font is huge,
which means, oh yeah, it commands attention.
So in the 1800s, we're starting to see the rise
of advertisements and posters.
And for these people making this type of communication,
this Sandserif font was a godsend.
It commanded attention.
It dictated page hierarchy.
And of course, it was legible at a decent distance.
So all of these practical uses,
plus the fact that the aesthetic just said new,
it made Sandserif get pretty popular pretty damn quick.
We all know Muk of the Artist,
but let's talk about Muk of the Typographer.
This is from an era known as Art Nouveau,
which translates in French to literally new art.
Stylistically, it had a lot of organic elements
and lots of plants and nature,
which were contrast with big, harsh lines.
And all of the typefaces that came along with it
naturally followed suit.
The mix of ornate, gooey lines with straight, harsh lines
was just perfect for the Latin alphabet.
And as for the impact of Art Nouveau,
it sent a message to designers all around the world.
You can morph the letters more than you think,
and they will still be legible.
After years and years of focusing so heavily
on the function of typography,
we now put form in the spotlight.
And naturally, some people used form as a weapon.
Q Marinetti and his futuristic criticism
of English traditions,
of course written in chunky Sandserif type.
This designer Marinetti in this letter,
he calls out basically all of the old British stuff
and he calls it the cream of snobbish earth.
Typographically, that snobbery could be seen
in a new font that had just hit the streets.
In 1931, in Britain, there was this paper, The Times,
that commissioned a guy called Stanley Morrison
to create their new body copy typeface.
And he was like, well, I guess I'll base it
on maybe like those old Roman letters,
that clarity, and it's for The Times.
You know what, I'm gonna call it Times New Roman.
Oh yeah, little did he know that he was gonna create
one of the most popular fonts of all time, bonkers.
Now back to Marinetti in that letter, right?
So this all comes at the dawn of the First World War,
which as you can imagine, plays a major role in our story.
So during the war, you've got all these futurists
and artists and creative people who all need a safe haven
and quite a lot of them end up fleeing to Zurich.
Now in Zurich, you've got all these diverse backgrounds,
various influences, you've got all these bright people,
but you've also got this backdrop of chaos.
The world around them is falling to pieces.
So naturally, this breeds a new movement.
Dadaism.
This is a Dadaist typographic poster by Ilya Zdanovich.
Notice the combination of serifs, Sandserifs and Dingbats.
What are Dingbats, you ask?
So do you remember the whole printing press thing?
Basically when they would make pages,
they might put these like ornate symbols and stuff
at the top and the bottom and they were their own stamps.
Dingbats.
So if that's the great grandfather,
the great grandchild is Wingdings, but we'll get there later.
For now, for the Dadaists, they're symbols.
Why symbols?
There's a pretty good Marcel Duchamp quote
that kind of sums it up.
The only thing worse than a serif typeface
is a Sandserif typeface.
This was the attitude and it led to quite a lot of people
doing things like using punctuation instead of letters,
as well as other people just generally criticizing
the limitations of the Roman alphabet.
Now, meanwhile, a couple of borders east, right?
We've got some pretty cool stuff going on.
We have the Russian typographic revolution.
Artists like Vavara Stepanova ushered in constructivist designs.
This meant big, harsh geometry, quite a lot of symmetry
and harsh, blocky fonts that would conform to both it
as well as the page.
Complimenting Stepanova was Alexander Rodchenko.
His ability to blend graphics and shapes and text,
it was just honestly flawless.
While I know the roots of modern graphic design are debatable,
I always feel like Rodchenko and Stepanova
should get just a little bit more credit.
Just a little bit more, you know?
So with all of these different aesthetics going on,
was there a golden standard?
Was there a unified way where everybody agreed
that this was the way that we should write a letter?
Well, those were the questions that were asked
by pioneers of the Bauhaus movement.
They sought to create a uniform, perfect aesthetic,
which, of course, came with a uniform, perfect typeface.
Cue this guy, Herbert Bayer.
In 1925, he set out to create the universal typeface,
a geometric alphabet based only on bars and circles.
So this Herbert guy has got this idea,
which was basically as we progress into a society
that uses more and more technology,
we would need a universally accepted way
to communicate letters in the most efficient manner.
The great grandchild of Bayer's dream font
can still be found today on computers everywhere,
and it's simply called Bauhaus.
What I love about this movement
is that within it is a genuine hope for utopia,
but sadly, utopia didn't happen.
World War II did.
After the Second World War,
thanks to constructivism and Bauhaus,
we start to get a rise of a new style,
this sort of Swiss modernism.
The key feature of modernism is that it is without ornament.
No frills.
You can see it best in a font like Helvetica.
Now, because this Swiss style was just embracing modernism,
what it meant is that there were no ties to the old world,
which also meant that there were no ties
to that huge tragedy that just happened, the Second World War.
But it was actually quite well understood across the globe.
Because of this, the Swiss style is also sometimes known
as the international typographic style.
For a minute, there was this glimmer of hope
that this international Swiss style would unite people
into that utopia that Bauhaus had dreamed of.
But ironically, one of the biggest adopters
of the international style was the American corporation.
TV shows, record companies, and advertisers
all embraced it wholeheartedly,
and you can see it so much in the pop culture from that era.
This isn't to say it was bad.
It was amazing.
From the 50s and the 60s,
we get these cool grotesque letters,
mid-century letters, the droopy kind of hippie font
that sort of looks a bit Art Nouveau,
this Art Deco revival, Western Slab Serif,
even cool sci-fi stuff.
It was a cool time for graphic design,
which means it's probably about the time
that we bring up Paul Rand.
It is quite hard to properly articulate
just how influential Paul Rand is
on the world of graphic design.
So I'm just going to use a Steve Jobs quote.
Steve Jobs called Paul Rand
the greatest living graphic designer,
obviously when he was alive, rest in peace.
And looking at his work, it's not hard to say why.
Paul Rand's theory was that graphic design
had this amazing ability to be a universal language
based on simplicity and geometry.
He just loved it.
In fact, he loved it so much
that he even changed his name.
It's a sad reason why he did.
He had a Jewish name, Peretz Rosenbaum,
and he angle-sized it to be
a little bit more Madison Avenue friendly.
But when he did pick this name,
he thought, four letters, four letters.
That'll make a great graphic symbol.
He even put graphic design in his freaking name, man.
Wow.
So that's a very brief overview
of the international style
and the gigantic design boom that it created.
But as you can imagine,
not everybody was on board with this futuristic dream.
And they really, really wanted you to know it.
The font rebels are back.
Critics of the international style,
they felt like all this clean, flawless modernity.
It was trying to say that life was perfect,
and life just wasn't.
Enter the pop artist of the 1960s,
most notably Andy Warhol,
people who were on a mission to satirize modernism
in all of its icon-heavy glory.
Now, it's one thing to satirize a movement,
but in the 1970s,
there emerged a group of people
who wanted to just rebel against it all together.
Punks.
Remember that guy, Marinetti,
who called the old English stuff snobbish?
Punks were feeling the same about modernism.
They felt like they just, I don't know,
lacked humanity, lacked realness.
There were no mistakes.
What's up with that?
So the punks rebelled.
And typographically,
we can see it really clearly
through things like zines and album covers.
These zines were full of handwriting,
typographic errors,
and letraset transfers that broke all the rules.
And while we're on the topic,
let's talk about Jamie Breed.
He quite literally tore apart designs
to make new ones.
And in doing so,
he sent a very powerful message.
Mainstream culture sucks,
and we're here to destroy it.
God save the queen.
All right.
Quick little break to talk about this shirt.
So the first thing you might notice
is, wow, what a silly and fun font.
How whimsical.
Second thing you might notice
is it says,
Struthless.
That's my freaking channel name
because that's my freaking shirt, baby.
And where do I sell that shirt?
Shopify.
That's right.
We are going into today's relevant sponsor.
So Shopify, if you don't know,
they're a commerce platform.
Definitely come across the Shopify website online.
They power like millions of businesses
in hundreds of different countries.
But what is really cool at the moment,
if you have been thinking lately,
damn, I wouldn't mind starting my own shop.
You know, getting creative,
building little something, something.
Well, Shopify right now
has something called a starter plan.
What this is,
is you can make your own shop,
literally like within minutes,
without code,
put up products,
use all the tools,
for just $5.
If it goes great,
you then have the option to upgrade it
and turn it into a full store.
If it doesn't,
hey, gave it a shot.
And that's pretty cool too.
If you're keen,
if you want to build a shop for $5,
use this link,
which I will put in the description,
and enjoy.
There you are,
back to the video.
So what happens next?
What is next in our typographic story?
Welcome to the 1980s.
There was New Wave,
radical modernism,
8-Bit,
and things that were being inspired,
not by what technology could do,
but by the constraints that they put on the designers,
and of course,
the rise of the graphic designer
getting taken seriously as an artist.
And I think the person who probably best
embodied this era of graphic design
and typography
was Thibaut Kalman.
Kalman had this strong belief
that design was a path to ethical justice.
He was the editor of Colors Magazine,
which was a magazine dedicated to uniting the world
and promoting social good
and making actual change.
He would vocally oppose working
with unethical companies,
and who goes far as to call out designers who would.
He was a provocateur and a bad boy,
but ultimately,
he was also a strong moral compass
in the design landscape.
I think his legacy lies
not as much in his work as in who he was.
Sure, he was a typographer,
sure, he was a designer,
but because he was so outspoken with his beliefs,
he made the job of graphic design
not only known,
but really, really cool.
And this is basically around the time
that Hollywood and TV get on board.
Let's say you got a quirky character,
but you also want to give him a professional streak.
What do you do?
I'm a graphic designer.
I'm a graphic designer.
Graphic designer.
Graphic design.
Graphic design.
You're a graphic designer.
You must be really artistic.
And with great graphic design comes great typography.
Uncle Ben, sans.
So you've got all this graphic design grounds,
well,
and people are getting more curious about the profession.
But the thing that made it really take off
was a certain guy in a certain turtleneck.
Steve Brecken Jobs,
the guy who founded Apple,
the guy who thought Paul Ram was so brilliant,
and the guy who inspired my 2015 Halloween costume.
Sexy Steve Jobs.
And he was also the guy who,
yes, as the legend goes,
took a calligraphy class in college,
and then a couple of years later decided,
you know what?
Computer should have all of those silly words on him, too.
He brought fonts to the Apple computer.
To do this,
he got a designer slash art historian
slash all-around genius called Susan Kair.
She's responsible for a bunch of fonts
named after a bunch of cities like Chicago, Geneva,
Monaco, Los Angeles.
And she's also the designer
behind the happy Mac symbol.
What a resume.
Steve Jobs gets a lot of credit
for this font revolution moment,
but I feel like the designer should, too.
And Susan Kair is clearly one of the best.
So as you can imagine,
fonts go onto computers,
and basically this is like a huge typographic explosion.
Imagine it's the late 80s
and you're just a casual user of your computer,
and then all of a sudden you're like,
whoa, dude,
I can change the writing on this word doc?
That is wild.
I know it sounds normal to us,
but back then it gave people a lot of agency
when it came to designing stuff.
It really put the power into their hands.
Now, I have a bit of a confession.
I have been using the words
font and typeface relatively interchangeably
up until this point.
And that's actually not technically correct.
What we know as a font, like a computer font,
that's actually just called a typeface.
And a font, technically,
is the way that you alter that typeface.
So things like line weight, italics, boldness, even size.
Technically, aerial size 12
is a different font to aerial size 14.
Now, the reason that these two words
are confused in our modern day vocabulary
is because of Steve Brickin' Jobs.
He, when he put them onto his Apple computer,
he was just like, you know what,
let's call them fonts.
And I don't know whether for him
it was a genuine mistake
or whether he just liked the word fonts
and was just like, screw it, they're fonts now.
See ya.
But in any case, Steve Jobs
is why we call typefaces fonts.
But before we critique his mistake,
we also must remember that putting fonts
on personal computers was pretty much
the biggest typographic shift
since the printing press.
So what do people do with all this power?
Stylistically, Grunge was pretty much
the polar opposite of the international style.
This is David Carson.
He was a surfer from California
who sprung into the spotlight
when he was made head graphic designer for Ray Gunn Magazine.
With this alternative publication,
David Carson turned graphic design on its head.
Carson saw type in pretty much
like the least functional way possible.
He saw text as like an image
or a texture or a decoration.
There's this one time,
this is like one of those graphic design legends
that you always hear
where basically Ray Gunn Magazine
had this interview with Brian Ferry
and Carson and the editors took one look
and they're like, dude, this interview's super boring.
So Carson's like, I've got an idea.
How about instead of printing this in a normal font,
we print the entire interview in Zapf dingbats.
Basically windings, symbols.
He really didn't care if you could read it or not.
Legibility was not at the forefront of his priorities.
So just like Grunge music,
Carson had his critics as well.
They would say things like,
ah, you're killing the legibility of typography.
Ah, it sucks.
Nobody likes this.
But just like with Grunge music,
Carson doubled down.
And yeah, it worked.
This typography, this design aesthetic,
it gets cool.
And then all of a sudden corporate America wants a slice.
To appeal to the youth,
all they had to do was use a Carson like aesthetic, right?
How do you do, fellow kids?
But Carson had a career to make
and he ended up working with a lot of these people.
Here's a Grunge piece that was literally made for Microsoft.
How cool is that?
And speaking of Microsoft,
I think it's about time that we talk about it.
The elephant in the room.
Are you ready?
The thing that happened in 1994?
Some of you might feel a temptation to skip this section.
Some of you might feel a temptation to call me out
or drag me or try and cancel me
for saying the words that I'm about to say.
But I promise you,
if you can stomach them,
we will all be better because of it.
In 1994, Microsoft came out
with one of the most iconic fonts of all time,
Comic Sans.
I don't know.
He has terrible taste in fonts.
Now, a lot of us today,
we see Comic Sans as a meme.
It's sort of the font that it's fun to hate
or the font that you might use
if you're trying to convey irony.
But in researching this,
I found out that the impact of Comic Sans is like
way bigger than I thought.
So this dude here, his name is Vincent Conair.
He made fonts like Trebuchet, Wild Style, Magpie, Webdings.
Actually, one of his dingbats from that font
would eventually become this emoji.
Side note, this is the greatest emoji of all time
and yes, this is a hill I will die on.
And he also made,
this is super random,
but the Ministry of Sound logo.
And yes, Vincent Conair also made Comic Sans.
The story of how it came to be
was basically it was a solution
to a problem that I guess a designer
would probably notice before many other people.
There was this dog called Rover
who when you would start up a Microsoft computer,
the dog's job was to guide you through
how to use the computer.
And basically the dog had these speech bubbles,
but Vincent Conair was like,
man, sort of not that appropriate
for this dog to be talking
in this harsh times new Roman.
You know, it's a bit formal for a dog.
Woof, woof, sir.
So he was like, well,
let's make something a bit more playful.
And he was a fan of comic books like DC, Watchmen.
And he's like, maybe I can make a font
sort of based on comic books.
Comic Sans blew up immediately.
It was just an instant here.
And the reason is, well,
let's say you are making a birthday invite
for a four year old.
Hello, children.
Nah, we're not going to use the times new Roman.
It just doesn't work.
We need something that tonally suits
playful or cheerful or whimsical.
You got church flyers, school certificates,
friendly emails, birthday cards.
There were so many pieces of writing all around the world
that just didn't warrant formality.
And Comic Sans was the missing puzzle piece.
But of course, with popularity comes haters.
Maybe you were one of them.
There's lots and lots of examples of people
inappropriately using Comic Sans,
which is such a strange sentence,
but I'll just give you one
which I think illustrates it best.
In 2012, there was this Dutch World War II memorial
that was set up, right?
And you know what font they chose?
Comic Sans.
Now, eventually they would scrap it
and the people who made it said it was for legibility,
but I think we all know why.
But even in that act,
it's such a strange graphic design question.
How is the way that you write a letter
somehow inappropriate?
That's weird, right?
Now, Comic Sans on the more positive end of the spectrum
actually has a couple of really cool features
that make it quite practical.
For example, it doesn't really use mirrored glyphs.
So a glyph might be like a bee,
which when mirrored might look like a lowercase D.
Comic Sans didn't do that.
They had two individual letters.
And because of this,
Comic Sans is really good for people with dyslexia.
And also, Comic Sans really opened the floodgates
for all of the fun 90s text moments.
You know, Comic Sans warped so that word art could fly,
so that all of the crazy fun 90s stuff could soar.
Thanks, Comic Sans.
Now, of course, this is probably a time to mention
that it is not the only controversial font.
Let's have a little moment for the rest of them.
Papyrus by Chris Costello.
Trayon by Carol Twombly, aka the movie poster font.
Jokerman by Andrew K. Smith.
And CurlsMT by Karl Krossgrove and Steve Madison.
Just taking a moment.
Just a little moment for them.
Now, to sum up this section on Comic Sans,
I think I'm just going to go ahead and quote
Vincent Connair himself.
If you love Comic Sans, you don't know much about typography.
But if you hate Comic Sans,
you really don't know much about typography either.
Amen.
The 2000s.
We're to now in our typographic journey.
You know, we've got fonts on computers,
Comic Sans starting to get a little couple of haters.
We've got the Y2K aesthetic.
There's a bit going on.
Mostly the thing that defines this era is technology.
Digital design was getting easier.
Your company's like Adobe pumping money
into these products that were just
facilitating more complex designs.
And from that, we've got more complex typography.
The 2000s saw a lot of 3D lettering,
scumorphism and maximalism.
On top of this, there were far more articulated
trend cycles.
If one tech company had a cool 3D logo,
then all of a sudden, all the tech companies
had a cool 3D logo.
Or if a rapper was like, you know what,
I'm going to make all my slabs of font
have this gold stroke and be encrusted with diamonds.
Yeah, a bunch of other rappers followed suit.
So if that's the 2000s, we all know what happens next, right?
Right?
We're back here now.
Neat.
So the internet starts to hit critical mass and maturity.
So between that, all these font sharing websites,
indie foundries popping up, memes,
and of course, Photoshop piracy.
Typography starts to have a big moment.
One interesting font to mention here
is one that had a revival.
It was created in the 1960s by Jeffrey Lee,
but it found a new home online, Impact.
Or I should say it's the typeface Impact,
and the font was white stylized with that black stroke.
Impact font.
It was the font for memes.
That's huge.
That's like getting your dream job as a font.
The other very important macroeconomic force to mention
is hipsters.
Yeah?
Hipsters bought two main movements into the spotlight.
The first was the revival of the sign writing aesthetic.
Multiple clashing fonts designed to look good
and compliment each other in one big sign.
The fonts that defined this era weren't the ones
that came standard with your computer.
They were the ones that you downloaded from the internet.
It was fonts like Babis New by Rayu Chitsukunawa.
Or Lobster by Pablo Impallari.
Every burger shop font ever.
And the smooth and chunky glorious Cubano by Charles Van Der Water.
So if that's the first movement, what was the second?
Sleek minimalism.
That international style is back.
Let's go Switzerland.
Woo!
Like I said before, no font epitomized this movement
better than Helvetica.
Helvetica was created in 1957 by the Haas-type foundry
as part of that international typographic style.
And true to its name, it is very much international.
We've since seen Helvetica in multiple different alphabets.
While I know that this video is mostly about the Roman alphabet,
Helvetica is one of those ones that transcends.
But the real question is why did this font from the 50s
suddenly get a breath of new life in the 2010s?
The answer is once again,
Steve freaking jobs.
Yep, Helvetica was the main choice of the Apple iOS pretty much up until 2015.
Which of course gave it a huge cop following,
a documentary and visibility in so many other corporate identities.
Helvetica was used as a corporate word mark for the following companies.
But of this international age,
the most important thing was just how accessible typeface creation became.
Technology just got real good and anybody could make a font.
In the same way anyone can now just make a YouTube video.
It's really, really cool.
Yep, Cambrian explosion of fonts.
There are indie designers making fonts upon fonts upon fonts.
And it is amazing.
And honestly, it's kind of beautiful
because I feel like that is the whole aim of typography.
It's sharing, it's communicating, and it's collaborating.
And it's also probably, I think, how we should sum this all up.
From clay carvings and cuneiform to comic sans and cubano,
I feel like the aim of typography has always sat alongside with the aim of the idealist.
Symbols were originally made to facilitate trade and a better life,
and they ushered in civilization.
Fonts are one of those things that, honestly, before starting this,
I sort of overlooked as just a nice quirky feature of design.
And I realize now that's because they're meant to be overlooked.
When they're at their best, they are facilitating information.
Half the time, fonts are working without anybody even knowing that they're working.
So I guess the right place to end this is by answering that original question that I asked.
Where do all these fonts come from?
They come from Dynastic China, the Phoenicians, the Renaissance,
they come from Switzerland, they come from you and me,
they come from people on the internet uploading fonts that they think are cool.
And what do all these people have in common?
They all contributed to a multiple millennia long ongoing mission.
The mission to connect.
They all knew that words could only ever say so much,
and so they morphed the glyphs to say even more.
These people were so eager to convey meaning with words,
they looked beyond the words themselves.
And yeah, the written word, the actual content,
it really does show our desire to communicate.
But fonts, fonts show just how deep that desire goes.
So I guess what I am trying to say is this.
The next time you feel like humanity's doomed,
we're all isolated and everything is going downhill,
just uh, I don't know man.
Stare a little longer at something that you've overlooked.
Because that desire to connect and the depth of that desire,
you can see it in everything.
Fonts and all.
