About six months ago, I was sat in my living room, in this living room, lost in the endless
comforting embrace of tiktoks for you, Fiend. I hadn't had the app very long at this point,
and its algorithm was still trying to figure me out. It had tried immersing me in book
talk videos, in clips of rich white guys crying on podcasts, and in endless footage of Taylor Swift
concerts. Which, that last one wasn't so bad. But this particular afternoon, the algorithm decided
that what I really needed to see was a steady stream of AI context. In fact, it must have been
December 2022. Because following the release of The Darling, Mid Journey and Stable Diffusion in
the spring and summer of that year, OpenAI had just unveiled its chat GPT tool, and it was a
lighting up conversation across the internet. Opinion was pretty split. Some saw an innovation
on the scale of the Gutenberg Press or Spinning Jenny. Others questioned the ethics of training
these tools on the work of artists and writers who hadn't agreed to their ideas being used
as training data. While some fantasized about whole professions being made obsolete, others
mocked mid journeys, then inability to draw hands, or chat GPT's tendency to just outright lie.
On tiktok, or at least my tiktok, however, there was little dissent. Users were hyped,
and there was a particular use case that they had in mind for these new tools.
There's an effortless way to use AI to make over $10,000 a month.
This may be the best way to make money with AI. These three AI apps should be illegal,
and if you use them correctly, you can make a lot of money.
My first response was to very consciously try and swipe these videos away as quickly as possible
in an effort to teach tiktoks algorithm, but I wasn't actually all that interested in using AI
to write computer-generated posts for my slightly shady, keyword-stuffed, affiliate-link-infested
health boots blog. This strategy had worked pretty well for stemming the flow of podcast clips,
after all. But these over-enthusiastic financial freedom seekers had managed to plant something
in my brain. In the days, weeks, and months since, my online feeds have continued to be
peppered with posts boasting about how these new AI tools can be used to make a quick buck.
Perhaps the weirdest part of this trend came when I opened up Notion,
the task management app that we use to keep track of our various projects.
When Notion began rolling out its Notion AI feature in February 2023,
one feature jumped out at me. It was the option to highlight a piece of text and select Make Longer.
Now, I've tried long and hard to think of a genuine, productive use case for such a function,
and I just can't. No piece of text, whether it be a novel, a news report, or a corporate evaluation,
has ever been made better by being gratuitously padded out to increase the word count. There's
a reason that writers are instructed to kill your darlings, not force your darlings to multiply
until a single pithy sentence has become an unwieldy mass of adverbs and adjectives.
Brevity is the soul of wit. Long-windedness is the soul of online recipes which are trying to
cram in as many keywords for search engine optimization as possible before just telling
you how to make the damn lasagna. Taken together, it was hard not to find all of this a bit depressing.
There are obviously plenty of ethical questions to be asked about how these AI tools are both
trained and implemented. Nevertheless, one has to admit they're pretty impressive.
There may be plenty of flaws to be ironed out, but the fact that I can just ask chat GPT to
write a scene from a stage play in which Albert Einstein argues with Bugs Bunny that who should
get the kids after their divorce is pretty cool, right? It was kind of depressing, though.
But faced with this new technology, with all kinds of possibilities for making people's
lives easier and better, so much discursive space was being taken up by people for whom the real
excitement lay in how it could be used to further automate their low effort online scripts.
Since noticing this, I haven't been able to stop thinking about the extent to which we
increasingly seem to be surrounded by grifts. I reckon a good third of the ads that I get on
YouTube are pictures for money making schemes which sound a little too good to be believed.
There have been weeks when I've seen this woman more than members of my actual family.
Neither is it a surprise anymore when a friend brings up dropshipping or foreign exchange trading
or some other questionable investments. At the same time, there's been a big upswing in
anti-grifter content. Whether it's Mike Winnett or Dan Olson or Mooncat or Coffee Zilla,
scam busting has become its own genre. We love to hear the juicy details of whatever scheme is
currently fleecing the easily fooled. Whether we're among those actually getting caught up in these
schemes or whether we're simply watching on voyeuristically from the sidelines then,
grifts, grifters and grifting seem to have taken over. They are the zeitgeist.
And so, I want to explore how it is that these blow rent, often cringe inducing grifts,
gain such a stranglehold over us. We are going to look a little bit at how some of these schemes
work but I'm mostly interested in why. What is it that's currently causing so many people
to get caught out by the preponderance of so-called passive income gurus and what is it
that draws the rest of us in to watch? Because while most of these schemes are the swindlers
which promote them might initially appear pretty small time and marginal, I think they're actually
pretty revealing about the world in which we live. It's certainly the case that you can learn a lot
about a historical moment from the heroes it raises up. The biographies of figures like Jeff Bezos,
Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg certainly tell us a great deal about the social and economic system
which has produced them. But one thing I've become convinced of during the four months or so that
I've been working on this project is that you can learn even more about an era through examining
its grifts. There's an effortless way to use AI to make over $10,000 a month. How I make $1,000 a day
selling on Etsy. That GBT doesn't really help you with money online. This is how I plan to make
more. I'm going to show you how to make more. Here are the four best passive income ideas. Start making
a passive income. In order to contextualize the rise of the online grift, we first need to talk for
a brief moment about the NBC sitcom The Office, which will make sense shortly, I promise. See,
The Office premiered in the spring of 2005, which in hindsight was an interesting time to launch a
show so explicitly focused on our relationship with work. As some of you might remember,
that relationship was about to change significantly.
But before we get to all of that, The Office. The Office exists in a tradition of comedies
inspired by situations which, in the hands of a different writing team, might be framed as deeply
tragic. Viewed through the eyes of the show's audience surrogate, Jim, the Scranton branch of
Dunder Mifflin, is a kind of hell. It's not just that he's surrounded by some deeply strange
colleagues, but that, on top of this, the work itself is kind of dystopian. When he's not
getting involved in some classic comedy hijinks, Jim's job is to sell paper.
My job is to speak to clients on the phone about
quantities and type of copier paper, you know, whether we can supply it to them, whether they can
pay for it, and
um, I'm boring myself just talking about this. It's not that businesses don't need paper.
They do. And they have to buy it from somewhere. But paper is paper. And Dunder Mifflin doesn't
even manufacture the paper itself. They're just middlemen. If Jim and Pam and Michael and Dwight
vanish from the face of the earth, their customers would barely even notice. They'd find a new
supplier within minutes and the world would keep on turning. Which, if you're Jim, has to be kind
of depressing. Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company, then
this would be my career. And, uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front
of a train. This kind of anxiety that one might find oneself trapped in an unfulfilling and maybe
even objectively pointless white collar job was pretty widespread in the mid to late 2000s.
It was best summed up a few years later by the anthropologist David Graber in an article titled
on the phenomenon of bullshit jobs. Graber wrote that it's as if someone were out there making
up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working. Like Jim Halpert, many white collar
workers viewed their stable, reasonably well compensated office jobs through the same lens
that others would view a life sentence. It's against this backdrop that in 2007, the businessman,
blogger and future podcaster Tim Ferriss released this book, The 4-Hour Workweek.
The 4-Hour Workweek didn't invent the online grift whole cloth. As Ferriss acknowledges,
the book is essentially a collection of money-making tips which had already been floating around in
the so-called blogger spin. But it was instrumental in bringing mainstream attention to a new set
of approaches to using the internet to get filthy rich. Or at least trying to. The 4-Hour Workweek
is pitched as a method for escaping the nine to five. And in this way, it responds to many of the
same cultural anxieties about work as the office. In Tim Ferriss's eyes, there are few fates worse
than being a quote, three-piece zombie or a high-paid coffee fetcher. In fact, as Ferriss sees it,
it's not just bureaucratic white collar work which sucks. He writes that,
for most people, somewhere between six and seven billion of them, the perfect job is the one that
takes the least time. The vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an
unending source of fulfillment. Luckily, Ferriss has a way out of this hellscape of cubicles and
coffee machines. Tim Ferriss's promise in the 4-Hour Workweek is, as the title would suggest,
that he can help you whittle your working week down from the usual 40 hours to just four. At the
same time, he suggests he can help you increase your income from, well, whatever it is now,
to $40,000 plus per month, or maybe $60,000 per month, or maybe $5,000 an hour. The exact figures
seem to change from chapter to chapter, but the point is that you're gonna be rich. What's his
plan for achieving this goal? Well, I don't think it would be doing the book justice if I didn't
summarize things with the appropriate level of brinado and obnoxiousness. So, without further ado,
let me explain. Hi, my name's Tom Nicholas, writer, video creator, entrepreneur. Welcome to my
Nonsense Guide to Tim Ferriss's Guide to Escaping the Nine to Five. Dobby is free! Step one.
Let's kick things off by boosting your productivity. See, Tim Ferriss reckons that a solid 50 to 80%
of your daily tasks are a complete waste of time. That's almost unbelievable, right? Well,
his solution is simple. Just don't do them. Non-urgent emails from colleagues?
Don't answer them. Clients with small orders? No, thank you. Disciplinary meetings about your
dismissive attitude? No messia! Congratulations! You just freed up at least half your time,
and it was as simple as just not doing stuff. Step two. Next up, you're gonna convince
your boss to let you work from home. This is probably gonna be a whole bunch easier since the
old rona swept through town, am I right? That's true. But our goal in working from home isn't just
to avoid novel zoonotic diseases. No, no, no. You're gonna leverage your newfound productivity
to finish your day job in half the time it used to take. And guess what? We're gonna use the rest
of that time to embark on some new money-making ventures. Incliable! Sure, the HR department
might call this something boring like gross misconduct or a breach of your contract,
but Tim Ferriss prefers to call it liberation, which just sounds so much cooler. Step three.
Three, three, three, three. It's time to start your very own business, but not just any business.
You're gonna focus in on creating a niche product-based direct-to-consumer sales business.
Think Casper mattresses, or Uber's, or the human fuel, the niche of the better.
How about a range of pasta sources marketed specifically at dog walks or letter boxes
just for snowboarders? Actually, not those. Those were pretty good, actually. All you've got to do
is set up a website to sell your new product, place a few ads on Google and in niche hobbyist
magazines, and wait for the sales to come rolling in, which they definitely will,
because you're a bloody legend to whom only good things happen. Step four.
Four. Now get this for a stroke of genius. With a few neat tricks, you're gonna completely
automate your new business, transforming it into a magical money-making machine.
So, Magnifique, you're gonna use a specialist manufacturer who's able to make each order on
demand and ship it direct to your customers. And when it comes to those mind-numbing admin tasks,
you're gonna hire a bunch of cheap virtual assistants in the global south,
which is, uh, all fine, and there is no ethical questions to be asked about at all.
Please don't ask any ethical questions. Assuming nothing goes wrong, which, why would it?
You've now got yourself a completely automated business, which only takes minimal levels of
effort to maintain. Voila! Step five. One, two, three, four, five.
Congratulations! You're now a super successful businessman. Or like, a per-person, I guess.
It's time to wave goodbye to that boring old day job. Au revoir! Oh, and now you're gonna move to
Asia. Why, you ask? Well, yeah, this bit might seem a little random. But look, even if you follow
the four-hour workweek plan down to the letter, your business is only gonna rake in a measly
four hundred and eighty thousand dollars a year. Or if we adjust for inflation since the book was
published, a poultry, uh, eight hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars a year. Which,
what are you, some kind of street urchin? You deserve the rock star lifestyle, my friend.
And that means moving to a low income country where favorable exchange rates will allow you
to live like a king. Although Ferris actually suggests that we should avoid, uh, all countries
in Africa, the Middle East or Central and South America, except in Costa Rica and Argentina.
So I guess you better start learning Thai. If you manage to conquer these five steps,
and the many dozens of sub-steps, then congratulations. You are now a member of the
New Rich. Do you on the beach? Because the beers are on you.
As you've probably already gathered, Tim Ferris' tendency is to present his money-making model
as entirely foolproof. There's little acknowledgement anywhere within the book that any part of his
multi-stage plan could ever go wrong. Even if it does, he has a pretty blasé attitude to the
potential consequences. In the section where he encourages readers to negotiate a remote
working contract with their employer, he writes that, if you jump ship or get fired, it isn't hard
to eliminate most expenses temporarily and live on savings for a brief period. From renting out
your home to refinancing or selling it, there are options. There are always options. At which
point I have to remind you that this book was published in 2007. Let's talk about the speed
with which we are watching this market deteriorate. As with any business, there are, of course,
all kinds of ways in which this plan might fail. But the biggest gap in Ferris' scheme
is also the most important thing for a product-based business to get right.
See, Ferris has the tendency to get lost in the weeds of some fairly unimportant parts of his plan,
which, you know, I can relate. This is a book which goes into minute detail about how and when
you should check your emails. It gives you scripted suggestions for how to convince your boss to
let you work from home. It even finds space for a series of confidence-building challenges,
one of which involves randomly lying face down in the middle of the street to, I don't know,
learn how to assert dominance or something. But for a book which presents itself as an
all-encompassing method for leveraging a product-based business to get filthy rich,
there is precious little advice on how to conceive of the product itself.
The few ideas Ferris does suggest are absolutely terrible. One is that you license an already
existing product and put your own label on it, similar to what supermarkets do with own brand
cereal. But this not only means entering a market which probably has a considerable amount of competition,
it likely also means sacrificing a huge chunk of your potential profit to the licensor. Ferris's
other suggestion is that you write a book. But don't worry if you don't really have any useful
knowledge to share with the world, you can always quote, create the content yourself,
often via paraphrasing and combining points from several books on a topic. Or if that seems too
hard for you, you can simply repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject to
copyright protection. So, essentially selling PDFs of Moby-Tick. In summary, the four-hour workweek
might be, as its blurb suggests, a step-by-step guide to living the life of your dreams. But
given that the most important step is to simply, you know, found Hello Fresh, none of its
particularly achievable. At risk of sounding like a McKinsey consultant or something, if you want to
make nearly $900,000 a year in profit, having a half-decent product is probably kind of important.
This all might seem like a terrible oversight. But to Tim Ferris, not caring about the product
you're selling is kind of the point. In probably the worst paragraph of a deeply terrible,
book, Tim Ferris asks, can a business be used to change the world, like the body shop or Patagonia?
Yes. But that isn't our goal here. Our goal is simple, to create an automated vehicle for
generating cash without consuming time. That's it. And this is the legacy of the four-hour workweek.
Reading the book in 2023, it was interesting to note how many different online subcultures
Ferris inspired. Every productivity guru you see on YouTube, every minimalism evangelist,
every van life lover or digital nomad owes at least something to Tim Ferris. But it's this idea
that one can build a completely hands-off, automated business that simply deposits cash
into your bank account at the end of the month that has had the most impact. It would be entirely
fair to describe Ferris' plan as a get-rich-quick scheme. But it would be more accurate to describe
it as a get-rich-easy scheme. The emphasis is far less on the speed with which this model will
guide you to wealth than it is on the lack of effort you'll have to put in. If Ferris refers
to this as developing income autopight or management-free money, the phrase that's really taken off,
however, is passive income. In the 15 years since Ferris released the four-hour workweek,
the dream of building so-called passive income streams is one which has spread far and wide.
For those who seek what enthusiasts call financial freedom, there are a whole range of
different schemes available and thousands upon thousands of self-appointed gurus willing to
teach you how. Before we take a look at how some of these schemes function, however, we first need
to acknowledge the event. On the 15th of September 2008, the New York-based investment bank Lehman
filed for bankruptcy. After 150 years of continuous operation, a series of high-risk
gambles in the subprime mortgage market had failed spectacularly and left it fatally short of cash.
With several other major global banks experiencing similar crises during the course of that year,
things looked bleak. The complete collapse of the global financial system was only held off through
unprecedented government action, with the US, the UK and the European Union effectively
nationalising huge chunks of their banking sectors. Watching that now infamous footage of
Lehman Brothers employees being unceremoniously deposed from their towering glass palace in
Times Square, it might initially have been tempting to revel in the Schadenfreude.
Investment bankers don't exactly tend to attract much sympathy. Nevertheless,
as the global economy plunged into recession, job losses and layoffs became a reality across
industries and sectors. According to the International Monetary Fund,
the financial crisis pushed around 30 million people out of their jobs. The unemployment rate
in the US peaked at 10%. While the recession itself was officially declared over in the US in
June 2009, it took until 2017 for unemployment rates to dip back to pre-crash levels. As important
as the sheer number of jobs, however, is how the crash affected the types of jobs on offer?
If we stay focused on America for a moment, we find that around 60% of jobs lost during
the Great Recession were mid-wage positions, paying between $13 and $22 an hour. These were
real estate agents, office managers and higher skilled tradespeople. When firms started hiring
again, the majority of new posts on offer were both less well remunerated and less secure.
These were jobs in retail, catering and care. There was a whole universe of work
which kind of just didn't exist anymore. For many, even having a job was no longer enough.
With real-term wages falling year on year, some took on additional work in the burgeoning
gig economy. Others put their skills to work by embarking on so-called side hustles.
But these dire economic circumstances also opened the door to the further popularization
of the online grift. Some clarification might be useful here because we tend to use the terms
grift and grifter pretty loosely. Some use them to describe full-on fraudsters such as
Bernie Madoff and Sam Bankman Freed. Others throw the term at contrarian and conspiracist
political commentators who seem to court controversy in order to shift dubious brain pills and mugs.
None of these are wrong, obviously. I'm not the word police. But for today's purposes,
I'm interested in a particular kind of grift. Because blowhards and con artists are fairly
eternal. The difference between 19th century snake oil salesman Clark Stanley and Ferenos CEO
Elizabeth Holmes is primarily one of aesthetics. But in popularizing the idea that it might be
possible to create an almost completely automated source of income, Tim Ferriss planted the seed
for a new kind of grift, which was much more of our time. Before our work week itself hasn't aged
particularly well. And I don't mean it's deeply sexist or anything, although there's some bits.
Ask for the phone numbers of at least two attractive members of the opposite sex on each day.
Girls, this means you're in the game as well. And it doesn't matter if you're over 50.
With its strong emphasis on telephone sales and earnest recommendations of tools like Skype,
it's just clearly written for a different era. Luckily for those seeking to make their fortune,
however, countless new schemes have popped up in its wake, which similarly promise to set you
up with a reliable source of passive income. And again, I don't think I'd really be doing
them justice if I didn't introduce them with the appropriate level of enthusiasm.
Guess who's back? The name's Tom Nicholas. Tee to the N to the Ikelos.
Writer. Video creator. Verified hustler. A little birdie tells me that you've been
looking for more ways to make money online. And boy, oh boy, do I have some ideas for you.
In this, my non-exhaustive list of online grips. Money making opportunities.
Strategy one, drop shipping. Drop, drop. Drop shipping is the classic
passive income stream. It allows you to sell real physical products to real physical customers
without any of the hassle of ordering or storing or shipping those products yourself.
Ooh la la. Here's how it works. Step one, get yourself over to a budget online marketplace
like AliExpress. Have a little scroll around and find yourself a red hot product. Something you
reckon will just fly out the window given half the chance. I've got my eye on this cute little
duck necklace. It's fun. It's cute. It also happens to only be 49p. Step two,
next up, you're going to want to create an online store showcasing this super and super cheap
bit of produce. You want to crack out all the persuasive writing and design skills you can
muster to make your product irresistible. I simply can't resist. Right about how ducks are symbolic
of like, love and spiritual evolution. Spiritual evolution. Like eggs and stuff. Eggs. Step three,
this is where the fun begins. See, you don't want the risk of having to buy and store a bunch of
these cheap, I mean, unique necklaces. Nor do you want to have to deal with shipping them to the
plebs who buy them. So, you're going to set things up on the back end so that when anyone
purchases anything from your website, it simply forwards their order on to AliExpress who will
take care of all that nonsense for you. Cheers, Ali. You're my best friend.
Be sure to charge a handsome markup for all this hard work. That thing we could call this
20 quid, don't you? I certainly do, Tom. I certainly do. Strategy two, affiliate marketing.
This one's another classic online money making model and all it requires is that you have the
ability to spit out paragraphs and paragraphs of sh- engaging pros. Step one, create a blog.
You want this blog to focus on reviewing and otherwise discussing products, preferably medium
to high ticket items such as barbecues, gas-powered barbecues. Because who doesn't love a good grill
session, am I right? Make sure to write all of your posts with search engine optimization in mind.
We're talking how-to articles. We're talking listicles. We're talking products comparisons.
Sign up to an affiliate marketing program. An affiliate marketing program is a scheme
in which an online store will give you a set of custom links to products on their site.
If anyone purchases a product after following your link, then you'll get a sweet little kickback
of sometimes up to 20%. Personally, I choose to become an affiliate of the world's biggest retailer.
Amazon. Cheers, Jeff. Nice stuff. Litter your blog with those magical affiliate links. Any mention
of a product should be a link. Any picture of a product, also an affiliate link. Keep going until
as many words as possible are that beautiful hyperlink blue. Drive those conversions, you bloody
legend. Now all you gotta do is sit back and wait for some loser to stumble upon your blog,
click through to Amazon and buy one of these things and you can stop, drop and start rolling in
those flame grilled millions. Strategy three. Retail arbitrage. Arbitrage. Despite its fancy
pants name, this one's so simple that even I understand it. Yes. Although unfortunately,
it is going to involve going outside. Step one. Roll on down to your local out of town
shopping center or discount store. Get your little peepers out and browse the aisles for any
products which are on sale or which look like they might be a little underpriced. This was down to
just 150 quid. Step two. Once you've got a little dealio in your sites, you're gonna wanna pull out
your phone and download the Amazon seller app. You can use this app to scan the barcode of the
product in front of you and in return, it'll tell you how much that item is currently selling for
on Amazon. If the Amazon price is higher than the store price, then congratulations. Looks like
you've managed to find yourself a cheeky bit of profit my friend. I'm so proud of you. Get loading
up that trolley with as many units as it will handle. I've got 28 of these things in my living
room. Step three. Sign up as an Amazon seller and register for their fulfilled by Amazon service.
This lets you send your hall to Amazon who will store it for you and then ship it to whoever buys
it. And all for just a tiny fee. Thanks again, Jeff. Strategy fun. If all else fails, why not
become an expert? What are those scare quotes doing there? Can we get rid of those please?
The internet thrives on content. The more words that are spaffed into this thing, the better.
And there is sweet, sweet money to be made in being a content spaffer. Step one. Pick yourself
a topic to be an expert in. Try and think of something that people aren't just interested in
but desperate to know about. How to be productive. How to be YouTube famous. How to get rich. How to
get laid. So cool. Step two. If you already know how to get laid or whatever, then you are good to go.
But if maybe you do a dome, then that doesn't matter either.
Tap up your old friend, Professor Google. Read a few blogs, watch a few videos and congratulations.
You've just got yourself a PhD from the University of Internet. Step three. It's time to start cooking
up some content. Blocks, YouTube videos, obnoxious Twitter threads, non-exhaustive lists.
It's all good. And if you ever get a little stuck, just have a look at some high-performing
posts by other experts and plagiarise, I mean, paraphrase, both. Step four. Once you've managed
to lure in some underconfident teenagers, I mean, dedicated readers, now's the time to start earning
some money. Yes, I love it. I'm talking ads on your posts. I'm talking ebooks. I'm talking courses.
I'm talking rephrasing all the stuff that's available for free on all your platforms,
but for an upfront fee. Fantastic. Okay, I think that's quite enough of that. My senses hurt.
This is but a tiny, tiny taste of the plethora of passive income schemes which have emerged over
the past decade. As you can see, they vary pretty wildly in their approach. Perhaps my favourite
suggestion involves investing in vending machines, you know, as if they don't cost a bunch of money
and break pretty easily. It's also funny how some of these schemes seem to just come full circle to
just invent a normal business again. Nevertheless, these schemes all share the same goal. Like Ferris'
formula in the four hour work week, they promise a path to generating a consistent income and usually
a pretty high income in return for minimal levels of effort. Again, these are get rich quick schemes,
but the real emphasis is on getting rich easily. Many of these schemes exist in a kind of legal
and ethical gray area. They seem to tacitly encourage some pretty shady practices in a way that
more traditional business models just don't. Affiliate marketers will clearly benefit from
forgetting to disclose their use of paid referral links. A wannabe dropshipper browsing Aliexpress
for products will quickly find themselves tempted by unlicensed or counterfeit goods.
Nevertheless, breaking the law is seldom a requirement of any of these schemes. They pretty
much all can be employed in ways that are completely legit. And most of the gurus who
provide advice on them benefit from existing in this strange area of plausible deniability.
What's really interesting though is that even when they are carried out in entirely legal ways,
they still feel kind of icky. As much as these are technically businesses like any other,
most of us would act pretty differently to a friend announcing that they were about to start
reselling air fryers on Amazon than we would if they said they were going to start a ballet school
or window cleaning company or something. They just feel off. And it's this sense of ickiness
which holds the key to understanding not only why these schemes have become popular,
but why these particular schemes have become popular at this particular moment in time.
Because when we dive into these bad vibes, we actually begin to find some pretty solid links
between these low rent grifts and some much more mainstream trends within our economy.
In chapter 5 of the 4 hour work week, Tim Ferriss introduces a concept known as the
Pareto principle. As he explains it, this is the idea that 80% of the results of a given project
or activity come from 20% of the effort and time that's put into it. This sometimes gets called
the 80-20 rule. Largely thanks to Ferriss, the Pareto principle has become something of an
unacknowledged cliche among time management nerds. If you scroll through the back catalogue of any
wannabe productivity guru on YouTube, you're bound to find at least one video about it in there
somewhere. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of these gurus actually have a pretty shaky understanding
of the principle itself. As Ferriss does in the 4 hour work week, they tend to assume that it means
you can simply identify which 20% of your daily tasks lead to 80% of your desired outcomes and
then kind of bin off everything else. This however is wishful thinking. Firstly, assuming there is
some truth to this idea, it's often only possible to identify which of your tasks constitute that
vital 20% after a project is completed. For example, I wrote several drafts of the script to this video
before I got it to a place where I was happy with it. I reckon that at least 80% of my time was
technically wasted writing words which ultimately got binned or tweaked in some way. But I didn't
write those earlier drafts knowing that they were going to be thrown out. It's only in hindsight
that I can tell you which sections made the final cut. In fact, who's to say that this section will?
I mean, it has. I'm filming it. Secondly, just because a task isn't directly related to your
core outcomes doesn't necessarily mean that you can simply not do it. Every month or so,

I can submit my taxes at the end of the year does keep me out of prison. Which is, you know, nice.
The Pareto principle then can certainly be a useful evaluation tool or thought experiment.
It can almost certainly help you be a bit more efficient with your time. But it's not some
all-powerful life hack which is going to upset you on the path to working just four hours a week.
I'm not only bringing this up as another excuse to dunk on Tim Ferriss, although the sheer silliness
of this book has infested my brain. I mention it instead because the Pareto principle is named
after this guy, the 19th century economist and polymath, Vilfredo Pareto. And it's not the
only concept which borrows his name. There's another idea named for Pareto which I think
offers a really useful way into unpacking why passive income schemes are so appealing to those
who attempt them and why they can feel so icky to the rest of us. It's called Peretian Rent.
Now, I'm aware that the phrase Peretian Rent sounds pretty technical. And I'll be honest with you,
we are about to do a little bit of learning. But to keep things interesting, I thought I'd
borrow a trick from The Big Short and hand over to Margot Robbie in a bathtub to explain.
You're your Margot?
What do you mean you can't make it? You've got this in a diary for ages.
I've already run on the bath.
Look, I'm about as happy about this as you are. So, Peretian Rent. Most of you are probably
already far too familiar with the concept of rent as we use it in everyday conversation.
You've likely handed over huge sums of money in rent payments to landlords over the course of your
life. And unless you've got a thing for being financially dominated, which to each their own,
you've probably come to resent those payments. In fact, there's something about paying rent,
which seems to hurt so much more than other essential outgoings. Over the past three years,
prices have been increasing on pretty much everything from food to electronics to fuel.
And yet, I rarely see memes comparing grocery store owners or smartphone manufacturers to leeches.
Landlords and the rent which they take attract a special kind of hatred.
Of course, part of this is that rent is expensive and only getting more so. The average private
renter in the UK spends 26% of their income on rent. In London, that figure is 40%.
Those figures are from before inflation went through the roof too, so they're probably a
little bit generous. Nevertheless, I don't think that the widespread hatred of landlords
is just down to rent being expensive. I think it's more than that. Because paying rent doesn't
only involve parting with more money than you'd like. It involves parting with more money than
you'd like to someone who doesn't seem to have done all that much to earn it. Food and phone bills
and fuel might all be more expensive than they could or should be. But at least when you're
tucking into a bowl of Weetabix crispy minis, you know that some work has gone into making them exist.
Someone had to grow the wheat and the cocoa and perform whatever magic happens in the factory
to process them into those beautiful little packs of chocolatey goodness. When you watch the rent
leave your bank account, however, it's hard to escape the feeling that your landlord has done
very, very little to earn that cash. If they've hired a letting agent to oversee the property,
there might be months when they completely forget that they own your property at all.
What might surprise you is that economists also hate rent. They might use the term in reference
to a much broader set of financial exchanges than the rest of us are used to, but it's always with
the same sense of contempt. When an economist uses the phrase economic rent or describes a person
or company as being engaged in rent seeking behavior, that is proper claws out stuff.
And the reason that economists dislike rent is for much the same reason as tenants do.
There are a handful of ways of defining economic rent, but the broadest is what's sometimes known
as perennial rent. The Penguin Dictionary of Economics describes this as
the difference between the return made by a factor of production and the return necessary
to keep the factor in its current occupation. But in slightly simpler language, it essentially
refers to excess profit, or maybe more specifically unearned profit. To say that a company or a person
is in receipt of an economic rent is to say that they are receiving a level of income from a particular
economic activity, which is in excess of that which is reasonable in relation to the time
and effort and resource they are putting in. Now I'm sure there's more than one person who
is currently watching this video who is cracking their knuckles and preparing to write something
along the lines of all profit is unearned, you absolute drongo. That would have sounded better
if Margo had been here to say it. She's Australian. And yes, this is broadly true. By its very definition,
making a profit involves getting more out of an economic activity than you put in. But within
the justifying logic of capitalism, some profit is viewed as necessary to motivate people to do
stuff, to start businesses, develop new products and improve upon existing ones. From this perspective,
that profit is earned by someone being willing to take the risk of that business or product
falling flat on its face. The point at which a profit margin turns into an economic rent then
is the point at which it begins to exceed the amount necessary to provide that motivation. Say,
for example, I could sell these cute little duck necklaces for £10 and in doing so would make
enough profit that I would remain motivated to continue selling more. If I were then to begin
selling those necklaces for £20, I would be claiming an economic rent of £10 on each necklace
sold. Now, if most of us wanted to criticise someone for charging an excess profit, we'd probably do
so on the basis of it feeling a little exploitative towards the customer. And we'll come back to
this idea in a moment. But the real beef that many economists have with economic rents is that
they're unproductive. Again, within the justifying logic of capitalism, a quote unquote normal level
of profit is productive. It promotes someone to create or sell a product or service they otherwise
might not have. And therefore it has consequences for both the economy and society. Because of that
normal profit margin, a thing now exists which previously didn't. An economic rent however
has no such impact. The product or service would have been made or performed anyway. A person or
company which is in receipt of an economic rent then is essentially getting money for nothing.
Landlords are the ultimate example of this. See, we often overlook the fact that most landlords
are actually engaged in two separate economic activities. The first is real estate speculation.
They've bought a house or a flat in the hope that it will increase in value over time and that
they'll later be able to sell it on at a profit. Outside of cases in which the landlord undertakes
a major renovation, this kind of speculation might itself be viewed as a kind of rent seeking.
This is an entirely unproductive activity. Neither the economy nor society benefits from
some boomer uncle hoarding a house for a decade. Nevertheless, the presence of economic rent
is even clearer when we look at the second activity that landlords are involved in. That of course
is the letting out of their property. The rent that a landlord receives in return for allowing
a tenant to live in their property is very clearly unproductive because this rent is not
a reward for doing anything at all. It is simply a reward for owning something. Even when a landlord
can be persuaded to do maintenance on a property, to fix a leaky pipe or whatever, this isn't really
a service performed in return for your rent check. If they're repairing something that you broke,
then you can bet they're going to charge you for it. If the problem they're fixing is the result
of wear and tear, then they're really just making that repair for their own benefit, ensuring that
their property will retain its value as a speculative asset. I guess if we're being really,
really generous, we could acknowledge that landlords in some countries are required to
ensure that certain gas and electrical safety tests are up to date. And I guess that's a kind
of service they're providing. Outside of this, however, the rent that you pay to a landlord
is just that. Economic rent. Nothing about the process of one person owning a house
and charging someone else to live in it is economically or socially productive.
Landlords do not create anything new, and any resources that they expend in maintenance are
in relation to their speculative activity, not in relation to their rental activity.
Landlords are quite literally extracting a bunch of money or contributing nothing in return.
If we wanted to find a more friendly phrase to replace the slightly formal sounding economic
rent, then passive income wouldn't actually be a bad shout. But that's enough from me,
Margot Robbie. To help apply some of these ideas to online grifts, I'd better pass you back to Tom.
Really looking forward to filming that bit. I think that's going to be fun, you know, to work
well with a real actor for a change. That's going to be good.
Okay, so it would be a stretch to classify all passive income schemes as pure rent-seeking
operations. Because outside of actually becoming a landlord, which does appear fairly frequently
on lists of recommended ventures, a lot of these schemes have the potential to sometimes
be at least mildly economically productive. If we wanted to be super duper generous,
we could view setting up a dropshipping store as a kind of marketing or branding.
By placing a product in a slightly more appealing context than the horror show that is AliExpress,
a dropshipper potentially facilitates a sale which otherwise wouldn't have taken place.
Even something as instinctively silly as buying a product in a shop to resell them on Amazon
can be viewed as a productive process of reallocating resources from somewhere that
they're in low demand and thus on sale to somewhere that they're in higher demand.
The problem is that the tiny percentage of dropshippers or arbitrageurs, which is a real word,
who are having these kinds of meaningful impacts, are almost certainly putting in a huge amount
of time and effort. They're continuously refining product descriptions or doing deep
analysis on Amazon trends. And isn't the whole point of a passive income scheme meant to be that
it's, well, passive? A lot of passive income gurus like to have it both ways. When either
their critics or aggrieved followers question why so few people actually end up getting rich
through these methods, they'll claim that passive income is really just a branding term.
And that if you're not getting rich, it's because you're not working hard enough.
Take this guy, Mark Tilbury, a finance guru from the UK who's closing in on two million subscribers
on YouTube. In 2020, he posted a video in which he leveled with his audience and explained that
making a success of any of these passive income business models will likely require a lot of
hard work and discipline. But ease is central to the way that these same gurus pitch their
strategies to new recruits. The pinned video on Mark Tilbury's channel at time of recording this
segment opens with this line. The biggest lie young people are told when they're 18, 19 and 20 is
money doesn't grow on trees. However much effort it takes to actually make a success of one of
these passive income schemes and whatever impact they might accidentally end up having on the wider
economy, the goal is absolutely one of rent seeking. The explicit aim of this community
is to find sneaky ways of extracting profit whilst avoiding any involvement in any
meaningful, real productive activity. The ickiness which many people feel towards these gurus and
their followers then comes from the same place as that which feeds the current backlash against
landlords. On the most basic level, it's a hostility towards people whose sole goal in life
is to find loopholes which allow them to get rich whilst giving as little back to society
as possible in return. But more than this, it's an anger at people whose path to wealth often
involves actively making our economy and society less efficient and thus less pleasant places to
live. Like landlords, passive income seekers can only thrive by creating unnecessary bloat in the
online economy. Dropshippers and arbitrages have the effect of inflating the cost of goods and
services. Affiliate marketers and fake experts create a slightly different kind of bloat in which
the internet gets flooded with fake reviews and soulless filler content which make the web a
worse place to be. Of course this drive to get rich easy no matter what effect it has on others
is in some ways eternal. It's the same motivation which leads people to gamble,
to buy stocks or to join multi-level marketing schemes. Nevertheless, I think there's something
about this current wave of passive income business model which is a bit more specific to the present
day. And as my various allusions to landlordism and economic rent throughout this section perhaps
hint, it lies in the way that these seemingly marginal online grifts mirror powerful trends
which run to the very heart of our economy. Special delivery, it's more ideas, delicious
nutritious ideas. There's probably a much lazier version of this video which ends with me sagely
pontificating that the attempts of passive income seekers to make bank from very little work
mirrors the way in which capitalists worldwide live off their investments whilst everyone else
is forced to work for a living. And that isn't untrue but the rise of passive income culture
actually mimics a much more specific trend in the corporate world. We've already acknowledged one
way in which the global financial crisis of 2008 contributed to the rise of the passive income
movement. It's really no surprise that the decade and a half of stagnant wages which followed the
crash created an eager audience for gurus trying to sell easy answers. But truly understanding
why these particular schemes have become popular at this particular moment in time necessitates
reviewing those same events from a slightly different perspective. That of the lucky entrepreneurs
who were able to use the crisis to make their billions. See, just under a year prior to the
collapse of Lehman Brothers, a pair of flatmates in San Francisco registered the domain airbedandbreakfast.com.
The corporate legend is that their landlord had raised their rent and in need of some extra cash
they decided to set up some airbeds in their loft and let them out to people attending business
conferences in the city. The venture was a success and over the next few years founders
Brian Chetsky and Joe Gebbia gradually began to invite more and more people to list rooms on their
sites. In an era of economic downturn the website quickly renamed Airbnb seemed like a pretty good
deal for both guests and hosts. The former were able to travel for cheaper whilst the latter were
able to earn an extra bit of cash. In those petty early days journalists began to write
pretty warmly of what they called the sharing economy. This ban of not only encompassed Airbnb
but a plethora of other websites and apps launched in the years surrounding the financial crisis.
Tarsgrabbit, Fiverr, Just Park, Lending Club, Kickstarter, Postmates, Uber, Deliveroo.
Across their various different industries commentators celebrated the way in which these sites
seemed to facilitate a direct so-called peer-to-peer exchange between individuals in need of a service
and those with the capacity to provide it. There were two problems with this view though.
The first was that whilst these services often pitched themselves as ways for private individuals
to make an extra bit of cash on the side, most quickly became professionalised. Airbnb soon
became dominated by full-time landlords. UberDriver became a job like any other. The collaborative
mirage of the sharing economy faded away and left in its place the backbreaking realities of the
gig economy. The second problem was that the connections forged between Airbnb hosts and
their guests and Uber drivers and riders weren't really peer-to-peer because the websites and apps
which made these exchanges possible were not passive facilitators. They were private companies,
often up to their eyeballs in venture capital money and in pursuit of ways to turn their sudden
popularity into profit. To some, the new business model represented by these companies might have
looked a little odd. In 2015, Tom Goodwin wrote an article for TechCrunch in which he observed that
Uber, the world's largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world's most popular
media owner, creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory,
and Airbnb, the world's largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. That these companies
have become so successful seem to turn some of the most fundamental principles of capitalism
on its head. See, in theory, the thing which elevates a company within capitalism is its
ownership and control over the means of production, by which we usually mean the
physical assets and machinery which allow a particular industry to function. But this new
breed of company didn't seem all that interested in owning the tools of their trade. Uber was
quite happy for drivers to own their own vehicles. Fiverr never felt the need to force copywriters
or artists working through the site to use Fiverr-owned laptops. In fact, these companies
didn't seem to thrive in spite of their lack of physical assets, but because of it. But I guess
if we're going to introduce a new business model, we'd better do it with the appropriate level of
panache. Boom, boom, boom! It's your boy Tom Nicholas, writer, video creator, titan of industry.
I'm here with another money-making scheme to fatten up those wallets.
Sure, I've got my wallet here. But I'm going to warn you, this one's for the big-time ballers
only. I call it the platform. The platform comes in all shapes and sizes. Shops, networking,
video streaming. You name it, there's a platform for it. And if you play your cards right,
running the platform can be a great way to make a shed load of money whilst leaving the hard work
to some other sucker. Sorry, suckers. Step one. One. Have a gander for an industry that's a little
too confusing or expensive for your average consumer. Maybe it's yet to embrace the full
potential of communications technology, or maybe it's plagued by nuisances such as competition
and workers' rights. I'm talking taxis, I'm talking selling handmade crafts,
I'm talking music, audiobooks, online video sharing.
Step two. Two. Build yourself an app which brings some order to this chaos. Trust me,
you'll be fine. Most large children can build apps these days. Focus on making your product as
flash and trendy as possible. These ain't your grandad's hotels, or taxis, or tv shows.
These are hotels, and taxis, and tv shows for the internet generation.
Step three. Sign up users who want to make some extra cash through your app. Present it as the
ultimate side hustle opportunity. This isn't work, this is the sharing economy, baby.
The trick is to make sure that all the real work is going to fall on your users. In using their own
cars and properties and filmmaking gear, they're also going to take the brunt of the risk too.
Well all you have to do is maintain a silly little app. Step four.
Solicit some big time venture capital investment. This is going to give you the ability to subsidize
the cost of products or services through your app. Sure, for a little while you're going to be
burning through cash, but it's all part of the master plan. Because by undercutting everyone
else on the market, you're going to make yourself irresistible to potential customers
and ensure anyone who wants to make money in your industry just has to use your app.
Step five. Once you've reached peak popularity, that's the point in which you can start cashing
in. On the one hand, you can start easing up on the subsidies. Gradually start ratcheting up prices
on customers until you're on your way to turning a tidy profit. On the other hand,
begin reducing the amount you pay out to folks providing services through your platform. As
long as you've made yourself popular enough, both customers and service providers won't have any
choice but to stick around. And that's it. Before you know it, you'll be raking it in.
And the best part is that all the real work and all the risk sits firmly on the shoulders of your
users. Now that's what I call passive income. What these new platform companies realized then
was that owning the physical assets which we traditionally think of as the means of production
isn't always the most important thing. In fact, a lot of assets can be a pain for a business to
own. Cars consistently go down in value the longer that you own them. Laptops become outdated. In
the tourism industry, even something as secure in value as property can be a nightmare. Destinations
go in and out of fashion or are only profitable during certain seasons. Whether by accident or
design, companies in industries as varied as transport, news, tourism, gaming, TV and computer
software came to realize that one could build a much more lightweight, flexible, responsive
business model by avoiding the hassle of actually providing services in favor of simply positioning
themselves as intermediaries between service providers and their customers. The similarities
between these platform companies and many of the online grifts we've been looking at are striking.
Much like dropshippers, affiliate marketers or Amazon arbitrageurs, these companies play a pretty
marginal role in their respective industries. When we really think about it, Uber, Airbnb,
Fiverr and Deliveroo are really just digital versions of the yellow pages plus a payment
feature. They play a part in the process, but it would be ridiculous to suggest that the money
that they take is justified by what they contribute. Uber takes a 25% cut from every ride arranged
through its app. Fiverr takes 20% of both fees and tips. Postmates takes between 15% and 30%
of an order's value from restaurants and 20% of the delivery from the person delivering an order.
The idea that maintaining an app justifies a company taking such a huge slice of the pie
is ludicrous. To make matters worse, the people who provide services through these platforms
are forced to take on nearly all of the associated risk. If ridership is down one month,
then Uber is certainly going to notice, but not as much as its drivers, who are not only not earning,
but are also on the hook for insurance and upkeep and probably for car loan repayments too.
On a purely aesthetic level then, online passive income grifts might seem pretty marginal.
From their overall vibe, you'd expect them to have more in common with some guy selling fake
trainers down the market than with Silicon Valley startup culture. And yet, their underlying business
models are pretty similar. When explaining the concept of rent seeking, the economist Robert
Schiller likes to draw on the example of a feudal lord who places a chain across a river
and demands a fee from passing boats in return for lowering the chain. He writes that,
there is nothing productive about the chain or the collector. The lord has made no improvements
to the river and is helping nobody in any way directly or indirectly accept himself.
None of the examples that we've been looking at are quite this bad, but they're not a million
miles off. Many platform companies increasingly function as gatekeepers, where one previously
might have ordered a takeaway directly from a restaurant, now Deliveroo or Uber Eats has
installed its chain between customer and vendor and expect to be rewarded for lowering it. A lot
of online grifts seem to poke for a similar scenario. Those that we've been looking at in
particular are predicated on inserting oneself as an additional intermediary in a sales process
in order to simply siphon off some of the proceeds. But there's one glaring difference
between online grifters and the likes of Uber. And that is that these large companies are pretty
successful. If we take a look at a list of the 10 largest companies in the world by market
capitalization, we find that six derive a meaningful amount of their revenue from operating as platforms.
Yet, it seems fairly accepted, even within the passive income community, that most people who
try out the various business models being hawked by financial freedom gurus failed spectacularly.
If the business models which these gurus offer have so much in common with those of the most
successful companies in the world, then why is it that passive income seekers struggle so hard
to make it work on a smaller scale? Greetings friends. Thank you. Thank you.
I think one of the reasons that online grifts are so intriguing to those of us outside of them
is because there's usually two separate levels of sleaze for us to unpick. The schemes themselves
are usually pretty scammy. As I mentioned before, there are certainly cases where dropshipping
functions as an honest, productive branding service. But let's be honest here, they are few
and far between. I was recently trying to buy a new belt for my wedding and as someone who's
always keen to cut down on waste, I wanted to find one that would last for as long as possible.
But searching for quality leather belt on Google, I kept finding myself ushered to websites which
had all the signs of being dropshipping fronts, generic images, random discounts and an over
abundance of keyword heavy descriptions. These sites made big promises for the quality and value
of their products. Yet a quick glance at trust pilot revealed complaints of inconsistent goods,
slow delivery times and terrible customer service. I don't know whether they ever veered into the
realms of illegality, but it was all at least highly dishonest. All of which points us to the
second level of sleaze at play here. Which is that despite the promises of passive income gurus
on YouTube and elsewhere, the vast majority of these schemes don't actually work. Dropshipping
sounds so simple and appealing on the surface. But what if your supplier runs out of stock?
What if a product gets held up on its very long journey from usually Asia to usually
the US or Europe? What if the customer doesn't feel that the dirt cheap product you've sent
them lives up to the quality that you promised? This is very quickly going to lead to bad reviews
and to complaints. Even more worryingly, it will lead to customers asking their credit card providers
to issue charge backs which will leave you out of pocket and likely blacklisted by payment
processors. All of the schemes that we've been talking about have similar pitfalls. Amazon
retail arbitrage is just straight up against the site's terms of service. If you want to advertise
goods as new, Amazon will ask you to prove that you've sourced them from official wholesalers
as part of their efforts to stamp out fakes. And if you can't, they'll just ban your seller account.
Nevertheless, it's not actually this rule-breaking which sets online grifts apart from the platform
companies we discussed in the previous section. In fact, breaking the law is almost a rite of
passage for ascendant platforms. When Uber first launched in Australia, it did so entirely illegally
with none of the required permits or licenses. As it had done in other countries, it simply
relied on creating such a buzz that, by the time lawmakers took note, they were essentially forced
into retroactively legalising the company's business model. Facebook's history has similarly
been beset with scandals and fines. In 2019, it paid $5 billion to the United States Federal
Trade Commission for its lackadaisical approach to sharing user data with third parties.
And all of this is before we even begin to talk about the more fundamental ways in which these
platforms use their status as intermediaries to circumvent labor laws. The primary difference
between the online grift on one hand and the platform on the other, however, is competition.
But to explain that properly, I think it's best to hand things back to Margo.
Earlier on, we took a look at the concept of economic rent. And during that section,
we focused on what's sometimes called perettian rent, which is a phrase that economists use
to describe what the rest of us might call excess profits. But this particular definition
of economic rent is actually kind of controversial. See, as you might have noticed, the perettian
definition of what counts as an economic rent is actually kind of vague. It's one thing to say
that it refers to excess profit, but differentiating between an excessive profit and one which is
simply very large is often nigh on impossible. If you ask a business owner what percentage of
their profit is strictly necessary for them to continue to do business, they're probably going
to say all of it. If we define economic rent merely as excess profit, then it becomes a pretty
subjective and therefore not all that useful term. To counteract this vagueness, some economists
are a little more selective when it comes to accusing a business or a person of extracting an
economic rent. Rather than simply using this term to refer to the vague notion of excess profit,
they would argue that a high level of profit is only truly an economic rent in cases where the
business or person claiming it is doing so as a result of them having an unfair advantage
in the form of significant market power. We might call this definition a
Ricardian definition of economic rent after the 18th century economist David Ricardo.
Under this definition, economic rent refers, as Beth Stratford puts it,
to unearned income resulting from control of scarce or monopolised assets. Take our example
of a landlord from earlier. As we discussed, the rent that a residential landlord charges
is an economic rent because it is unproductive. The landlord doesn't have to do anything at all
to claim it other than to own the property in question. But it's not simply by chance that
landlords are able to extract such exorbitant fees. The reason landlords are able to charge such
eye-watering figures is because rooms and flats and houses are an extremely scarce resource.
There are usually many, many more people looking for somewhere to rent in a given town or city
than there are properties available at any one time. In such a scenario, the whole justifying
logic of capitalism begins to break down because there isn't any real competition.
That there are always so many more people in need of somewhere to live means that
even the smallest, most damp-infested property is going to find a tenant.
So why would any landlord ever reduce their asking price? Furthermore, this is not just
a scenario from which landlords passively benefit. Many actively work to sustain the
state of housing scarcity they profit from. Many landlords will use some of the cash that they take
from their tenants and donate it to lobbying groups or directly to politicians in an effort
to thwart laws which make it easier to build new homes. These lobbying activities might require
them to spend a bit of cash but it's money which is returned many times over in their ability to
push rents even higher. The economic rent extracted by landlords is therefore more than just unproductive
excess profit. It is excess profit resulting from extreme scarcity and market conditions
in which the idea of competition is a joke. Nevertheless, economic rents of this more
precise kind are not confined solely to the housing sector. They exist throughout our economy.
Wherever there is a single company or a handful of companies with a stranglehold on a particular
market or industry, it is likely that they are using that power to artificially increase prices
or drive down costs and thus claim an economic rent. But that's enough from me, Margot Robbie.
To tie all this back into online grifts, I'd better hand you back to Tom.
I think I'm going to need to order catering, you know? I think she'll expect catering.
Platform companies like Uber, DoorDash, Facebook and Fiver share a great deal with online grifts.
As we've discussed, both business models are focused on the extraction of economic rents.
It's all about inserting oneself into an industry or supply chain in such a way that
one is able to siphon off as much profit as possible whilst contributing little to no real
productive activity. What allows one model to thrive whilst the other so often ends in failure
is market share. In short, the most successful platform companies are those which have managed
to establish themselves either as monopolies or at the very least as part of a small oligopoly
of companies. Some have been pretty brazen about this. When Uber fetched a valuation of $100
billion in 2019, it was partly because investors believed that the company had the potential
to wipe out all other competition, not only in the form of other ride-sharing companies
but also local taxi firms. The company heavily subsidized fares for years in the hope that once
it was the only game in town, it would be able to charge whatever it saw fit. This method has
allowed Uber's portion of the ride-sharing market in the US to grow to 74 percent, while other
companies have established similar strangleholds on their own industries. 65 percent of online
food orders in the United States go through door-dash. 77 percent of people with access to the
internet use at least one platform owned by Meta. Amazon's market share has grown and grown to
the point where the site accounted for 56.7 percent of all US online retail purchases in 2021.
That these companies put in vanishingly small amounts of work for the percentages they take then
doesn't really matter. They've captured the market, which makes it increasingly difficult
not to use them. A restaurant owner might think that door-dash charging a 30 percent commission
on every order is pretty despicable, but not listing themselves on the site would be a death
warrant for their restaurants. The same goes for any newspaper which chooses not to use Facebook or
any video creator who chooses not to use YouTube. Where most passive income seekers fail is that
they simply aren't in this monopolistic position. There might have been a period 10 years ago when
it was at least possible to make decent money through low effort dropshipping or affiliate
marketing sites. But the internet is too mature now and there's simply too much competition.
Why would someone wait weeks and weeks for a product ordered through your dropshipping store
when Amazon will deliver it tomorrow? Ultimately, as has been pointed out by others before me,
the only passive income grift which actually works is becoming a fake expert. And what better
arena to become an expert in than in selling get-rich-easy schemes? In fact, vanishingly few
passive income gurus actually make their money through the business models they promote.
This goes as far back as Tim Ferriss. While Ferriss was a moderately successful businessman
prior to writing the 4 hour work week, he's fairly open about the fact that he didn't
actually implement any of the techniques he promotes in the book until after the business
was already off the ground. What's more, the success of that company appears to have largely
been a result of being in the right place at the right time. You see, Tim Ferriss made his first
million dollars selling brain pills. For a while, this was obviously highly lucrative,
but the online supplement market quickly became massively oversaturated.
Despite making lofty claims in the 4 hour work week about how much money the company was making
and how easy it was to run, Ferriss sold it just three years later at what seems to have been a
somewhat discounted price. Ferriss is legitimately rich, but it doesn't seem clear that much of
that wealth came from actually using any of the techniques he describes in his book. In fact,
alongside some timely investments in Uber and other startups, a lot of Ferriss's wealth has come
from sales of the 4 hour work week and his subsequent career as a self-help influencer.
The same is true of a lot of these figures. Earlier on, I mentioned the British finance guru
Mark Tilbury. Tilbury's YouTube channel is packed with videos in which he tries out all
kinds of passive income ideas, from dropshipping to selling empty books through Amazon's print
on demand service. But Tilbury didn't become a millionaire through any of these methods.
His actual business experience seems to amount to selling remote control cars and planes
in a fairly standard retail setup. Again, this is impressive. But it has precious little in common
with any of the so-called side hustles he features on his social media channels. Furthermore,
according to his latest company's house filings, Tilbury's YouTube and TikTok channels are
currently more valuable than any of the offline businesses he leans on for legitimacy. As with
Ferriss, we find that the real money is in recommending these passive income schemes,
not in actually undertaking them. Mike Winnett sums all of this up perfectly,
in the trailer to his documentary, The Contrepreneur Formula Exposed. He compares the
current popularity of get rich easy schemes to the 1849 California Gold Rush. And he has this to
say on the topic. Right now there's a Gold Rush on to be rich and wealthy, but the people who made
the real money in the Gold Rush weren't digging for gold at all. They sold shovels. It was certainly
possible to strike it rich in the Gold Rush, but that required huge amounts of luck. More stable
and methodical success came in the form of companies such as Levi's, who profited from the
Goldseeker's misplaced optimism by selling them tools and gear. The most obvious modern-day
equivalents to those pick, shovel and clothing companies are the Guru's themselves.
As we've seen, these figures tell their audience that there's gold in them their passive income
schemes, but whilst their followers devour hours of inspirational and instructional content,
in order to learn how to find that gold, it's the Guru's themselves who are making the real
fortunes from adsense, sponsorships and, in the worst cases, ludicrously expensive courses.
What gets less attention are the more mainstream companies, which have also taken it upon themselves
to prey on those who have been drawn in by this siren song of passive income. Over the past six
months or so, I've obviously spent a huge amount of time investigating the details of various
passive income schemes. And what shocked me more than anything is the number of times that I've
googled a passive income-related keyword and found myself pointed to the website of the e-commerce
platform Shopify. Shopify is one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. It essentially provides
companies with a means to quickly and easily add shopping capabilities to their websites.
And it's used by some pretty massive companies. Decathlon, The New York Times, Staples,
Puel, The Human Fuel. But Shopify also seems to be making a concerted effort to lure in passive
income seekers. Their official blog is packed with posts promoting these kinds of business models.
Their authors are somewhat more realistic about one's chances of making a fortune than the
gurus that we've been looking at. Nevertheless, they're still quite happy to push you to give
them a try. Shopify also runs an affiliate program, which many, many of these gurus participate in.
In doing so, they help to fund content which is far more questionable than that which they
would likely be willing to host on their own site, whilst retaining a level of plausible
deniability about the kinds of advice which are leading people to sign up to their service.
Shopify manages to braid together the twin threads of this video in that it is itself
a platform company. It makes its money from being an intermediary between sellers and their customers.
Whilst few would bemoan they're providing of e-commerce capabilities to genuine businesses
of various sizes, however, this aspect of the company's activity feels far more ethically
dubious. It begins to resemble the pick-and-shovel play of the gurus, encouraging passive income
seekers to take big risks while Shopify collect its reliable monthly fee. In some regards then,
it's no surprise that significant numbers of people are drawn to these passive income schemes.
On the one hand, the times we live in are pretty bleak. Just as jobs had become to recover from
the Great Recession, we found ourselves battling a pandemic and then facing rampant inflation,
soaring interest rates and the prospect of another economic downturn. On the other,
a huge, well-funded ecosystem has emerged which promises simple solutions to those
feeling economically anxious or otherwise under-rewarded for their labour. The self-reinforcing
recommendation systems of YouTube and TikTok further mean that one only needs to show the
slightest interest in any kind of financial advice for one to be bombarded with this kind of content.
But I want to close out this video by exploring some of the less material ways in which these
schemes draw people in. Because from what I've seen, the appeal of this community and its practices
is as much cultural and experiential as it is solely financial. And it's in discussing this
aspect of the passive income trend that we can identify not only what keeps people around after
that initial promise of getting rich easy wears thin, but also why those of us outside of these
schemes are so drawn in to watching them be debunked and derailed.
Clearly a large part of what draws people in to the passive income community
is that they genuinely believe it's going to make them rich. As with buying a lottery ticket or
starting a band, there's the tendency to think that even when we know the odds are stacked against
us, we're going to be the exceptions that are going to make it. But I think part of the attraction
and at least what keeps people trying these schemes, even after it becomes clear that wealth
might not come so easily, is the opportunity to role play. Being part of the passive income community
is a chance for people who lack the connections and capital to ever launch a really successful
business to simulate the experience of being a startup founder. As we've seen,
there are enough similarities between these passive income business models and those behind
some of the largest companies in the world that this might be, at times, pretty convincing.
I'm reminded of a quote attributed to John Steinbeck, the author of Of Mice and Men,
which posits that socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as
an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires. This is actually a bit
of a misquote and it would be more accurate today to refer to billionaires rather than millionaires.
Nevertheless, the crux of the idea is that working-class people in America have historically
tended to identify far more with the super-rich than with other working-class people. Whether or
not this is a real phenomenon is an open question, but there is a certain logic to it. We're told
that capitalism is a meritocratic system in which good, hard-working people rise to the top. If you
believe this, then you're obviously likely to have a pretty positive view of rich people. But
more than this, if you also believe yourself to be good and hardworking, as most of us do,
then you kind of have to believe that your own lack of wealth is some kind of mistake. On the
one hand, passive income schemes offer to amend this oversight. They pledge to give you the secret
knowledge that will restore you to your rightful place among the rich and famous. But when actual
wealth fails to materialize, the manner in which these schemes allow passive income seekers to
roleplay as Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk at least provides some form of consolation.
Guided by their gurus, passive income seekers adopt what they believe to be the language of the
super-rich, the daily routines of the super-rich, the reading lists of the super-rich. In this way,
they're able to keep proving to themselves and to others within this community that whilst they
might not have the bank balance or fast cars of a billionaire, they at least have the mindset
of a billionaire. They might not actually be rich, but they are the kind of person who should be rich
for it not for their temporary embarrassment. Passive income seekers might be a pretty obnoxious
bunch. They might regularly try to take advantage of others in ways which are neither easy nor
necessary to forgive. But their attempts to imitate the successful business models of the super-rich
are ultimately driven by the same socioeconomic trends which have driven the growth of other
disconcerting subcultures in recent years. All this elaborate pseudo-business roleplay
is simply one further way people have found to cope with the sense that life for ordinary people
in the global north is getting worse. A lot worse. And I think these same trends fuel much of the
interest in anti-grifter content too. The videos that creators like Coffey's Illamake highlighting
fraudsters and con artists are obviously important, but these debunkings aren't primarily
made for an audience of people who would otherwise have fallen for the scam being featured in a
particular video. They're a little bit more voyeuristic than that. The core audience is people
entirely outside of these communities who nevertheless love watching gurus and grifters
being exposed for what they are. There are no doubt several reasons why we find such videos
compelling. Some of the schemes covered in these grift-busting videos are hideous for how they
prey on vulnerable and desperate people. But I think there's also an extent to which the roleplay
in which passive income gurus and their followers indulge allows us to view them as stand-ins for
the more mainstream grifters who run the world's largest companies. The more these wannabes adopt
the routines, vernacular and business models of the super rich, the more we can pretend that they're
one and the same. And this provides a different kind of coping mechanism. Because the CEOs and
investors behind exploitative platform companies like Uber or Amazon or Facebook profit from all
kinds of unethical and unjust practices. Many of us feel their attempt to extract economic
rents every day. But a lot of people have come to accept that those CEOs and investors are
unlikely to ever meaningfully answer for those actions. I mean what level of fine would you
have to inflict on Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg for them to even notice? In a world where such
figures seem untouchable anti-grifter content allows us a taste of justice. We might not be
able to bring down the real rent seekers but we can at least watch their imitators be torn apart.
Again, that's not a bad thing in and of itself. Many of the grifters featured in these videos
have taken huge sums of money from deeply vulnerable people. But I think we have to be careful.
Not to be lured interviewing grifts and grifting as something which only exists on the edges of
our economy. For despite their often low rent appearances, the online grift ecosystem is heavily
inspired by the practices of decidedly mainstream companies. Increasingly large portions of our
economy are predicated on rent seeking and deception. And we do well to be careful that
whilst we're laughing at videos of their small time imitators being taken down,
we're not letting these much larger and much more powerful companies off the hook.
I want to talk about one more scam. One that's sitting right beneath our noses.
Literally. I'm talking about razors. Modern cartridge razors are a classic grift. Shaving
companies lure you in with a discounted starter pack and then once you've committed to using
their system, they charge you a small fortune for replacement blades. Before you know it,
you're spending vast sums each year on these things. And that's where Henson Shaving comes in.
Henson Shaving, who are kindly sponsoring today's video and making it easier than ever to embrace
the simplicity, ease and cost-effectiveness of safety razors. In place of expensive,
plasticy cartridges, safety razors use much cheaper, far more environmentally friendly razor blades
like this one. Which might seem a little daunting at first, but Henson makes it easy.
See, Henson was born out of a family-run machine shop in Canada, which was previously building
parts for the International Space Station. There's stuff from their shop floating around in space
right now. And they've applied the same aerospace standards of precision to building their AL-13
razor. The AL-13 is designed to expose just the right amount of blade at just the right angle,
whilst also providing it with consistent support for the smoothest of shapes. I've been using a
safety razor for a few years now and the upgrade from my previous model to the Henson AL-13 was
night and day. It consistently manages an even, irritation-free shave, and the quality of the
materials and manufacturing just makes it an all-round nice product to use. And of course,
this being a YouTube sponsorship, I have a little deal to offer you too. If you head to
HensonShaving.com forward slash Tom Nicholas and enter the code TomNicholas at checkout to let them
know that I sent you, then you can get a pack of 100 blades for free with the purchase of a razor.
And I mean, if my experience is anything to go by, those blades will last you quite some time.
