Going on an extended vacation, where should we travel to?
Morocco and Africa.
All right, done deal.
Actually, traveling is one of the few things
that I'm not doing.
There's a lot going on that I've sprinkled
throughout some of these videos in the past.
Like, this is going to be one of the last few videos
in this office.
Over the next, I've been thinking about two to three weeks,
Molly and I are going to be gone
out of this house into a new house.
And I try to share as much as possible with y'all.
I kind of feel like I have two different lives.
I have my YouTube software engineering life,
which is my full-time job plus YouTube,
my part-time job, if you will.
And then I have the rest of my life.
Like the fishing, the going out on the boats, the dog,
a lot of other things that are going on.
I've always floated with the idea
of either starting a whole other channel
just so I can kind of post more of non-software development
stuff over there, or if I want to just start working
on integrating a lot of different aspects of my life
into this channel.
Let me know what you think in the comments below.
And I don't care one way or another.
I'm just going to try to figure that out.
But that's not why most of y'all clicked on this video.
You're trying to hear about my regrets
as a computer science student.
If you don't know, last May, so May of 2018,
I graduated from ODU with a computer science degree.
And in this video, we're going to go over a few things,
quite a few things that I felt like I should have done better,
that I regret not doing better and things that I would do
if I had to do it all over again.
And I also want to talk about a few things
that I don't regret, things that I did.
And retrospectively looking at it, I did right.
Now I'm going to be the first to say
that there are more things that I did wrong than I did right,
but I figured out kind of try to balance out
the video a little bit.
And I know I specified computer science in the title.
This very well could be my regrets as a college student,
but I wanted to specify computer science
because computer science is a hard degree to obtain.
I mean, you have to put in a lot of work.
If my major back in college was incredibly simple
or just overall easy, not much problem solving,
not much involved work,
then I probably wouldn't have these regrets.
So let's get into them.
First and foremost, it is treating college like high school.
In high school, I didn't have any homework.
If I did, I got it done in study block or in class,
or it was very, very minuscule.
And in high school, I didn't study.
I didn't feel like I needed to
and I seemed to pass the classes just fine.
So I didn't do homework and I didn't study.
I went to class.
I did my work that needed to get done in class.
And when I went home, I went home.
I kind of like clocked out of work, if you will.
And in college, it doesn't really work that way.
While high school, you go for, let's say,
seven, eight hours a day,
and then maybe you have one to two hours of homework at home.
For college, you go to class for one to two hours a day,
and then you have seven to eight hours of homework at home.
It completely flipped everything around
where everything in high school, you could do in class.
Your teachers were there to teach you everything.
While college, you needed to be doing everything on your own.
Sure, you had the resources of your teacher.
They just kind of go over things
and you have to figure it out yourself.
At least that's how it was in computer science.
It's a lot easier to write a paper in class
or do a math worksheet in class, whatever it may be.
Calc one doesn't matter.
Then it is to write an involved program in class
with a language that you need to Google every other thing
that needs to get done in that program.
That's definitely, that was definitely a big one.
I also regretted not completely understanding
the aspect of computer science
prior to signing up for computer science degree
and attending the computer science classes.
In all honesty, I thought it was more like
a software development degree,
where I was gonna go in, I was gonna learn how to code,
and that was basically, that was the focus
and sure I take electives here and there
to make sure I'm a well-rounded student,
but I thought most of my computer science classes
were gonna be programming, coding, blah, blah, blah.
But it was a lot of theory, a lot of math,
a lot more work and a lot different work
than I previously thought, and that was my own problem.
I didn't do enough research going into it.
I was just naive.
One thing I don't regret,
because I remember very vividly my early years of college,
something that helped me get through my college,
was when I signed up for Angelist.
Now, this isn't necessarily a sponsor,
but it kind of is in a way for this video.
I remember back in my early years,
I signed up for Angelist.
Think of Angelist as a place for startups,
tech startups or what have you to put their company
on this platform, and then software engineers,
software developers, or anyone who would be needed
in a particular tech space to put their resume,
similar to LinkedIn, but for startups
and something that I remember scrolling through
my early years of computer science,
just dreaming about one day,
maybe I can get this iOS development job.
I have a potential to get three to 5% equity
and make $80,000 a year and work remotely.
I just remember scrolling through
all of those things down through Angelist,
and that really helped me drive forward
and try to just pursue that dream.
And if you're someone who is interested
in just checking out Angelist,
you're interested in being a software developer
at a startup, maybe you are a startup.
I'm gonna leave a link in the top of the description.
It's a free for life account to Angelist.
You just go there, you sign up.
This isn't a free trial, this is you sign up
just like you would be signing up
to a social media account, and you go from there.
That is a real thing, I'm glad I did,
simply because it helped me get through to the next step.
If I ever felt, if I ever had the imposter syndrome
or just kind of felt like I wasn't good enough,
I just remembered of where I wanted to be,
I would scroll through that,
and then I would work in order to hopefully one day get there.
Now we're gonna get a bit more generic.
This can go for all college students.
My next regret is neglecting office hours,
something you gotta understand.
While you have your class one to two hours a day per class,
and then you have your homework that you need to get done,
when you do your homework or your projects
or whatever the heck you wanna call it,
and you face a problem, especially in computer science,
and you're trying to figure out a problem, stack overflow,
whatever else your search engine, your internet will show you,
you need to use your office hours
when you've exhausted all resources.
If you can't figure something out,
go to your non-advisor, but your professor for that class,
for that project, so they can help guide you through it.
Make sure you have a decent understanding
of what your problem is.
You wanna talk to them about the solutions that you've tried,
and sometimes you'll figure it out yourself,
like the rubber ducky method.
If I were to talk to this globe right here,
and try to describe my particular problem to this globe,
I can maybe figure it out because I'm trying to formulate words
in order to describe the problem at hand.
Now, that may not happen, and if that doesn't happen,
that's where your professor will come into play and say,
well, maybe you gotta do X, Y, and Z,
and that'll help you get over that hump
and onto the next problem, basically.
So always use those office hours wisely
because they are incredibly valuable.
You're paying for it.
You're paying a lot of money to go to college,
regardless of what degree you have.
That money pays for a lot of different things,
a lot of which is the curriculum,
the professors teaching you the stuff,
and then your professor's office hours.
Just imagine how much money you're wasting
by not using those office hours.
Now, can you call something a regret
when you still do it to this day?
Like, I regret procrastinating so much in school,
but yet, even in my own life, on particular things,
I still procrastinate quite a bit.
I've gotten better at it.
It's a process, but in school, procrastinating was worse.
Like, you would be down to a couple days left
or maybe just the night before you have to turn something in
and you get stuck on a bug or an error,
especially if you're trying to write
some type of program for a class,
and you can't go to office hours.
Your professor probably won't be responding to emails,
and if they are, how many other people procrastinated
just like you until the last night
to ask a professor via email about the problems?
All emailing your professor,
trying to figure out the problems,
while your professor, they don't have much time.
They may be trying to respond to emails at 11 p.m.
when your thing is due at 11.59 p.m.,
but who knows if they're gonna get around to you.
It's a lot better in terms of your grades
and in terms of how much you'll learn.
If you work little by little on these projects
that you have two weeks to complete.
If you start off on it on the second or third day
in which it's assigned or even the night of,
then you're able to use those office hours
like I suggested in the previous regret.
So just make sure you leave yourself enough time.
Don't procrastinate, don't procrastinate.
This is me talking, I'm gonna talk to myself
because like I said, and I wanna leave this
on a positive note with something
that I felt like I did right,
and that is getting in on internships early.
Like I could have maybe done earlier,
but I think it was the summer after my sophomore year
where I got my first internship,
computer science internship,
and then that following fall I had an internship,
and then the next summer I had an internship,
and then that last year, my senior year,
I just kinda did all the work I needed to get done
so I could graduate.
So if you're going to college for anything,
especially computer science,
try to get in on internships early.
Don't worry about, I'm not good enough for internships,
like they don't expect much out of you.
A lot of the work you're gonna be doing
is typical internship work,
something that someone from a computer science degree,
all the way down to a communications degree.
You're gonna be doing the typical intern work,
like Excel spreadsheets, building PowerPoints,
basically anything, Microsoft Office.
You could be rewiring a whole entire data center,
which that's just pulling out plugs
and plugging them back in
and using new power strips and what have you,
or your company's gonna be sending you over to Chicago
for documenting a manual process
in which needs to be automated,
but that manual process occurs from 1 a.m. to roughly 10 a.m.
That was another one of mine,
or you could actually get a coding internship
and that could be, that would be pretty cool too.
Just don't be worried.
They know you're an intern, you're a student.
They don't expect the world out of you.
Just be willing to do the work
and ask questions when you run into a problem.
And that's it.
Those are my regrets as a computer science student
and I sprinkled in a few positive things
that I think I did right.
I know I'm gonna think of something
as soon as I hit that publish button
on, oh man, I should have included that in the video,
or I should have included that.
Literally, I've been adding to this list
over the past few days,
ever since I came up with the idea for this video,
and I know I'm gonna have so many other regrets
or non-regrets that I had as a computer science student.
