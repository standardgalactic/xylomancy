Hey guys it's Sasha, the world is obsessed with AI. Every company is busy telling its
shareholders that they are now not a retail company, not a software company, not a car
company, not a social media company, no. They are all now artificial intelligence companies.
And you can't blame them. Since the start of 2022, the stock market has had one of the
worst crashes in history. Stocks fell 25% in 2022 and have not recovered since then.
But at the same time, the S&P 500 is at an all-time high. This is because in the last
18 months, since chatGPT arrived, the small number of AI stocks have absolutely exploded
in value which has covered up what's actually happening out there to the rest of the stock
market. The race for being the leader in AI is so hot that there is now huge pressure
on companies to release AI products, on companies to call things AI where maybe they're not
quite AI or not at all AI, not because they actually make things better for users if they
use AI in many cases, but because if you have a high enough density of using the word AI
in your quarterly earnings call, your share price automatically increases by 300%. And
the problem is that a lot of these big companies are now so far up their own backside they are
faking their AI because they need to put out something that looks like AI, that they can
sell as AI, but they haven't actually figured out how to make that AI work yet. They haven't
actually made it work, so let's pretend. So yesterday, the information published a story
leaked by an Amazon insider. In the last two years or so, Amazon have released their Just
Walkout technology in some of their shops. The idea is that you can just walk in and Amazon
develop this AI that automatically checks what it is that you put in your basket through cameras
and sensors in the shop, and you don't have to queue up at the checkout, you don't have to pay
for it, you just walk out of the store with the stuff that you've picked up and you will get
billed automatically afterwards. Now, I tried this a few times, although the prices in these shops
are so high, it doesn't make any sense, and I only really did it for novelty value, but the weird
thing is that when you go and do the shop, you don't get an immediate notification when you
come out saying, hey Sasha, thanks for shopping with Amazon, here is your itemized bill, we've
charged your credit card $25. No, it takes several hours for that to happen, and I thought that was
a bit strange because if it's automatic, if it's driven by AI, why does it take several hours for
the automatic life system to send you the bill? Well, it now turns out that this AI was actually
1000 people sitting in a room somewhere in India watching the cameras from the shops
and manually adjusting your basket. According to this whistleblower, 70% of all transactions in
these shops were processed manually via this team in India. I guess anything other than you may be
picking up one item for the novelty value and then walking straight out becomes too complicated for
this AI to actually process. Amazon quickly tried to perform damage limitation, and Amazon spoke
out and said that associates may validate a small minority of shopping visits where our
computer vision technology cannot determine with complete confidence and the individual's purchases.
Amazon went and quickly deleted a bunch of pages which described this AI when they first
launched the product. According to Amazon, this story is completely untrue and the system works
great and their associates in India are really just there to help train the AI system, which is
working just fine, which is why two days ago, just before that new story broke, because Amazon
knew it was coming, they announced that they are cancelling the just walk out system in their stores,
you know, the one that's working really great, and they are replacing it with shopping trolleys.
But Amazon is not the only big company that is actively faking AI. Back in December, Google
announced Gemini, because I guess even the execs at Google realized that even though their personal
butler at home is called Bard, it is in fact actually a pretty bad name for an AI tool.
So in December, Google published this video where they showcased the capability of Gemini.
They would show Gemini things, ask Gemini things, and it would respond, except it came out sometime
after that video was published that the entire thing was faked. The interaction was faked,
the video was faked, the responses were manually fed through to the AI engine, submitting some
hyperspecific still images, not what was in the video, until the AI just happened to give the right
answer. And then they put all those right answers together, did a voiceover of the answers to pretend
that it worked seamlessly as it did in the video. It's not the first time Google faked an AI demo.
Back in 2018, Sunda Pichai demonstrated an AI system called Duplex. By the way, what is it with
the reference to the number two? You know, Duplex, Gemini. Anyway, in 2018, Google demonstrated
that this new AI assistant can do things like phone a restaurant on your behalf to make you a
reservation, so you don't have to. I'm looking for something on May 3rd, so it can be one second.
And naturally, people asked a lot of questions, people were intrigued,
and Google ignored all of those questions. The most obvious question was, was that
demonstration completely faking fake? Because it sure looked like a complete fake in the video,
and well, six years later, that assistant still doesn't exist. So you can decide for yourself
whether that was another completely fabricated bit of AI, but it doesn't stop there.
You know the mysterious Google algorithm, the almighty powerful algorithm that decides
which websites get shown for which results? Well, Google has long been saying how advanced
their ranking system is, you know, how results are automatically generated. This whole thing is
being operated by extremely sophisticated AI. There is a whole page rank system behind the scenes
that automatically determines if your content is helpful, and there is no human element to it
whatsoever to prevent bias. Well, it just so happens that Google employs 16,000 people called
quality raters. There is a whole giant training document for these people, here it is, it's 170
pages long, and these people spend all day every day manually assessing the websites, you know,
the websites that are ranked by this really amazing AI. For example, they're meant to try and check if
the content creator lacks adequate experience, lacks adequate expertise. If the content creator
is not an authoritative or trustworthy source. And by the way, your website gets the lowest
possible score if the website terms of use states that some articles are generated by
artificial intelligence and may have errors or be out of date, which of course makes perfect sense,
because instead of showing these rubbish websites, Google now shows you answers generated by
artificial intelligence that often have errors and the information is out of date, talking of which
the most talked about AI that exists today is chat GPT by open AI. It is like the holy grail.
And of course, Bing, Microsoft Search Engine uses open AI in their results. And you know the spiel
you told that these are highly sophisticated, highly complex systems that learn on data,
that you feed into it, and then it becomes incredibly intelligent. You see learning on
other people's data is not stealing. It is not copyright theft. It is far more advanced than
that. You just don't get it. It's a bit like how artists learn by looking at other artists they
grow up. And to be honest, these AI models are just so complicated that none of us with our small
brains can possibly understand or compute how clever they are, because they do not, do not
scrape the internet and then just spit out that same content. No, no, no, no, no. I went and asked
Bing to tell me what the best road trips from Las Vegas are. And it said, certainly, if you're in
Las Vegas and looking for exciting road trips, here are some fantastic options. One, Nelson
Goes Town and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Interesting choice at number one. It's funny because there
is this article here written by some guy called Sasha called 21 best road trips from Las Vegas.
And you know what? It's not the best article out there. But wouldn't you know it? The number one
spot in this article is also Nelson Goes Town and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Word for word. How
strange? How far is it? Well, it's exactly 45 minutes and 45 miles from Las Vegas, which is
interesting because that's a very precise number of minutes. But you know, probably just a coincidence.
So just outside Las Vegas, you'll find the ghost town of Nelson. There's half rusted old cars,
you know, an interesting phrase to use. It's a very unusual way of putting that. Then there's
rattlesnakes in a freezer. Hmm. According to Google, there is literally only one results
on the internet that uses this exact phrase. And I guess rattlesnakes should be spelled as one word.
I guess I made a mistake. Well, never mind. Being also spelt it as two words. Such a coincidence is
crazy. So then there's even crashed airplanes. Take care when exploring though, because rattlesnakes
are common. Tours of the gold mine run at 9am, 12pm and 2pm. Taking you through Nevada's richest
mine that operated for nearly 80 years. And you know what? I just checked their website and it's
funny because I actually got that last bit wrong. The mine ran from 1861 until 1942. So it was actually
a bit more than 80 years. Isn't it such a coincidence? The being made the same exact mistake
using the same exact words. Anyway, number two on their list is the Valley of Fire State Park.
And it's 50 minutes and 49 miles from Las Vegas. Very precise. Although strangely, if you look it up
on being maps, you know, the being map service, that says 53 miles. Because I guess being maps
is measuring to the middle of the park. Where did they get the 49 miles from? How strange. Anyway,
you get the point. This AI is just plain stealing content from other websites. Slightly changing
some of the words and showing that instead of showing the website from which the information
was stolen. Just because this information is processed and stored in a neural net does not
somehow make it immune from general laws about, I don't know, theft, right? This AI is what is
known in the industry as an automated content spinner. You might have noticed in the last six
months that a huge number of smaller medium sized websites have stopped being shown on Google.
They're disappearing. These websites are going bankrupt because they're getting no traffic now.
Now when you search something, you get an AI answer from the search engine, which basically has stolen
the content of those small websites that they no longer show. Then you get a 15 year old Reddit
post at the top. This of course has nothing to do with Google signing a commercial deal with Reddit
to use Reddit data for their AI training. It has nothing to do with Reddit traffic randomly growing
by over 500% in the last few months for no apparent reason whatsoever. Because Google is now sending
them all of the traffic that they used to send to the small websites. And it has nothing to do with
the fact that Reddit just went and did an IPO immediately after their traffic exploded. And
the owner of Reddit sold a massive boatload of shares becoming incredibly rich after the company
was valued based on the fact that their traffic is now 500% higher than it was a year ago. This
of course is all a complete coincidence. The fact is there are a lot of people making a lot of money
from this AI hype wave. Not in the sense of earning revenue and making profits because no,
AI is a loss making in most cases at the moment. But in the sense of the price of company shares,
a lot of companies including the very biggest companies in the world are now so balls deep in
their commitment to AI because it's all smoke mirrors and pretend games that they have to lie,
they have to break the law and they have to create fake AI to keep their stock price high.
Making false statements as a publicly traded company about your AI capabilities is not punished.
The SEC does not seem to give a shit that these companies are openly brazenly lying about their
products to their customers, about their developments and new releases to their investors. It's AI bro,
it's the future, it's pushing the boundaries and the result? Well, other than the stock price going
up in a vertical line, the real life experience of people in many cases is getting worse. Remember
when you could actually find useful information on Google? Well, now you have an AI generated answer
followed by some shopping results followed by four ad slots before you see the first actual result.
You now often have to scroll quite far down just to see the first result and that actual first
result is going to be a Reddit post from 15 years ago. Remember when you could actually call up a
company if you had a problem? And there would be a human, a person at the other end, who would
actually help you with your problem? Well, now that person has been fired so that the company
can have less cost and make more profits. And instead, you have the AI chatbot, which apparently
is what everybody wants because I don't know about you but every single time I speak to one of these
chatbots, I immediately get the perfect resolution to all of my problems and I do not sit there
staring at the fucking screen, spitting and fuming in rage. When the AI chatbot gives me
yet another generic answer, sends me to the FAQs or asks me to rephrase the question.
It's indisputable that in the long run, AI is going to fundamentally improve our lives.
It's here to stay, it's going to do great things. When AI can drive your car for you,
when the AI can take over the boring chores and do the shit that you don't want to do,
or when AI can automate the jobs that people would prefer not doing. But at the moment,
companies are a million miles from there. They're just using the hype for personal advantage.
They're busy faking AI and then promoting that fake AI to boost their share price because who
cares about the fact that your product is actually worse? Who cares if that AI is actually
unprofitable? Who cares that you piss off your customers and ruin your product? Remember,
you are a monopoly. It doesn't matter. It's AI, bro.
And AI means that your stock just keeps on going up to the moon.
