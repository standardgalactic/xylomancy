Hi guys, in this video I'm going to show you how you can create a REST API by using Julia.
API means here Application Programming Interface.
Due to this you can talk to any language like you can call, you can talk to any language
and even you can talk with the command line by the curl and you can also talk from mobile.
You can think as suppose you go to the Japanese restaurant and you don't know Japanese and
what you need to do now you need a converter who convert English language into Japanese
then you finally got the dish.
For example you can if you use the azure azure is a cloud platform which is provided
by the Microsoft and there are API available for different different services for if you
want to do text analytics there is also there is API available for that for different task
for API is available in the azure similarly for Google cloud and Amazon web service.
Similarly if you go to the yatra.com or booking.com so this website basically for traveling or
hotel booking or flight booking they under the hood they actually using the API.
So API is very famous things in the internet and you use probably you use most of the time
API service in your daily life.
So what I will do so I am calling the REST API to the Julia from the R programming.
So what I do I create a JSON data structure in R then I send to the JSON request to the
Julia server Julia REST API server then Julia response the JSON response.
So suppose I want a sum of the array so four plus five nine plus six fifteen so it will
give you the result the fifteen like that you can call to any language like I will show
you in two language R and Python to create a REST API in Julia I am using here Gini package.
So this is the basic command first out what I am doing I activating the Gini environment
variable then I changed the directory Gini apps.
So if you observed here this is my folder so I am going there by run this command CD
so change directory then I import the Gini package to create the REST API you have to
type new app underscore web service and put here your app name so I am I am taking here
test zero so this is my app name.
So when you run this it will create a create the template for you this is my home directory
and this is my folder under this folder.
So this is a my template so this is my whole app test zero to run your app what you can
do so in under the bin directory so you have to run either server or REPL all the logic
you have to type here in roots.gl file so I open this file.
So I need to use the router it is a compulsory and I am also using Gini and I also using
the request module so for that type here Gini dot request to rendering the JSON response
I have to use the JSON for so I type here renderer dot JSON now I am making the root
so JSON payload whatever you can give the name and I want to do the post request request
so method I want post to show you the JSON response you have to use the macros at the
at the rate so so I I want to show the JSON payload this is a function
this function is written this is so to the user I also want to show the
row payload then I want to save the user's data so suppose users give me the array so I
save this in a variable suppose you
JSON payload is a function which is return a dictionary so that's why I am writing here in
the close bracket I show you how it actually work so I open the REPL so first I am making the
first function f which have no argument and it return our data structure integer so one
so whenever I call f then press enter it will return no parenthesis so it will return a one
function similarly suppose if I type here the data structure array one two and three
if I call this function so this is no this has no argument so I have to call in parenthesis
if you press enter it will return a data structure array similarly if I type here a dictionary
so if I call this function it will return a dictionary if I want to extract the first element
so I have to write here in bracket a
so it will return an array like that it return an array of the users
now I want to do some calculation in this array let's suppose I want to show the
sum of the vector to the user now I want to give the JSON response you just need to use the JSON
function that's it and your REST API is ready now now I run the app so bin REPL
call the up function to run the server so my app is running in this URL
now I am calling from R or R and Python so this is Python and first I am importing the request
module so then I am requesting the post request in this URL so this is my server URL so if you
observed here Julia is running in the so what I do I just copy this URL and paste this so this is
the local host and this is the port number and this is my the root and I am giving the JSON data
array 456 so I run this command to get the result response type here response your variable name
and JSON so as you can see that a sum of arrays 15 so which is 100 correct similarly in R you
have to use the STTR library and JSON library I write here URL where my Julia server is running
and I put here JSON data then I run the post request
to see the content you have to use the content function in the R
so as you can see that sum of arrays 15 thank you
