Today we will start talking about, so this week, so let me show you this slide, there
you go, one slide, life is critical.
So what do we mean by this?
So we talked about the laws of order, right?
Laws of disorder and laws of order, do you remember?
Now I will speculate and many people did speculate that life is between order and disorder.
But how?
So life is at that critical place, life appears at that critical place because life needs
order to sustain its processes but life needs disorder to be adaptable to changes, okay?
So today we will look at what physicists mean when they talk about a critical system, disorder
order and the transition between phase transition.
So I want to start with a method called Monte Carlo method, have you heard of it?
Yes?
You have heard of it, you never tried it, just heard, right?
Have you heard of the casino, Monte Carlo?
Yes, so the method takes its name from the casino, okay?
Which is basically a place where you throw dice, right, random number in it.
So let's, usually this simple problem is stated for understanding of Monte Carlo.
So if I take random numbers between zero and one, okay, random numbers and then if I count
the ones that are inside the unit circle divided by the total number, what do you expect to
get?
So pi times one over two squared divided by one squared, pi over four, right?
So let's actually do this and if you throw enough dice, then let's call this set S1,
the number of S1 divided by total number will converge to pi over four, right?
So you can actually take this four to the other side and get an approximation of pi
as the run continues, right?
So we will not do it smoothly, we will just, okay, how many numbers do you want to, one
million, maybe, let me quickly change the font, okay?
So random numbers, two rows of random, no, columns, this one is column, right?
Two columns of random numbers, right?
So how do you find the ones that are inside the unit circle?
We can do sum of r one squared plus r two squared, right?
More than one, do you agree?
And divide it by n, multiply it with four, we should get pi, are you ready?
I haven't tried it before, there you go, we get pi to sum, okay, if I do it ten million
times, I get a better pi, not that better, yes, there you go, much better pi, right?
Are you with me?
Yes, so today we will talk about, so what Monte Carlo did is you throw some dice, you
have some, you look at the system and you take an average over many trials and you get
some physical property, okay?
Today we will look at a particular case called, I think it's called easing model, not easing.
So easing model, models magnetization, have you heard of magnetization?
You know what the magnet is, yes, have you heard of Curie temperature, yes?
What is Curie temperature?
Again you have heard of it.
Yes, exactly, so if we have a magnet, let's say this is T, okay, and this is magnetization,
sorry magnetization, like the total strength of the magnet, if you are at zero temperature,
okay, then all the tiny magnets are aligned, so atomic magnets are aligned, so you have
maximum magnetization and as you increase the temperature, those tiny magnets fluctuate,
right?
And when you reach at the Curie temperature, you lose all magnetization, so zero magnet.
So this is the phase transition, so you go from order to disorder, okay?
Here magnets are aligned, so you have a net magnetization, here they are disordered.
Do you have any questions so far?
No?
So we talked about order laws, but we mainly focused on biological kind of order, like
pattern formation or something, there is one law of order that sits right in front of us,
which is energy minimization, okay?
So if you are at zero temperature, things go to their minimum energy, right?
And for example, atoms reach their minimum energy by making bonds with other atoms.
And why do we have order?
Because the atoms are very similar to each other, right?
So their environment eventually becomes similar, that's why you form crystals, depending on
the bonding of the atoms.
Are you following my argument?
So if you have carbon atoms, 10 to the 23 of them, each one interacting with the other
one in the same fashion, so you expect to get something ordered because they are all the
same, right?
But if you increase the temperature, and if those bonds are not strong enough, like in
silicon, you get an amorphous material.
Do you have any questions so far?
Okay.
So what about magnets?
This easing model is very simple, but very rich.
So it describes, do you remember this u equals to minus mu dot b?
You remember from physics 102?
Magnetic moments get lower energy when they are aligned with magnetic field.
Why are you smiling?
So now we will look at the case when two magnets interact.
In fact, we will even simplify it further and we'll assume that these tiny magnets can
either have upstate or downstate.
Do you have any questions so far?
So let's call these states S1 and S2 as a vector, okay?
And the energy, the interaction energy between them, if I write it in this way where J is
positive, what kind of interaction do they have?
Do they want to be aligned or not aligned?
Do they want to stay opposite to each other or to stay in the same direction?
So let's derive.
So if both of them is one, okay, like if both of them are aligned, what is the energy?
Minus J.
Right?
If they are opposite, one and minus one, what is the energy?
Plus J.
Which one is lower energy?
Minus J.
So they want to be aligned, okay?
Do you have any questions so far?
Did you miss anything so far?
So when this is positive, you have a ferromagnetic interaction, ferromagnet, okay?
When J is negative, what do you have?
No.
No?
Anti-ferromagnetic.
Thank you all.
So you have anti-ferromagnetic state where all spins want to be opposite, all neighbors
want to be opposite to each other.
Did I draw it properly?
So you will have something like this.
Do you have any questions so far?
Yes.
How do you know if an object is anti-ferromagnetic, not something else, or anti-ferromagnetic?
Very good question.
That's a very good question.
So in the calculation that I do, for example, if I am allowed to switch off the magnetic
interaction, then I see that non-magnetic state has higher energy than anti-ferromagnetic
state.
Did you follow?
So I can do calculations using dense function theory, for example, right?
So I take a material, I do a non-magnetic calculation, I get an energy value E1, then
I do a magnetic calculation, magnetic interaction is on, okay?
But I see zero magnetization at the end of the calculation, but I see that E2 is smaller
than E1.
But how about experiments, right?
What would you see in experiments?
I don't know.
Okay.
But did you get a gist of an answer here?
I hope so.
That's a very good approach.
So you can see the dynamics of the system with respect to applied magnetic field.
You are not happy.
I think so, like, first of all, this one will not get magnetized at all, I guess.
So this one, the non-magnetic material would not interact with magnetic field.
Because its spins are all fulfilled, they are dream, they have all found their pairs.
Well we are at the edge of my knowledge, so let's, this is embarrassing, but I don't know,
I don't have a good answer.
So let's move on.
So we will look at ferromagnetic case, where you expect all spins to be aligned eventually
at zero Kelvin, right?
So let's look at, I'm sure, can I ask you a question about the alignment of course.
So is it like something one-dimensional, could they only be facing the same way or vice versa?
Or could there be some, I mean, are we defining how it is like, they are either facing the
same direction or they are not, but not specific like this?
Or could there be some kind of, okay.
So is it one-dimensional?
In our model, there is only two, there are only two states, like on and off, okay?
But normally there are these things called magnons, like phonons, photons, electrons,
they are magnons that corresponds to this kind of oscillation, like, let's say they
are all aligned, but you introduce just like in the atoms when they are at their equilibrium.
If you, what, yes, precession, yes, very good.
So if you just disturb this atom, it will create a wave, right?
And we call them phonons, okay?
In a similar fashion, if you have like perfectly aligned magnetic moments and then you process
one of them and that interacts with the other, processes the other, you create a wave that
acts as a particle called magnon.
But for our case, we are just like defining a finite kind of a particle, yes, yes, and
this is again, I don't want to go into too much discussion, but have you heard of quantum
mechanics?
Yes, so there weird things happen, like if you are measuring a spin of an electron in
a certain direction, you either get plus one over two or minus one over two, although they
could have been, I mean, quantum mechanically, when you operate on something, it just goes
to one of its eigenvalues.
So it's not far away from the truth, this interaction, thank you.
So let's think of four spins, okay?
Just four spins.
So how much energy do we have here in total?
Go ahead, don't be scared.
Just four J, just four spins.
Yes, like this interaction, this interaction, this and this, we don't have this interaction.
Okay, do you have any questions so far?
No.
So let's look at another state where this is present.
So what is the total energy here?
Minus two J, very good, right?
So what about, zero, I trust you, so minus, minus, plus, plus, you are right.
So what about this one?
Plus four J, okay?
So remember Boltzmann distribution, do you remember it?
This is the probability of a certain state, KBT, do you remember this?
So if you are at a certain temperature, let's say you are at a certain temperature, the
probability of having this state is e to the minus four J over KBT, I mean, if you want
to find the probability, you need to sum all other probabilities, right?
Because for example, this one is e to the zero KBT and e to the four J over KBT, do
you understand what I'm doing?
So let's say this is the total probabilities, this is the probability of this one happening,
so it's very small, right, compared to others.
This is more probable and this is the most probable.
Actually in fact, if you go to zero temperature, this will be infinitely more probable than
the others, so it will be the only possibility and it will go there.
Did you follow so far the discussion?
Yes?
So what we are going to do is, we are going to simulate any configuration of spins at
a certain temperature, okay, at a certain temperature.
So how do we do this?
How will we do this and how it will connect to Monte Carlo method?
Well there we have Nicholas Metropolis, okay, from Los Alamos.
By the way, I want to point out Los Alamos guys, okay, they built the A-bomb, that's
a different story, but Los Alamos brought so many brilliant people, right, let's just
name them Feynman von Neumann, right, Metropolis, Fermi, who else?
Ulam.
Ulam, definitely, and many others, right, and Feigenbaum, by the way, Los Alamos.
So some, and generally numerically interesting thing came out of there because that was the
place where computers were used massively for the first time, I guess, right, to calculate
the effect of the explosion, you agree?
So let's just look at Metropolis's Magnum Opus, the greatest work of Metropolis, where
is it?
Just if we type Nicholas Metropolis and maybe Metropolis Monte Carlo, it's not, no, I wanted
to show you the citations, it's more than, it's around 7,000, but I will show you the
paper, never mind, so this is the paper.
Equation of state calculation by fast computing machines, like iPhones, okay, so, da-da-da-da-da,
this is, is this the part where the sublime part, yes, we then calculate the change in
energy of the system, delta E, which is caused by the move, if delta E is smaller than zero,
if the move would bring the system to a lower state energy, we allow the move and put the
particle in its new position.
I will explain this, but let's read it first from the original.
If delta is bigger than zero, we allow the move with the probability of this one, e to
the minus delta E k B T, so here I will tell you something more from this, let me find
that word, those words, it will be worth it, just let me find, okay, never mind, so I had
some point here, let me make that point and everything will be clear, I promise you, okay,
so how would you calculate magnetization in this system?
Let's say you put four spins into a temperature of some T and you want to find the total magnetization,
how would you calculate it?
Well, I'm talking about this simple system that has, so what you are going to do is,
for all possibilities, you have the energies, right, and those energies will give you the
probabilities, do you agree?
So what is this total magnetization in this system, four, right, if it's one plus one
plus one, it's four.
So can I do the following, I integrate over all possible states the probability of being
at that energy times the magnetization at that energy, yes, yes, it's the expectation
of magnetization, did you follow this, yes, so what we did is, we look at, we sampled
the whole system, then we took the possibilities and we multiplied them to find the average.
Metropolis Monte Carlo approaches it a different way, okay, it samples with that probability,
then it takes the average.
So let me restate this, in this case, we take all possibilities, multiply them with their
probabilities, then sum them up, right, then average them out.
In the metropolis case, you choose, you already choose the systems with the relevant probabilities
and then you average them out.
Who can explain what I just told you, yes, for me, that's the bad version, yes, so what
is the good version, you take the states according to their probability already, you sample them
according to their probability, then you take those samples and you take the average.
If I could find that sentence, it's much better put in Metropolis's paper, please go ahead
and read it and find that sentence.
So let me restate it one final time, instead of taking all possible states and averaging
them according to their probabilities, we take the states according to their probabilities
and average them out.
The number of states in the first case, the number of states, I think, in the second case,
are the same?
No, that's the whole point.
The number in the first case, I have to take all numbers, everything, everything that is
possible.
Let me tell you what I take.
So Metropolis's algorithm tells you that you should take them in the following way.
So let's say you pick one single spin and you calculate what happens if you flip it, okay?
That's how you calculate delta e.
So let's say you are here and I choose this one.
What is the change in the energy if I flip it?
Be careful when you calculate this.
It goes from minus 4j to 4j, so it's 8j.
Do you agree?
Yes.
So Metropolis says that we should accept this flip with this probability, minus 8j over
KBT, okay?
And what if you have something like this?
Something like this.
What if you flip this one?
What is the delta e?
Minus 8j.
Everybody agrees?
It's 4j before, then it's minus 4j.
Did you follow?
And according to Metropolis's algorithm, if the energy decreases, you accept it, okay?
So by doing this, energy decreases accept, energy increases accept with this probability.
If you continue doing this, then you are sampling according to Boltzmann distribution eventually,
okay?
I didn't, I was expecting that this part will take like 10 minutes, but it took 30.
So I will not explain many details of this code.
I hope you can figure it out.
So by the way, the only possible, by the flips, the only possible energy chains are minus
8j, minus 4j, 0, plus 4j, and plus 8j.
So if the energy change is minus 8j, then there is one probability of switching.
If it's minus 4j, one probability.
What is, what if the energy change is 0?
Again one probability because e to the 0 over KBT, right?
But the others will switch with this probability, okay?
Did you follow all this?
So I will start with random spins, up and downs.
And this part, you can see that this is the flip, the spin.
That's all.
And just these parts are making sure that you are choosing a random spin, and according
to the probability, you flip it.
Did you follow?
So let's run it and see what we get.
We get this interesting structure.
I have to point out here that this is not the real dynamics, okay?
This is not like molecular dynamics.
It's just we are sampling the system.
Are you following?
Do you agree?
Sir, how hard is the matrix of the elements?
200 by 200.
So we take each, so in one sample, do we take one?
No, that's a very good point.
So each time this picture changes, we actually flip 200 squared spins, not at the same time.
That's very good.
All of those are very good points, but I have very short time, unfortunately.
Can you give me five more minutes after 10.30, yes?
So you are flipping each spin, I mean, you are each time looking at one spin, and here
I actually do that n squared times, but not necessarily with the same order.
Randomly I pick n squared times, I pick one spin, should I flip it or not?
With certain probability, I flip it or not?
Did you follow all this?
In the n squared choices you have, but even with that?
Sometimes one spin doesn't get picked at this n squared runs, but that's okay.
So let's see, so right now KBT is 2.
What if I change temperature?
So let's go to this code.
So here I will start with 1.5, T minimum is 1.5.
I will go to maximum temperature of 3, then I will go back to 1.5, then I will go back
to 3.
So I want you to see what happens when the temperature is changed, okay, ready?
So this is low temperature, which means that you have aligned magnets, do you agree?
The blue parts are minus spins, so they are all aligned, you have big magnetization.
Now we are approaching this critical temperature where you have transition from order, this
is order, and you are going towards disorder, okay, where your magnetization will go down
to zero.
So you can see that we have almost equal amount of plus ones and minus ones.
Are you following all this?
Now did we reach the maximum temperature?
We have reached it now, now we go back.
So what will happen when we go back?
Any ideas?
Once you go below critical temperature, you should see the order reappear, right?
Domains, very good.
So you will see domains appear and those domains, one of them will dominate.
We don't know which one, so I think right now my bet is on yellow one, right?
One of them will dominate and flip the others, no?
Blue one?
So I am taking the bets, blue, yellow, okay, no one else, I think?
Yes, yes, yes, there is a hysteresis and again, let me restate.
This is not an actual simulation of a magnet, we are just sampling the system.
Are you confused, no?
So this easy model is not easy to solve at all, okay, although the name suggests that
way.
So it was solved by this genius, Lars Onsager, have you heard of him?
Not many people have heard of him.
Yes, critical systems and far from equilibrium systems, right?
He got the Nobel Prize in 1968 for this stuff and he actually solved the easing model analytically.
Can you believe it, genius?
So let's look at that paper, two-dimensional model with an older disorder transition.
Let's just skip through this paper and you will see different mathematics introduced
to solve this quaternion algebra.
So 33 pages of pure beauty, do you see it?
Well, there is only his name here.
But let's go to acknowledgments, which is before this long appendix.
Is this still the appendix?
No acknowledgment.
Yes, what is the year?
1943, right in the middle of the war, he solved this problem.
So he gave us a very nice formula, okay?
Let's find that formula for critical temperature, where the critical temperature occurs.
Let's go ahead and find that formula.
Yes, there it is.
So if you rearrange it, ktc over j should be this weird number 2 over ln 1 plus square
root 2, okay?
And we also have the formula for magnetization.
Where is that formula?
So we have analytical solution, never mind, I have this formula in my code.
Let me show you.
This is that formula, 1 minus sin hyperbolic 2 times j over kbt to the power of minus 4
in the brackets to the power of 1 over 8, never mind.
So what I will do here, are you following, yes?
What I will do here is I will go from, so I will define tc to be this number, 2 over
ln 1 plus something.
And I will go from half of the critical temperature to the 1.5 of the critical temperature, okay?
And each time, we will start, we will do how many runs, let's see, we will do thousand
different runs, okay?
Each one flipping the spins 200 square times.
So 200 square times thousand gives you 40 million, right?
So we will sample 40 million pictures from the system, do you agree?
And well, let's run this code, and while it runs, I will talk about it.
So we have run the first one of this temperature, so let me, what we are doing is, this one
is t critical.
So we start from 0.5 t critical, and we take the system, we run the system thousand times,
and each time we flip 200 squared spins.
But we only take the last 100 steps and average the magnetization from those pictures, did
you follow?
Yes?
What do we expect to get?
So magnetization versus temperature.
What would you expect?
Let's say all spins pointing at the same direction is 1.
So when the temperature is low, it should be very close to 1, right?
And at this point, it has to go sharply to 0, right?
And remain at 0 forever, right?
Let's see the result, there you go.
And what is this line?
The red line?
Yes, analytical solution of metropolis.
Do you see that our numerical calculation using metropolis algorithm is matching it
almost perfectly?
Do you have any questions?
So this particular point where it switches will be critical for life.
So this is where life wants to be at the criticality.
And at least now you have a sense of order and disorder.
Next time we will explore those concepts even further.
Do you have any questions?
Thank you all.
Take care.
