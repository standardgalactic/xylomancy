Naively, I certainly thought that all humans would have words for exact counting, and the
Piroha don't.
Okay?
So they don't have any words for even one.
There's not a word for one in their language.
So there's certainly not a word for two, three, or four, so that kind of blows people's minds
off.
Yeah, that's blowing my mind.
That's pretty weird.
How are you going to ask, I want two of those?
You just don't.
And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in the Piroha.
It's not possible.
Because there's no words for that.
The following is a conversation with Edward Gibson, or TED, as everybody calls him.
He is a psycholinguistics professor at MIT.
He heads the MIT Language Lab that investigates why human languages look the way they do,
the relationship between cultural language and how people represent, process, and learn
language.
Also, you should have a book titled Syntax, A Cognitive Approach, published by MIT Press,
coming out this fall.
So look out for that.

And now, dear friends, here's Edward Gibson.
When did you first become fascinated with human language?
As a kid in school, when we had to structure sentences in English grammar, I found that
process interesting.
I found it confusing as to what it was I was told to do.
I didn't understand what the theory was behind it, but I found it very interesting.
So when you look at grammar, you're almost thinking about like a puzzle, like almost
like a mathematical puzzle?
Yeah, I think that's right.
I didn't know I was going to work on this at all at that point.
I was really just, I was kind of a math geek person.
Computer scientist, I really liked computer science.
And then I found language as a neat puzzle to work on from an engineering perspective.
Actually, that's what I, as a, I sort of accidentally, I decided after I finished my undergraduate
degree, which was computer science and math and Canada and Queens University, I decided
to go to grad school.
It's like, that's what I always thought I would do.
And I went to Cambridge where they had a masters in a master's program in computational linguistics.
And I hadn't taken a single language class before.
All I'd taken was CS, computer science, math classes, pretty much, mostly as an undergrad.
And I just thought this was an interesting thing to do for a year because it was a single
year program.
And then I ended up spending my whole life doing it.
So fundamentally, your journey through life was one of a mathematician and computer scientists.
And then you kind of discovered the puzzle, the problem of language and approached it
from that angle to try to understand it from that angle, almost like a mathematician or
maybe even an engineer.
As an engineer, I'd say, I mean, to be frank, I had taken an AI class, I guess it was 83
or 85, somewhere 84 in there a long time ago.
And there was a natural language section in there.
And it didn't impress me.
I thought there must be more interesting things we can do.
It seemed just a bunch of hacks to me.
It didn't seem like a real theory of things in any way.
And so I just thought this seemed like an interesting area where there wasn't enough good work.
Did you ever come across the philosophy angle of logic?
So if you think about the 80s with AI, the expert systems where you try to kind of maybe
sidestep the poetry of language and some of the syntax and the grammar and all that kind
of stuff and go to the underlying meaning that language is trying to communicate and
try to somehow compress that in a computer-representable way.
Did you ever come across that in your studies?
I mean, I probably did, but I wasn't as interested in it.
I was trying to do the easier problems first, the ones I could thought maybe were handleable,
which seems like the syntax is easier, which is just the forms as opposed to the meaning.
Like when you're starting to talk about the meaning, that's a very hard problem.
And it still is a really, really hard problem, but the forms is easier.
And so I thought at least figuring out the forms of human language, which sounds really hard,
but is actually maybe more attractable.
So it's interesting, you think there is a big divide, there's a gap,
there's a distance between form and meaning.
Because that's a question you have discussed a lot with LLMs, because they're damn good at form.
Yeah, I think it's what they're good at, is form.
Exactly. And that's why they're good, because they can do form, meanings are.
Do you think there's... Oh, wow. I mean, it's an open question, right?
How close form and meaning are? We'll discuss it, but to me,
studying form, maybe it's a romantic notion, gives you... Form is like the shadow of the
bigger meaning thing underlying language. Language is how we communicate ideas.
We communicate with each other using language.
So in understanding the structure of that communication,
I think you start to understand the structure of thought and the structure of meaning behind
those thoughts and communication, to me. But to you, big gap.
Yeah. What do you find most beautiful about human language?
Maybe the form of human language, the expression of human language.
What I find beautiful about human language is some of the generalizations.
That happen across human languages, within and across a language.
So let me give you an example of something which I find kind of remarkable.
That is if a language, if it has a word order, such that the verbs tend to come before their
objects. And so that's like English does that. So we have the first... The subject comes first in
a simple sentence. So I say, the dog chased the cat or Mary kicked the ball.
So the subject's first the... And then after the subject, there's the verb.
And then we have objects. All these things come after in English.
And so it's generally a verb. And most of the stuff that we want to say comes after the subject.
It's the objects. There's a lot of things we want to say they come after.
And there's a lot of languages like that. About 40% of the languages of the world
are looked like that. They're subject verb object languages.
And then these languages tend to have prepositions, these little markers
on the nouns that connect nouns to other nouns or nouns to verbs.
So a preposition like in or on or of or about, I say I talk about something.
The something is the object of that preposition that we have.
These little markers come also, just like verbs, they come before their nouns.
So now we look at other languages like Japanese or Hindi or some...
These are so-called verb-final languages. Those is about maybe a little more than 40%,
maybe 45% of the world's languages are more... I mean, 50% of the world's languages are verb-final.
Those tend to be postpositions. Those markers, they have the same kinds of markers
as we do in English, but they put them after. So sorry, but they put them first.
The markers come first. So you say instead of talk about a book, you say a book about
the opposite order there in Japanese or in Hindi. You do the opposite.
And the talk comes at the end. So the verb will come at the end as well.
So instead of Mary kicked the ball, it's Mary ball kicked.
And then if it says Mary kicked the ball to John, it's John two.
The two, the marker there, the preposition, it's a postposition in these languages.
And so the interesting thing, a fascinating thing to me is that within a language,
this order aligns. It's harmonic. And so if it's one or the other,
it's either verb-initial or verb-final, but then you'll have prepositions, prepositions,
or postpositions. And that's across the languages that we can look at.
We've got around 7,000 languages on the earth right now, but we have information
about, say, word order on around 1,000 of those pretty decent amount of information.
And for those 1,000, which we know about, about 95% fit that pattern.
So they will have either verb, it's about half and half, half verb-initial,
like English and half verb-final, like Japanese.
So just to clarify, verb-initial is subject, verb, object.
That's correct.
Verb-final is still subject, object, verb.
That's correct. Yeah, the subject is generally first.
That's so fascinating. I ate an apple or I apple ate.
Yes.
Okay. And it's fascinating that there's a pretty even division in the world amongst those 40, 45%.
Yeah, it's pretty even. And those two are the most common by far. Those two
word orders, the subject tends to be first. There's so many interesting things, but these things
are what I find so fascinating is there are these generalizations within and across a language.
And not only those are the, and there's actually a simple explanation, I think,
for a lot of that. And that is, you're trying to like minimize dependencies between words.
That's basically the story, I think, behind a lot of why word order looks the way it is,
is you were always connecting. What is it? What is the thing I'm telling you?
I'm talking to you in sentences. You're talking to me in sentences.
These are sequences of words which are connected. And the connections are dependencies between the
words. And it turns out that what we're trying to do in a language is actually minimize
those dependency lengths. It's easier for me to say things if the words that are connecting for
their meaning are close together. It's easier for you in understanding if that's also true.
If they're far away, it's hard to produce that and it's hard for you to understand.
And the languages of the world within a language and across languages fit that generalization,
so it turns out that having verbs initial and then having prepositions ends up making dependencies
shorter. And having verbs final and having postpositions ends up making dependencies shorter.
Then if you cross them, if you cross them, it ends up, you just end up, it's possible.
You can do it. You mean within a language?
Within a language, you can do it. It just ends up with longer dependencies than if you didn't.
So languages tend to go that way. They tend to, they say they call it harmonic.
So it was observed a long time ago without the explanation by a guy called Joseph Greenberg,
who's a famous typologist from Stanford. He observed a lot of generalizations about how
word order works. And these are some of the harmonic generalizations that he observed.
Harmonic generalizations about word order. There's so many things I want to ask you.
Okay, let me just, sometimes basics. You mentioned dependencies a few times.
What do you mean by dependencies?
Well, what I mean is, in language, there's kind of three structures to,
three components to the structure of language. One is the sounds. So cat is k, at, and te in
English. I'm not talking about that part. I'm talking, and then there's two meaning parts,
and those are the words. And you were talking about meaning earlier. So words have a form,
and they have a meaning associated with them. And so cat is a full form in English,
and it has a meaning associated with whatever a cat is. And then the combinations of words,
that's what I'll call grammar or syntax. And that's like, when I have a combination like the cat,
or two cats, okay? So where I take two different words there and put them together, and I get a
compositional meaning from putting those two different words together. And so that's the syntax.
And in any sentence or utterance, whatever I'm talking to you, you're talking to me,
we have a bunch of words, and we're putting together in a sequence. It turns out they are
connected so that every word is connected to just one other word in that sentence. And so you end
up with what's called technically a tree. It's a tree structure. So there's a root of that
utterance of that sentence. And then there's a bunch of dependence, like branches from that root
that go down to the words. The words are the leaves in this metaphor for a tree.
So a tree is also sort of a mathematical construct. Yeah, yeah, it's a graph theoretical thing.
Graph theory thing. So in this fascinating that you can break down a sentence into a tree,
and then when every word is hanging on to another, it's depending on it.
That's right. And everyone agrees on that. So all linguists will agree with that. No one.
That is not controversial. There's nobody sitting here. I do nothing mad at you.
I don't think so. Okay. There's no linguists sitting there mad at this.
No, I think in every language, I think everyone agrees that all sentences are trees at some level.
Can I pause on that? Sure. Because it's to me, just as a layman, it's surprising
that you can break down sentences in many, mostly all languages into a tree.
I think so. I've never heard of anyone disagreeing with that.
That's weird. The details of the trees are what people disagree with.
Well, okay. So what's the root of a tree? How do you construct?
How hard is it? What is the process of constructing a tree from a sentence?
Well, this is where, depending on what your theoretical notions, I'm going to say this
simplest thing, dependency grammar. It's like a bunch of people invented this.
Tenier was the first French guy back in, I mean, the paper was published in 1959,
but he was working on the 30s and stuff. And it goes back to, you know,
philologist Penini was doing this in ancient India. Okay. And so, you know,
doing something like this, the simplest thing we can think of is that there's just connections
between the words to make the utterance. And so let's just say I have like two dogs entered a room.
Okay. Here's a sentence. And so we're connecting two and dogs together. That's like,
there's some dependency between those words to make some bigger meaning.
And then we're connecting dogs now to entered, right? And we connect a room somehow to entered.
And so I'm going to connect to room and then room back to entered. That's the tree is I,
the root is entered. That's the thing is like an entering event. That's what we're saying here.
And the subject, which is whatever that dog is, is two dogs, it was, and the connection goes back
to dogs, which goes back to them, then that goes back to two. I'm just, that's my tree.
It starts at entered, goes to dogs down to two. And then the other side, after the verb,
the object, it goes to room. And then that goes back to the determiner or article,
whatever you want to call that word. So there's a bunch of categories of words here we're
noticing. So there are verbs. Those are these things that typically mark
they refer to events and states in the world. And they're nouns, which typically refer to
people, places and things is what people say, but they can refer to other more,
they think you've heard of events themselves as well. They're marked by,
you know, how they, how they, the category, the part of speech of a word is how it gets used
in language. It's like, that's how you decide what the, what the category of a word is not,
not by the meaning, but how it's, how it gets used.
What's usually the root? Is it going to be the verb that defines the event?
Usually. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah. I mean, if I don't say a verb,
then there won't be a verb. And so it'll be something else.
What if you're messing, are we talking about language that's like correct language? What
if you're doing poetry and messing with stuff? Is it then, then rules go out the window, right?
Then it's, no, you're still, you're constrained by whatever language you're dealing with.
Probably you have other constraints in poetry, such that you're like, usually in poetry,
there's multiple constraints that you want to, like you want to usually convey multiple
meanings is the idea. And maybe you have like a rhythm or a rhyming structure as well.
And depending on, so, but you usually are constrained by your, the rules of your language
for the most part. And so you don't violate those too much. You can violate them somewhat,
but not too much. So it has to be recognizable as your language. Like in English, I can't say
dogs to entered room. I mean, I meant that, you know, two dogs entered a room and I can't
mess with the order of the, the articles and the nouns. You just can't do that. In some languages,
you can, you can mess around with the order of words much more. I mean, you speak Russian.
Russian has a much freer word order than English. And so in fact, you can move around words in,
you know, I told you that English has the subject verb object word order. So does Russian,
but Russian is much freer than English. And so you can actually mess around with the word order.
So probably Russian poetry is going to be quite different from English poetry because the word
order is much less constrained. Yeah, there's a much more extensive culture of poetry throughout
the history of the last hundred years in Russia. And I always wondered why that is, but it seems
that there's more flexibility in the way the language is used. There's more, you're more
female language easier by altering the words, altering the order of the words, messing with it.
Well, you can just mess with different things in each language. And so in Russian, you have
case markers, right? On the end, which are these endings on the nouns, which tell you how it connects
each noun connects to the verb, right? We don't have that in English. And so when I say, Mary
kissed John, I don't know who the agent or the patient is, except by the order of the words,
right? In, in Russian, you actually have a marker on the end. If you're using a Russian name and
each of those names, you'll also say, is it, you know, agent, it'll be the, you know, nominative,
which is marking the subject or an accusative will mark the object. And you could put them in the
reverse order. You could put accusative first, as you could put subject, you could put the patient
first, and then the verb, and then the, the, the subject, and that would be a perfectly good Russian
sentence. And it would still mean, Mary, I could say John kissed Mary, meaning Mary kissed John,
as long as I use the case markers in the right way. You can't do that in English. And so,
I love the terminology of agent and patient and, and the other ones you used,
those are sort of linguistic terms, correct? Those are, those are for like, kind of meaning,
those are meaning and subject and object are generally used for position. So subject is just
like the thing that comes before the verb and the object is when it comes after the verb. The agent
is kind of like the thing doing it. That's kind of what that means, right? The subject is often the
person doing the action, right? The thing. So yeah. Okay. This is fascinating. So how hard is it to
form a tree in general? Is there, is there a procedure to it? Like if you look at different
languages, is it supposed to be a very natural, like is it automatable or is there some human
genius involved in? I think it's pretty automatable at this point. People can figure out the words
are they can figure out the morphemes, which are the technically morphemes are the, the minimal
meaning units within a language. Okay. And so when you say eats or drinks, it actually has two
morphemes in an English. There's, there's the, there's the root, which is the verb. And then
there's some ending on it, which tells you, you know, that's the third person, third person singular.
Can you say what morphemes are? Morphemes are just the minimal meaning units within a language.
And then a word is just kind of the things we put spaces between in English and 10,
they have a little bit more, they have the morphology as well. They have the endings,
this inflectional morphology on the endings on the roots.
They modify something about the word that adds additional meaning.
They tell you, yeah, yeah. And so we have a little bit of that in English, very little,
much more in Russian, for instance. And, and, but we have a little bit in English.
And so we have a little on the, on the nouns, you can say it's either singular or plural.
And, and you can say, same thing for, for, for verbs, like simple past tense, for example,
it's like, you know, notice in English, we say drinks, you know, he drinks, but everyone else
says, I drink, you drink, we drink, it's unmarked in a way. And then, but in the past tense, it's
just drank there for everyone. There's no morphology at all for past tense. It's,
there is morphology, it's marking past tense, but it's kind of an, it's an irregular now.
So we don't even, you know, drink to drink, you know, it's not even a regular word. So in most
verbs, many verbs, there's an ED, we kind of add, so walk to walked, we add that to say it's the
past tense that I just happened to choose an irregular because the high frequency word and the
high frequency words tend to have irregular as an English for.
What's an irregular? Irregular is just, there's, there isn't a rule.
So drink to drink is an, it's an irregular.
Drink, drink, okay, as opposed to walk, walked, talked,
and there's a lot of irregular, irregular in English.
There's a lot of irregular in English. The, the frequent ones, the common words tend to be
irregular. There's many, many more low frequency words and those tend to be, those are regular ones.
The evolution of the irregular is fascinating. It's essentially slang that's sticky because
you're breaking the rules and then everybody use it and doesn't follow the rules and they,
they say screw it to the rules. It's fascinating. So you said it, more themes, lots of questions.
So morphology is what? The study of morphemes?
Morphology is the, is the connections between the morphemes onto the roots, the roots.
So in English, we mostly have suffixes. We have endings on the words, not very much,
but a little bit. And as opposed to prefixes, some words, depending on your language, can have,
you know, mostly prefixes, mostly suffixes or mostly, or both. And then even languages,
several languages have things called infixes where you have some kind of a general
form for the, for the root and you put stuff in the middle and you change the vowels.
That's fascinating. That's fascinating. So in general, there's what, two morphemes per word,
usually one or two or three? Well, in English, it's one or two. In English,
it tends to be one or two. There can be more. You know, in other languages, you know, a language
like, like Finnish, which has a very elaborate morphology, there may be 10 morphemes on the
end of a root. Okay. And so there may be millions, there'll be millions of forms of a given word.
Okay. Okay. I'll ask the same question over and over. But
how does the, just sometimes to understand things like morphemes, it's nice to just ask the question,
how does these kinds of things evolve? So you have a great book studying sort of the,
how the cognitive processing, how language used for communication,
so the mathematical notion of how effective language is for communication and what role
that plays in the evolution of language. But just high level, like how do we, how does a
language evolve with where English has two morphemes or one or two morphemes per word
and then Finnish has infinity per word? So what, how does that, how does that happen? Is it just
people? That's a really good question. Yeah. That's a very good question is like,
why do languages have more morphology versus less morphology? And I don't think we know the
answer to this. I think there's just like a lot of good solutions to the problem of communication.
And so like, I believe, as you hinted that language is an invented system by humans for
communicating their ideas. And I think we, it comes down to we label the things we want to talk about.
Those are the morphemes and words. Those are the things we want to talk about in the world and
we invent those things. And then we put them together in ways that are easy for us to convey,
to process. But that's like a naive view. And I don't, I mean, I think it's probably right,
right? It's naive and probably right. I don't know if it's naive. I think it's simple.
Simple. Yeah. I think naive is, naive is an indication that's an incorrect somehow,
it's a trivial to too simple. I think it could very well be correct. But it's interesting how
sticky it feels like two people got together. It just feels like once you figure out certain
aspects of a language that just becomes sticky and the tribe forms around that language,
maybe the language, maybe the tribe forms first, then the language evolves. And then you just kind
of agree and then you stick to whatever that is. I mean, these are very interesting questions. We
don't know really about how words, even words get invented very much about, you know, we don't
really, I mean, assuming they get invented, they, we don't really know how that process works and
how these things evolve. What we have is kind of a current picture, a current picture of
a few thousand languages, a few thousand instances. We don't have any pictures of really how these
things are evolving, really. And then the evolution is massively, you know, confused by
contact, right? So as soon as one language group, one group runs into another, we are smart, humans
are smart, and they take on whatever is useful in the other group. And so any kind of contrast,
which you're talking about, which I find useful, I'm going to start using as well. So I worked a
little bit in specific areas of words, in number words and in color words. And in color words,
so we have in English, we have around 11 words that everyone knows for colors. And many more,
if you happen to be interested in color for some reason or other, if you're a fashion designer or
an artist or something, you may have many, many more words. But we can see millions, like if you
have normal color vision, normal trichrometric color vision, you can see millions of distinctions
in colors. So we don't have millions of words. You know, the most efficient, no, the most, you
know, detailed color vocabulary would have over a million terms to distinguish all the different
colors that we can see. But of course, we don't have that. So it's somehow, it's been, it's kind
of useful for English to have evolved in some way to, there's 11 terms that people find useful
to talk about, you know, black, white, red, blue, green, yellow, purple,
gray, pink, and I probably missed something there. Anyway, there's 11 that everyone knows.
And depending on your, but you go to different cultures, especially the non industrialized
cultures, and there'll be many fewer. So some cultures will have only two, believe it or not,
that the Danai in Papua New Guinea have only two labels that the group uses for color. And those
are roughly black and white. They are very, very dark and very, very light, which are
roughly black and white. And you might think, oh, they're dividing the whole color space into,
you know, light and dark or something. And that's not really true. They mostly just
only label the light, the black and the white things. They just don't talk about the colors
for the other ones. And so, and then there's other groups, I've worked with a group called
the Chimani down in, in Bolivia in South America. And they have three words that everyone knows,
but there's a few others that are, that, that several people like, that many people know.
And so they have made, it's kind of depending on how you count between three and seven words
that the group knows. Okay. And again, they're, they're black and white. Everyone knows those.
And red, red is, you know, like that tends to be the third word that everyone, that cultures bring
in. If there's a word, it's always red, the third one. And then after that, it's kind of all bets
are off about what they bring in. And so after that, they, they bring in a sort of a big blue,
green space group, group, they have one for that. And then they have, and then,
you know, different people have different words that they'll use for other parts of the space.
And so anyway, it's probably related to what they want to talk, what they, not what they,
not what they see, because they see the same colors as we see. So it's not like they have,
they don't, they have a, a weak, a low color palette and the things they're looking at.
They're looking at a lot of beautiful scenery. Okay. A lot of different colored
flowers and berries and things. And, you know, and so there's lots of things of very bright colors,
but they just don't label the color in those cases. And the reason probably we don't know this,
but we think probably what's going on here is that what you do, why you label something
is you need to talk to someone else about it. And why do I need to talk about a color?
Well, if I have two things which are identical and I want you to give me the one that's different,
and in the only way it varies is color, then I invent a word which tells you, you know,
this is the one I want. So I want the red sweater off the rack, not the, not the green sweater,
right? There's two. And, and so those, those things will be identical, because these are
things we made and they're dyed and there's nothing different about them. And so in,
in industrialized society, we have, you know, everything, everything we've got is pretty much
arbitrarily colored. But if you go to a non-industrialized group, that's not true. And so they
don't, suddenly they're not interested in color. If you bring bright colored things to them, they
like them just like we like them. Bright colors are great. They're beautiful. They are, but they
just don't need to, no need to talk about them. They don't have. So probably color words is a
good example of how language evolves from sort of function when you need to communicate the use
of something. I think so. Then you kind of invent different variations. And, and basically, you
couldn't imagine that the evolution of a language has to do with what the early tribes doing,
like what, what they want, what, what kind of problems are facing them. And they're quickly
figuring out how to efficiently communicate the solution to those problems, whether it's aesthetic
or function, all that kind of stuff, running away from a mammoth or whatever. But you know,
it's, so I think what you're pointing to is that we don't have data on the evolution of language
because many languages have formed a long time ago. So you don't get the chatter.
We have a little bit of like old English to modern English because there was a writing system.
And we can see how, how old English looked. So the word order changed, for instance, in old
English to middle English to modern English. And so it, you know, we could see things like that.
But most languages don't even have a writing system. So of the 7000, only, you know, a small
subset of those have a writing system. And even if they have a writing system, they,
it's not a very modern writing system. And so they don't have it. So we just basically have,
for Mandarin, for Chinese, we have a lot of, a lot of evidence from, from, for long time and
for English and not for much else, not from in German a little bit, but not for a whole lot of
like long term language evolution. We don't have a lot. We just have snapshots is what we've got
of current languages. Yeah. You get an inkling of that from the rapid communication on certain
platforms, like on Reddit, there's different communities, and they'll come up with different
slang, usually from my perspective, German by a little bit of humor, or maybe mockery or whatever.
You know, just talking shit in different kinds of ways. And you could see the evolution
of language there. Because I think a lot of things on the internet, you don't want to be
the boring mainstream. So you like want to deviate from the proper way of talking.
And so you get a lot of deviation, like rapid deviation. Then when communities collide,
you get like, just like you said, humans adapt to it. And you can see it through the
lungs of humor. I mean, it's very difficult to study, but you can imagine like a hundred years
from now, well, if there's a new language born, for example, we'll get really high resolution
data. I mean, English is changing. English changes all the time. All languages change all the time.
So, you know, as a famous result about the Queen's English. So if you look at the Queen's vowels,
the Queen's English is supposed to be, you know, originally the proper way for the talk was sort
of defined by whoever the Queen talked or the King, whoever was in charge. And so if you look at
how her vowels changed from when she first became Queen in 1952 or 1953, when she was
currently the first, I mean, that's Queen Elizabeth, who died recently, of course, until,
you know, 50 years later, her vowels changed, her vowels shifted a lot. And so that, you know, even
in the sounds of British English, in her, the way she was talking was changing. The vowels were
changing slightly. So that's just in the sounds, there's change. I don't know what's, you know,
I'm interested. We're all interested in what's driving any of these changes. The
word order of English changed a lot over a thousand years, right? So it used to look like
German. You know, it used to be a verb-final language with case marking, and it shifted
to a verb-medial language, a lot of contact. So a lot of contact with French. And it became a
verb-medial language with no case marking. And so it became this, you know, verb-initially thing.
And so that's, it totally evolved. And so it may very well, I mean, you know, it doesn't evolve
maybe very much in 20 years is maybe what you're talking about. But over 50 and 100 years, things
change a lot, I think. We'll now have good data, which is great. That's for sure. Can you talk to
what is syntax and what is grammar? So you wrote a book on syntax. I did. You were asking me before
about what, you know, how do I figure out what a dependency structure is? I'd say the dependency
structures aren't that hard generally. I think it's a lot of agreement of what they, of what they are
for almost any sentence in most languages. I think people will agree on a lot of that.
There are other parameters in the mix such that some people think there's a more complicated
grammar than just a dependency structure. And so, you know, like Noam Chomsky,
he's the most famous linguist ever. And he, he is famous for proposing a slightly more complicated
syntax. And so he, he invented phrase structure grammar. So he's well known for many, many things.
But in the 50s, in the early 60s, like the late 50s, he was basically figuring out what's called
formal language theory. So, and he figured out sort of a framework for figuring out how complicated
language, you know, a certain type of language might be so-called phrase structured grammars of
language might be. And so he, his, his idea was that maybe we can, we can think about the complexity
of a language by how complicated the rules are. Okay. And the rules will look like this. They
will have a left-hand side and it'll have a right-hand side. Something on the left-hand side
will expand to the thing on the right-hand side. So we'll say we'll start with an S, which is like
the root, which is a sentence. Okay. And then we're going to expand to things like a noun phrase and
a verb phrase is what he would say, for instance. Okay. An S goes to an NP and a VP is a kind of a
phrase structure rule. And then we figure out what an NP is. An NP is a, a, a determiner and a noun,
for instance. And verb, verb phrase is something else is a verb and another noun phrase and another
NP, for instance, those are the rules of a very simple phrase structure. Okay. And, and so he,
he proposed phrase structure grammar as a way to sort of cover human languages. And then he
actually figured out that, well, depending on the formalization of those grammars, you might get
more complicated or less complicated languages. And so you could, he could, he said, well, you,
these are, these are things called, you know, context-free languages, that rule that he thought,
you know, human languages tend to be what he calls context-free languages. And, but there are
simpler languages, which are so-called regular languages, and they have a more, a more constrained
form to the rules of the, of the phrase structure of these particular rules. So he, he basically
discovered and kind of invented ways to describe the language. And those are phrase, those are
phrase structure, a human language. And he was mostly interested in English initially in his,
his work in the fifties. So quick questions around all this. So formal language theories,
the big field of just studying language formally. Yes. And it doesn't have to be human language
there. We can have a computer languages, any kind of system, which is generating a,
a, some set of expressions in a language. And those could be like the, the,
you know, the statements in a, in a computer language, for example. So formal, it could be
that or it could be human language. So technically you can study programming languages.
And have been, I mean, heavily studied using this formalism. There, there's a big field of
programming languages within the formal language. Okay. And then phrase structure grammar is this
idea that you can break down language into this SNP, VP, like type of thing.
It's a particular formalism for describing language. Okay. So and, and Choms, he was the
first one, he's the one who figured that stuff out back in the fifties. And, and, and, but he,
and, and that's equivalent actually there, this, the context free grammar is actually
is kind of equivalent in the sense that it generates the same sentences as a dependency
grammar would as the dependency grammar is a little simpler in some way. You just have a root
and it goes, like, we don't have any of these, the rules are implicit, I guess,
in the, and we just have connections between words. The free structure grammars are kind
of a different way to think about the, the dependency grammar. It's slightly more complicated,
but it's kind of the same in some ways. So to clarify, dependency grammar is the framework
under which you see language. And you make a case that this is a good way to describe language.
That's correct. And no, no, Chomsky is watching this is very upset right now. So it's
just kidding. But what's the difference between where's the place of disagreement
between free structure grammar and dependency grammar?
They're very close. So free structure grammar and dependency grammar aren't that, aren't that far
apart. I like dependency grammar, because it's more perspicuous, it's more transparent about
representing the connections between the words. It's just a little harder to see in
free structure grammar. You know, the place where Chomsky sort of devolved or went off from,
from, from this is he also thought there was something called movement. Okay. And so, and
that's where we disagree. Okay, that's the place where I would say we disagree. And, and, and,
and I mean, well, maybe we'll get into that later. But the idea is, if you want to, do you want me
to explain that? No, I would love to explain movement. Okay, so you're saying so many interesting
things. Okay, so here's the movement is Chomsky basically sees English. And he says, okay, I
said, you know, we had that sentence early, like it was like two dogs entered the room,
it's changed a little bit, say, two dogs will enter the room. And he notices that, hey, English,
if I want to make a question, a yes, no question from that same sentence, I say, instead of two
dogs will enter the room, I say, will two dogs enter the room? Okay, there's a different way to
say the same idea. And it's like, well, the auxiliary verb that will thing,
it's at the front as opposed to in the middle. Okay. And so, and he looked, you know, if you
look at English, you see that that's true for all those modal verbs. And for other kinds of
auxiliary verbs in English, you always do that, you always put an auxiliary verb at the front.
And, and what he's, when he saw that, so, you know, if I say, I can win this bet, can I win this
bet, right? So I move a can to the front. So actually, that's a theory, I just gave you a
theory there. He talks about it as movement. That word in the declarative is the root,
is the sort of default way to think about the sentence, and you move the auxiliary verb to
the front. That's a movement theory. Okay. And he just thought that was just so obvious that it
must be true, that there's nothing more to say about that, that this is how auxiliary verbs
work in English. There's a movement rule such that you're moved, like to get from the declarative
to the interrogative, you're moving the auxiliary to the front. And it's a little more complicated
as soon as you go to simple, simple present and simple past, because, you know, if I say, you
know, John slept, you have to say, did John sleep, not slept John, right? And so you have to somehow
get an auxiliary verb, and I guess, underlyingly, it's like slept is, it's a little more complicated
than that. But his, that's his idea, there's a movement. Okay. And so a different way to think
about that, that isn't, I mean, the, then he ended up showing later. So he proposed this theory
of grammar, which has movement, and there's other places where he thought there's movement,
not just auxiliary verbs, but things like the passive in English and things like
questions, WH questions, a bunch of places where he thought there's also movement going on. And,
and, and each, each one of those, these things, there's words, well, phrases and words are moving
around from one structure to another, which he called deep structure to surface structure. I
mean, there's like two different structures in his, in his theory. Okay. There's a different
way to think about this, which is there's no movement at all. There's a lexical copying rule
such that the word will or the word can, these auxiliary verbs, they just have two forms. And,
and one of them is the declarative and one of them is interrogative. And you basically have
the declarative one and oh, I form the interrogative or I can form one from the other, doesn't matter
which direction you go. And, and I just have a new entry, which has the same meaning, which has
a slightly different argument structure, argument structure. It's a fancy word for the ordering
of the words. And so if I say, you know, it was the dogs, two dogs can or will enter the room.
There's two forms of will. One is will declarative. And then, okay, I've got my subject to the left.
It comes before me. And the verb comes after me in that one. And then the will interrogative is
like, Oh, I go first. Interrogative will is first. And then I have the subject immediately
after and then the verb after that. And so you just, you can just generate from one of those words
another word with a slightly different argument structure with different ordering.
And these are just lexical copies. They're just they're not necessarily moving for one.
There's no movement. There's a romantic notion that you have like one main way to use a word.
And then you could move it around, which is essentially what movement is implying.
But that's the lexical copying is similar. So then we do lexical copying for that same idea
that maybe the declarative is the source and then we can copy it. And so an advantage for,
there's multiple advantages of the lexical copying story. It's not my story. This is like
Ivan Sog, linguists, a bunch of linguists have been proposing these stories as well,
you know, in tandem with the movement story. Okay, you know, he's Ivan Sog died a while ago,
but he was one of the proponents of the non movement of the lexical copying story.
And so that is that a great advantage is, well, Chomsky, really famously in 1971,
showed that the movement story leads to learnability problems. It leads to problems for
how language is learned. It's really, really hard to figure out what the underlying structure of
languages, if you have both phrase structure and movement, it's like really hard to figure out
what came from what. There's like a lot of possibilities there. If you don't have that
problem, learning, the learning problem gets a lot easier. Just say there's lexical copies.
Yeah, yeah. Well, we say the learning problem, do you mean like humans learning a new language?
Yeah, just learning English. So baby is lying around listening to the crib, listening to me
talk. And you know, how are they learning English? Or, you know, maybe it's a two year old who's
learning, you know, interrogatives and stuff or one, you know, they're, you know, how are they
doing that? Are they doing it from like, are they figuring out or like, you know, so Chomsky said,
it's impossible to figure it out. Actually, he said it's actually impossible, not, not hard,
but impossible. And therefore, that's what that's where universal grammar comes from,
is that it has to be built in. And so what they're learning is that there's some built in movement
is built in in his story is absolutely part of your language module. And, and then you are,
you're just setting parameters, you're said, depending on English is just sort of a variant
of the universal grammar, and you're figuring out, oh, which orders do those English do these things?
That's the, the non movement story doesn't have this, it's like much more bottom up. You're
learning rules, you're learning rules one by one. And oh, there's this, this word is connected to
that word. A great advantage, another advantage is learnable. Another advantage of it is that it
predicts that not all axiliaries might move, like it, it might depend on the word, depending on
whether you and that turns out to be true. So there's words that, that don't really work as
auxiliary, they work in declarative and not in an interrogative. So I can say, I'll give you the
opposite first, if I can say, aren't I invited to the party? Okay. And that's an, that's an
interrogative form, but it's not from, I aren't invited to the party. There is no, I aren't,
right? So that's, that's interrogative only. And, and then we also have forms like, ought, I ought
to do this. And, and I guess some British old British people can say, exactly, it doesn't
sound right, does it? For me, it sounds ridiculous. I don't even think ought is great. But I mean,
I totally recognize I ought to do, it is not too bad, actually, I can say ought to do this.
If I'm trying to sound sophisticated, maybe. I don't know, it just sounds completely out to me.
Anyway, it's, so there are variants here. And a lot of these words just work in one
versus the other. And that's like, fine, under the lexical copying story, it's like, well,
you just learn the usage, whatever the usage is, is what you, is what you do with this,
with this word. But it doesn't, it's a little bit harder in the movement story, the movement story,
like that's an advantage, I think, of lexical copying. And in all these different places,
there's, there's all these usage variants, which make the movement story a little bit
harder to work.
So one of the main divisions here is the movement story versus the lexical copy story
that has to do about the auxiliary words and so on. But if you rewind to the phrase structured
grammar versus dependency grammar.
Those are equivalent in some sense in that for any dependency grammar, I can generate a
dependency, a phrase structure grammar, which generates exactly the same sentences. I just,
I just like the dependency grammar formalism because it makes something really salient,
which is the dependent, the lengths of dependencies between words, which isn't so obvious in the,
in the phrase structure. In the phrase structure, it's just kind of hard to see. It's in there.
It's just very, very, it's opaque.
Technically, I think phrase structure grammar is mappable to dependency grammar.
And vice versa.
And vice versa.
But there's like these like little labels S and PVP.
Yeah. For a particular dependency grammar, you can make a phrase structure grammar,
which generates exactly those same sentences and vice versa. But there are many phrase
structure grammars, which you can't really make a dependency grammar. I mean,
you can do a lot more in a phrase structure grammar, but you get many more of these extra
nodes basically. You can have more structure in there. And some people like that. And maybe
there's value to that. I don't like it.
Well, for you, so we should clarify. So dependency grammar, it's just one word depends on only one
other word and you form these trees. And that makes, it really puts priority on those dependencies,
just like as a, as a tree that you can then measure the distance of the dependency from one
word to the other, they can then map to the cognitive processing of the, of the sentences,
how well, how easy it is to understand and all that kind of stuff. So it just puts the focus on
just like the mathematical distance of dependence between words. So like, it's just a different
focus. Absolutely. Just continue on the thread of Chomsky, because it's really interesting,
because it, as you're discussing disagreement, to the degree there's disagreement, you're also
telling the history of the study of language, which is really awesome. So you mentioned context
free versus regular. Does that distinction come into play for dependency grammars?
No, not at all. I mean, regular, regular languages are too simple for human languages.
They are, they, it's a part of the hierarchy, but human languages are in, in the phrase structure
world are definitely, they're at least context free, maybe a little bit more, a little bit
harder than that. But so there's something called context sensitive as well, where you can have,
like this is just the formal language description. In a context free grammar, you have one, this is
like a bunch of like formal language theory we're doing here. I love it. Okay. So you have,
you have a left hand side category, and you're expanding to anything on the right is, is a,
that's a context free. So like the idea is that that category on the left expands
in independent of context to those things, whatever they're on the right, doesn't matter what.
And a context sensitive says, okay, I actually have more than one thing on the left. I can tell you
only in this context, you know, I have maybe you have like a left and a right context or just a
left context or a right context, I have two or more stuff on the left tells you how to expand
that those things in that way. Okay. So it's context sensitive. A regular language is just
more constrained. And so it, it doesn't allow anything on the right. It allows very, it allows,
basically, it's a one very complicated rule is kind of what a regular language is. And so it
doesn't have any, let's just say long distance dependencies, it doesn't allow recursion, for
instance, there's no recursion. Yeah, recursion is where you, which is human languages have
recursion, they have embedding. And you can't, well, it doesn't allow center embedded recursion,
which human languages have, which is what center embedded recursion within a sentence,
within a sentence. Yeah, within a sentence. So here we're going to get to that. But I, you know,
the formal language stuff is a little aside, Chomsky wasn't proposing it for human languages,
even he was just pointing out that human languages are context free. And then he was most in for,
for human, because that was kind of stuff we did for formal languages. And what he was most
interested in was human language. And that's like the, the movement is where we, we, we,
where, where he sort of set off in on the, I would say, a very interesting, but wrong foot,
it was kind of interesting. It's a very, I agree, it's kind of a very interesting history. So there's
a set, he proposed this multiple theories in 57, and then 65, they're, they all have this framework,
though, was phrase structure plus movement, different versions of the, of the phrase structure
and the movement in the 57, these are the most famous original bits of Chomsky's work.
And then 71 is when he figured out that those lead to learning problems, that, that
there's cases where a kid could never figure out which rule, which set of rules was intended.
And, and so, and then he said, well, that means it's innate. It's kind of interesting. He just
really thought the movement was just so obviously true that he couldn't, he didn't even entertain
giving it up. It's just obvious that that's obviously right. And it was later where people
figured out that there's all these like subtle ways in which things would, which look like
generalizations aren't generalizations. And they, you know, across the category, they're,
they're word specific and they have, and they, they kind of work, but they don't work across
various other words in the category. And so it's easier to just think of these things as
lexical copies. And I think he was very obsessed. I don't know. I'm guessing that he just, he really
wanted this story to be simple in some sense. And language is a little more complicated.
In some sense, you know, he didn't like words. He never talks about words. He likes to talk
about combinations of words and words are, you know, look up a dictionary, there's 50
senses for a common word, right? The word take will have 30 or 40 senses in it. So there'll be
many different senses for common words. And he just doesn't think about that. It's, or he doesn't
think that's language. I think he doesn't think that's language. He thinks that words are distinct
from combinations of words. I think they're the same. If you look at my brain on in the scanner,
while I'm listening to a language I understand, and you compare, I can localize my language
network in a few minutes in like 15 minutes. And what you do is I listen to a language I know,
I listen to, you know, maybe some language I don't know, or I listened to muffled speech,
or I read sentences, or I read non words, like I do anything like this, anything that's sort
of really like English and anything that's not very like English. So I've got something like it
and not, and I got a control. And the voxels, which is just, you know, the 3D pixels in my
brain that are responding most is a language area. And that's this left lateralized area in my head.
And wherever I look in that network, if you look for the combinations versus the words,
it's everywhere. It's the same. That's fascinating.
And so it's like hard to find, there are no areas that we know. I mean, that's,
it's a little overstated right now. At this point, the technology isn't great. It's not bad. But we
have the best way to figure out what's going on in my brain when I'm listening or reading language
is to use fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging. And that's a very good localization
method. So I can figure out where exactly these signals are coming from. Pretty,
down to millimeters, cubic millimeters are smaller, very small. We can figure those out
very well. The problem is the when. It's measuring oxygen. And oxygen takes a little while to get
to those cells. It's what takes on the order of seconds. So I talk fast. I probably listened
fast and I can probably understand things really fast. So a lot of stuff happens in two seconds.
And so to say that we know what's going on, that the words right now in that network,
our best guess is that whole network is doing something similar, but maybe different parts
of that network are doing different things. And that's probably the case. We just don't
have very good methods to figure that out right at this moment. And so since we're kind of talking
about the history of the study of language, what other interesting disagreements, and you're both
at MIT or war for a long time, what kind of interesting disagreements, their attention of
ideas are there between you and Noam Chalsky. And we should say that Noam was in the linguistics
department and you're, I guess, for a time were affiliated there, but primarily brain and cognitive
science department. It's just another way of studying language. And you've been talking about
fMRI. So like, what is there's something else interesting to bring to the surface about the
disagreement between the two of you or other people in the... Yeah, I mean, I've been at MIT for
31 years since 1993, and Chalsky's been there much longer. So I met him, I knew him. I met
when I first got there, I guess, and we would interact every now and then. I'd say that,
so I'd say our biggest difference is our methods. And so that's the biggest difference between me
and Noam is that I gather data from people. I do experiments with people and I gather corpus data.
Whatever corpus data is available, and we do quantitative methods to evaluate
any kind of hypothesis we have, he just doesn't do that. So he has never once been
associated with any experiment or corpus work ever. And so it's all thought experiments. It's
his own intuitions. So I just don't think that's the way to do things. That's a cross the street.
They're across the street from us, kind of difference between brain and cog sci and
linguistics. I mean, not all linguists, some of the linguists, depending on what you do,
more speech oriented, they do more quantitative stuff. But in the meaning, words and well,
it's combinations of words and text semantics, they tend not to do experiments and corpus analyses.
So in linguistics size, probably, well, but the method is a symptom of a bigger approach,
which is sort of a psychology philosophy side on Noam. And for you, it's more sort of data driven,
sort of almost like mathematical approach. Yeah, I mean, I'm psychologist. So I would
say we're in psychology, you know, I'm in brain cognitive sciences is MIT's old psychology department.
It was a psychology department up until 1985, and that became the brain and cognitive science
department. And so I mean, my training is math and computer science, but I'm a psychologist.
I mean, I mean, I don't know what I am. So data driven psychologist. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You are. I am what I am, but I'm happy to be called a linguist. I'm happy to be called a
computer scientist. I'm happy to be called a psychologist, any of those things.
But in the actual, like how that manifests itself outside of the methodology is like these
differences, these subtle differences about the movement story versus the lexical copy story.
Those are theories, right? So the theories are, but I think the reason we differ in part is because
of how we evaluate the theories. And so I evaluate theories quantitatively and Noam doesn't.
Got it. Okay, well, let's explore the theories that you explore in your book.
Let's return to this dependency grammar framework of looking at language. What's a good justification
why the dependency grammar framework is a good way to explain language? What's your intuition?
So the reason I like dependency grammar, as I've said before, is that it's very transparent about
its representation of distance between words. So it's like it all it is, is you've got a bunch
of words, you're connecting them together to make a sentence and a really neat insight,
which turns out to be true, is that the further apart the pair of words are that you're connecting
the harder it is to do the production, the harder it is to do the comprehension. It says
harder to produce, it's hard to understand when the words are far apart. When they're close together,
it's easy to produce and it's easy to comprehend. Let me give you an example. Okay, so we have,
in any language, we have mostly local connections between words, but they're abstract. The
connections are abstract, they're between categories of words. And so you can always
make things further apart. If you add modification, for example, after a noun,
so a noun in English comes before a verb, the subject noun comes before a verb,
and then there's an object after, for example. So I can say what I said before, you know,
the dog entered the room or something like that. So I can modify dog. If I say something more about
dog after it, then what I'm doing is indirectly, I'm lengthening the dependence between dog and
entered by adding more stuff to it. So I just make it explicit here. If I say
the boy who the cat scratched cried, we're going to have a mean cat here. And so what I've got
here is, the boy cried, it would be a very short, simple sentence. And I just told you something
about the boy, and I told you it was the boy who the cat scratched, okay? So the cry is connected
to the boy. The cry at the end is connected to the boy in the beginning.
Right. And so I can do that. And I can say that that's a perfectly fine English sentence.
And I can say the cat which the dog chased ran away or something. Okay, I can do that.
But it's really hard now. I've got whatever I have here. I have the boy who the cat,
now let's say I try to modify cat, okay? The boy who the cat which the dog chased
scratched ran away. Oh my God, that's hard, right? I can, I'm sort of just working that
through in my head, how to produce and how to, and it's really very just horrendous to
understand. It's not so bad. At least I've got intonation there to sort of mark the boundaries
and stuff. But it's, that's really complicated. That's sort of English in a way. I mean, that
follows the rules of English. But so what's interesting about that is, is that what I'm
doing is nesting dependencies there. I'm putting one, I've got a subject connected to a verb there
and then I'm modifying that with a clause, another clause, which happens to have a subject
and a verb relation. I'm trying to do that again on the second one. And what that does
is it lengthens out the dependence, multiple dependents actually get lengthened out there.
The dependencies get longer, longer on the outside ones get long. And even the ones in between get
kind of long. And you just, so what's fascinating is that that's bad. That's really horrendous in
English. But that's horrendous in any language. And so in no matter what language you look at,
if you do just figure out some structure where I'm going to have some modification following
some head, which is connected to some later head, and I do it again, it won't be good.
It guaranteed like 100%. That will be uninterpretable in that language in the same way that was
uninterpretable in English. Just clarify the distance of the dependencies is whenever
the boy cried, there's a dependence between two words. And then you counting the number of what
morphemes between them. That's a good question. I just say words. Your words are morphemes between.
We don't know that. Actually, that's a very good question. What is the distance metric?
But let's just say it's words. Sure. And you're saying the longer the distance of that dependence,
the more, no matter the language, except legalese. Even legalese. We'll talk about it. But that
the people will be very upset that speak that language, not upset, but they'll either not
understand it. They'll be like, this is, their brain will be working in overtime.
Yeah, they will have a hard time either producing or comprehending it. They might tell you that's
not their language. It's sort of the language. I mean, it's following like they'll agree with
each of those pieces as part of the language. But somehow that combination will be very,
very difficult to produce and understand. Is that a chicken or the egg issue here?
Well, I'm giving you an explanation. I mean, I'm giving you two kinds of explanations. I'm
telling you that center embedding, that's nesting, those are synonyms for the same concept here.
And the explanation for what, those are always hard. Center embedding and nesting are always
hard. And I give you an explanation for why they might be hard, which is long distance connections.
When you do center embedding, when you do nesting, you always have long distance
connections between the dependents. That's not necessarily the right explanation. I can go
through reasons why that's probably a good explanation. And it's not really just about
one of them. So probably it's a pair of them or something of these dependents that get long,
that drives you to be really confused in that case. And so what the behavioral consequence
there, I mean, this is kind of methods, like how do we get at this? You could try to do experiments
to get people to produce these things. They're going to have a hard time producing them. You
can try to do experiments to get them to understand them and see how well they understand them,
can they understand them. Another method you can do is give people partial materials and ask them
to complete them, those center embedded materials and they'll fail. So I've done that. I've done
all these kinds of things. So central embedding meaning like you take a normal sentence like
boy cried and inject a bunch of crap in the middle. Yes. That separates the boy and the
cried. Yes. Okay. That's central bedding and nesting is on top of that. No, nesting is the same
thing. Center embedding, those are totally equivalent terms. I'm sorry, I sometimes use one
and sometimes use two. Got it. Got it. They don't need anything different. Got it. And then
what you're saying is there's a bunch of different kinds of experiments you can do. I mean,
I like to understand anyone is like have more embedding, more central bedding, is it easier
or harder to understand, but then you have to measure the level of understanding, I guess.
Yeah. Yeah, you could. I mean, there's multiple ways to do that. I mean, there's the simplest
ways just to ask people how good is it sound, how natural is the sound. That's a very blunt,
but very good measure. It's very, very reliable. People will do the same thing. And so it's like,
I don't know what it means exactly, but it's doing something such that we're measuring something about
the confusion, the difficulty associated with those. And those like those are giving you a signal.
That's why you can say them. What about the completion of the central bed?
So if you give them a partial sentence, say I say the book which the author who, and I ask you to
now finish that off for me. I mean, either say it, but you can just say it's written in front of you
and you can just type and have as much time as you want. They will, even though that one's not
too hard, right? So if I say it's like the book is like, oh, the book which the author who I met
wrote was good. That's a very simple completion for that. If I give that completion online somewhere
to a crowdsourcing platform and ask people to complete that, they will miss off of a verb
very regularly. Like half of the time, maybe two thirds of the time, they'll say, they'll just
leave off one of those verb phrases. Even with that simple so to say, the book which the author
who, and they'll say was, you need three verbs, right? I need three verbs. Who I met wrote was
good and they'll give me two. They'll say who was famous was good or something like that.
They'll just give me two and that'll happen about 60% of the time. So 40%, maybe 30%,
they'll do it correctly, meaning they'll do a three verb phrase. I don't know what's
correct or not. This is hard. It's a hard task.
Yeah, I'm actually struggling with it in my head. Well, it's easier when you look there.
If you look, it's a little easier than listening. It's pretty tough because you have to,
because there's no trace of it. You have to remember the words that I'm saying,
which is very hard auditorily. We wouldn't do it this way. We do it written. You can look at it
and figure it out. It's easier in many dimensions in some ways, depending on the person. It's easier
to gather written data for, I mean, most sort of psycho, I work in psycho linguistics, right?
Psychology of language and stuff. And so a lot of our work is based on written
stuff because it's so easy to gather data from people doing written kinds of tasks.
Spoken tasks are just more complicated to administer and analyze because people do weird
things when they speak and it's harder to analyze what they do. But they generally
point to the same kinds of things. Okay. So the universal theory of language
by Ted Gibson is that you can form dependency. You can form trees from any sentences and
you can measure the distance in some way of those dependencies. And then you can say that
most languages have very short dependencies. All languages. All languages. All languages have
short dependencies. You can actually measure that. So an ex student of mine, this guy is at
University of California Irvine, Richard Futrell did a thing a bunch of years ago now
where he looked at all the languages we could look at, which was about 40 initially. And now I
think there's about 60 for which there are dependency structures. So they're meaning
that it's got to be like a big text, a bunch of texts, which have been parsed for their dependency
structures. And there's about 60 of those which have been parsed that way. And for all of those,
you can, what he did was take any sentence in one of those languages and you can do the
dependency structure and then start at the root. We were talking about dependency structures.
That's pretty easy now. And he's trying to figure out what a control way you might say the same
sentence is in that language. And so he's just like, all right, there's a root and it has,
let's say as a sentence is, let's go back to, you know, two dogs entered the room. So entered
is the root and entered has two dependents that's got dogs and it has room. Okay. And what he does
is like, let's scramble that order. That's three things, the root and the head and the two dependents
and into some random order, just random. And then just do that for all the dependents down the two.
So now look, do it for the whatever was two in dogs and for in room. And that's, you know,
that's not a very short sentence. When sentences get longer, and you have more dependents,
there's more scrambling that's possible. And when he found what, so that, so, so that that's one,
you can figure out one scrambling for that sentence, he did like a hundred times for every
sentence in every corp, in every one of these texts, every corpus. And then he just compared
the dependency lengths in those random scramblings to what actually happened with what the English
or the French or the German was in the original language or Chinese or what all these like 80
no 60 languages. Okay. And the dependency lengths are always shorter in the real language
compared to this kind of a control. And there's another, it's a little more rigid, his control.
So the way I described it, you could have crossed dependencies, like that by scrambling that way,
you could scramble in any way at all. Languages don't do that. They tend not to cross dependencies
very much. Like, so the dependency structure, they just, they tend to keep things
non-crossed. And there's a, you know, like, there's a technical term, they call that
projective, but it's just non-crossed is all that is projective. And so if you just constrain
the scrambling so that it only gives you projective sort of non-crossed is the same thing holds.
So it's, so the, you still, still human languages are much shorter than these, this kind of a control.
So there's like, it, what it means is that that we're in every language, we're trying to put things
close and relative to this kind of a control. Like there, it doesn't matter about the word order,
some of these are verb final, some of them is a verb, medial like English. And some are even
verb initial. There are a few languages of the world which have VSO, world order, word order,
verb, subject, object languages, haven't talked about those. It's like 10% of the,
And even, even in those languages, it's still short dependencies.
Short dependencies is rules.
Okay. So how, what, what, what are some possible explanations for that?
For why, why languages have evolved that way? So that, that's one of the,
as opposed to disagreements you might have with Chomsky. So you consider the evolution of language
in, in terms of information theory. And for you, the purpose of language is ease of communication,
right? And process.
That's right. So I mean, the, the story here is just about communication. It is just about
production, really. It's about ease of production is the story.
When you say production, can you, oh, I just mean ease of language production. It's easier for me
to say things when the, when I'm doing, whenever I'm talking to you is somehow I'm
formulating some idea in my head and I'm putting these words together. And it's easier for me to
do that, to put, to say something where the words are close, closely connected and it depends
as opposed to separated, like by putting something in between and over and over again.
It's just hard for me to keep that in my head. Like that's, that's the whole story.
Like the story, it's basically, it's like the dependency grammar sort of gives that to you.
Like just like long, long as bad, short as good. It's like easier to keep in mind because you
have to keep it in mind for probably for production, probably, you know, probably matters in
comprehension as well. Like also matters in comprehension.
Some both sides of the production.
But I would guess it's probably evolved for production. Like it's about producing.
It's about what's easier for me to say that ends up being easier for you also.
That's very hard to disentangle, this idea of who's it for? Is it for me, the speaker,
or is it for you, the listener? I mean, part of my language is for you. Like the way I talk
to you is going to be different from how I talk to different people. So I'm definitely angling
what I'm saying to who I'm saying, right? It's not like I'm just talking the same way to every
single person. And so I am sensitive to my audience. But does that work itself out in the
dependency length differences? I don't know. Maybe that's about just the words, that part,
you know, which words I select?
My initial intuition is that you optimize language for the audience.
It's just kind of like messing with my head a little bit to say that
some of the optimization might be, and maybe the primary objective of the optimization might be
the ease of production.
We have different senses, I guess. I'm very selfish. I think it's all about me. I'm just
doing what's easiest for me in all sense. I mean, but I have to, of course, choose the words
that I think you're going to know. I'm not going to choose words you don't know. In fact,
I'm going to fix that. So there it's about, but maybe for the syntax, for the combinations,
it's just about me. I don't know, though.
But the purpose of communication is to be understood, is to convince others and so on.
So the selfish thing is to be understood. It's about the listener.
It's a little circular there, too, then.
Right. I mean, the ease of production helps me be understood, then.
I don't think it's circular.
No, I think the primary objective is to be understood, is about the listener.
Because otherwise, if you're optimizing for the ease of production, then you're not going to
have any of the interesting complexity of language. You're trying to explain...
Well, let's control for what it is I want to say. I'm saying let's control for the thing,
the message. Control for the message. I want to tell you...
But that means the message needs to be understood. That's the goal.
But that's the meaning. So I'm still talking about the form.
The form.
Just the form of the meaning. How do I frame the form of the meaning is all I'm talking about.
You're talking about a harder thing, I think, is how am I trying to change the meaning.
Let's keep the meaning constant. If you keep the meaning constant,
how can I phrase whatever it is I need to say, I got to pick the right words,
and I'm going to pick the order so it's easy for me. That's what I think it's probably like.
I think I'm still tying meaning and form together in my head. But you're saying if you keep the
meaning of what you're saying constant, the optimization, yeah, it could be the primary
objective of that optimization is for production. That's interesting. I'm struggling to keep
constant the meaning. It's just so... I'm such a human, right? So for me, the form,
without having introspected on this, the form and the meaning are tied together like deeply.
Because I'm a human. Like for me, when I'm speaking, because I haven't thought about language,
like in a rigorous way about the form of language.
But look, for any event, there's an unbounded, I don't want to say infinite, but ways that I
might communicate that same event. These two dogs entered a room, I can say in many, many
different ways. I can say, hey, there's two dogs, they entered the room. Hey, the room was entered
by something. The thing that was entered was two dogs. I mean, it's kind of awkward and weird
and stuff. But those are all similar messages with different forms, different ways that might
frame. And of course, I use the same words there all the time. I could have referred to the dogs
as a Dalmatian and a Poodle or something. I could have been more specific or less specific about
what they are. And I could have said, been more abstract about the number. So I'm trying to keep
the meaning, which is this event, constant. And then how am I going to describe that to get that
to you? It kind of depends on what you need to know. And what I think you need to know.
But I'm like, let's control for all that stuff. And then it's like, I'm just like
choosing, but I'm doing something simpler than you're doing, which is just forms, just words.
To you, specifying the breed of dog and whether they're cute or not is changing the meaning.
That might be, yeah. Yeah, that would be changed. Oh, that would be changed the meaning for sure.
Right. So you're just, yeah. That's changing the meaning.
But say, even if we keep that constant, we can still talk about what's easier or hard for me,
right? The listener and the, which phrase structures I use, which combinations, which,
this is so fascinating and just like a really powerful window into human language. But I wonder
still throughout this, how vast the gap between meaning and form, I just, I just have this like,
maybe romanticized notion that they're close together, that they evolve close to like hand in
hand, that you can't just simply optimize for one without the other being in the room with us.
Like it's, well, it's kind of like an iceberg form is the tip of the iceberg. And the rest,
the, the meaning is the iceberg, but you can't like separate.
But I think that's why these large language models are so successful is because they're
they're good at form and form isn't that hard in some sense. And meaning is tough still. And
that's why they're not there. You know, they don't understand what they're doing. We're gonna
talk about that later maybe, but like we can distinguish in our forget about large language
models, like humans, where maybe you'll talk about that later too, is like the difference between
language, which is a communication system and thinking, which is meaning. So language is a
communication system for the meaning. It's not the meaning. And so that's why I mean that and
there's a lot of interesting evidence we can talk about relevant relevant to that.
Well, I mean, that's a really interesting question. What is the different, what is the
difference between language written, communicated versus thought? What to use the difference between
them? Well, you or anyone cast a think of a task, which they think is is a good thinking
task. And there's lots and lots of tasks, which should be good thinking tasks. And whatever those
tasks are, let's say it's, you know, playing chess, or that's a good thinking task, or playing some
game, or doing some complex puzzles, maybe, maybe remembering some digits, that's thinking, remembering
some a lot of different tasks, we might think maybe just listening to music is thinking, or
there's a lot of different tasks we might think of as thinking. There's a woman in my department,
Federenko, and she's done a lot of work at on this question about what's the connection between
language and thought. And so she uses, I was referring earlier to MRI, fMRI, that's her primary
method. And so she has been really fascinated by this question about whether what language is.
Okay. And so as I mentioned earlier, you can localize my language area, your language area,
in a few minutes. Okay. In like 15 minutes, I can listen to language, listen to non-language,
or backward speech, or something. And we'll find areas left lateralized network in my head,
which is especially, which is very sensitive to language, as opposed to whatever that control
was. Okay. Can't specify what you mean by language, like communicated language? Like what is language?
Just sentences. You know, I'm listening to English of any kind story, or I can read sentences,
anything at all that I understand, if I understand it, then it'll activate my language network.
So right now, my language network is going like crazy, when I'm talking, and when I'm listening
to you, because we're both, we're communicating. And that's pretty stable. Yeah, it's incredibly
stable. So I've, I happen to be married to this woman at Federico. So I've been scanned by her
over and over and over since 2007 or six or something. And so my language network is exactly
the same, you know, like a month ago, as it was back in 2007. It's amazingly stable. It's astounding.
And with it, it's, it's a really fundamentally cool thing. And so my language network is,
it's like my face. Okay. It's not changing much over time inside my head.
Can I ask a quick question? Sorry, I was a small tangent. At which point in the,
as you grow up from baby to adult, does it stabilize? We don't know. Like that's,
that's a very hard question. They're working on that right now, because of the problem,
scanning little kids, like doing the, trying to do local, trying to do the, the localization on
little children in this scanner, or you're lying in the fMRI scan, that's the best way to figure
out where something's going on inside our brains. And the scanner is loud, and you're in this tiny
little area, you're claustrophobic. And it doesn't bother me at all. I can go to sleep in there.
But some people are bothered by it, and little kids don't really like it, and they don't like to
lie still. And you have to be really still, because you move around, that's, that messes up the
coordinates of where, where everything is. And so, you know, try to get, you know, your question is,
how and when are language developing? You know, how, when, how does this left lateralized system
come to play? Where does it, you know, and it's really hard to get a two year old to do this task.
But you can maybe, they're starting to get three and four and five year olds to do this task for
short periods. And it looks like it's there pretty early. So clearly, when you lead up to you,
like a baby's first words, before that, there's a lot of fascinating turmoil going on about like
figuring out like, what are, what are these people saying? And you're trying to like make
sense, how does that connect to the world and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, that might be just
fascinating development that's happening there. That's hard to introspect. But anyway, you,
we're back to the scanner. And I can find my network in 15 minutes. And now we can ask a,
we can ask, find my network, find yours, find, you know, 20 other people do this task. And we
can do some other tasks. Anything else you think is thinking of some other thing, I can do a spatial
memory task, I can do a music perception task, I can do programming task, if I program, okay,
I can do what, where I can like understand computer programs. And none of those tasks
tap the language network at all, like at all, there's no overlap. They do, they're, they're
highly activated in other parts of the brain. There's a, there's a bilateral network, which I
think she tends to call the multiple demands network, which does anything kind of hard and,
and sort of anything that's kind of difficult in some ways, will activate that multiple demands
network. I mean, music will be in some music area, you know, there's music specific kinds of areas.
And so, but there, but, but none of them are activating the language area at all, unless
there's words, like, so if you have music, and there's a song, and you can hear the words, then,
and then you get the language area. We're talking about speaking and listening, but or we also
talking about reading. This is all comprehension of any kind. And so that is fast. So what this,
this, this network doesn't make any difference if it's written or spoken. So the, the, the
thing that she calls, Federico calls the language network is this high level language.
So it's not about the spoken, the spoken language, and it's not about the written language is about
either one of them. And so we're, so when you do speech, you're sort of list, you either,
you're listening to speech and you'd, you know, subtract away some language you don't understand
and see where it's, or you subtract way back backwards speech, which signs sounds like speech,
but it isn't. And, and then so you take away the sound part altogether. And so, and then if you
written, you get exactly the same network. So for just reading the language versus reading
sort of nonsense words or something like that, you'll find exactly the same network. So it's
just about high level comprehension of language. Yeah. In this case, and the same thing happened,
production is a little harder to run the scanner, but the same thing happens in production. You get
the same network. So production is a little harder. You have to figure out how do you run a task,
you know, in the network such that you're doing some kind of production. And I can't remember
what they've done a bunch of different kinds of tasks there where you get people to, you know,
produce things. Yeah. Figure out how to produce. And the same network goes on there. It's actually
the same place. And so if you, wait, wait, so if you read random words, yeah, if you read things like
like gibberish, yeah, yeah, Lewis Carroll's, Twaz Brillig, Jabberwocky, right? They call that
Jabberwocky speech. The network doesn't get activated. Not as much. There are words in there.
Because it's still, there's function words and stuff. So it's lower activation.
Yeah. Yeah. So there's like, basically the more language like it is, the higher it goes in the
language network. And that network is there from when you speak from as soon as you learn language.
And, and it's, it's there, like you speak multiple languages, the same network is going for your
multiple languages. So you speak English, you speak Russian, both of them are hitting that same
network. If you, if you're fluent in those languages. So programming. Not at all. Isn't that
amazing? Even if you're a really good programmer, that is not a human language. It's just not conveying
the same information. And so it is not in the language network. And so that has mind blowing
as I think that's pretty cool. That's weird. That's amazing. And so that's like one set of
day. This is hers like shows that what you might think is thinking is not language language is
just the seek just, just this conventionalized system that we've worked out in human languages.
Oh, another fascinating little bit tidbit is that even if they're these constructed languages,
like Klingon or I don't know the languages from Game of Thrones. I'm sorry. I don't remember those
languages baby. A lot of people offending right now. There's people that speak those languages.
They really speak those languages because the people that wrote the languages for the shows,
they did an amazing job of constructing something like a human language. And those that,
that lights up the language area. That's like, because they can speak, you know,
pretty much arbitrary thoughts in a human language. It's not a, it's a constructed human
language. And probably it's related to human languages because the people that were constructing
them wasn't were making them like human languages in various ways. But it also activates the same
network, which is pretty, really cool. Anyway, sorry to go into a place where you may be a little
bit philosophical, but is it possible that this area of the brain is doing some kind of translation
into a deeper set of almost like concepts? Which it has to be doing. So it's doing in
communication, right? It is translating from thought, whatever that is, is more abstract.
And it's doing that. That's what it's doing. Like it is, that is kind of what it is doing.
It's like kind of a meaning network, I guess. Yeah, like a translation network. But I wonder
what is at the core, at the bottom of it, like what are thoughts? Are they thoughts? To me, like
thoughts and words, are they neighbors or is it one turtle sitting on top of the other?
Meaning like, is there a deep set of concepts that we... Well, there's connections right between
what these things mean. And then there's probably other parts of the brain that what these things
mean. And so, you know, when I'm talking about whatever it is I want to talk about, it'll be
represented somewhere else. That knowledge of whatever that is will be represented somewhere
else. Well, I wonder if there's like some stable, nicely compressed encoding of meanings
that's separate from language. That link, you know, I guess the implication here is that
we don't think in language. That's correct. Isn't that cool? And that's so interesting.
So people, I mean, this is like hard to do experiments on, but there is this idea of
an inner voice and a lot of people have an inner voice. And so, if you do a poll on the internet
and ask if you hear yourself talking when you're just thinking or whatever, you know, about 70
or 80% of people will say yes. Most people have an inner voice. I don't. And so, I always find
this strange when... So when people talk about an inner voice, I always thought this was a metaphor
and they hear, I know most of you, whoever's listening to this thinks I'm crazy now because I
don't have an inner voice and I just don't know what you're listening to. It sounds so kind of
annoying to me, but to have this voice going on while you're thinking, but I guess most people
have that. And I don't have that. And we don't really know what that connects to.
I wonder if the inner voice activates that same network. I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. I mean, this could be speachy, right? So that's like, do you hear, do you have an
inner voice? I don't think so. A lot of people have this sense that they hear other people,
they hear themselves, and then say they read someone's email, I've heard people tell me that
they hear that other person's voice when they read other people's emails. And I'm like, wow,
that sounds so disruptive. I do think I vocalize when I'm reading, but I don't think I hear a voice.
Well, that's, you probably don't have an inner voice. Yeah, I don't think I have an inner voice.
People have an inner voice. People have this strong percept of hearing sound in their heads
when they're just thinking. I refuse to believe that's the majority of people.
Majority, absolutely. What? It's like two thirds or three quarters. It's not.
I would never ask class. And I went internet, they always say that. So you're in a minority.
It could be a self report flaw. It could be. You know, when I'm reading inside my head,
I'm kind of like saying the words, which is probably the wrong way to read,
but I don't hear a voice. There's no precept of a voice. I refuse to believe the majority
people have. Anyway, it's a fascinating, the human brain is fascinating, but it still blew
my mind that the, that language does appear, comprehension does appear to be separate from
thinking. So that's one set. One set of data from Fedorenko's group is that no matter what task you
do, if it doesn't have words and combinations of words in it, then it won't light up the language
network. You know, you could, it'll be active somewhere else, but not there. So that's one.
And then this other piece of evidence relevant to that question is it turns out there are these,
this group of people who've had a massive stroke on the left side and wiped out their language
network. And as long as they didn't wipe out everything on the right as well, in that case,
they wouldn't be, you know, cognitively functionable. But if they just wiped out language, which is
pretty tough to do because it's, it's very expansive on the left. But if they have, then there are
these, there's patients like this called so-called global aphasics who can do any task just fine,
but not language. They can't, you can't talk to them. I mean, they don't understand you,
they can't speak, can't write, they can't read, but they can do, they can play chess,
they can drive their cars, they can do all kinds of other stuff, you know, do math, they can do all,
like, so math is not in the language area, for instance, you do arithmetic and stuff. That's
not language area. It's got symbols. So people sort of confuse some kind of symbolic processing
with language and symbolic processing is not the same. So there are symbols and they have meaning,
but it's not language. It's not a, you know, conventionalized language system. And so language,
so math isn't there. And so they can do math. They're, they do just as well as their control,
age match controls and all these tasks. This is Rosemary Varley over in University College London,
who has a bunch of patients who, who she's shown this that they're just, so that, that sort of
combination suggests that language isn't necessary for thinking. It, it, it doesn't mean you can't
think in language. You could think in language because language allows a lot of expression,
but it's just, you don't need it for thinking. It's, it suggests that language is separate,
is a separate system. This is kind of blowing my mind right now. I'm trying to load that in
because it has implications for large language models. It sure does. And they've been working on
that. Well, let's take a stroll there. You wrote that the best current theories of human language
are arguably large language models. So this has to do with form. It's a kind of a big theory.
And, but the reason it's arguably the best is that it, it does the best at predicting what's
English, for instance, it's, it's like incredibly good, you know, it better than any other theory.
It's so, you know, but, you know, we don't, you know, there's, it's not sort of, there's not enough
detail. It's opaque. Like there's not, you don't know what's going on. No, what's going on. It's
another black box, but I think it's, you know, it is a theory. What's your definition of a theory?
Because it's a gigantic, it's a gigantic black box with, you know, a very large number of parameters
controlling it. To me, theory usually requires a simplicity, right? Well, I don't know. Maybe
I'm just being loose there. I think it's a, it's not, it's not a great theory, but it's a theory.
It's a good theory in one sense in that it covers all the data. Like anything you want to say in
English it does. And so that's why it's, that's how it's arguably the best is that no other theory
is as good as a large language model in predicting exactly what's good and what's bad in English.
You know, now you're saying, is it a good theory? Well, probably not, you know,
because I want a smaller theory than that. It's too big. I agree.
You could probably construct mechanism by which it can generate a simple explanation of a particular
language, like a set of rules, something like a, it could generate a dependency grammar for a
language, right? You could probably, you could probably just ask it about itself.
Well, you know, that's, I mean, that presumes, and there's some evidence for this that some
large language models are implementing something like dependency grammar inside them. And so
there's work from a guy called Chris Manning and colleagues over at Stanford in natural language.
And they looked at, I don't know how many large language model types, but certainly Bert and some
others where, and where you do some kind of fancy math to figure out exactly what the sort of,
what kind of abstractions of representations are going on. And they, and they were saying,
it does look like dependency structure is, is what they're constructing. It doesn't,
like, so it's actually a very, very good map. So it's kind of a, they are constructing something
like that. Does it mean that, you know, that they're using that for meaning? I mean, probably,
but we don't know. You write that the kinds of theories of language that LLMs are closest to
are called construction based theories. Can you explain what construction based theories are?
It's just a general theory of language such that there's a form and a meaning pair for,
for lots of pieces of the language. And so it's, it's, it's primarily usage based is a construction
grammar. It's just, it's trying to deal with the things that people actually say, actually say and
actually write. And so that's, it's a usage based idea. And what's a constructional construction
is either a simple word, so of like a morpheme plus its meaning or a combination of words. It's
basically combinations of words, like the rules. So, but it's, it's, it's, uh,
un, un-specified as to what the form of the grammar is under, underlyingly. And so I, I would, I,
I would argue that the dependency grammar is maybe the, the right form to use for the types of
construction grammar. Construction grammar typically, um, isn't kind of formalized quite.
And so maybe the formalization, a formalization of that, it might be in dependency grammar.
I mean, I, I would think so, but I mean, it's up to people, other researchers in that area,
if they agree or not. So, do you think that large language models understand language?
Are they mimicking language? I guess the deeper question there is, are they just understanding
the surface form? Or do they understand something deeper about the meaning that then generates the
form? I mean, I would argue they're doing the form. They're doing the form and doing it really,
really well. And, uh, are they doing the meaning? No, probably not. I mean, there's lots of these
examples from various groups showing that they can be tricked in all kinds of ways. They really
don't understand the, the meaning of what's going on. And so there's a lot of examples that he and
other groups have given, which just, which show they don't really understand what's going on.
So, you know, the Monty Hall problem is this silly problem, right? Where, you know, if, uh,
you have three door, it's, it's less make a deal as this old game show, and there's three doors,
and there's a prize behind one, and there's some junk prizes behind the other two, and you're
trying to select one. And if you, you know, he knows Monty, he knows where the target item is,
the good thing, he knows everything is back there. And you're supposed to, he gives you a choice,
you choose one of the three, and then he opens one of the doors, and it's some junk prize.
And then the question is, should you trade to get the other one? And, and the answer is yes,
you should trade because he knew which ones you could turn around. And so now the odds are two
thirds. Okay. Um, and then you just change that a little bit to the large language mall, the
large language mall, just seeing that, that, that explanation so many times that it just,
if you change the story, it's a little bit, but it makes it sound like it's the Monty Hall problem,
but it's not. You just say, oh, um, there's three doors, and one behind them is a good prize,
and there's two bad doors. I happen to know it's behind door number one. The good prize,
the car is behind door number one. So I'm going to choose door number one. Monty Hall opens door
number three and shows me nothing there. Should I trade for door number two? Even though I know
the good prize and door number one, and then the large language mall say, yes, you should trade,
because it's a, it's, it just goes through the, the, the, the forms that it's seen before so many
times on these cases where it, yes, you should trade because, you know, your odds have shifted from
one in three now to two out of three to being that thing. It doesn't have any way to remember
that actually you have a hundred percent probability behind that door number one. You know that,
that's not part of the, of the, the scheme that it's seen hundreds and hundreds of times before.
And so you can't, you can't, even if you try to explain to it that it's wrong, that they can't do
that, it'll just keep giving you back the, the problem. But it's also possible the large language
model would be aware of the fact that there's sometimes over a representation of a, of a
particular kind of formulation. And it's easy to get tricked by that. And so you could see if
they get larger and larger models be a little bit more skeptical. So you see a over representation.
So like you, it just feels like form can, training on form can go really far in terms of being able
to generate things that look like the thing understands deeply the underlying world, world model
of the kind of mathematical world, physical world, psychological world that would generate
these kinds of sentences. It just feels like you're creeping close to the meaning part easily
fooled, all this kind of stuff, but that's humans too. So it just seems really impressive
how often it seems like it un-understands concepts.
I mean, you don't have to convince me of that. I'm, I am very, very impressed, but does it,
does do, I mean, you're, you're giving a possible world where maybe someone's going to train some
other versions such that it'll be somehow abstracting away from types of forms. I mean,
I don't think that's happened. And so no, no, no, no, I'm not saying that. I think when you
just look at anecdotal examples and just showing a large number of them where it doesn't seem to
understand, it's easily fooled. That does not seem like a scientific data driven like analysis of
like how many places is a damn impressive in terms of meaning and understanding and how many
places is easily fooled. And like that's not the inference. So I don't want to make that,
the inference I don't, I wouldn't want to make was that inference. The inference I'm trying to
push is just that is it, is it like humans here? It's probably not like humans here. It's different.
So humans don't make that error. If you explain that to them, they're not going to make that error.
You know, they don't make that error. And so that's something, it's doing something different
from humans that they're doing in that case.
What's the mechanism by which humans figure out that it's an error?
I'm just saying the error there is like, if I explain to you there's 100% chance
that the car is behind this case, this door, well, do you want to trade? If you'll say no.
But this thing will say yes, because it's so, that trick, it's so wound up on the form
that it's, that's an error that a human doesn't make, which is kind of interesting.
Less likely to make, I should say.
Yeah, less likely.
Because like humans are very-
Oh yeah.
I mean, you're asking, you know, you're asking humans, you're asking a system to understand
100%, like you're asking some mathematical concepts. And so like-
Look, the places where large language models are, the form is amazing. So let's go back to
nested structures, center embedded structures. Okay, if you ask a human to complete those,
they can't do it. Neither can a large language model. They're just like humans in that. If you
ask, if I ask a large language model-
That's fascinating, by the way.
That, that's-
The central embedding.
Yeah, the central embedding is, it struggles with-
Just like humans, exactly like humans.
Exactly the same way as humans. And that's not trained. So they do exactly, so that is
a similarity. So, but then it's, that's not meaning, right? This is form. But when we
get into meaning, this is where they get kind of messed up. When you start just saying, oh,
what's behind this door? Oh, it's, you know, this is the thing I want. Humans don't mess that up as
much, you know. Here, the form is, it's just like the form of the match is amazing, is similar,
without being trained to do that. I mean, it's trained in the sense that it's getting lots of
data, which is just like human data, but it's not being trained on, you know,
bad sentences and being told what's bad. It just can't do those. It'll actually say things like,
those are too hard for me to complete or something, which is kind of interesting. Actually, kind of,
how does it know that? I don't know.
But it really often doesn't just complete sense. They get off, very often says stuff that's true.
And sometimes says stuff that's not true. And almost always the form is great.
But it's still very surprising that with really great form, it's able to generate a lot of things
that are true based on what is trained on and so on. So it's not just, it's not just form that is
generating. It's mimicking true statements from the internet. I guess the underlying idea there is
that on the internet, truth is overrepresented versus falsehood. I think that's probably right.
So, but the fundamental thing is trained on your saying is just form. I think so. Yeah, I think so.
Well, that's a sad, if that's to me, that's still a little bit of open question. I probably lean
agreeing with you, especially now you've blown my mind that there's a separate module in the brain
for language versus thinking. Maybe there's a fundamental part missing from the large language
model approach that lacks the thinking, the reasoning capability. Yeah, that's what this
group argues. So the same group, Fedorenko's group has a recent paper arguing exactly that.
There's a guy called Kyle Mahwell who's here in Austin, Texas actually. He's an old student of
mine, but he's a faculty in linguistics at Texas and he was the first author on that.
That's fascinating. Still, to me, an open question. Yeah. What do you have the
interesting limits of LLMs? You know, I don't see any limits to their form. Their form is
impressive. Yeah, it's pretty much, I mean, it's close to- Well, you said ability to complete
central embeddings. Yeah, it's just the same as humans. It seems the same. But that's not
perfect, right? It should be- That's good. No, but I want to be like humans. I'm trying to,
I want to model of humans. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Also, perfect is as close to humans
as possible. I got it. Yeah. But you should be able to, if you're not human, you're like,
you're superhuman. You should be able to complete central embedded sentences, right?
I mean, that's the mechanism is, if it's modeling something, I think it's kind of
really interesting that it can't- Then it's really interesting.
It's more like, I think it's potentially underlyingly modeling something like what the
way the form is processed. The form of human language and how humans process the language.
Yes. I think that's plausible. And how they generate language. Process language and
general language, that's fascinating. Yeah. So in that sense, they're perfect.
If we can just linger on the center embedding thing, that's hard for LLMs to produce and
that seems really impressive because that's hard for humans to produce. And how does that connect
to the thing we've been talking about before, which is the dependency grammar framework,
in which you view language and the finding that short dependencies seem to be a universal
part of language. So why is it hard to complete center embeddings?
So what I like about dependency grammar is it makes
the cognitive cost associated with longer distance connections very transparent.
It turns out there is a cost associated with producing and comprehending
connections between words, which are just not beside each other. The further apart they are,
the worse it is according to, well, we can measure that. And there is a cost associated with that.
Can you just linger on what do you mean by cognitive cost and how do you measure?
Sure. Oh, well, you can measure it in a lot of ways. The simplest is just asking people to say
whether, you know, how good a sentence sounds. We just ask, that's one way to measure and you
try to like triangulate then across sentences and across structures to try to figure out what
the source of that is. You can look at reading times in controlled materials, you know, in certain
kinds of materials and then we can measure the dependency distances there. There's a recent
study which looked at, we're talking about the brain here, we could look at the language network,
okay? We could look at the language network and we could look at the activation in the language
network and how big the activation is depending on the length of the dependencies. And it turns out
in just random sentences that you're listening to, so it turns out there are people listening to
stories here. And the longer the dependency is, the stronger the activation in the language
network. And so there's some measure, there's a bunch of different measures we could do. That's
a kind of a neat measure actually of actual activation in the brain. So that you can somehow,
in different ways, convert it to a number. I wonder if there's a beautiful equation connecting
cognitive cost and length of dependency. E equals MC squared kind of thing. Yeah, it's
complicated, but probably it's doable. I would guess it's doable. I tried to do that a while ago
and I was reasonably successful, but for some reason I stopped working on that. I agree with
you that it would be nice to figure out. So there's like some way to figure out the cost. I mean,
it's complicated. Another issue you raised before was like, how do you measure distance? Is it words,
is it, it probably isn't, is it part of the problem? Is that some words matter than more than
others? And probably, meaning like nouns might matter depending, and then it maybe depends
on which kind of noun. Is it a noun we've already introduced or a noun that's already been mentioned?
Is it a pronoun versus a name? Like all these things probably matter. So probably the simplest
thing to do is just like, let's forget about all that and just think about words or morphemes.
For sure. But there might be some insight in the kind of function that fits the data,
meaning like quadratic, like what? I think it's an exponential. So we think it's probably an
exponential such that the longer the distance, the less it matters. And so then it's the sum of
those is my, that was our best guess a while ago. So you've got a bunch of dependencies,
if you've got a bunch of them that are being connected at some point, at the ends of those,
the cost is some exponential function of those is my guess. But because the reason it's probably
an exponential is like, it's not just the distance between two words, because I can make a very,
very long subject verb depends by adding lots and lots of noun phrases and prepositional phrases.
And it doesn't matter too much. It's when you do nest it, when I have multiple of these,
then things get go really bad, go south. Probably somehow connected to working memory.
Yeah. That's probably the function of the memory here is the access is trying to find those earlier
things. It's kind of hard to figure out what was referred to earlier. Those are those connections.
That's the sort of notion of working as opposed to a storagey thing, but trying to connect,
retrieve those earlier words, depending on what was in between. And then we're talking about
interference of similar things in between. That's the right theory probably has that kind of notion
and it is an interference of similar. And so I'm dealing with an abstraction over the right
theory, which is just, it's count words, it's not right, but it's close. And then maybe you're
right though, there's some sort of an exponential or something to figure out the total so we can
figure out a function for any given sentence in any given language. But it's funny, people haven't
done that too much, which I do think is, I'm interested that you find that interesting. I
really find that interesting. And a lot of people haven't found it interesting. And I don't know why
I haven't got people to want to work on that. I really like that too.
That's a beautiful idea. And the underlying idea is beautiful that there's a cognitive
cost that correlates with the length of dependency. It just, it feels like it's a deep, I mean,
language is so fundamentally human experience. And this is a nice, clean theory of language
where it's like, wow, okay. So like we like our words close together, the dependent words close
together. That's why I like it too. It's so simple. Yeah, the simplicity of the theory.
And yet it explains some very complicated phenomena. If you, if I write these very
complicated sentences, it's kind of hard to know why they're so hard. And you can like,
oh, nail it down. I can do like a, give you a math formula for why each one of them is bad and where.
And that's kind of cool. I think that's very neat.
Have you gone through the process? Is there like a, if you take a piece of text and then simplify
sort of like there's an average length of dependency, and then you like,
you know, reduce it and see comprehension on the entire, not just a single sentence, but
like, you know, you go from James Joyce to Hemingway or something.
No, no, I, simple answer is no, that does, there's probably things you can do in that,
in that kind of direction. That's fun. We might, you know, we're going to talk about legalese at
some point. And so we, maybe we'll talk about that kind of thinking with applied to legalese.
Well, let's talk about legalese because you mentioned that as an exception,
which is taking a tangent upon tangent. That's an interesting one. You give it as an exception.
It's an exception.
That you say that most natural languages, as we've been talking about,
have local dependencies with one exception, legalese.
That's right.
So what is legalese, first of all?
Oh, well, legalese is what you think it is. It's just any legal language.
I mean, like, I actually know very little about the kind of language that lawyers use.
So I'm just talking about language in laws and language in contracts.
Got it.
So the stuff that you have to run into, we have to run into every other day or every day,
and you skip over because it reads poorly and or, you know, partly it's just long, right?
There's a lot of text there that we don't really want to know about.
And so, but the thing I'm interested in, so I've been working with this guy called Eric Martinez,
he was a lawyer who was taking my class.
I was teaching a psycholinguistics lab class.
I haven't been teaching it for a long time at MIT, and he was a law student at Harvard.
And he took the class because he had done some linguistics as an undergrad,
and he was interested in the problem of why legalese sounds hard to understand.
So why is it hard to understand, and why do they write that way, if it is hard to understand?
It seems apparent that it's hard to understand.
The question is, why is it?
And so we didn't know, and we did an evaluation of a bunch of contracts.
Actually, we took a bunch of random contracts, because I don't know, you know,
there's contracts and laws might not be exactly the same, but contracts are kind of the things that
most people have to deal with most of the time.
And so that's kind of the most common thing that humans have, like humans,
that adults in our industrialized society have to deal with a lot.
And so that's what we pulled, and we didn't know what was hard about them,
but it turns out that the way they're written is very center-embedded,
has nested structures in them.
So it has low-frequency words as well.
That's not surprising.
Lots of texts have low-frequency words.
It does have surprising, slightly lower-frequency words than other kinds of control texts,
even sort of academic texts.
Legalese is even worse.
It is the worst that we weren't being able to find.
You just reveal the game that lawyers are playing.
They're optimizing a different...
Well, you know, it's interesting.
Now you're getting at why.
And so near your thing, they're doing intentionally.
I don't think they're doing intentionally.
But let's get into this.
It's an emergent phenomena.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll get to that.
We'll get to that.
And so, but we wanted to see why.
So we see what first, as opposed to...
So because it turns out that we're not the first to observe that Legalese is weird.
Back to, Nixon had a plain language act in 1970, and Obama had one.
And boy, a lot of presidents have said,
oh, we've got to simplify legal language, must simplify it.
But you don't know how it's complicated.
It's not easy to simplify it.
You need to know what it is you're supposed to do before you can fix it.
Right?
And so you need to cycle linguists to analyze the text and see what's wrong with it
before you can fix it.
You don't know how to fix it.
How am I supposed to fix something?
I don't know what's wrong with it.
And so what we did was just...
That's what we did.
We figured out, well, it's okay.
We just had a bunch of contracts, had people,
and we encoded them for a bunch of features.
And so another feature of the people, one of them was central embedding.
And so that is basically how often a clause would intervene between a subject and a verb,
for example.
That's one kind of a central embedding of a clause.
And it turns out they're massively central embedded.
So I think in random contracts and in random laws,
I think you get about 70% or 70% of sentences have a central embedded clause,
which is insanely high.
If you go to any other text, it's down to 20% or something.
It's so much higher than any control you can think of, including...
You think, oh, people think, oh, technical academic text.
No, people don't write central embedded sentences in technical academic text.
I mean, they do a little bit, but it's on the 20%, 30% realm as opposed to 70.
And so there's that.
And there's low-frequency words.
And then people, oh, maybe it's passive.
People don't like the passive.
Passive, for some reason.
The passive voice in English has a bad rap.
And I'm not really sure where that comes from.
And there is a lot of passive in the...
There's much more passive voice in legalese than there is in other texts.
And the passive voice accounts for some of the low-frequency words.
No, no, no, no.
Those are separate.
Those are separate.
Oh, so passive voice sucks.
These are just three...
Low-frequency word sucks.
Well, sucks are different.
That's a judgment on passive.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pass the...
Drop the judgment.
It's just like, these are frequent.
These are things which happen in legalese texts.
Then we can ask the dependent measure is like,
how well you understand those things with those features.
Okay.
And so then, and it turns out the passive makes no difference.
So it has a zero effect on your comprehension ability,
on your recall ability.
No, nothing at all.
That means no effect.
The words matter a little bit.
They do low-frequency words are going to hurt you in recall and understanding.
But what really hurts is the central betting.
That kills you.
That is like, that slows people down.
That makes them very poor at understanding.
That makes them, they can't recall what was said as well, nearly as well.
And we did this not only on lay people.
We did have a lot of lay people.
We ran it on 100 lawyers.
We recruited lawyers from a wide range of different levels of law firms and stuff.
And they have the same pattern.
So they also, like when they did this, I did not know what happened.
I thought maybe they could process, they're used to legally.
So they can process it just as well as it was normal.
No, no, they're much better than lay people.
So they can much better recall, much better understanding,
but they have the same main effects as lay people, exactly the same.
So they also much prefer the non-center.
So we constructed non-center embedded versions of each of these.
We constructed versions which have higher frequency words in those places.
And we did, we un-passivized, we turned them into active versions.
The passive active made no difference.
The words made a little difference.
And the un-center embedding makes big differences in all the populations.
Un-center embedding.
How hard is that process, by the way?
Not very hard.
So I don't question, but how hard is it to detect center embedding?
Oh, easy, easy to detect.
You just looking at long dependencies?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You can just, you can, so there's automatic parsers for English, which are pretty good.
And they can detect center embedding?
Oh, yeah.
Very.
Or I guess nested.
Perfectly.
Yeah, you've learned pretty much.
So you're not just looking for long dependencies,
you're just literally looking for center embedding.
Yeah, yeah, we are in this case, in these cases.
But long dependencies are, they're highly correlated, these types of this.
So like a center embedding is a big bomb you throw inside of a sentence that just blows
up the, that makes super.
Can I read a sentence for you from these things?
Sure.
I see, I mean, this is just like one of the things that,
my eyes might glaze over in mid-sentence.
No, I understand that.
I mean, legalese is hard.
This is the goal, because in the event that any payment or benefit by the company,
all such payments and benefits, including the payments and benefits under section 3a here of
being here at here and after referred to as a total payment,
would be subject to the excise tax, then the cash severance payments shall be reduced.
So that's something we pulled from a regular text, from a contract.
Wow.
And the center embedded bit there is just, for some reason, there's a definition,
they throw the definition of what payments and benefits are in between the subject and the verbal.
Let's, how about don't do that?
How about put the definition somewhere else, as opposed to in the middle of the sentence?
And so that's very, very common, by the way, that's what happens.
So you just throw your definitions, you use a word, a couple words, and then you define it,
and then you continue the sentence.
Like just don't write like that.
So then we asked lawyers, we thought, oh, maybe lawyers like this.
Lawyers don't like this.
They don't like this.
They don't want to write like this.
They, we asked them to rate materials which are with the same meaning,
with uncentered bed and center bed, and they much preferred the uncentered bed versions.
On the comprehension, on the reading side.
Yeah, well, and we asked them, would you hire someone who writes like this or this?
We asked them all kinds of questions, and they always preferred the less complicated version,
all of them.
So I don't even think they want it this way.
Yeah, but how did it happen?
How did it happen?
That's a very good question.
And the answer is, they still don't know.
But I have some theories.
Well, our best theory at the moment is that there's actually some kind of a performative
meaning in the center embedding, in the style which tells you it's legalese.
We think that that's the kind of a style which tells you it's legalese.
Like that's a reasonable guess, and maybe it's just, so for instance, if you're,
like it's like a magic spell.
So we kind of call this the magic spell hypothesis.
So when you give them, when you tell someone to put a magic spell on someone, what do you do?
They, you know, people know what a magic spell is, and they do a lot of rhyming.
You know, that's kind of what people will tend to do.
They'll do rhyming, and they'll do sort of like some kind of poetry kind of thing.
Abracadabra type of thing.
Yeah, and maybe that's, there's a syntactic sort of reflex here of a magic spell,
which is center embedding.
And so that's like, oh, it's trying to like tell you this is like,
this is something which is true, which is what the goal of law is, right?
It's telling you something that we want you to believe as certainly true, right?
That's what legal contracts are trying to enforce on you, right?
And so maybe that's like a form which has, this is like an abstract, very abstract form,
center embedding, which has a meaning associated with it.
Well, don't you think there's an incentive for lawyers to generate things that are hard to
understand?
That was one of our working hypotheses.
We just couldn't find any evidence of that.
No, lawyers also don't understand it.
But you're creating space, why, you yourself, I mean, you ask in a communist Soviet Union,
the individual members, their self-report is not going to correctly reflect what is broken
about the gigantic bureaucracy that leads to Chernobyl or something like this.
I think the incentives under which you operate are not always transparent to the members within
that system.
So like it just feels like a strange coincidence that like there is benefit if you just zoom out,
look at the system as opposed to asking individual lawyers that making something hard to understand
is going to make a lot of people money.
Like you're going to need a lawyer to figure that out, I guess, from the perspective of the
individual, but then that could be the performative aspect.
It could be as opposed to the incentive driven to be complicated.
It could be performative to where we lawyers speak in this sophisticated way and you regular
humans don't understand it, so you need to hire a lawyer.
Yeah, I don't know which one it is, but it's suspicious.
Suspicious that it's hard to understand and that everybody's eyes glaze over and they don't
read.
I'm suspicious as well.
I'm still suspicious and I hear what you're saying.
It could be kind of a no individual and even average of individuals.
It could just be a few bad apples in a way which are driving the effect in some way.
Influential bad apples that everybody looks up to whatever their central figures and how.
But it turns out, but it is kind of interesting that among our 100 lawyers, they did not share
that.
They didn't want this.
That's fascinating.
They really didn't like it.
And they weren't better than regular people at comprehending it.
Or they were on average better.
But they had the same difference.
The same difference.
The exact same difference.
So they wanted it fixed.
And so that gave us hope that because it actually isn't very hard to construct a material,
which is uncenter embedded and has the same meaning, it's not very hard to do.
Just basically in that situation, just putting definitions outside of the subject verb relation
in that particular example, that's pretty general.
What they're doing is just throwing stuff in there, which you didn't have to put in there.
There's extra words involved.
Typically, you may need a few extra words to refer to the things that you're defining outside
in some way, because if you only use it in that one sentence, then there's no reason to
introduce extra terms.
But so we might have a few more words, but it'll be easier to understand.
So I mean, I have hope that now that maybe we can make legalese less convoluted in this way.
So maybe the next president in the United States can, instead of saying generic things,
say, I ban center embeddings and make Ted the language czar of the U.S.
Eric Martinez is the guy you should really put in there.
But center embeddings are the bad thing to have.
That's right.
So you can get rid of that.
That'll do a lot of it.
That affects a lot.
Oh, that's fascinating.
That is so fascinating.
And it is really fascinating on many fronts that humans are just not able to deal with
this kind of thing.
And that language, because of that evolved in the way you did, it's fascinating.
So one of the mathematical formulations you have when talking about languages communication
is this idea of noisy channels.
What's a noisy channel?
Well, so that's about communication.
And so this is going back to Shannon.
So Shannon, Claude Shannon was a student at MIT in the 40s.
And so he wrote this very influential piece of work about communication theory or information
theory.
And he was interested in human language.
Actually, he was interested in this problem of communication, of getting a message from
my head to your head.
And so he was concerned or interested in what was a robust way to do that.
And so assuming we both speak the same language, we both already speak English, whatever the
language is, we speak that, what is a way that I can say the language so that it's most likely
to get the signal that I want to you?
And so the problem there in the communication is the noisy channel.
It's that there's a lot of noise in the system.
I don't speak perfectly.
I make errors.
That's noise.
There's background noise.
You know that.
Like a literal background noise.
There is like white noise in the background or some other kind of noise.
There's some speaking going on that you're at a party.
That's background noise.
You're trying to hear someone.
It's hard to understand them because there's all this other stuff going on in the background.
And then there's noise on the receiver side.
So that you have some problem maybe understanding me for stuff that is internal to you in some
way.
So you've got some other problems, whatever, with understanding for whatever reasons.
Maybe you're, maybe you've had too much to drink.
You know, who knows why you're not able to pay attention to the signal.
So that's the noisy channel.
And so that language, if it's communication system, we are trying to optimize in some sense
the passing of the message from one side to the other.
And so, I mean, one idea is that maybe, you know, aspects of like word order, for example,
might have optimized in some way to make language a little more easy to be passed from
speaker to listener.
And so Shannon's the guy that did the stuff way back in the forties.
You know, it's very interesting, you know, historically, he was interested in working
in linguistics.
He was in MIT and he did, this is his master's thesis of all things.
You know, it's crazy how much he did for his master's thesis.
In 1948, I think, or 49 or something.
And he wanted to keep working in language.
And it just wasn't a popular communication as a reason, a source for what language was,
wasn't popular at the time.
So Chomsky was becoming, it was moving in there.
He was, and he just wasn't able to get a handle there, I think.
And so, and so he moved to Bell Haps and worked on communication from a mathematical point of
view and was, you know, did all kinds of amazing work.
And so he's just more on the signal side versus like the language side.
Hi, it would have been interesting to see if you proceed the language side.
That's really interesting.
He was interested in that.
His examples in the forties are kind of like, they're very language like things.
We can kind of show that there's a noisy channel process going on in when you're
listening to me, you know, you can often sort of guess what I meant by what I,
you know, what you think I meant, given what I said.
And I mean, with respect to sort of why language looks the way it does, we might,
there might be sort of, as I alluded to, there might be ways in which word orders
is somewhat optimized for, because of the noisy channel in some way.
I mean, that's really cool to sort of model if you don't hear certain parts of a sentence
or have some probability of missing that part.
Like how do you construct a language that's resilient to that?
That's somewhat robust to that.
Yeah, that's the idea.
And then you're kind of saying like the word order and the syntax of language,
the dependency length are all helpful.
Yeah.
Well, the dependency length is really about memory, right?
I think that's like about sort of what's easier or harder to produce in some way.
And these other ideas are about sort of robustness to communication.
So the problem of potential loss of loss of signal due to noise.
It's so that there may be aspects of word order, which is somewhat optimized for that.
And we have this one guess in that direction.
These are kind of just so stories.
I have to be pretty frank.
They're not like, I can't show this is true.
All we can do is like look at the current languages of the world.
This is like, we can't sort of see how languages change or anything,
because we've got these snapshots of a few hundred or a few thousand languages.
We don't really, we can't do the right kinds of modifications to test these things experimentally.
And so just take this with a grain of salt from here, this stuff.
The dependency stuff I can, I'm much more solid on.
I'm like, here's what the lengths are and here's what's hard, here's what's easy.
And this is a reasonable structure.
I think I'm pretty reasonable.
Here's like, why does the word order look the way it does?
We're now into shaky territory, but it's kind of cool.
But we're talking about, just to be clear, we're talking about maybe just actually
the sounds of communication.
You and I are sitting in the bar, it's very loud.
And you model with a noisy channel, the loudness,
the noise, and we have the signal that's coming across.
And you're saying word order might have something to do with optimizing
that presence of noise.
It's really interesting.
I mean, to me, it's interesting how much you can load into the noisy channel,
like how much can you bake in?
You said like, cognitive load on the receiver end.
We think that those are, there's three, at least three different kinds of things going on there.
And we probably don't want to treat them all as the same.
And so I think that the right model, a better model of a noisy channel would have
three different sources of noise, which are background noise,
speaker, inherent noise, and listener, inherent noise.
And those are all different things.
Sure. But then underneath it, there's a million other subsets of like what?
That's true.
On the receiving, I mean, I just mentioned cognitive load on both sides.
Then there's like speech impediments or just everything.
World view, I mean, on the meaning, we start to creep into the meaning realm of like,
we have different world views.
Well, how about just form still though?
Like just what language you know?
Like, so how well you know the language?
And so if it's second language for you versus first language,
and how maybe what other languages you know, these are still just form stuff.
And that's like potentially very informative.
And, you know, how old you are, these things probably matter, right?
So like a child learning a language is, you know, as a noisy representation of English grammar,
you know, depending on how old they are.
So maybe when they're six, they're perfectly formed.
But you mentioned one of the things is like a way to measure the language is learning problems.
So like, what's the correlation between everything we've been talking about
and how easy it is to learn a language?
So is like a short dependencies correlated to ability to learn a language?
Is there some kind of or like the dependency grammar?
Is there some kind of connection there?
How easy it is to learn?
Yeah, well, all the languages in the world's language, none is right now,
we know is any better than any other with respect to sort of optimizing dependency lengths,
for example, they're all kind of do it, do it well, they all keep low.
So I think of every human language is some kind of an sort of an optimization problem,
a complex optimization problem to this communication problem.
And so they've solved it, you know, they're just sort of noisy solutions
to this problem of communication.
There's just so many ways you can do this.
So they're not optimized for learning, they're probably less for communication.
And learning.
So yes, one of the factors which, yeah, so learning is messing this up a bit.
And so, so for example, if it were just about minimizing dependency lengths,
and that was all that matters, you know, then we, you know, so then we might find
grammars which didn't have regularity in their rules, but languages always have regularity
in their rules.
So what I mean by that is that if I wanted to say something to you in the optimal way to say it
was really matter to me, all that mattered was keeping the dependencies as close together as
possible, then I would have a very lax set of free structure or dependency rules.
It wouldn't have very many of those.
I would have very little of that.
And I would just put the words as close to the things that refer to the things that
are connected right beside each other.
But we don't do that.
Like there are word order rules, right?
So they're very, and depending on the language, they're more and less strict, right?
So you speak Russian, they're less strict than English.
English is very rigid word order rules.
We order things in a very particular way.
And so why do we do that?
That's probably not about communication.
That's probably about learning.
I mean, then we're talking about learning.
It's probably easier to learn regular things, things which are very predictable and easy to.
So that's probably about learning is our guess, because that can't be about communication.
Can it be just noise?
Can it be just the messiness of the development of a language?
Well, if it were just a communication, then we should have languages which have very,
very free word order.
And we don't have that.
We have free err, but not free.
Like there's always-
Well, no, but what I mean by noise is like cultural, like sticky cultural things,
like the way you communicate, just there's a stickiness to it.
That it's an imperfect, it's a noisy optimist.
Stochastic, the function over which you're optimizing is very noisy.
Because I don't, it feels weird to say that learning is part of the objective function,
because some languages are way harder to learn than others, right?
Or is that, that's not true.
That's interesting.
I mean, that's the public perception, right?
Yes, that's true for a second language.
For a second language.
But that depends on what you started with, right?
So it really depends on how close that second language is to the first language you've got.
And so, yes, it's very, very hard to learn Arabic if you've started with English,
or it's harder to learn Japanese, or if you've started with Chinese,
I think is the worst, in the, there's like Defense Language Institute in the United States
has like a list of how hard it is to learn what language from English.
I think Chinese is the worst.
But that's just a second language.
You're saying babies don't care.
No, there's no evidence that there's anything harder, easier about any baby,
any language learned, like by three or four, they speak that language.
And so there's no evidence of anything harder, easier about any human language.
They're all kind of equal.
To what degree is language, this is returning to Chomsky a little bit, is innate.
You said that for Chomsky, he used the idea that language is,
some aspects of language are innate to explain away certain things that are observed.
How much are we born with language at the core of our mind, brain?
I mean, I, you know, the answer is I don't know, of course.
But the, I mean, I like to, I'm an engineer at heart, I guess.
And I sort of think it's fine to postulate that a lot of it's learned.
And so I'm guessing that a lot of it's learned.
So I think the reason Chomsky went with the innateness
is because he hypothesized movement in his grammar.
He was interested in grammar and movement's hard to learn.
I think he's right.
Movement is a hard, it's a hard thing to learn to learn these two things together
and how they interact.
And there's like a lot of ways in which you might generate exactly the same sentences.
And it's like really hard.
And so he's like, oh, I guess it's learned.
Sorry, I guess it's not learned, it's innate.
And if you just throw out the movement and just think about that in a different way,
you know, then you, you get some messiness, but the messiness is human language,
which it's actually fits better.
It's that messiness isn't a problem.
It's actually a, it's a valuable asset of, of, of the theory.
And so, so I think I don't really see a reason to postulate much innate structure.
And that's kind of why I think these large language models are learning so well
is because I think you can learn the form, the forms of human language from the input.
I think that's like, it's likely to be true.
So that part of the brain that lights up when you're doing all the comprehension,
that could be learned.
That could be just, you don't need, you don't need any.
It doesn't have to be innate.
So like lots of stuff is modular in the brain that's learned.
It doesn't have to, you know, so there's something called the visual word form area
in the back.
And so it's in the back of your head near the, you know, the visual cortex.
Okay.
And that is very specialized language, sorry, very specialized brain area,
which does visual word processing if you read, if you're a reader.
Okay.
If you don't read, you don't have it.
Okay.
Guess what?
You spend some time learning to read and you develop that, that brain area,
which does exactly that.
And so these, the modularization is not evidence for innateness.
So the modularization of a language area, it doesn't mean we're born with it.
We could have easily learned that.
I, I, we might have been born with it.
I, I, we just, we just don't know at this point.
We might very well have been born with this left lateralized area.
I mean that there's like a lot of other interesting components here,
features of this kind of argument.
So some people get a stroke or something goes really wrong on the left side.
Where are the left, where the language area would be?
And that, and that isn't there.
It's not, not available.
And it develops just fine on the right.
And so it's no lie.
So it's not about the left.
It goes to the left.
Like this is a very interesting question.
It's like, why is the, why are any of the brain areas the way that they are?
And how, how, how did they come to be that way?
And, you know, there's these natural experiments which happen where people get these,
you know, strange events in their brains at very young ages,
which wipe out sections of their brain and, and they behave totally normally.
And no one knows anything was wrong.
And we find out later, because they happen to be accidentally scanned for some reason.
It's like, what, what happened to your left hemisphere?
It's missing.
There's not many people who have missed their whole left hemisphere,
but they'll be missing some other section of their left or their right.
And they behave absolutely normally, we'd never know.
So that's like a very interesting, you know, current research.
You know, this is another project that this person in Federico is working on.
She's got all these people contacting her because she's scanned some people
who have been missing sections.
One person missing, missed a section of her brain and was scanned in her lab.
And she, and she happened to be a writer for the New York Times.
And there was an article in New York Times about, about the,
just about the scanning procedure and, and about what might be learned about by sort of
the general process of MRI and language and, and that's her language.
And, and because she's writing for the New York Times,
then she, all these people started writing to her who also have similar,
similar kinds of deficits because they've been, you know, accidentally,
you know, to scan for some reason and, and found out they're missing some section.
And they, and they say they volunteer to be scanned.
So these are natural experiments.
Natural experiments.
They're kind of messy, but natural experiments, kind of cool.
She calls them interesting brains.
The first few hours, days, months of human life are fascinating.
It's like, well, inside the womb actually, like that development.
That machinery, whatever that is, seems to create powerful humans that are able to
speak, comprehend, think, all that kind of stuff, no matter what happened,
not no matter what, but robust to the different ways that the, the, the brain might be damaged
and so on. That's really, that's really interesting.
But what would Chomsky say about the fact, the thing you're saying now that languages
is, seems to be happening separate from thought?
Because as far as I understand, maybe you can correct me.
He thought that language underpins.
Yeah. He thinks so. I don't know what he'd say.
He would be surprised because for him, the idea is that language
is the sort of the foundation of thought.
That's right. Absolutely.
And it's pretty mind-blowing to think that it could be completely separate from thought.
That's right. But so, you know, he's basically a philosopher,
philosopher of language in a way, thinking about these things.
It's a fine thought. You can't test it in his methods.
You can't do a thought experiment to figure that out.
You need a scanner. You need brain damage people.
You need something. You need ways to, to measure that.
And that's what, you know, FMRI offers as a, and, and, you know,
patients are a little messier. FMRI is pretty unambiguous, I'd say.
It's like very unambiguous.
There's no way to say that the language network is doing any of these tasks.
There's, like, you, you should look at those data.
It's like, there's no chance that you can say that there,
those networks are overlapping.
They're not overlapping. They're just like completely different.
And so, you know, so the, you know, you can always make, you know,
it's only two people. It's four people or something for the, the patients.
And there's something special about them we don't know.
But these are just random people and, and with lots of them,
and you find always the same effects.
And it's very robust, I'd say.
What's a fascinating effect?
What's the, you mentioned Bolivia.
What's the connection between culture and language?
You've, you've also mentioned that, you know, much of our study of language comes from
W-E-I-R-D, weird people, western educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic.
So when you study, like, remote cultures, such as around the Amazon jungle,
what can you learn about language?
So that term weird is from Joe Henrich.
He's at Harvard. He's a Harvard evolutionary biologist.
And so he works on lots of different topics.
And he basically was pushing that observation that we should be careful
about the inferences we want to make when we're talking in psychology or
social, yeah, mostly in psychology, I guess, about humans if we're talking about,
you know, undergrads at MIT and Harvard.
Those aren't the same, right?
These aren't the same things.
And so if you want to make inferences about language, for instance,
there's a lot of very, a lot of other kinds of languages in the world,
then English and French and Chinese.
And so maybe for language, we care about how culture, because cultures can be very,
I mean, of course, English and Chinese cultures are very different,
but hunter-gatherers are much more different in some ways.
And so if culture has an effect on what language is,
then we kind of want to look there as well as looking.
It's not like the industrialized cultures aren't interesting, of course they are,
but we want to look at non-industrialized cultures as well.
And so I've worked with two.
I've worked with the Chimani, which are in Bolivia and Amazon,
both in the Amazon in these cases.
And there are so-called farmer foragers, which is not hunter-gatherers.
It's sort of one up from hunter-gatherers in that they do a little bit of farming as well,
a lot of hunting as well, but a little bit of farming.
And the kind of farming they do is the kind of farming that I might do
if I ever were to grow tomatoes or something in my backyard.
So it's not like big field farming, it's just a farming for a family,
a few things you do that.
And so that's what that's the kind of farming they do.
And the other group I've worked with are the Pirahá,
which are also in the Amazon and happen to be in Brazil.
And that's with a guy called Dan Everett,
who is a linguist anthropologist who actually lived and worked in the,
I mean, he was a missionary actually, initially back in the 70s,
working with, trying to translate languages so they could teach them the Bible,
teach them Christianity.
What can you say about that?
Yeah, so the two groups I've worked with, the Cimani and the Pirahá,
both isolate languages, meaning there's no known connected languages at all,
they're just like on their own.
Oh, cool.
Yeah, there's a lot of those.
And most of the isolates occur in the Amazon or in Papua New Guinea,
in these places where the world has sort of stayed still for long enough.
And they're half, like, so there aren't earthquakes,
there aren't, well, certainly no earthquakes in the Amazon jungle.
And the climate isn't bad, so you don't have droughts.
And so, you know, in Africa, you've got a lot of moving of people
because there's drought problems.
And so they get a lot of language contact when you have,
when people have to, you've got to move because you've got no water,
then you've got to get going.
And then you run into contact with other tribes, other groups.
In the Amazon, that's not the case.
And so people can stay there for hundreds and hundreds and probably thousands of years,
I guess.
And so these groups have, and the Cimani and the Pirahá are both isolates in that,
and they just, I guess they've just lived there for ages and ages,
with minimal contact with other outside groups.
And so, I mean, I'm interested in them because they are,
I mean, you know, in these cases, I'm interested in their words.
I would love to study their syntax, their orders of words,
but I'm mostly just interested in how languages, you know,
are connected to their cultures in this way.
And so with the Pirahá, the most interesting,
I was working on number there, number information.
And so the basic idea is I think language is invented.
That's what I get from the words here is that I think language is invented.
We talked about color earlier.
It's the same idea.
So that what you need to talk about with someone else
is what you're going to invent words for.
And so we invent labels for colors that I need,
not that I can see, but that things I need to tell you about
so that I can get objects from you or get you to give me the right objects.
And I just don't need a word for teal or a word for aquamarine
in the Amazon jungle for the most part,
because I don't have two things which differ on those colors.
I just don't have that.
And so numbers are really another fascinating source of information here,
where naively, I certainly thought that all humans
would have words for exact counting, and the Pirahá don't.
Okay, so they don't have any words for even one.
There's not a word for one in their language.
And so there's certainly not a word for two, three, or four.
So that kind of blows people's minds off.
Yeah, that's blowing my mind.
That's pretty weird.
How are you going to ask?
I want two of those.
You just don't.
And so that's just not a thing you can possibly ask in the Pirahá.
It's not possible.
That is, there's no words for that.
So here's how we found this out.
Okay, so it was thought to be a one, two, many language.
There are three words, four quantifiers for sets,
but people had thought that those meant one, two, and many.
But what they really mean is few, some, and many.
Many is correct.
It's few, some, and many.
And so the way we figured this out, and this is kind of cool,
is that we gave people, we had a set of objects.
Okay, and these are having to be spools of thread.
Doesn't really matter what they are.
Identical objects.
And I sort of start off here.
I just give you one of those and say, what's that?
Okay, so you're a Pirahá speaker, and you tell me what it is.
And then I give you two and say, what's that?
And nothing's changing in this set except for the number.
Okay, and then I just ask you to label these things.
We just do this for a bunch of different people.
And frankly, I did this task.
Just facet.
And it's a little bit weird.
So they say the word that we thought was one, it's few,
but for the first one.
And then maybe they say few, or maybe they say some for the second.
And then for the third or the fourth,
they start using the word many for the set.
And then five, six, seven, eight.
I go all the way to 10.
And it's always the same word.
And they look at me like I'm stupid
because they told me what the word was for six, seven, eight.
And I'm going to continue asking them at nine and 10.
I'm sorry, I just, I just,
they understand that I want to know their language.
That's the point of the task is like I'm trying to learn their language.
And so that's okay.
But it does seem like I'm a little slow
because they already told me what the word for many was, five, six, seven.
And I keep asking.
So it's a little funny to do this task over and over.
We did this with a guy called, Dan was our translator.
He's the only one who really speaks Piraha fluently.
He's a good bilingual for a bunch of languages,
but also English and Piraha.
And then a guy called Mike Frank was also a student with me down there.
He and I did these things.
And so you do that.
Okay.
And everyone does the same thing.
All, all, all, you know, we asked like 10 people
and they all do exactly the same labeling for one up.
And then we just do the same thing down on like random order.
Actually, we do some of them up, some of them down first.
Okay.
And so we do instead of one to 10, we do 10 down to one.
And so, so I give them 10, nine and eight.
They start saying the word for some.
And then at down, when you get to four,
everyone is saying the word for few, which we thought was one.
So it's like, it's the context determined what word,
what, what, what that quantifier they used was.
So it's not a count word.
They're not, they're not count words.
They're, they're just approximate words.
And they're going to be noisy when you interview a bunch of people,
the, what the definition of few and there's going to be a threshold in the context.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Context.
Yeah.
I don't know what that means.
That's, that's going to be 10 on the context.
I think it's true in English too, right?
If you ask an English person what a few is,
I mean, that's dependent completely on the context.
And that might actually be at first hard to discover.
Yeah.
Because for a lot of people, the jump from one to two will be few.
Right.
So it's a jump.
Yeah.
It might be still be there.
Yeah.
Like it's, I mean, that's fascinating.
That's fascinating that numbers don't present themselves.
Yeah.
So the words aren't there.
And then, and so then we do these other things.
Well, if, if they don't have the words,
can they do exact matching kinds of tasks?
Can they even do those tasks?
And, and, and the answer is sort of yes and no.
And so yes, they can do them.
So here's the tasks that we did.
We put out those spools of thread again.
Okay.
So maybe I put like three out here and then we gave them some objects.
And those happen to be uninflated red balloons.
It doesn't really matter what they are.
It's just a bunch of exactly the same thing.
And it was easy to put down right next to these spools of thread.
Okay.
And so then I put out three of these.
And your task was to just put one against each of my three things.
And they could do that perfectly.
So I mean, I would actually do that.
It was a very easy task to explain to them because I have,
I did this with this guy, Mike Frank, and he would be my,
I'd be the experimenter telling him to do this and showing him to do this.
And then we just like, just do what he did.
You'll copy him.
All we had to, I didn't have to speak to him,
except for know what copy him, like do what he did is like,
all we had to be able to say.
And then they would do that just perfectly.
And so we'd move it up.
We do some sort of random number of items up to 10.
And they basically do perfectly on that.
They never get that wrong.
I mean, that's not a counting task, right?
That is just a match.
You just put one against them.
It doesn't matter how many,
I don't need to know how many there are there to do that correctly.
And they would make mistakes, but very, very few.
And no more than MIT undergrads.
Just going to say, like there's no, these are low stakes.
So, you know, you make mistakes.
Counting is not required to complete the matching task.
That's right. Not at all.
Okay. And so, and so that's our control.
And this guy, I had gone down there before
and said that they couldn't do this task,
but I just don't know what he did wrong there
because they can do this task perfectly well.
And, you know, I can, can train my dog to do this task.
So of course they can do this task.
And so, you know, it's not a hard task,
but the other task that was sort of more interesting is like,
so then we do a bunch of tasks where you need some way to encode the set.
So like one of them is just, I just put a opaque sheet
in front of the, of the things I put down a bunch of set of these things
and I put an opaque sheet down.
And so you can't see them anymore.
And I tell you, do the same thing you were doing before, right?
You know, and it's easy if it's two or three, it's very easy.
But if I don't have the words for eight, it's a little harder.
Like maybe, you know, with practice went, well, no.
Because you have to count.
For us, it's easy because we just, we just count them.
It's just so easy to count them.
But, but they don't, they can't count them because they don't count.
They don't have words for this thing.
And so they would do approximate.
It's totally fascinating.
So they would get them approximately right, you know, after four or five.
You know, because you can basically always get four right,
three or four that looks, that's something we can visually see.
But, but after that, you kind of have, it's an approximate number.
And so then, and there's a bunch of tasks we did, and they all failed as, I mean, failed.
They did approximate after five on all those tasks.
And it kind of shows that the words, you kind of need the words, you know,
to be able to do these, these kinds of tasks.
There's a little bit of a chicken and egg thing there.
Because if you don't have the words, then maybe they'll limit you in the kind of,
like a little baby Einstein there.
Won't be able to come up with a counting task.
You know what I mean?
Like the ability to count enables you to come up with interesting things probably.
So yes, you develop counting because you need it.
But then once you have counting, you can probably come up with a bunch of different inventions.
Like how to, I don't know, what kind of thing they do matching really well for building purposes,
building some kind of hut or something like this.
So it's interesting that language is a limiter on what you're able to do.
Yeah.
Well, here language is just, is the words.
Here is the words.
Like the words for exact count is the limiting factor here.
They just don't have them.
Yeah.
And this, yeah.
Well, that's what I mean.
The limit, that limit is also a limit on the society of what they're able to build.
That's going to be true.
Yeah.
So it's problem, I mean, we don't know, this is one of those problems with the snapshot of just
current languages is that we don't know what causes a culture to discover slash invent
accounting system.
But the hypothesis is the guess out there is something to do with farming.
So if you have a bunch of goats and you want to keep track of them,
and you save 17 goats and you go to bed at night and you get up in the morning,
boy, it's easier to have a count system to do that.
You know, that's an abstract abstraction over a set.
So they don't have, like people often ask me when I talk to them about this kind of work,
and they say, well, don't these, Peter, huh, don't they have kids?
Don't they have a lot of children?
I'm like, yeah, they have a lot of children.
And they do.
They often have families of three or four or five kids.
And they go, well, don't they need the numbers to keep track of their kids?
And I always ask the person who says this, like, do you have children?
And the answer is always no, because that's not how you keep track of your kids.
You care about their identities.
It's very important to me when I go, I think I have five children.
It's, it's, it doesn't matter which, yeah, it matters which five.
If you replaced one with someone else, I would, I would care.
Goat maybe not, right?
That's the kind of point.
It's an abstraction.
Something that looks very similar to the one wouldn't matter to me, probably.
But if you care about goats, you're going to know them actually individually also.
Yeah, you will.
I mean, cows and goats, if there's a source of food and milk and all that kind of stuff,
you're going to actually really, really care.
But I'm saying it is an abstraction such that you don't have to care about their identities
to do this thing fast.
That's, that's the hypothesis, not mine.
From anthropologists are guessing about where words for counting came from is from farming, maybe.
Yeah.
Do you have a sense why universal languages like Esperanto have not taken off?
Like, why do we have all these different languages?
Well, my guess is the function of a language is to do something in a community.
And, and I mean, unless there's some function to that language in the community,
it's not going to survive.
It's not going to be useful.
So here's a great example.
So whatever, like language, death is super common.
Okay.
Languages are dying all around the world.
And here's how, here's why they're dying.
And it's like, yeah, I see this in, you know, in, it's not happening right now in either the
Chamonix or the, or the Piedoha, but it probably will.
And so there's a neighboring group called Mostitan, which is, I, I, I, I said that it's
a Isola.
It's actually, there's a dual.
There's two of them.
Okay.
So it's actually, there's two languages, which are really close, which are Mostitan and,
and Chamonix, which are unrelated to anything else.
And Mostitan is unlike Chamonix in that it has a lot of contact with Spanish and it's dying.
So that language is dying.
The reason it's dying is there's not a lot of value for the local people in their native language.
So there's much more value in knowing Spanish, like because they want to feed their families.
And how do you feed your family?
You learn Spanish so you can make money so you can get a job and do these things.
And then you can, and then you make money.
And so they want Spanish things they want.
And so, so Mostitan is in danger and is dying and that's normal.
And so basically the problem is that people, the reason we learn languages to communicate
and we need to, we use it to, to make money and to do whatever it is to feed our families.
And if that's not happening, then it won't take off.
It's not like a game or something.
This is like something we use.
Like why is English so popular?
It's, it's not because it's an easy language to learn.
Maybe it is.
I don't really know.
It's, but that's not why it's popular.
But because it's a gigantic, the United States is a gigantic economy.
And therefore-
It's big economies that do this.
It's all it is.
It's all about money.
And that's what, and so, you know, there's a motivation to learn Mandarin.
There's a motivation to learn Spanish.
There's a motivation to learn English.
These languages are very valuable to know because there's so, so many speakers all over the world.
That's fascinating.
There's less of a value economically.
It's like kind of what drives this.
It's not a, but it's not a, you know, it's not just for fun.
I mean, there are these groups that do want to learn language just for language's sake.
And they want, and then, and there's something, you know, to that.
But those are rare, those are rarities in general.
Those are a few small groups that do that.
Not most people don't do that.
Well, if that was a primary driver, then everybody was speaking English or speaking one language.
There's also a tension.
That's happening.
Well, we're moving towards fewer and fewer languages.
We are.
I wonder if you're right.
Maybe, maybe, you know, this is slow, but maybe that's where we're moving.
But there is a tension.
You're saying a language that defringes.
But if you look at geopolitics and superpowers, it does seem that there's another thing in
tension, which is a language is a national identity sometimes for certain nations.
I mean, that's the war in Ukraine, language, Ukrainian language is a symbol of that war
in many ways, like a country fighting for its own identity.
So it's not merely the convenience.
I mean, those two things that are a tension is the convenience of trade and the economics
and be able to communicate with neighboring countries and trade more efficiently with
neighboring countries, all that kind of stuff, but also identity of the group.
I completely agree.
This language is the way, for every community, like dialects that emerge are a kind of identity
for people.
And sometimes a way for people to say FU to the more powerful people.
That's interesting.
So in that way, language can't be used as that tool.
Yeah, I completely agree.
And there's a lot of work to try to create that identity.
So people want to do that as a cognitive scientist and language expert.
I hope that continues because I don't want languages to die.
I want languages to survive because they're so interesting for so many reasons.
But I mean, I find them fascinating just for the language part, but I think there's a lot
of connections to culture as well, which is also very important.
Do you have hope for machine translation that can break down the barriers of language?
So while all these different diverse languages exist, I guess there's many ways of asking
this question, but basically, how hard is it to translate in an automated way for one
language to another?
There's going to be cases where it's going to be really hard, right?
So there are concepts that are in one language and not in another, like the most extreme
kinds of cases are these cases of number information.
So good luck translating a lot of English into Piraha.
It's just impossible.
There's no way to do it because there are no words for these concepts that we're talking about.
There's probably the flip side, right?
There's probably stuff in Piraha, which is going to be hard to translate into English
on the other side.
And so I just don't know what those concepts are.
I mean, the world space is different from my world space.
So the things they talk about, it's going to have to do with their life as opposed to
my industrial life, which is going to be different.
And so there's going to be problems like that always.
Maybe it's not so bad in the case of some of these spaces, and maybe it's going to be harder
than others.
And so it's pretty bad in number.
It's like extreme, I'd say, in the exact number space.
But in the color dimension, right?
So that's not so bad.
I mean, but it's a problem that you don't have ways to talk about the concepts.
And there might be entire concepts that are missing.
So to you, it's more about the space of concept versus the space of form.
Like form, you can probably map.
Yes.
Yeah.
But so you were talking earlier about translation and about how translations,
there's good and bad translations.
I mean, now we're talking about translations of form, right?
So what makes writing good, right?
There's a music to the form.
Right.
It's not just the content.
It's how it's written.
And translating that, that sounds difficult.
We should say that there is like, I don't hesitate to say meaning, but there's a music
and a rhythm to the form.
When you look at the broad picture, like the Fritz Wietzi and Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy,
or Hemingway, Bukowski, James Joyce, like I mentioned, there's a beat to it.
There's an edge to it that is in the form.
We can probably get measures of those.
Yeah.
I don't know.
That's interesting.
I'm optimistic that we could get measures of those things.
And so maybe that's...
Translatable.
I don't know.
I don't know though.
I have not worked on that.
I would love to see.
That sounds totally fascinating.
Translation to Hemingway is probably the lowest...
I would love to see different authors, but the average per sentence dependency length
for Hemingway is probably the shortest.
That's your sense, huh?
It's simple sentences.
Simple sentences.
Short, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, that's when...
If you have really long sentences, even if they don't have center embedding, like...
They can have longer connections, yeah.
They can have longer connections.
They don't have to.
You can't have a long, long sentence with a bunch of local words.
But it is much more likely to have the possibility of long dependencies with long sentences, yeah.
I met a guy named Azar Askin who does a lot of cool stuff.
Really brilliant.
He works with Tristan Harris and a bunch of stuff.
But he was talking to me about communicating with animals.
He co-founded Earth Species Project where you're trying to find the common language
between whales, crows, and humans.
And he was saying that there's a lot of promising work,
that even though the signals are very different,
like the actual...
If you have embeddings of the languages,
they're actually trying to communicate similar type things.
Is there something you can comment on that?
Is there a promise to that in everything you've seen in different cultures,
especially like remote cultures, that this is a possibility?
No.
Like we can talk to whales?
I would say yes.
I think it's not crazy at all.
I think it's quite reasonable.
But there's this sort of weird view...
Well, odd view, I think, that to think that human language is somehow special.
I mean, it is...
Maybe it is.
We can certainly do more than any of the other species.
You know, and maybe our language system is part of that.
It's possible.
But people have often talked about how human...
Like Chomsky, in fact, has talked about how human language has
this compositionality thing that he thinks is sort of key in language.
And the problem with that argument is he doesn't speak whale.
And he doesn't speak crow, and he doesn't speak monkey.
They say things like, well, they're making a bunch of grunts and squeaks.
And the reasoning is like, that's bad reasoning.
I'm pretty sure if you asked a whale what we're saying, they'd say,
well, I'm making a bunch of weird noises.
Exactly.
And so it's like, this is a very odd reasoning to be making, that human language is special
because we're the only ones who have human language.
I'm like, well, we don't know what those other...
We just don't...
We can't talk to them yet.
And so there are probably a signal in there, and it might very well be
something complicated like human language.
I mean, sure, with a small brain, in lower species,
there's probably not a very good communication system,
but in these higher species where you have what seems to be
abilities to communicate something, there might very well be a lot more signal there
than we might have otherwise thought.
But also if we have a lot of intellectual humility here,
there's somebody formerly from MIT, Neri Oxman, who I admire very much,
has talked a lot about, has worked on communicating with plants.
So like, yes, the signal there is even less than...
But like, it's not out of the realm of possibility that all nature has a way of communicating.
And it's a very different language, but they do develop a kind of language through the chemistry,
through some way of communicating with each other.
And if you have enough humility about that possibility, I think you can...
I think it would be a very interesting, in a few decades, maybe centuries, hopefully not,
a humbling possibility of being able to communicate not just between humans,
effectively, but between all of living things on Earth.
Well, I mean, I think some of them are not going to have much interesting to say,
but some of them will.
We don't know.
We certainly don't know.
I think if we're humble, there could be some interesting trees out there.
Well, they're probably talking to other trees, right?
They're not talking to us.
And so to the extent they're talking, they're saying something interesting to some other
conspecific, as opposed to us, right?
And so there may be some signal there.
So there are people out there, actually, it's pretty common to say that human language is special
and different from any other animal communication system.
And I just don't think the evidence is there for that claim.
I think it's not obvious.
We just don't know, because we don't speak these other communication systems until we get better.
I do think there are people working on that, as you pointed out,
though people working on whale speak, for instance.
That's really fascinating.
Let me ask you a wild, out-there, sci-fi question.
If we make contact with an intelligent alien civilization and you get to meet them,
how hard do you think it would be?
Like how surprised would you be about their way of communicating?
Do you think it would be recognizable?
Maybe there's some parallels here when you go to the remote tribes.
I mean, I would want Dan Everett with me.
He is amazing at learning foreign languages.
And so this is an amazing feat, right, to be able to go.
This is a language, which has no translators before him.
Oh, wow.
He just shows up.
Well, there was a guy that had been there before, but he wasn't very good.
And so he learned the language far better than anyone else had learned before him.
He's good at, he's just a very social person.
I think that's a big part of it, is being able to interact.
So I don't know, it kind of depends on this species from outer space,
how much they want to talk to us.
Is there something you can say about the process he follows?
How do you show up to a tribe and socialize?
I mean, I guess colors and counting is one of the most basic things to figure out.
Yeah, you start that.
You actually start with objects and just throw a stick down and say stick.
And then you say, what do you call this?
And then they'll say the word, whatever.
And he says, the standard thing to do is to throw two sticks at two sticks.
And then he learned pretty quick that there weren't any count words in this language
because they didn't know this wasn't interesting.
I mean, it was kind of weird.
They'd say some or something, the same word over and over again.
But that is a standard thing.
You just like try to, but you have to be pretty out there socially,
like willing to talk to random people, which these are really very different people from you.
And he was, and he's very social.
And so I think that's a big part of this, is like, that's how a lot of people
know a lot of languages as they're willing to talk to other people.
That's a tough one.
We just show up knowing nothing.
Yeah. Oh, God.
It's beautiful that humans are able to connect in that way.
Yeah. Yeah.
You've had an incredible career exploring this fascinating topic.
What advice would you give to young people about how to have a career like that
or a life that they can be proud of?
When you see something interesting, just go and do it.
Like I do, I do that.
Like that's something I do, which is kind of unusual for most people.
So like when I saw the, like if Peter and I was available to go and visit,
I was like, yes, yes, I'll go.
And then when we couldn't go back, we had some trouble with the
Brazilian government.
There's some corrupt people there.
It was very difficult to go back in there.
And so I was like, all right, I got to find another group.
And so we searched around and we were able to find the,
because I wanted to keep working on this kind of problem.
And so we found the Chimani and just go there.
I didn't really have, we didn't have contact.
We had a little bit of contact and brought someone.
And that was, you know, we just kind of just try things.
I say it's like, a lot of that just like ambition, just try to do something
that other people haven't done, just give it a shot is what I,
I mean, I do that all the time.
I don't know.
I love it.
And I love the fact that your pursuit of fun has landed you here talking to me.
This was an incredible conversation that you're,
you're just a fascinating human being.
Thank you for taking a journey through human language with me today.
This is awesome.
Thank you very much, Lex.
It's been a pleasure.
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Edward Gibson
to support this podcast.
Please check out our sponsors in the description.
And now let me leave you with some words from Wittgenstein.
The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
