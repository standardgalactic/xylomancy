Here we have the graph of sine of sine x plus cosine y equals cosine of sine x y plus cosine x.
And although it looks crazy, it actually has some interesting applications.
No, I'm just kidding. Or maybe I'm not. But as far as I know, I'm just kidding.
Now, the reason I'm showing this is really because it's funny.
And the only reason I was able to find this curve was because it was in a book called Curse
for the Mathematically Curious, which is a more technical book, but for the math enthusiasts,
you may enjoy it. Anyways, several curves and mathematics do have applications.
I'll get to more advanced ones later. But we learned several of these in high school, right?
Like parabolas or sinusoid or logarithms and more like that. But often just any randomly picked curve
doesn't really have applications or at least not obvious ones. It just looks pretty or cool
or really weird. Or it has some unique property. For example, take the wirestross function.
I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. This is a curve that's continuous everywhere,
but differentiable nowhere. If you've taken calculus, you know a curve like this with a sharp
corner or one with a cusp is continuous, but not differentiable at that sharp point.
Well, this function is continuous. There are no holes or breaks anywhere,
but again, differentiable nowhere. So you can kind of say it's infinitely jagged.
And if you zoom in, you see it behaves like a fractal.
This isn't super applicable, but it was the first function discovered to have this continuous
everywhere, differentiable nowhere property. Even less useful though is the Einstein curve.
It's a very simple set of parametric equations. I'm sure everyone can understand this.
And what you get when you plot it is Einstein. I just found this on Wolfram Alpha,
but the fact that even a computer could determine this is quite impressive.
And they have more like the Santa curve or the warrior pose yoga curve and so on.
So not very applicable, but definitely artistic. However, there is a kind of curve that has
applications when it comes to art, like Photoshop and video editing software,
more like that. And those would be Bezier curves. Now this is an entire family of curves that's
found based on a certain number of control points. For example, with two control points,
we can construct a linear Bezier curve, which isn't too exciting. But with three control
points, we can make a quadratic Bezier as follows. First, imagine two extra points moving from one
to two and then two to three respectively in the same amount of time. Those spinning numbers are
basically percentages of the completed path and they always match. Now I'm going to do the same
thing again, but add in a third dot that moves along that purple connecting line from one end
to the other, also in the same amount of time. The path that dot traces out is a quadratic Bezier
curve. Then for a cubic Bezier, you need four control points with a bunch of other connecting
points slash lines that follow. This then continues to higher order curves, which I won't show.
And it does just take watching these a few times to see how they work credit to Jason
Davies for coding this by the way, very useful. One thing to notice is that the location of the
control points determines what the curves will look like entirely. And also in most cases,
the curves in red don't touch every single one of those control points like this one for that
quadratic Bezier. Now if we have these four points, the associated cubic Bezier curve would be this
here. It might not touch points two and three. However, if we draw tangent lines just at the ends
here, then those will always intersect some other points. And this makes it a little easier to predict
the look of these curves because if I move one point around, then we still get that same behavior.
Taking this to computer graphics in Premiere Pro when I use the pen tool and just click two points,
then I get a linear Bezier curve. But instead, if I click once and then click and drag a second time,
I get a quadratic Bezier, which is defined by these three points. No, that fourth one doesn't do
anything yet. And then I can adjust the shape however I want. But that fourth point does come
in when I click and hold again, because now we get a cubic Bezier curve defined by these four points.
So what we have here is a quadratic attached to a completely separate cubic Bezier curve,
kind of like a piecewise function. These two points are thus for two totally different curves.
But by forcing them to both be on this tangent line and move together, then we don't have to
worry about a corner here. It'll always be smooth. And believe it or not, cubics and quadratics are
the main curves you'll see in computer graphics. Connecting them together over and over allows
for much more complex shapes. And since a Bezier curve is defined by the location of those control
points, placing them strategically allows us to create basically whatever we want. And yes,
this is used to create fonts, computer graphics and more. That might have been a new type of curve
for some of you, but this next one will probably be more familiar. And that's the Lemniscate,
although you've probably never seen it like this. The Lemniscate is basically a figure eight,
but here we have a specific kind called the Lemniscate of Bernoulli. It has two focus points,
and mathematically this is defined as all the points where if you take the distance from each
focus and multiply those values together, you get some constant, regardless of where you are on the
curve. But you can also make the shape like this. First, we attach a rod from the left focus to
zero comma one, then from there to zero comma negative one, and from there to the other focus
to get this linkage here. Now imagine the focus points are pinned, they cannot move, but the
other joints can. Since the rods are rigid, then this one can only move along this circle that goes
off screen, and this other one can only move along this circle. Now if you put a dot in the
center of that yellow rod and allow everything to rotate, that dot will sweep out the Lemniscate of
Bernoulli. This is common in robotics, for example, to look at all the connections and see what path
is swept out by some point. And one famous example of this is Watts linkage. Here's the animation
you'd find on Wikipedia. The configuration consists of three rods, and with this setup,
the center point can only move in a nearly straight line up and down. This was actually
used in Watts pattern for the steam engine in the late 1700s, and still this day the linkage
applies to suspensions for different types of vehicles to ensure there's no horizontal motion.
Now another curve you can create with something physical is the cycloid,
as this is the path that one point on a wheel traces out. I'm sure many of you know where this
is going, but this relates to the Barquester Crone curve. This curve answers the question of,
given two points at different heights, what shape slide, with no friction,
minimizes the time it takes for an object to slide from point A to point B? Naturally many
people say the shortest path or a straight line, but that's not the answer here. Even putting a
straight drop in the beginning, which does increase length, actually reduces time. But the absolute
minimum time comes when you take a piece of that cycloid, flip it upside down, and make it bigger
here, and use that as the slide. That shape will win every single time. Now this is derived
through something called the calculus of variations. In calculus one you learn how to find points that
have maximum or minimum y values, where if you just move a bit in any direction from that spot,
the y value in this case decreases. Well calculus of variations is used when you need to find entire
curves that have an optimal something. That something could be distance, where this straight
line is a minimum, or it could also be time where the Barquester Crone curve is a minimum.
And if you wiggle that curve in any way, the associated time would guaranteed go up,
meaning the original curve is in fact the minimum. But it's not just time and distance
you can optimize. For example, take the catenary curve. I've talked about this before, but still
real quick. If you asked a typical high school student what shape this makes when you have a
cable hung from two fixed points, I think most of them would say a parabola, and that's very close.
But this actually is a catenary curve whose equation is this here. Now how this is derived
is through the calculus of variations, and that's because this minimizes something,
and that something is potential energy. I forgot to explicitly state this, but since
potential energy is a function of height, then minimizing this essentially means a cable wants
to quote hang the lowest. Okay, now back in. So if you took these two fixed points and drew
every single curve of this length, the length of the cable, or at least the part between these two
points, and drew every curve with that length going from here to here, and added up all their
potential energies at every little point, they would all have some value. But this, this catenary
curve is the one that has the minimum value, and that is the shape that the cable takes.
Besides just hanging cables, the catenary curve is seen in architecture, for example,
because of the structural properties that it offers. Now where a regular parabola does show
up is when you throw an object through the air, at least near the surface of the earth.
But what's cool is even this minimizes something that can be found with the calculus of variations.
It's not obvious at all, but it turns out if you find the kinetic energy or one half mv squared
at some point, and the potential energy mgh, then subtract them, and do that for every point
along the curve, and add or really integrate the results, that value will be a minimum for this
parabolic curve. You could do the same thing for every curve that could possibly exist between
points a and b, and assuming the total time is the same for all of them, if you added up all the
kinetic minus potential energies at every point, the minimum sum would be for the parabola, which
is the path the object takes. It's you a totally different way to think about motion rather than
f equals ma. Now the shortest distance between two points on some surface has a more specific name
actually, and that's a geodesic, which isn't usually very simple to find. If I asked you to
find the shortest path from point a to point b, that's not too exciting because it's obviously a
straight line, but that simplicity goes away when you have curve surfaces. So now I can't really
curve this that well, but here curve surface, if you want to find the shortest path or the geodesic
from point a to point b, requiring that you have to move along the paper, how would we find that?
Well, that isn't super easy to do, however, in this case it is, because that geodesic path is
going to be the exact same thing. And the reason for that is geodesics are preserved under certain
smooth transformations. So because I knew this was the shortest path, straight line of course,
then I know no matter how I deformed this, this is still going to be the shortest path from point
a to point b. And I also discussed in a previous video with my candy oatmeal that you can wrap a
piece of paper around a cylinder without having any distortion or crumpling or anything like that.
So if I wanted to find, hey, what's the shortest path from point a to point b,
moving along the cylinder, it's going to be the spiral that moves along the side here.
And that's because again, I knew this was the shortest path. This is a smooth transformation,
which preserves the geodesic. Therefore, this is still the shortest path.
And again, it's not easy to find these in general, but this was a big part of Einstein's
general theory of relativity, because photons, for example, travel along geodesic curves in spacetime.
Now on top of what we've seen so far, there are several other famous curves out there, some applied
and some just interesting, but might have to save those for another time. For those who want to
continue learning about how math applies to the real world, though, I recommend checking out

what we saw here is the secret life of chaos, which explores the mathematics of, of course, chaos
theory. This goes into detail about some of the patterns that appear in nature as well as mathematics
