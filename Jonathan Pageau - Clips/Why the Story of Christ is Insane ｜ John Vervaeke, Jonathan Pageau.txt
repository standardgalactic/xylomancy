If you actually look at the story of Jesus, it's an insane story, because even if you know
traditional storytelling, it's like you don't have stories where someone is like a warrior,
and a king, and a shepherd, and a worker, and a monk, and he's like all these categories jammed
into this one story. Like this doesn't make sense, but that's the point. Grab all these story structures,
these aspects of the gods. It's interesting because a lot of the people that have tried
to criticize Christianity will say, well, Jesus is just a copy on all these old gods,
and it's like, yeah, I mean all of them? Like every single one of them? Like he's all these
weird things that would never for a pagan be brought together, and so it's like that's it. So
it's like you look at the image of that person on the throne, and it's like it's that that condensation.
And then that person, he is the source, but he also ends up being the judge, because he's the
standard by which all the multiple aspects get compared to or the through line, the through
line.
