1. **Sine in the Second Quadrant**: In the second quadrant, the x-coordinate is negative. Therefore, for an angle whose sine value you're evaluating lies in the second quadrant, you would take the positive square root of 1 minus the cosine squared (since cosine is positive in the second quadrant). For our specific example, the angle has a reference angle of 3 pi/2, and since it's in the second quadrant, the sine would be the negative square root of 2 over 2.

2. **Cosine in the Second Quadrant**: The x-coordinate is negative in the second quadrant. For our specific example, the angle has a reference angle of 3 pi/2, and since it's in the second quadrant, the cosine would be the positive square root of 1 minus the sine squared (since sine is negative in the second quadrant). For our specific example, the cosine would be the positive square root of 1 over 2.

3. **Tangent of a Coterminal Angle**: When dealing with coterminal angles, remember that adding or subtracting 2 pi makes the angles coterminal. In the case of tangent for an angle at 15 pi/6 (or 3 pi/2), you can find a coterminal angle between 0 and 2 pi (in this case, it's simply 2 pi/6 or pi/3) and then evaluate the tangent of that coterminal angle. Since the angle lies in the first quadrant, where both x and y are positive, you can find the slope of the line from the point (1, 0.5) to the x-axis, which is the tangent value. For our specific example, the tangent of pi/2 is undefined because the point lies on the y-axis, where x is 0 and y is nonzero.

In summary, when evaluating trigonometric functions for angles not in the first quadrant, remember to use the sign of the coordinates from the unit circle based on the quadrant the angle is in, and for coterminal angles, adjust the angle to be between 0 and 2 pi before evaluation. Always refer back to the reference angle in the first quadrant to find the correct values.
