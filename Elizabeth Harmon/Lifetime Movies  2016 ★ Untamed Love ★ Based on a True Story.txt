Come here. Stay right there. Stay right there.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no, don't go there.
I'm sorry.
The cage tipped over in here.
It's okay, just hold him.
Yeah, okay.
But the lady inside told me that you're Mr. Bernard.
Bernard, yep, that's me.
My name is Miguel Prado, I'm supposed to be your assistant.
Oh, great, great.
Yes, I'm from Social Services.
I could get my slip right here from the unemployment department.
Unemployment?
Yes.
Do you have any training?
Any experience?
Sure I do.
You know, they send me out on all kinds of jobs.
You know, I do everything, painting houses,
unloading computers, that kind of stuff.
Great.
Oh, hold on, I'll be right back.
Carol.
Young man just introduced himself.
You, your Margaret, have a good holiday?
Happy New Year.
That young man just introduced himself
as my new aide from unemployment.
What happened to my full-time experience teaching assistant?
You're lucky to get anybody, there is no money in the budget.
I had to take some money out of maintenance just to pay him.
Thank you.
Oh, what happened at the school board meeting?
Did they approve my class having recess with the rest of the school?
Margaret, that wasn't discussed, we ran out of time.
Why? You were going to bring it up?
That we, there just wasn't time.
This is not the most pressing issue.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on, come on, come on, it's all right.
Come on, come on, buddy, come on, come on, come on.
Hold on a minute.
It's all right, come on.
It's all right.
I'll take you here.
Okay.
Give me a raise.
There you go.
Carol, you promised, you said this was the time,
you were going to bring it up.
Look, we have had a special ed class in this school
for what, five years, and it's always been separate
from the rest of the school.
It works best that way, why change it?
The parents are comfortable.
The parents are comfortable?
Yeah.
Harold, I have six very challenged kids in my class.
What about what makes them feel comfortable?
Margaret, I don't even know if we're going to have
a special ed class next year.
I don't know if we can afford it.
Now, things are going very well for your class this year, right?
So don't rock the boat.
The Rudds wish me to stress that their son
has second degree burns on 80% of his body.
I understand, Mrs. Miyako.
My question, however, related to Caitlin
and why she's acting out this kind of violence.
But, Your Honor, what Caitlin Eldridge did
is more than acting out.
It's psychotic and dangerous.
This child must be institutionalized.
Ms. Brown, it's up to you to suggest an alternative.
Social services tried, but that doesn't seem
to be one with her history.
Can I say something?
Don't go ahead, Mrs. Rod.
When this sick child tied Tommy to a tree
and set a match to a...
she turned my son into some kind of a freak.
Now, he has to deal with that pain for the rest of his life.
And so do we.
I want you to put her away, Judge.
So she can't never hurt another kid like she done mine.
Don't look at me, Judge.
I can't control her. No way.
But you're her father, Mr. Eldridge.
I don't make no difference.
She just turned out bad, that's all.
Caitlin?
Caitlin?
This isn't easy, is it?
Well, maybe you can help me.
Can you tell me why you did what you did?
Caitlin?
You see?
What did I tell you?
Good morning, Lisa Ann.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Let's try it. Good morning, Maggie.
Good morning, Maggie.
Look at my nose. Look at my nose.
Okay, give me some air.
Like a big girl. Come on, give me air.
That's a good try.
We'll work on it, all right? Let's go sing.
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go sing.
What do you want me to put this stuff?
Oh, just put it on the plant table and the rest of stuff in the fridge.
I want to see the fish.
I want to see the fish.
I want you to be a big boy now, remember?
It's Bradley, the big boy.
I want to see the fish.
Jordan, move your hand on and go sit down.
Crap.
All right, hang it up. Here we go.
Everything's fine.
Come on, Derek, big boy.
Take the thumb out of your mouth. That's it.
Stand up. There you go.
Now we're going to have our morning circle.
Right here.
Come on. Right here, next to Shanice.
There you go.
Okay.
You want to tie it up?
All right. Stand up there.
Get your body in control.
Okay. Good. Let's say morning song.
There you go.
Jorge.
Yes.
Christmas is over.
Christmas is over.
That's it. I know Christmas is over,
but this is so beautiful.
And we're going to hang it up
all year round, okay?
It's good to see you all.
Take off your jacket, okay?
And get ready to sing and do the play.
Miguel, help him with his coat.
Because his mother has to drive.
Come on.
Bradley, sit still.
Come on.
Okay, we're a pretty wild group here
after vacation, huh?
Bradley, sitting ready?
Okay.
Make room for our new guest.
His name...
I'm not going to tell you his name.
Do you notice anybody who's new in the group?
Yeah, him.
Him and him has a name and his name is
what? Miguel.
And he's going to help us, okay?
Bradley, come here.
See you in just a second.
Sam, could you wait just a minute, please?
Thanks.
Come on.
I mean, a child that sets other children on fire.
You got to be kidding.
Poster care won't touch it.
Well, God can imagine.
How does no help.
What about homebound? Why can't a teacher go to our house?
Nobody will go.
Everybody's scared of this little...
Well, I'm scared.
And I'm scared for my kids.
Sam, don't do this to me.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Listen, I got to get back.
My kids have finally calmed down.
You know, it took four months,
but they formed a cohesive group.
They finally feel safe.
You bring a child like this into my class
and everything's going to explode.
It's nothing we can do.
The law says the girl deserves to go to school.
She has a right to go to school.
What are you going to do with that?
Keep it.
They don't give nice equipment to the garbage cans.
And so the evil queen
asks for a magic mirror.
Here's the magic mirror.
Okay, which one is two?
One is two.
Now this, this right here, this one is two.
Okay, what number is this?
One.
What number is this?
Two.
What number is this?
Three.
My turn.
No.
My turn.
No.
Okay, now these, which one is two?
One is two.
Bradley?
These three, which one?
Bradley, go sit down.
Okay, keep going.
No window.
No window.
Okay, which one is two?
Let's go back.
One is two.
One is two.
Oh, and when you're working with Derek,
don't rush to give him the answer.
You know, be patient.
He'll surprise you sometimes.
Is it like this every day?
First days after vacation are pretty tough.
Tomorrow should be better.
See you in the morning.
I don't know if I can be here tomorrow.
I have to go to unemployment tomorrow,
you know, and check in.
You'll be here.
You have a knack for this.
Finished.
What time is it?
That was our clue.
Oh, man.
Four hours to do that closing statement,
and I'm not even charging the client.
I get angry they don't make me a partner.
Screwed up priorities, huh?
I like your priorities.
Oh.
This intake information sheet on the new kid,
I get, ah.
How is it?
It's unbelievable.
You get her tomorrow?
I should have had a lawyer and a baseball cap
plead my case.
You went charging.
I bet you would.
God.
Let me just read this.
A tax of their children.
She destroys properties, smears feces on the wall.
And then this underlining red,
unteachable child.
No match for you.
It's not funny.
It's frantic.
It's not funny.
It's frantic.
It's not funny.
It's frightening.
Take a compliment, huh?
You'll handle her.
You'll connect.
Cut it out.
Stop it.
I can't have finished my plan.
You know, we should have a rule.
The first one who finishes their homework,
the other one has to take some time out.
And we just hang together.
So it's my house and you're making the rules.
I live here.
Most of the time, this is where I hang my hats.
I should get some jurisdiction.
Night teacher.
Everything I know better you have in that file on your model.
Okay.
Okay, I'll read it.
Now, what do you suppose it might feel like
if you were new to some place and you didn't know anybody?
What would that feel like?
Or hey?
Really bad.
I've had none.
Now, what did that feel like right here?
No.
She stinks.
Jordan, she...
I want her sitting near me.
She'll stink.
No.
She does stink.
Like pee.
She'll sneeze.
I told you, I'm being very rude.
Now stop.
What do you think it feels like to tell someone that they stink?
She stinks.
Terrible.
She stinks terrible.
It hurt my feelings.
Thank you, Horey.
And what might be a better way that we could teach her?
You...
You can learn it in private.
That she...
She stinks.
That she wouldn't have to change her colors.
That's great, that's great.
Good talking, too.
What else?
What else might we do?
We could pluck up our nose.
Right.
Backward.
All of you.
Right now.
Backward.
Okay, Derek.
That's it.
I don't want you to go any higher, okay?
All right.
Jordan.
Jordan's slow.
Take it easy.
I'm going to the very top.
Nobby, let's come up here.
She can come up here.
Maggie, look.
No.
Stop.
Get out of my playroom.
Come on.
Get away from me.
Don't come up here.
Maggie, you're heavy.
Caitlin, if you'd like to play, you can join us.
Come on.
No, wait for me.
Get down.
Maggie, you're heavy.
Okay.
Jordan, watch where you're stepping.
All right.
Thank you very much.
All right.
What's up, Derek?
There you go.
Let's go back there.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Okay.
Well...
Caitlin was deserted by her mother
at the age of four.
And then left with her father,
who was on welfare.
The father spent time in state prison
for theft.
sitting with her father in a trader park.
Wow. Her options closed pretty early, didn't they?
You know where I come from?
Mother would never leave her babies except to go to work.
And then all the money she makes, she sends it back home for her children.
How'd your day go, Margaret?
Quiet. I don't know for how long. I didn't give her any work yet.
Well, you know, it's temporary. You don't have to teach her. Just let her sit.
And just do nothing?
I think it would be easier on the other kids not to stir this one up.
Uh, Harold, speaking of being kinder to my kids,
will you please talk to the school board about recess with the rest of the school?
When the time is right, I will.
You think you will?
Yeah. I pound him hard enough.
I think you're pretty good at pounding.
Yeah, I am, aren't I? Come on.
You have a cuddle.
You didn't say hello to Melissa.
Hello.
Here, everybody. Discussion time.
Help him out with his moped. Thanks, we go.
Hold it. Hold it.
It's a long discussion.
Bradley, come in. Where's your book?
Caitlin?
Caitlin, we need to have a talk.
Now listen, we went over the rules in class, right?
And one of the rules is you have to try to talk.
Now I know it's really hard, but I need you to try.
Shanice didn't talk when she first came here, and Ethan did Derek, okay?
And the next rule is that I want you to participate in discussion,
but we all get together as a group, and we talk about our feelings, alright?
Come on, let's go.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come here. Come here.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Push her down the toilet.
She's cracked.
No!
Push her down the toilet.
Come on, come on.
No!
No!
No!
No!
Right here, right here.
Right here. That's it.
Come to you. Calm down, young lady, and do what's asked of you.
Calm down.
Are you ready?
When you're ready, you can come and join us.
Well, it was the first blind date I've been on since high school.
So what was he like?
Well, he wasn't exactly handsome. I'd call him more like distinguished.
Oh, so it was a dog.
No, he wasn't a dog. He was not a dog. What are you doing?
He was...
He was a dog.
He was a dog. He was barking, baby. Let me tell you, he was barking.
Miss Bernard, some girl's throwing stuff all over the classroom.
Come on, give me the pencil. Give it to me.
Kailin, give me the pencil. Give me the pencil.
Kailin, give it to me. Give it to me.
Get her out of here.
Kailin, give me the pencil.
Give me the pencil. Kailin, give me the pencil.
Give me the pencil.
Grab here.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Help me, baby.
Help me!
Help me!
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Help me!
It's gonna die.
It's gonna die.
It's gonna die.
It's gonna die.
With a child like Katelyn Eldridge, there is always gonna be potential danger.
Look, the bottom line is everybody is concerned.
What are we gonna do about this?
Serve better coffee than seven in the morning starters.
Verbena, what about social services putting more pressure on the hospital
and officially force them to make an opening for her and take her in?
I mean, like, next week?
We can try. I don't know that it will do any good, but we can try.
And until then, I was wondering, I mean, are we all gonna celebrate
when we send this little girl to the mental hospital,
knowing that she probably will never get out again?
No, I'm confused. Do you want her to stay in your class indefinitely
after the goldfish catastrophe yesterday?
No. No, I don't.
Okay, so we're all agreed. Let's get her in the hospital as soon as possible, right?
Meantime, Maggie, you should have lunch with your class every day
as long as she's with us, all right?
Great.
Guess what? I'm supposed to tell you that Katelyn's early this morning
and from now on.
What are you talking about?
Well, the only bus that connects with her home, I guess it's very far,
is the high school bus, so she'll be arriving here half an hour early every day.
You're kidding me.
And then the afternoon, the bus will leave from the high school
one hour after your class approaches.
What are you talking about?
She has to wait here.
Here, here?
Look, I was in the office getting my mail.
I'm just a messenger.
Mr. Sherman says it's only temporary.
She's probably going into the hospital a lot.
Have a good day.
The marble's round. It's a death ray.
It's not a death ray and she's not going to hurt you.
Now I want you to go back and do your letters, all right?
You're a good mailman and you're doing a great job.
I bet you don't know how many marbles you have.
How many marbles?
Two of one.
Kiddo, it's time to do some math.
Come on.
We're going to do math.
You know?
Okay?
All right, here we go.
No, no, no, no.
You want me to sit right here?
No.
Yep.
Okay.
I'm going to get some blocks.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
I want you to take your hand, okay?
And I want you to count three.
Count three.
All right?
I'm going to help you.
One, two, three.
Bradley, come back.
Come back here and finish your work.
That is not...
Sit down.
That is not acceptable.
Now we're going to do it again.
I'll help you.
Ready?
One, two, three.
It's unacceptable.
Right now.
I'm going out to do math.
Miguel, take them out to recess.
Now?
Everybody, it's recess.
We're going out with the other kids like we talked about.
But it's not your time.
What the hell with their time?
You take them out now.
No.
Okay, come on.
Okay.
Yes.
We're going to do math.
yeah.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Yes.
No!
Yes.
You know, most of the time, Katelyn still stinks, like a toilet.
She should be on that side from rabbit.
Hey, come on Jordan, don't make fun, okay?
If we had a pancake, Katelyn should be on the side with the pancake.
Do you like the picture?
Yeah, yeah, I like your treat.
Hey, you remember what Maggie said about being nice?
And about being kind, huh?
Hey, hey, you remember?
Well, come on, go back and do your work.
Hey, look, come on, finish what you're doing.
All right, Fancy, stop laughing now.
Come on, let's go back to work.
Okay, ready?
I want you to find number four.
Good job.
You're number five.
All right, great, now look at some socks for me.
Ready?
We have to go pee.
You can go to the bathroom.
And then we'll do some math, right?
Right?
All right.
Count out three.
Good.
Show me ten.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
How about two plus two?
All right, I'm going to get you on this one.
Fifteen, take away nine.
Pretty smart, aren't you?
Uh-huh.
Let's try some more.
Do you know how phenomenal that is?
Yeah, I think I do.
Because the hardest part of this job
is that you can't ever really change these kids.
I mean, no matter what.
Because their brain is actually impaired in some way.
Well, that doesn't stop you.
I mean, Lisa Ann and Derek, they're autistic.
I can't exactly set a goal for them.
So it's basically a day-to-day kind of trying to hold them together.
You know, Katelin, you know, she opened up like that.
It was a dream.
And it's the matter.
I mean, I don't know if she can read yet.
And I don't know if she's ever going to open up again,
but I reached her.
Okay.
This is it.
What do you think?
It's okay.
Do you know what I'm saying?
Okay, I thought it was perfect for over the kitchen table.
You're not listening to me.
Do you know what I'm trying to tell you?
Yes, I hear what you're trying to tell me.
So enough with your kids, okay?
With interior decorating.
But that's the point.
She's not like the other kids.
She's different.
Maggie, look.
We are buying a damn light fixture for the house.
Can we just focus on that for one minute?
It's nice.
It's a light.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was a Porsche.
Hi.
Do you feel a hurt?
I can tell you fast, please.
I've been trying to corner this guy for two days.
Can I just steal him for a minute?
Yeah.
Thanks.
We need to figure this out before lunch.
I don't know.
I'll try.
I'll talk to him.
Carol, have you heard about Caitlin?
What about her?
An opening in the hospital.
I mean, they haven't gotten her in yet.
I can't believe they're taking so long.
It's...
I'll call again today, okay?
No.
Listen, something phenomenal has happened.
She is reading at a third grade level.
She's doing second grade math.
And then I had Donald test her IQ yesterday.
We are talking 168.
Huh.
Read.
Yeah, ask him.
He'll tell you 168.
That's genius.
I mean, to put a little girl like that in a mental hospital,
it's just...
it's a tragedy.
She's going to revert back to her behavior,
and of course, I'll have to punish her.
Can we appeal the decision?
Can who appeal?
The school board.
Based on her ability.
And her behavior now.
No outbursts, no fighting.
Nothing destructive.
I mean, she's almost like a new child.
Well, that's true.
You really deserve your reputation, don't you?
Crazy kids, crazy teacher.
Yeah.
Oh, one other thing.
The recesses are going great,
and can we have assembly with the rest of the classes?
Maybe.
One thing at a time, okay?
Okay.
But you will try to find out about appealing the court decision.
You want to know what troubles me most about that little girl's future?
According to her file, she never cries,
and a child that never cries, that's inhuman.
You've never seen that before, have you?
I've seen a lot of things in my class
that I've never seen before.
Very human.
You know what?
What?
Melissa's going to a party tonight.
She is?
Yeah, you want to go with her?
No.
Why not?
She's going to go by herself?
Yeah.
I'm just going to take her.
Oh, you're going to take her,
but you're going to drop her off?
Oh, you figure it out.
Oh, good.
Well, you run off, and I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie.
Bye, Maggie.
Bye-bye.
Caitlin.
Rear sweep.
Got a great idea.
Come on.
Okay.
I thought we could comb your hair out,
so it looks just like mine.
Now, hmm.
How come you're being nice to me?
Because I like you.
Okay?
Now I'm going to put the other bread in.
All right, just like that.
All right.
Maybe tomorrow we'll give it a wash, okay?
You ready?
You look beautiful, Caitlin.
My paw.
I'll take him away and say I stole him.
Nobody ever gave me nothing.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you wear them when you're in school,
and then I'll keep them very safe for you at night.
Okay?
Okay.
This was too big to carry around.
For almost a year together.
My appreciation.
Open it.
Oh!
They're beautiful.
I've never had real pearls before.
They are real, aren't they?
There.
Beautiful.
I don't know what to say.
I love you, Meg.
Let's get married, okay?
I...
Well?
Well, why are you changing the rules?
I mean, we've had such a great year.
I want the next one to be even better.
We bought a lamp together.
Two of my bosses came into my office this afternoon.
That partnership's going to happen.
You're kidding.
Oh, that's great.
Wonderful.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I am telling you.
I've screwed up so many relationships in my time.
Now that I've finally got it right,
I thought, you know...
Thank you.
The end of the summer?
They owe me three weeks,
and you've got your summer vacation.
Damn.
I've applied to go back and get my doctorate.
You know that.
Haven't you said you weren't sure?
Well, I might need that degree
if I go back into child psychology someday.
I just have to feel that it's right.
I...
I need to feel a buzz, you know?
Yeah, I've seen it go off.
About that kid in your class.
And, uh...
You and me?
There isn't a buzz.
I'm just saying that...
I need to get a grip on my own life
before I take on somebody else's, that's all.
You're shutting down, Meg.
I just asked you.
To marry me.
No.
You asked me to change my whole life.
It really scares you, doesn't it?
The idea of trusting someone that much.
I don't want to change you, Meg.
I just want to be with you.
I just want to be with you.
They're beautiful.
Morning, Kalen.
Morning.
Would you put the clips in my hair now?
You bet.
I think this morning I'm going to give you
the full beauty treatment.
Head to toe.
A bath.
Oh, rubber dup dup.
I found some nice things for you in our clothes box.
My paw won't let me keep them.
We always see about that.
Anyway,
when I was washing you up, you know,
I noticed some scars on your back
and on your ankle.
What happened?
I fell.
Kalen, did your paw ever leave any marks on you?
You know, like maybe spank you real hard or something?
It was my mom.
But my paw, he loves me.
He loves me and never ever run away or dump me.
Why did your mom do that?
What happened?
Well, I'm trying, man, but it is tough, I'll tell you.
I told you things has changed since we were stationed down.
Yeah, well, I sure as hell ain't right in this thing,
although we're back to Portland, I'll tell you that.
Listen, I'll hook something up.
Don't worry.
Yeah, you better hook it up soon.
The trailer's getting a little small for three people.
You know what I mean?
I heard that.
Um, Mr. Eldridge?
Oh, hi.
I'm Keaton's teacher.
Hey, give me a minute.
Listen, I'm out of here, all right?
What's she done now, lady?
She hasn't done anything.
Really?
Really, she's a great kid.
So, you're gonna take her away?
Could we step inside?
And there's some clothes at school that we could give, Caitlin.
I also wanted to tell you what a great read of your little girl is.
Oh, yeah?
So, what's she done bad?
She hasn't done anything bad.
I came to tell you that she's really very smart,
and I wanted her to have the clothes.
You see him?
That Jimmy.
That's Caitlin's brother.
He was my boy, until that bitch took him away.
Left me with that little bastard.
And I can't do anything with her.
What about a foster home?
I mean, that's a solution.
Well, what kind of a bastard would I be if I gave her up?
You want me to give her up?
No, you're full of crap.
There's no need to talk that way.
Miguel, it's all right. It's all right, Mr. Eldridge.
Mr. Eldridge, listen, listen.
You said...
You said you couldn't control her.
I was just trying to make a suggestion.
No, no, no, no, no.
Well, thank you so much.
I think you have to leave now.
We don't want your clothes.
Thank you.
We don't need your charity.
Come on.
Thank you.
You wish you could go back to lifting refrigerators, huh?
It's discouraging, isn't it?
But you're going to have to deal with all kinds of things
when you work with these kids.
No, I don't know if I want to.
Family used to live in a place like this.
Now, that's why I don't like touching the rat.
Seven brothers and sisters.
Me in the middle, all in three rooms.
I understand.
Sad, too, because you're great with children.
My girlfriend.
She wants me to go back to school to be a teacher.
Smart girlfriend.
You can't do this for me.
Two days, just take two days off.
Next Thursday and Friday.
Yes.
It's just too soon.
I can't leave Caitlin for two days suddenly like that.
She's right on the edge.
I've been working on a defense for this case for two months
because Wally wants to nail that account.
When Wally, the most senior partner, asks the most junior partner
to join him for a long weekend at the beach house with a client,
the most junior partner goes.
So why do I have to go?
Because Wally specifically asked me to bring it to couples thing.
I just can't.
I'm the only safe fridge she has.
Give me a break.
I mean it.
I mean, you should see the way she lives.
I feel for the kid, but you're going overboard on this.
We're talking two days here.
It is tough for a kid to trust after she has been so badly abused.
And I thought the time away would be good for us.
For a lot of reasons.
You're right.
It's just bad timing, that's all.
Well, everything is these days.
Sir.
Does it have to be next weekend?
Yes, it has to be next.
Why do you always have to try to control everything?
I am not trying to control everything.
What are you talking about?
Everything.
That girl's life, my life, this relationship.
I am not trying to control you.
You are trying to control me.
Control for you means not having to let go of anything, Maggie,
including your feelings.
Dan.
Let's go.
For three days.
I'll take Friday off.
We can drive to Santa Barbara on Thursday night.
I want to.
Really.
I'll, um, I'll try to leave the kids in the classroom.
Okay, everybody.
It's a stop.
Come on now.
I got the platform.
Can we go again in a little while?
Wait, wait, wait.
Is Kate okay?
I don't know.
Did you see that look on her face when I told her I was going to be in Santa Barbara?
Maybe I shouldn't take Friday off.
Oh, she'll be all right.
I mean, they're going to put her in that hospital soon, right?
She's just so raw right now.
Well, but she'll be okay, though.
You know what I mean?
She'll be okay.
She'll be okay.
She'll be okay.
She'll be okay.
She'll be okay.
She'll be okay right now.
Yeah, but she'll be okay, though.
You know what I mean?
She's not acting out.
Acting out?
You're learning fast.
She didn't run.
She didn't make a major explosion, but she was ticking down, you know?
What, sweetheart?
Hey, look.
Here's your goods.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Show me where, sweetheart.
Where?
Oh.
Here you go.
Here you go.
Oh, here you go.
My perfect.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
I know.
I know, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
It's all right.
Oh.
Oh, feeling a little better, huh?
Taitlin, answer me.
Okay.
Oh, sweetie.
I wish I could make you understand, but I can leave for a day and you'll be all right.
Katie, I'm your teacher, you know, and we won't always be together.
No.
Listen to me.
Listen.
This one day that I'll be away, you can get along without me.
And it's so important that you understand that.
When are you gonna be back?
Monday morning, before you know it.
Trust me.
Did you fix it with my hair, right?
I think that's a great idea.
I like the way your lady plays the game.
Serious.
Me too.
You know, I had that backhand ball and I put it away, boom, and I missed it.
I tell you, Wally, she never thinks she's good enough.
So, Maggie, we're having a charity tournament next month and you are such a great player.
We'd love to have you.
You know, a lot of the wives are gonna be there.
Well, thanks.
I appreciate it.
Great.
Give me a break.
She needs Lisa and wants to order.
Would you like some stew?
Okay.
So would you like anything?
Stew.
One stew.
Okay.
Two stews coming right up.
Yes.
That's a good boy, Derek.
You hung up your coat by yourself.
Didn't you?
It's the other woman I can know.
You be our customer.
I'm good.
Are you ready for this?
Good.
I want to be the cook.
I want to be the cook.
I want to.
You have to be the waitress.
I am the cook.
Fine.
You can be it for a minute and then I'll be the cook.
Brad, you didn't tell her.
She was such a good storyteller.
You know, I thought you were gonna tell us the...
Excuse me.
Oh, sure.
You know, Doris, I thought you were gonna tell us the one about the three guys and the
rat.
You know, the man of the cloth, the man of the cloth, the doctor and the lawyer.
Okay?
Why are you doing this?
I'm trying to reach McGill.
Something's gotta be wrong.
Maggie, you've left the table three times in the last 15 minutes.
It's making people uncomfortable.
Dan, I'm worried.
Look, I'll tell them about Caitlin and then they don't have to feel uncomfortable.
I don't think they're interested.
They're trying to enjoy their dinner and not talk about their work.
I'm sorry if sometimes my job and my life are a little...
A little?
Just come back to the table, okay?
I will.
I'll be right there.
I promise.
Dan, would you come in or close the door?
It's freezing out there.
No more than that is in here.
You aren't gonna let it go, are you?
Not it, Maggie.
You.
You, I don't want to let you go.
Dan, I made a mistake.
I never should have said I was gonna come.
I just don't fit in as one of the wives.
I don't want you to be one of the wives.
Why do you have to do this?
What?
Push me off.
I don't know.
Something happens to me when somebody gets too close.
Well, I'm sorry.
It makes you a tough woman to love.
I got him.
Slumming it?
She's going in.
The school board didn't think it was warranted to appeal.
It's not warranted.
What about a lawsuit?
There has to be something that we can do.
No.
They expect an opening soon before Easter, they think.
But you should feel proud, you know?
You've brought her so far.
Obviously, not far enough.
Why? Why should I continue teaching?
So I can watch another child be destroyed by the system?
Every child can't be saved, Maggie. You're a teacher.
That's the equation. What else would you do?
Get your muffin.
You know, you're never gonna change the system the way you want.
You want it all perfect, whether that's your terrific teaching or your energy.
And sometimes you'll even make a difference, a little difference.
Let's get real. There ain't no Camelot.
That's not a reality that I can live with.
Okay, okay. Solve your own problems.
I can't. Please.
Call them off.
I'll slow it down.
You want some muffin?
No, go ahead.
Oh, Sam, one other thing.
You know, my class doesn't get to go to assembly with the rest of the school.
I mean, if they did, it would be great.
Do you never stop, do you?
First recess, now assembly.
They've already learned the Pledge of Allegiance, Sam.
Right.
Give me your mom's leave.
Deal.
Yes, sweetie?
Can you tell me a story?
I'm really busy right now. Maybe later when you're waiting for the bus, okay?
I'm sorry.
My favorite story was about a little girl who lived in a forest far, far away.
It was a beautiful forest.
The little girl was very lonely because she had nobody to play with.
And then one day, she saw a big lion standing on a rock staring down at her.
Well, she was so lonely that she decided to ask the lion if he would play with her.
But the lion said he couldn't because he hadn't been tamed.
What's that, tamed?
Well, that is the exact same question that the little girl asked the lion.
And the lion told her that being tamed was about becoming friends.
And he said that he'd been born wild and fierce.
And that if the little girl really wanted to, she could become his friend
if she would give him all of her love and trust.
You see, the idea was that once the lion felt what it was like to be needed and to trust,
then he would have to love the little girl back.
And then the lion would be tamed.
Well, it had been so long since the little girl had had anybody to play with
that she agreed to do what the lion asked.
And you know what?
Very soon they had learned together to love and to need and to trust.
And then they were in each other's hearts forever.
And then they both were tamed.
Hi, Dan here. Now it's your turn. Okay.
Rain stopped.
Tomorrow I go back to school.
Yeah. Oh, what a lousy day for you to have to pick up a job, huh?
Want to play checkers?
No.
You like your dolly, don't you?
Can I have it from you?
You know, we could play house.
My dolly.
This one's better.
Yes, it's better.
This one's better.
This one's better.
Put some more on this.
That's a little bit too much.
You want to get that one before you do that?
This is too hard, me now.
No.
This should be good.
Yeah, that's good.
Are you sure?
Okay, sweetie.
Okay.
Let's do some math, all right?
Come here, I'll help you.
Come on.
You guys finish up over there.
Okay.
Now, let's see, where were we?
Okay, we've got two more to do.
Okay?
So now number nine.
If it's not 12 minus seven, right here,
if it's not 12 minus seven, then what number is it?
Sweetheart, what number is it?
If it's not...
Oh, hey, look.
Oh, my God.
Oh, come here.
Come here.
Sweetheart, just lay back.
Just lay back.
Come here.
All right, lock it down.
All right.
Okay, I'll just stand and be all right.
Come on, sweetie.
I'll just stand and be just here.
I'm right here.
I think it's gonna be okay.
Okay, here we go.
All right, what's that up in the yard?
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go.
All right, everybody, let's get ready to go out for recess.
I don't want to go out until Caitlyn comes back.
I understand, sweetie.
Come on.
My grandpa was to the hospital.
He's died there.
Caitlyn's gonna die.
Oh, come here, sweetie.
She's gonna be fine, really.
She's doing much better.
The operation has stopped the bleeding.
And she's getting stronger and stronger every day.
Okay, she's gonna live a long, long time.
My mom said her dad's friend who did that should be killed dead.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Bradley, come here.
Come here.
All right, everybody.
I know it's a real scary thing.
What happened to Caitlyn?
All right, I'll tell you what.
Before we go out for recess, let's have a talk.
Everybody to the circle, all right?
And bring your pictures for Caitlyn.
Come on, kids.
Let's go.
Doctor, that is the CCU.
Doctor, that is the CCU.
Please.
Go upstairs.
Take it all.
Don't cry, Maggie.
It doesn't hurt too much anymore.
Makes me feel a little bit better to cry sometimes, Kitty.
Here you go.
Do you want to hold my marble like you did yesterday?
No, I think I just want to hold your hand tonight.
Last night when I woke up, it was sort of scary.
I wanted my paw, but I didn't cry none.
Miguel went to get him, sweetheart.
Oh, look.
It's for you, from everybody.
Just for me?
Mm-hmm.
Hello, Maggie.
Oh, great, Miguel.
Hello, Caitlyn. How are you?
Good.
Papa.
Mr. Elvish, why don't you go talk to her?
She asked for you.
Well, I can't help her, hun.
It hurts me to see her like that.
I got this, uh...
today.
I can't believe that this rock...
is so beautiful.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
No problem. Just had to cancel three and a half major clients as well.
How's Caitlyn?
She's fine. She's up, walking,
mending fast.
Good.
Dan, I called you because I have to know if I can petition the court.
I mean, can I appeal her case?
Wait a minute, you mean just you?
I know I'm not her guardian or anything official, but can I appeal?
You want to go over the heads of, what, the school board, the social services department?
I don't want to. I have to.
Everybody has turned me down.
And believe me, I've made as much noise as I possibly can.
I bet you have.
Maggie the Madwoman.
Come on, there's a decent new place around the corner.
Who's your job, you know that?
I'm giving up teaching at the end of the year anyway.
I decided to get my doctorate.
I'm kidding.
No, I'm serious. Anyway, Caitlyn's the issue now.
Saving Caitlyn.
Yeah, she always had a little more buzz than anyone around for her.
I'll tell you the truth, Maggie. I was a little jealous.
Disappointed you called about her instead of us.
I found us. Why? You're the one who snuck off with his hat and left a note on the rack?
Dan, a note?
Not only corny, but a little chicken, wasn't it?
I had my reasons.
I don't want to talk about this.
Okay, well, my opinion is you can't appeal the case. It's risky. Nobody's going to like it.
But you say you don't care.
Will you take it on?
Oh, boy, you've got guts.
Maggie, the mad woman, and a friend, a good friend who needs you very much.
I hope you're buying the drinks. Not going to make any money off this one.
It's tough on a child because basically they have no choice.
Yeah, I worry for Caitlyn. You know, it's so hard to stop feeling for them.
Well, maybe that's what makes a good teacher. Or a bad one.
You think maybe, maybe I make a good teacher?
I think you ought to look in the mirror and ask yourself that question.
There he is.
Okay, I'll go to the pay phone and call Dan.
I'll let that bastard stay here for two months and look what he does.
I beat the crap out of them before they took him off to jail.
No, thanks.
Nothing.
Well, I appreciate you bringing me the groceries very much.
Mr. Aldridge, we need you to do something for your little girl.
We are appealing to the court not to send Caitlyn to the state hospital.
And we want you to come to court next Thursday. Just answer a few questions.
Good court?
This is the date of the court appearance, the time, and the place.
It's for your daughter. You understand?
I ain't sure I got a daughter.
You know, you're full of it. You've got a daughter and from what I understand, she's a great little kid.
Now you'll be there for her. You got that?
Here, you take this.
What's that for?
Take it.
Oh.
Take the money, Mr. and you get the hell out of here.
Mr. Aldridge.
Stand out of my house! This is my house!
That guy's crazy.
Damn. Can we win without him?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
One, two, three, four. Here, here.
You buy Caitlyn her dress. Green. I think she likes green.
Did you remember the tapes?
They're right here in my briefcase. It's all just...
The parents of the boy she burned.
Did you know they were going to be here?
I figured they would be. They want to see Caitlyn put away forever.
With Pa?
Told him to be here half an hour ago.
Come here, sweetheart. Sit down.
I don't think your Pa's going to be able to make it.
You should have thrown him in the car and dragged him down here, whether he likes courtrooms or not.
Look what I brought you. I want you to draw me a beautiful picture.
And if you have any questions, you see that guard right there?
He'll call me.
All right? I'm going to tell him right now.
It's okay.
He wasn't in there either.
Excuse me. Do you see that little girl right there?
Just make sure you take care of her.
She'll be safe here, honey.
Maggie and I will be right there.
Okay?
Okay?
No problem.
I'll be right back.
Here you go, sweetie.
Did I do good enough?
You did great, kiddo.
I think the judge was very impressed.
Dan is in the judge's chambers right now,
discussing everything that went on in the courtroom.
And then the judge will make his decision.
Is he going to send me away for a long time?
I hope not, kiddo.
Okay. Based on the testimony, one could deduce that she shows some,
and I underlined some, signs of improvement.
But what does that really mean?
That she fits in a class full of misfits?
Oh, come on. Look, that is just cheap name-calling.
This is a child who had never experienced
even the smallest expression of love.
And then she was put into a healthy, nurturing environment,
and incredible things happened.
You saw the videotape her teacher made.
This Caitlyn is a different child.
I can't think of any more to get real tired of this.
This is Ryan. What is it?
Could you excuse us just for a minute?
I want you to know that I didn't appeal to the court on behalf of Caitlyn,
because I excuse what she did to your son.
It was awful and cruel.
Then why not put her away?
Because I know that the pain she inflicted came from such tremendous hurt
and fear that she was having to hold inside.
And now that she's learning to release those feelings responsibly,
there's no need to act them out.
She doesn't have to keep trying to prove that she is a bad girl.
You want me to feel sorry for her?
Well, I don't.
Neither do I.
Feeling sorry for kids like Caitlyn.
That doesn't help them survive.
That's exactly what I try to teach each of my kids how to survive
in a world that hands them almost nothing besides pain and rejection.
I can't do anything about the past.
I wish I could, but I can't.
And nobody is going to gain from trying to destroy that little girl's future.
But how can you be sure?
How can you guarantee that she's not going to torture some innocent kid
as soon as she gets away from that teacher?
Exactly.
Look, I can't guarantee anything, Your Honor.
But what's the choice here?
To shut a child with Caitlyn's potential away from society forever?
She is six and a half years old.
It's taking so long.
Waiting so hard, isn't it, Giddle?
I want you to tame me, like the little girl did the lion.
No hospital. Just therapy.
Oh, yes, yes.
Bottom line, the judge thought that under the circumstances,
Caitlyn made major progress.
Enough to live at home and attend regular classes next year.
That's wonderful, sweetheart.
You're wonderful.
Hey, Giddle, it's Caitlyn's time.
Let's celebrate. Hey, come on, pizza.
And hot dogs.
Rich fries.
And hot fudge sundaes for dessert.
Mr. Eldridge, we won.
Listen, we're going to go celebrate.
Would you join us?
No, I can't.
At least you're a party anyway. You did it.
Well, you, uh...
You ought to know that your being here was very important to the judge.
Thanks for the dress, Pa.
Neat color.
I can keep it, right?
Because you gave it to me.
You look real nice.
Go have some fun, huh?
And behave yourself.
Come on, Giddle, let's go.
Yeah!
All right!
Me, too.
And we're going to pizza.
You know, there are a lot of places you can teach in Seattle.
You don't care that I changed my mind.
Well, what else is new?
When I saw Caitlyn tonight,
I knew...
I knew you don't understand something.
I was able to give that little girl to you.
I knew you don't understand something.
I was able to give that little girl a love that nobody else had ever been able to give her before.
A love that...
I didn't even realize that I had within me to give.
And she was so vulnerable and so scared.
And she risked it all by loving me back.
And I was the only person there who could celebrate her existence.
That's why I'm going to go back and teach again.
It's what I do.
You really get me.
So, when did you move?
Next month.
You know, the reason I wrote you that chicken letter
I left on a half-rack was because I knew I had to leave.
I knew if I looked into your eyes,
I'd have to leave.
I knew I had to leave.
I knew if I looked into your eyes,
I'd have to leave.
I knew if I looked into your eyes,
I'd have to leave.
I knew if I looked into your eyes,
I'd have to leave.
I knew if I looked into your eyes,
I wouldn't be able to.
And you think it'll be a breeze for me to leave?
Me or Kate?
Sometimes you are such a butt-head.
You didn't answer my question, Maggie.
I need to know.
At this time, not to shut down.
Well, um...
We still have a little more than three weeks.
Good morning, Margaret.
Hello, Harold.
Margaret, what would you say if Caitlin
and two of your more advanced kids were in the color guard
at the last assembly of the year?
I'd say terrific, Harold.
But why just Caitlin and two of the others?
I think you'd be even more proud of your special ed class
if they all were the color guard.
Well, I think that's risking a bit too much.
Come on, Harold, don't let your good instincts fail you now.
I ain't gonna go. This is my class.
Sweetheart, the school year will be over in a few weeks,
and everybody's agreed, Mr. Sherman, the school board, everybody,
that you're ready to go into a regular class next year.
It's time to play.
I want to stay in this crazy class with you.
I need a little bit of this.
Kittle.
Come on, Lisa. Let's go paint.
Listen.
You know, next year,
I probably won't be here...
Yes, you will. I've been good.
You said so, my pa said so.
He bring home a pizza.
Sometimes new ideas take a little time, don't they?
Come on.
Let's get ready and practice for assembly, okay?
Come on.
Good, good, and...
Now, and to the public.
I thought we painted this.
We always smat me into this bunch.
Good, good.
Yeah, good job, Derek. Good job.
Can you go help those guys clean up, okay?
I'm so sad to leave them.
I know.
The end of the year always hurts.
Okay.
For you, I have a little thank you.
California University is pleased to admit Miguel Prado
for the fall semester.
Come here, you.
Congratulations.
When did you...
It's wonderful, it's wonderful.
I looked in the mirror and I said,
this guy could be a good teacher.
You know, I think that man was right.
Come here. Come on.
Okay, everybody, assembly in five minutes.
You have to go to the bathroom now's the time.
You're going to break your class next year.
Can you and me? No more geeks.
He's made incredible progress, and I'm so happy with him.
And he hangs his coat every time.
He knows the pledge.
What do you see him in the assembly? Just to...
Maggie, Maggie, excuse me.
Um, Caitlin slipped out of the auditorium.
I don't know where...
Okay, go back with the others. I'll find her.
Okay.
This is foster, I'm sorry, but, um, I'll talk to you.
Okay, that's all right.
All right.
What's wrong?
Caitlin.
She's not here.
Okay, I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
I was worried about you, sweetie.
Come on, the assembly's starting. Let's go.
Gordie and Derek, they're waiting for you to leave them, you know?
Let's go, sweetie. Come on.
No, I don't want you to ruin the day for everybody.
Don't kick me out.
I'm not gonna kick me out.
I'm not kicking you out, honey. You don't need this class anymore.
What do you mean, don't need? I'm still crazy.
You are not crazy. Now stop thinking that.
Fine, then I'll be the craziest girl in the whole world.
Then I'll make you keep me here.
Caitlin, listen to me, listen to me carefully.
I am going away next year.
I am not going to be here.
Sweetheart, you have grown so much, and so have I.
And now it's time to see how good that growing up was.
You're ready to try it on your own.
You're strong.
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh.
Okay, that's all right. Where is she?
Look, Maggie's not here yet, okay?
Yeah, I'm sorry, but if these kids are not ready in five minutes,
I'm gonna have to send some band members out.
Look, I'm doing the best I can.
Sorry.
I don't know where they are.
What?
They're just keeping above my head.
You want to know what my mama did when she left me?
You want to know?
Of course I do, sweetheart, but everybody's waiting.
Just listen.
We were in the car.
See?
Jimmy wanted it.
No way, my mama gave it to me.
It's the best thing she ever did give me.
Sweetheart, we're waiting.
Jimmy was crying and screaming in the back.
I was back there trying to make her nice.
Mama said,
Caitlin, come up here.
She gave me a kiss on the cheek
and opened the door
and pushed me on into the highway.
See?
I know, sweetheart.
See? You're just like my mama leaving.
How come you're not gonna stay here and make me good?
I am not leaving you.
Remember the story that I told you about the little girl who lived in the forest
and how she tamed the lion by showing him that she loved him?
Well, that's how it is with us.
We'll always love each other.
And just like that little girl found out,
going away is easier than
because every time you think of that special person,
you can feel a little bit of their love.
And that love is inside you forever.
Okay.
Come on.
Ow!
Jordan, watch where you're walking.
Ow!
Okay, we're here. Let's go.
It's too late, honey. It's too late.
Come on, Beth.
Come on, you guys. We can do it.
Line up. Come on, let's go.
We can do it. Line up. Here we go.
No, it goes over to the right shoulder.
No, wait. It goes over to the right shoulder.
Get this, Mrs. Sherman.
Maggie, we're here.
No, no, no.
Yes, yes. One minute.
Can't do it.
You ready?
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
Take our position.
Jordan.
Come on.
They're late.
Oh!
Oh!
Damn it.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Okay.
Let's play.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, another God,
indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Good luck.
Are you ready?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That was crazy.
We were wonderful.
We did.
Thanks for having me.
You were soあと as a grandchild.
We did a great job.
You did a great job.
I can't believe this.
Goodbye honey, and remember we're going to write letters and every time we think about
each other, we're going to feel a whole lot of love.
I'll be bad, we'll have to come back.
No I won't Caitlin, and I'm counting on you to be good, I'm betting on you kiddo.
I'll be good Mary, I promise, just for you.
No, just for you.
I will.
Bye.
Bye.
Maggie, I tamed you too.
I did move to Seattle, and as it turned out, mine was the last special education class
at Lindbrook Elementary School.
I wondered if I'd ever hear from Caitlin, because I had decided to let her make that decision on her own.
Well, a couple of months ago, in the mail came a crumpled, water-stained piece of notebook paper,
written on with a green felt-tip marker.
No letter accompanied it.
It was inscribed to Maggie, with much love, and it said,
You were right to say you'd never leave me, because I could always feel you there to dry my tears when I get lonely.
I'm happy I carry your smile on my mind, so I can remember just how scary but very kind it was for you to show me to myself.
And now I need to let you know that every single day I grow, and so does the joy that only you would teach me to share.
Caitlin was right. She did tame me, and I will always be a teacher.
Thank you.
