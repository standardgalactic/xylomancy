So I'm scared to death of public speaking so for me to dance in here on stage
The Delta is a little bit wide, I must confess. Amazing to have everyone here
listening into these very deep complex difficult discussions. My name is
Niklas Adalbert and I was very lucky with my company Clana with the timing.
It's a buy now pay later for e-commerce and thanks to this timing I was part of
this amazing growth journey. I was receiving awards and front-page magazines
and recognition for what I was doing and seven years in I reached my goal in
life which was to be financially independent. I could change my fake
Rolex into a real one. I mean how great is that? But as everyone
understand I mean a fake Rolex showed the same time as a real one and looks
exactly the same and I could only eat five times per day and so once nothing
changed. I thought I would reach Nirvana but I just felt complete emptiness.
This made me reflect. It made me reflect on what we celebrate in society and in
my vertical of startups we celebrate unicorns. The companies that reach a
certain valuation, a billion dollar valuation, no consideration whatsoever if
they destroy the planet or society in doing so. If we put people to depth or
we create addictive mobile games which destroys people's ability to pay
attention and so on all about reaching a specific valuation. So this was the birth
or idea behind Norwegian foundation to instead put the spotlight and capital and
networks behind impact entrepreneurs. So startups that are actually tackling the
world's greatest challenges. And thanks to the resilience center, get a tomb
bury, north vault, creating the world's greenest batteries that we're very
proud of here in Sweden. Sweden today have actually 34 times as many impact
startups as the world average and this has been feeling great to me. I mean such
good like recognition and feeling and feeding my ego until Eric Fanholm
introduced me to this guy here and the metacrisis. Informing me or pointing at
that this embedded growth obligation we're having in society is that really
compatible on a finite planet, north vault. I mean if we do produce the world's
greenest batteries with green energy but meanwhile creating an ecological
disaster in DRC Congo or Indonesia, is that a sufficient solution?
We're coming to him. Or the Germans paradox that we also talked about, Nate
was pointing to that, that even though we have added so much wind and solar is
still a world record of cold consumption. So this is very difficult to
complex and it's obvious that just focusing on impact investing is maybe
not sufficient. So a true honor to have a discussion here with Daniel Schmackdenberger.
So Daniel, where should we start? So maybe if you could give us just a
reflection of impact week or the sessions we have had here and like obvious
thoughts. You guys don't know that we're completely blind up here. I can't see
any faces. It's such a weird experience. Can you hear Daniel though? Yeah.
Reflections on impact week yesterday and today. I was sitting in the audience and
I was listening to Nate and Olivia and Kate today and you know these are people
whose work I respect deeply and who are saying some of the most important things
that can be said and are brilliant educators. And I was feeling the sense of the
recognition that it probably doesn't matter at all. That most everybody will
leave and probably continue working the jobs that they work doing mostly the
same types of things. And they will remember what happened like okay we're
destroying the atmosphere, we're boiling the oceans, we're killing all the other
species, we're doing it at the cost of colonialism. We're on the way towards
extinction and that will last in people's minds till they scroll for a minute
until a bunch of messages come in and until the bills need paid at most.
And I'm thinking about the talks that Bohm and Krishna Marti gave in the 80s saying
very similar things about civilization being on a self-destruct path or
that Bucky gave after World War II and the people who listened earnestly and
everything they were saying has come to pass and those curves keep doing the same thing.
And I was thinking about the Nuremberg trials where after World War II and the
Nazis were being tried for war crimes. One of the things they were asked was if
they believed in everything they were doing. And something like 90% of them
said no. At first they believed the kind of propaganda of the Jewish attack on
their population and whatever, but as it got into gassing children,
something like 90% of the people who were doing that said no, I totally didn't believe in it and
I thought it was terrible. And then when they were asked did you try to stop, they all said no.
And they quoted German phrases that translated to something like officers' orders,
I didn't have a choice. And I think about all the things that we would consider
impact like that was just normal life in Tibet before Mao invaded.
When we talk about having a civilization that has deeper consideration for other
sentient beings and deeper interiority and Tibet was pretty great at that and it didn't lead
to their civilization continuing when a more power-oriented civilization wanted to end it.
I think about when we're talking about the impending catastrophes, I think about the 100
million Native Americans that were genocided for my country to exist just a minute ago.
And we talk about like the values of Western civilization, but you know,
modern democracy in the United States occurred on 100 million person genocide and massive slavery
as well as the destruction of the species. And that genocide was in this part of the
exponential curve that is now verticalizing and people don't have an intuition for how fast it
goes from here. And I'm thinking about all of the Chinese soldiers who were going into Tibet
murdering nuns and priests and destroying that culture and that similarly they were mostly
people who loved their kids and were moral people before being called into that situation.
And so I'm thinking about when I was reflecting like what does it take for any of this knowledge
to matter? I don't know about the other speakers. I hate public speaking. You were mentioning the
fear of it like this is a miserable experience for me. I feel an obligation to have more people
understand more of the situation they find themselves in and hopefully care more deeply.
One last thing and then we'll go back to your questions. I was on a call with a friend the other
day who has done very successful work in public health globally. It's a good guy, is a good guy
who is used to working on how to make the world better through institutional means the United
Nations and things like that. And he engaged on some projects that we were working on regarding
artificial intelligence risks and synthetic biology risks which are not obvious on the map
shared earlier. The map shared earlier we're talking about largely the effect of industrial
era tech on planetary boundaries but industrial era tech gives rise to digital era tech which
moves radically faster. When you look at the speed at which GPT got used by 100 million users or
threads then in five days getting used by 100 million users compared to how quick it took the
steam engine to be used by that many people. But also the impact of it and just briefly in case
people don't know because this will add something to the meta crisis to the thesis of what's been
shared so far in terms of the risk we face. The poly crisis is a term more people are familiar with
which is really good. I'm very happy about the poly crisis becoming more aware so that
more common and awareness so people aren't reductively focused on climate or social justice or
whatever one issue they were coming from but recognizing there are many different critical
issues facing the world and that they're interconnected and that there are cascades from
one to the other and they need considered together which is unbelievably important. We more talk
about the meta crisis which is just a slight distinction in terms of it's not just that
there's a lot of different crises and that they're moving towards global catastrophic risks but
that they have underlying dynamics that give rise to them that have to be addressed. But one of
the other distinctions is a different way of taxonomizing the problem space and the issues
of advanced technology get some more emphasis. So probably I mean I know Nick Bostrom and
Andrew Sandberg and Max Tegmark are sweet so everybody here is probably actually fairly aware
of AI risk more than in lots of places but you know there was a some studies done in the US
just in the last couple weeks on the relationship between the publicly deployed large language
models GPT-4 like things but the ones that have been jailbroken so that they don't have the same
restrictions on them and pretty much everyone that has been deployed has either been leaked,
reverse engineered or jailbroken very quickly and the relationship between those and biological
development tools the ability to synthesize genomes of pathogens and things like that and
just asking questions to an AI that can talk to you that knows all of chemistry that is published
on Wikipedia and online knows all of biology knows all of current technology which would normally
be a radically huge team needed to do that and being able to ask questions like which companies
provide gene synthesis tools that are not government monitored where I can buy gene
synthesis tools without triggering oversight and what are the most virulent pathogens and
how many people could I kill for a hundred thousand dollars and questions like that and it answering
and this is totally nuclear weapons level catastrophic capability but unlike nuclear
you just have to have an information packet to be able to use it the knowledge of how to do that
travels the speed of light on the internet radically decentralized can't be limited to G8
and so the and yet from the economic perspective of what every speaker today was talking about
exponential curve goes up software seems like the answer to planetary boundaries right because
we get to keep getting more economic growth without having to use as many resources per dollar
awesome we're definitely moving forward as fast as possible with AI in the US and the hope that
it'll fix the stagflation and allow us to deal with the economic situation but it's dual use
it's omni use it's basically meaning you develop it for one purpose but it enables everybody to
do every purpose that they have and the radical enablement of the distribution of human purposes
as they exist today super problematic but the the thing that I was talking to my friend about
is we were working on these issues how do we regulate that type of AI and that type of synthetic
biology that has nuclear level catastrophic capabilities but that non-state actors can get
and he was suggesting to me that uh oh we have to that he'd already made action on this we have
to make a public-private partnership where we get all the big AI companies and all the big
synthetic bio companies involved because they're the only ones who know the information and they're
the only ones that can move fast enough because government moves too slow and they'll be able
to come up with the regulation for themselves and he's serious he was actually serious about this
and I'm like are you kidding are you kidding about this and I like and I said we can't have any
revolving doors in this the people who are regulating the tech cannot have a vested interest
in the tech not getting heavily regulated and he got so frustrated at me it's like Daniel
everything in DC is rotating doors and I'm like I know that's why we're gonna go extinct
and he got so frustrated he almost had to hang up because he's like you're being so unrealistic
because this is how regulation in the world works and I'm like you're being so unrealistic
you're pretending a biosphere can continue to exist and the issue is that he was grounded in
the reality of human history as it has been so far and I was trying to ground in physics and
biology because we don't get to change those in the same ways and the two aren't compatible
so I have to be unrealistic to history as it has been so far if I want to be able to think about
how to make a human technological civilization compatible with the biosphere and itself and
its own continuity and I think yeah one thing like if I'm gonna express what I was reacting to
today is that I do believe we're at the end of history like eminently in the lifetimes of everyone
in this room we're at the end of history meaning we're at the end of a human civilization defined
by the major defining characteristics that what we call written human history from early Egypt or
Sumeria or whatever was defined by which is the it didn't if you had a peaceful civilization and
Genghis Khan wanted that area or Alexander the Great wanted that area your peaceful civilization
was wiped out and the same is true if you have a if you want to internalize all of the cost of
carbon your country is going to get destroyed geopolitically by whoever externalizes that
cost and concentrates the profits that the thing that has been more successfully dominant extracted
more grown its population more increased its violence capability wins and that thing with
exponential tech at planetary boundaries self-terminate so either we're at the end of our species
or we're at the end of our species being defined by those parameters
and the end of our species being defined by those parameters requires
I think the last thing I'll say when I was thinking about the the Nazis and everyone else in those
situations is the famous quote lots of people have said a quote like this that it's the complicity
of the week with the wicked that allows the evils of the world to happen most of the Nazis were
not Hitler but Hitler couldn't have done shit without a lot of people who obeyed most of the
Mongols were not Genghis Khan most of us are not the people that make the choice to
make up bullshit reasons for wars that are false flag for truly economic and geopolitical reasons
but we will still not get in the way of that thing happening the
Iraq war that started all of the recent rounds of wars because of the weapons of mass destruction
that we knew they didn't have where are the prosecutions for that because four and a half
million people were murdered as a result of that there are a small number of people who
are motivated by power exclusively pretty exclusively and then there's most everyone else
who just needs to pay the bills and not rock the boat too much and wants to feel like they will
do good things within the confines of that so I guess I don't I don't want people to think about
how to make their own life regenerative because it doesn't matter I don't want people to think
about how to make Sweden regenerative I want people to think about what it would take to turn
the entire arc of humanity factoring what is currently driving it and that everything else
that you could do doesn't matter at all because the end of the possibility space of all meaningful
human activities is eminent if we don't do that that's what I'm reflecting on
wow what do we take it from here do you want to do you think it was any like missing perspectives
or anything we need to add to the previous models or do you rather think we should go into like
this is not sufficient what is then a sufficient solution to you
yeah we didn't talk about war in the previous models very much let's talk about war
when we study history we study war a lot because history is very significantly defined by war
right now we're talking about markets as the defining characteristic markets and war
co-evolutionary structures they're both structures of how to grow and empower populations and
rival risk conflict with each other in fact you can think about what we call war as kinetic warfare
zero-sum type competition using bombs and guns and stuff and you can think about what we call
economics as economic warfare political warfare diplomatic warfare narrative warfare
and von Klausowitz's famous statement that war is politics by other means
and so I think understanding the role of conflict in the ecological crisis is very important
I think you know like the best country on Kate's chart was Costa Rica they don't have a military
also because they don't have extractable natural resources and they don't have some critical
and international thing like a Panama Canal or whatever so they they don't have to have the
resources allocated to military and that kind of thing but you know when we look at the history
of warfare we didn't have the ability and war to destroy everything until world war two and world
war two was a minute ago in historical terms and at the end of world war two there were about
two billion people on the planet which was already a forex jump from what there was for
all of human history till the industrial revolution right until until the industrial revolution we
didn't have the type of tech that could destroy the biosphere because you can't over fish the
oceans with fishing rods right you have to over fish the oceans you have to have massive industrial
fishing equipment and on and on so all of human history only brought us to half a billion people
until the industrial revolution and then we're like oh look how awesome the Haberbosch mechanism is
but corresponding to we can feed a lot more people is all of the planetary boundary issues
we're hitting now just a couple hundred years later because we went from half a billion to
eight billion overnight but we went at world war two we were up to two billion but only two
billion that means we went from two billion to eight billion since then and that's because part of
the solution to don't use these nukes was radically grow the economy via globalization the globalization
solution which was which was key to the post world war two how do we have the superpowers not war
because throughout all of history there have not been long periods of peace or the superpowers
don't work because because the superpowers are run by power oriented people and and who want more
stuff and they get more stuff by taking other people's stuff and so but now with nuclear bombs
we have a war that nobody can win so for the superpowers to not war they'll still have proxy
wars which we've had they'll still have wars on the global south they'll have wars on the environment
but they can't have a direct kinetic war and so the answer was let's connect the whole global system
and there was some brilliance to this through globalization so that we don't want to bomb
each other because we're bombing our own supply chains you have to think about this when you
start thinking about localization because if you make things more local and we're not interdependent
on each other we have less disincentive to bomb them right so that was one of the reasons for the
radical globalization but it did of course create these radically complicated fragile
supply chains where if anything happens and they go down everybody's fucked and we saw that in
covid right we saw that to stop the travel of the pathogen fertilizers and pesticides weren't
able to move and you got locusts in north africa in the middle east and you got crop failures in
india and like that but the let's radically financialize and deregulate the world so that
everybody and globalize the world so that everybody can have more stuff and the superpowers
can have more stuff without having to take each other's stuff did produce 75 years of
non-kinetic war between superpowers with proxy wars the whole time but it also forexed the population
100x the resource consumption per capita of you know what it was the beginning of the industrial
revolution and developed ai and synthetic bio and cyber technologies and extincted 13 species a day
so when we look at that picture if we start to degrowth there are a lot of people who are like
no i would rather not have less i'd rather there be less of other people's people and i think that
we can win the war so one of the challenges to degrowth is that that has been the only thing
that's prevent the the growth equation has been the only thing with these kinds of
people and patterns that have prevented world war three kinetically so we have to factor that
so i think the role of war violence is critical i think the
to add to the story i think the role of advancing tech is critical to add to the story
because when we're largely looking at the results of the industrial tech that have cumulative effects
the exponential tech allows us to have cumulative effects much faster but also not just cumulative
effects but radically rapid catastrophic effects and then we have to look at the underlying drivers
why can we not stop this thing why is it that no literally no country no company in the world
wants climate change nobody's like climate change is the world that i want
but we're orienting to it so fast and we can't stop and nobody can stop it because we all want
stuff that requires energy that is driving that thing and nobody wants species extinction and
nobody really wants to live in a world with automated AI weapons but we're all racing to build them
so what the fuck is actually driving the world to a world that literally nobody wants
i think there's a deeper analysis of that and the market is a part of it
i i immediately think if should we continue to elaborate that what is actually driving that
do you want to continue over to the market yeah let's come please continue
think about the scale of the market for a minute you have something like a hundred trillion dollars
exchange hands every day and as has been made clear all of that involves energy that is involving
mining and fracking and extraction and pollution on the other side it also even the services sector
depend upon products so all of it has a materials footprint it all requires central banks it all
requires militaries nobody gets to make money in that contract hold without the military
that holds the monopolies of violence and everything in place that keeps that economic
system going so all of those dollars the taxes that they pay and whatever are supporting that whole
system right so norskine is one of the probably larger impact companies around and if you have
whatever a few hundred million dollars to invest and we're talking about a hundred trillion dollars
a day of activity that is right up at planetary boundaries and at the verticalizing part of
the exponential tech curve you know how do you leverage any activity to be able to affect a hundred
trillion dollars a day no longer being harm externalizing that's a question we have to
take really seriously but so that's the size of the economy today and it's obviously growing
exponentially just to keep up with interest and if we didn't grow exponentially you wouldn't keep
up with interest the financial system as we know it would collapse so we have a financial system that
the world that how we meet our basic needs depends upon that is so obviously incompatible with a
biosphere what the fuck we did just do this so ridiculous but so what is the market think of
it as money is a kind of token for value it's a kind of token for game theoretic optionality
where it has no intrinsic value but it has maximum optionality to get me any type of value I want
I can get militaries with it I can get media influence I can change people's minds I can get
materials and because I don't know how the environment's going to change the speed of
adaptive response is the most important thing the OODA loop the speed at which I can respond to the
environment so I don't want a lot of materials that might become less useful I want a lot of
optionality to have whatever I want right and so if you think of money as a proxy for value
but only value that is measurable extractable and exchangeable and all the types of value that on
your deathbed you'll really care about are not measurable extractable and exchangeable we'll
destroy all those types of value in the pursuit of these types and we have to because they are
right and so now think about that as a decentralized incentive system that is
incenting all the 8 billion humans to figure out how to get it because everything else they
want requires it and everything they need to exist requires it the country is relative to
each other the company is relative to each other the people relative to each other and so it
incents them to innovate and it incents them to act on existing innovation so search algorithms
and optimization algorithms right and so you can think of the global market as something like an AI
in an intelligent system that is running parallel process on human compute on human beings
and you know how radically powerful parallel process in the cloud is being able to run a
lot of parallel process on computers did a lot more than centralized supercomputers could do
so this is running parallel process on 8 billion human beings and the clusters of corporations
and countries and whatever to incentivize them all to search new ways to make money and to optimize
on existing ways and whoever gets good at that system gets more power and in turn lobbies and
changes laws and changes cultural values of the media they create and whatever that makes the system
better for them and anyone that opposes that system is also opposing those who are doing well at it
so there is agency to suppress that so the you can think of the global market as a misaligned
superintelligence that is already misaligned with planetary well-being in humans that is
running on all the humans while also running all the humans that also uses all the compute and all
the other technology and that is building all of the narrow AIs in its own service
we said that most of the Nazis weren't Hitler so the the Hitler we're all in relationship to
today is this thing right we can call it mohawk but this kind you can call it the superorganism
you can call it the mega machine and that thing has to die a thing has to die or the biosphere will
die but it's not actually animate it is running on and made up of human action
and so thinking about what would it take to it has to die and or be converted to something that it
is not and the something that it is not is that you can't assess all types of value with a single
value currency a fungible value currency where the real types of value can't be measured there
and where you can destroy real values to get the optionality token for value that that thing there
is no global fungible unitary currency with its own internal financial mechanisms like interest
to create embedded growth obligations there is no system that has those structures that is compatible
with human continuance so that thing has to change and for people in here to have a future
where you don't live in cognitive dissonance if you if you get that then you can't operate within
that thing anymore you have to say fuck how do i change that thing i can't operate within it
because i can't i can't be complicit with an omnicidal thing
so so does it need to break or can we bend it
there is no human future that is compatible with a single fungible global currency
and interest and most of human access mediated by property private property ownership those
things are fundamentally incompatible we can do the math on that sometime back in 2017 i wrote a
series of papers called a new economic series and it addresses a chunk of this stuff
no making the money crypto doesn't solve it
so first can you
the money is supposed to index real value goods and services right like the theory of the market
was people want real shit that will improve their lives and barter is just and there's a lot wrong
with this and you can read graver and others to see what's wrong with this but like very simplified
kind of market apologism uh early market theory a la smith and friends says people want real goods
and services that will improve the quality of their lives how many cows are worth how many
shoes is really hard so we make a unit of currency that's easier to carry around or you don't have
to cut up the cows each time to be able to mediate that kind of barter in exchange and people will
buy the product or service that meets their need the best at the best price so this creates the
authentic demand creates an incentive for other people to figure out supply to be creative and
that it's not money as a measure of extraction but money as a measure of production we're adding
value by putting pieces together in a form that wasn't there and that the intelligent rational
human will pick the thing that meets their need the best and the world will get better right like
that's the gist of the idea and it's supposed to be then that the money is indexing the real
goods and services so how much money is there has to be that within that market you kind of know
how much goods and services to know how much one unit of currency is worth which is why counterfeit
is always illegal because if you just added a bunch more currency that wasn't indexing the
goods and services you'd be debasing the value of the currency but as soon as that the financial
system you start to realize okay well now I have some of this money that is an optionality token
for any kind of value and I can give some of it to someone else I can loan some of it to someone
else so that they can buy the tractors or the horses or the whatever they need to do a thing
or then they will grow the productivity some of that increase gain that they get I should get back
so we call that interest rent seeking or interest and then now we have a situation where just the
reality of interest requires the system to grow the monetary supply now because the population
was growing and because we were technologically innovating the system was growing but now that
we're at a situation where we can't keep growing because we've hit planetary boundaries because
there's eight billion people and a hundred x the resource per capita that there was before industrial
tech the monetary system still requires there to be three percent more money next year and then
three percent more on that which is a compounding curve which goes exponential to not debase the
value of that currency that means you have to exponentiate real goods and services which means
rather than the money following the real economy it's driving it right can you have that embedded
growth obligation is totally incompatible with planetary boundaries so do you have to change
financial services to not have an embedded growth obligation absolutely there's a lot of other
structures that we can get into that have to change now can we bend not break there is immediate
work we have to do because we're so near tipping points we're past tipping points right like if
everybody probably many people in here saw the article that came out about six months ago in the
american chemical society journal about PFOS the fluorinated surfactants and rainwater everywhere
in the world but they are in rainwater like these fluorinated surfactants which affect
endocrine their endocrine disruptors and carcinogens and neurotoxins they're in every
drop of rainwater all around the world that has been studied including snowfall and Antarctica
and they're at levels that are above the EPA and EU thresholds that's not we're getting close to
planetary boundaries that's we have crossed them and the cascade of tragedies we don't know yet
we don't know if we stop using hydrocarbons awesome but if we stop the pollution and these are
forever chemicals what they're still there and they're not just affecting the humans they're
affecting the soil microbes and the algae and everything the gene lines of those things so
we're already past some planetary boundaries we're near other ones there's immediate shit that has
to happen we have to use markets and governments and whatever for that because that's where all the
power is but we have to use them very differently than they so we kind of have to hijack them
and so what does that look like it looks like that the most toxic forms of agriculture that
deplete all the minerals in the soil and use pesticides and herbicides i.e poison that was
designed to kill life and spread all over our food and spread in the ecosystem in billions of tons
of year that shit is subsidized by the governments of the world i.e it's not even market competing
with regenerative agriculture it's being subsidized to to not even allow fair competition of the other
things when it is omnicidal because it's it claims it's the only thing that can produce enough food
to meet food security for national interests no the real reason is because they're fucking better
at lobbying than small farmers are so what's an immediate thing to do do you need lobbying
do you need people who know how to lobby as well as big ag and big pharma and big oil and big tech
who go and lobby for opposite purposes to remove the perverse subsidies that are going to those
and move them to the things that would be better that are still market viable things so that the
market topology changes a small amount of lobbying money can produce a lot of
state money change which can produce a lot of market change because you've changed the topology
of the market these are examples of not changing the underlying logics of the market but working
with them to change the world in the timely things i call this triage and that needs done in a lot of
sectors there's transitional work which is to make the existing systems less pathological how
do we change so how kates work with the doughnut would be an example of in so far as governments
start actually forcing monitoring of externalities and making it illegal so the externalities have
to be internalized in the cost equation that would be a good example in so far as they start to
change the fiduciary responsibility from profit maximizing to things that are not
ecocidal and biocidal and life-side in the process of you know economic viability those would be
transitional and then long term is totally rethinking okay we know how to split an atom now
wow like we go back through the high school physics of how small an atom is
and the fact that we have figured out how to split an atom to actually how to do fusion right how
to how to do this at the level of the nucleus of an atom and we know how to modify genomes of
species and make new synthetic life that never existed before and the fact that we know how to
reverse engineer brains and make these massive neural networks that can do exoflops per second
of calculation this is the fact that we are the major geologic force shaping the surface of the
planet at this time in the Anthropocene that's a lot of fucking power that we have from our
intelligence to think through what would it mean for our species to be wise enough to steward that
power safely what kind of civilization what kind of economic system what kind of governance system
what kind of education system what kind of religious systems of conditioning the sacred and meaning
are necessary to be able to steward the power of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence
and nuclear tech and globalized supply chain industrial tech to steward that safely
that's the long-term work but that we don't get time to do if we don't do these other things
we only have eight minutes left I guess it's like a third question we can fit into that
I mean hearing all the messages of today's presentations hearing you now
just a side reflection I'm just realizing this is not only like virtue signaling to sit here
with you it's also like cognitive signaling pretending I understand everything you're saying
that's a kind of good feeling I mean digesting this how how can you not become depressed if you
really take this in because it's quite complex it's just so dark what you're saying and what
we need to do as as society I think people can you hear me okay I think people should let themselves
become depressed I think if they are not they're they're so schismed inside they're not it's hard
to even think of people as humans if you can know the reality of what's happening in factory farms
and just be stoked it's not not my problem if you can know how many kids are in the sex trade
globally if you can know what the destruction of species looks like and you aren't depressed
there's something really wrong with you but the reason you're depressed if you let yourself be
the reason that you might not be is because you won't let yourself be either you're actually an
obligate sociopath that just can't feel shit or you won't let yourself be because it's overwhelming
and you don't know what to do with that trust that let yourself go there anyways and then recognize
that the reason you're depressed is not just what it means for you but because you because you love
animals and the animals that are being destroyed are not that different than your dog and because
you love kids not just your own and the other kids that are being in totally fucked situations
and the future kids that won't have a chance at life are not that different than your kids
and the reason for the depression at all is because life is actually beautiful and sacred
and the depression is recognizing the destruction of the sacred
but then there's like okay well i'm here and i have some agency i have some capacity
i can do something about it i don't know how to yet but i'm not going to let myself do anything
other than figure out how and then act on that then when it's insufficient figure out how
as opposed to i'll wait till someone else figures it out or when i figure out how even
though i'm not allocating time to trying so yeah i i want people to feel the depressed
depression and the outrage and the fear because it means that they
are not just deadening themselves and fragmenting inside and then i want them to not allow themselves
the cognitive dissonance to forget and just care more about the messages that came in today
that totally don't fucking matter in comparison and then i want you to realize that you can't
focus on the bad guy over there and and then you also can't let yourself stop or not act
because you don't know how but you also can't act doing things that you know won't work so you have
to learn you have to try to figure it out and talk to other people that are and and then recognize
that if life was not actually beautiful meaningful and sacred to you would give no shits at all
that it's being destroyed and so don't act out of anger depression and fear act out of that
sense of the sacred and that you are in service to a life that is beautiful to a life with a
capital l a world that is beautiful and that you're at a time when there is a higher possible
consequence of your action than there has ever been for humans and there is an obligation in that
and there is a meaningfulness in that that you don't want to waste
final two and a half minute any any final words that you want to share with us anything that you
think we have missed any like all to action for all of us yeah super highly skilled and
capable and people here with a lot of agency yeah i'm reminded of the the krishna murthy quote that
being well adjusted to a profoundly insane society is not a good measure of health good measure of
mental health it will seem like i'm trying to radicalize you and i am but i'm not trying to
radicalize you i'm trying to talk about the only thing i feel is sane at all in a world that is
completely batshit crazy and then i don't want to moralize you uselessly so you just kind of feel
bad on your way to bed while continuing to do the same shit so the question i was talking
about at the beginning of how does any of this matter a practical thing i would say is that your
social media feed will continue to show you the same shit and your bills will continue to call
it you and your media will continue to show you all the things that it does that are all wrong
and your existing obligations will continue to push on you and that you will not be able to
counter that by memory and will alone you will have to change the feed of what's coming into
your awareness where this comes into your awareness every day so put nate's podcast put the work of
the other people that are waking you up or reminding you of things you know put that on
your daily feed somehow because the whole we are the average of the five people we spend the most
time around our consciousness is influenced by what we're paying attention to make sure that
what is most the truest thing you know is what is getting your attention the most
change who is around you and change the information feed coming to you such that what is most true
and meaningful is what you're getting reminded of the most if you can like literally tonight
start thinking about who you know that reminds you of these things that you can start spending
more time around and send the messages what things you can delete off your phone what social apps
you can just delete what new ones you can add like that's a practical thing that you are that what
is conditioning your consciousness continuously is aligned with what what is most real
