非常感谢侯先生给我们的这样一个精彩报道
我突然感觉自己已经不会说中文了
然后我们看到就是说
当我们这些理科生们
因为大部分在做的可能都是来自于这个
就是跟计算机
或者是人工智能相关的这个专业
当我们在感叹说
软件正在吃掉这个世界
对吧
然后我们人工智能站在竞军
所谓的传统的社会科学
语言学等等这些领域的时候
我们也不要忘记
今天侯先生给我们看到的
实际上现在的人工智能
现在的机器翻译
还有非常非常远的路去走
因为机器它不懂这个世界
它没有一个meaning在这里面
而我们人类却在观察这些语言也好
这个世界也好
它会从各种各样的侧面
来去观察不同的这种pattern
就像我们刚才看到的那个
那首诗一样
你可以从发音的角度
你可以从不同的这个
几个空间形状的角度等等
有多个侧面
所以这个世界还是比我们机器
更加的美好
一个非常真实的这样一个世界
好 那接下来呢
就让我们进入一个互动的环节
看大家有什么问题来提问

Professor Hofstetter
Oh OK
I come from the Suama Club
and I'm also a robotics researcher
I think tell
My name is Shi Xue Song
Sue Song means
see the kind of tree in a rare
My question is about
recent progress on artificial intelligence
and you mentioned
you gave some examples
where machine translation
was awkward or even ridiculous
and you also mentioned
that on some other tasks
like completing goals
or computer vision
or speech recognition
where city of the art
deep neural networks
played quite well
some hard problems
that had been thought to
require high-level intelligence
has not been solved to some extent
so would you share with us
your thoughts on those recent progress
of giving the examples
I fully agree that there has been
some impressive progress
in some of the domains
that you just mentioned
and the question
of course we don't know
whether neural networks
deep neural networks
and deep learning
are going to be able to
go much further
there are lots of problems
with such approaches
adversarial examples
and so forth
we know that there are problems
and we also know
that there are limitations
the reasonperhaps behind
that I gave this talk
in the first place
was that about
a little over a year ago
there were articles in
the newspapers
like the New York Times
and othersthat suggested
that this new technology
deep neural nets
applied to machine translation
had revolutionized
machine translation
and made it roughly
as good as human translation
and as a defender
of the human mind
and somebody who
thinks the translation
is a deep art
I felt
firstly threatened
by that claim
and secondly skeptical
of that claim
and so I
had to investigate it
myself
and I did
and you saw
some of the results
I did it
with many languages
not just Chinese
but I did it
with many languages
and I found that
in the domain
of machine translation
there was no such
it was not at all true
it had come close
to human translation
they had
of course
done something
that was
it was impressive
in the sense
thatyou could take
a paragraph
and cut and paste it
and put it into
your translation engine
and it would be translated
in one second
whereas a human
being might take
ten minutes to do it
and so in a sense
it's very impressive
but it's like
a dictionary lookup
and it's a fast
dictionary lookup
it's not words
but it's phrases
and the phrases
are disambiguated
by context
but of course
it fails
in many cases
and sometimes
it does a very impressive
job
now
in other domains
such as chess
and go
which are far smaller
than understanding
the world
which is
what translation
requires
translation involves
the entire world
chest doesn't
involve the entire world
involve 64 squares
black and white squares
and similarly
with go
it's more squares
more dots
and so forth
but it's a very limited
world
very finite world
and those
in such domains
it does
you get deep neural nets
doing very good things
we don't know
where deep neural nets
are going to get us
you mentioned vision
vision is an interesting thing
there are certainly
impressive programs
that can sometimes
recognize instances
of cats
and what not
very well
but they also can
be fooledby things
that don't
that look
two pictures
that look identical
to a human
it'll say this is a cat
and it'll say something
completely different
for the other picture
because of the adversarial
example
so we still have a long
way to go
in terms of
that kind of thing
I don't know
where we're going
I agree that there
has been a great deal
of progress
and
we
I can't
I'm not a
futurologist
I can't predict
the future
I don't
look forward
to the day
when
if it arrives
in which
computers
reach the
human intelligence
level
I find that
a very threatening
idea
not a
positive one
but
I don't know
where we're going
it seems like
there is
a kind of
momentum
towards
trying to
create
computers
that are
intelligent
I would have
understood that idea
of trying to
create computers
that are intelligent
four years ago
when there was
it seemed like
it was such a
far-off goal
that it was
it was mostly
just a philosophical
hope
but now
when it seems
like it might
possibly happen
we don't know
now
is not a goal
that I
am enthusiastic
about any longer
it's a goal
that I don't
like and
find disturbing
but
as I say
there's
sort of
an unstoppable
momentum
towards it
and
where that
will lead
nobody knows
it's a big
big
big question
nobody knows
in general
the
breakthroughs
in the research
recent years
are also
breakthroughs
in the sense
on the way
to achieve
human level
intelligence
or to think
those are
only incremental
improvements
and
those works
ever
changed
your mind
on human
recognition
and
artificial intelligence
do think
there are
any statements
in the
G.E.B
to be
revised
there's no
there's
not a word
of
G.E.B
is going to be
revised
there's not going to be
another
edition
I understand
but
what I think
you mean
of course
is
would you say
that some
of the things
in G.E.B
are wrong
and yeah
of course
I made
some wrong
statementsin
G.E.B
which
I
let me say this
for the benefit of
or just
for the sake of clarity
when I wrote
G.E.B
back in the mid-1970s
I stated
very emphatically
and firmly
and definitively
that I
believed
that there was
no reason
computers could
not become
fully intelligent
there was
nothing about computers
that would
be
intelligent
as
people
however
that was
a theoretical
statement
anin-principle
statement
it wasn't a statement
that computers
then were
as intelligent
as people
or that
they were about
to become
as intelligent
as people
or that
in 50 years
they would
be
as intelligent
as people
it wasn't
stating anything
like that
at that time
infinitely far away
from such a goal
at this time
I'm not so sure
that we're infinitely far away
and you use the word
breakthrough
and I think the word
breakthrough can be heard as
it can be heard as
enthusiastic
that is
a breakthrough
is usually considered
to be a positive thing
right
but I think
if there are
breakthroughs
or revolutions
or something like that
they make me sad
rather than happy
I don't want to
there to be
breakthroughs
I don't want there
to be revolutions
I don't want there
to be
things that will
suddenly
make computers
leap ahead
and surpass us
inintelligence
I don't want to
see that
and
you know
that's a long story
I don't have any answers
to your question
whether
incremental
or giant leaps
that have been taken
I don't know
there have been
some impressive things
that have been done
we'll see where it goes
I don't know
thank you very much
yes
hello
professor
侯大人
my name is Wang Pei
in order to
attend this
interesting because
Wang Pei was one of the
translators
the same name as
that translator
in order to
attend this
event
I prepare
short essay
and I want to
present my thoughts
about the
artificial intelligence
so
well you can't
read an essay
yes
no no no
not now
give me some minutes
no no no
no no
no no
that's not appropriate
a question
is supposed to be a question
not the reading
of an essay
ok
大家还是尽量
提问
ok my question
其实跟对
他刚才讲的这部分
关于GV5
待会儿话还有一块
I'm sure your essay
is well thought out
and I respect your
essay
but I don't think
it's appropriate
to read an essay
out loud
as a question
I think that's wrong
ok
I'm sorry
my question
ok I ask a question
yeah
in your new book
you explore the theme
that the analogy
is very important
to help us
that what is important
the analogy
analogy is
analogy
is very important
to help us
to understand
the essence
of intelligence
but
obviously
making analogy
needs to find
the similarity
the similarity
between two
appearing
difficult things
in order to achieve that
needs many
daily experiences
including emotion
and feeling
and so on
so do you think
even if we
understand
the key role of
making analogy
we still
be far away
to understand
the general
mechanism
of intelligence
what's your
point
about the right
yeah
no that's
a very good
question
I think
that
you put
you put
your finger
on something
very important
which is emotions
and I agree with that
totally
for me
thinking and emotions
are inseparably connected
inseparably
they are linked intimately
you can't have
thinking without emotions
because emotions
means
having preferences
I like this
better than I like that
I meanhow could I possibly
have come up with a
take that last thing
that I just did
ok I just
went through that
long way poem
you saw that
I felt emotional about it
I said to myself
how is it possible
that nobody did
a 20-syllable thing
that puzzled me
that experience
of puzzlement
was a frustration,
a confusion,
a kind of a
I don't know
outrage
the next thing was
I tried very hard
I looked and I looked
it was curiosity
intellectual curiosity
desire
I was fascinated
I was
I had a passion
to try to find
20-syllables
four per line
that excited me
it was exciting
then once I had done
that I wanted to take
then I saw
there were flaws
and I thought about it
I saidtake those
commas and periods away
take the capitals out
this was exciting to me
then each stage
that I went through
further
was emotional
it gripped me
it was a passion
I couldn't possibly
inconceivable
for me to come up
with that translation
without being
a deeply emotional
human being
emotions
were behind
that translation
from beginning
to end
everything
was emotional
so you're
absolutely right
and analogies
I assume
you were not
at my talk yesterday
right
you were not
at my talk yesterday
no
well I talked about
some analogies
that involved emotions
and many analogies
emotions are at the core
of analogies
and I gave some examples
I'm not going to
give them today
but you are
completely right
emotions are
very central
to thinking
and have to be
part ofwhat thinking
is all about
absolutely right
and I
preciate that
contribution to the
discussion
it's very very good
thank you
the next one
alright
hi professor
I'm a sophomore
of USSP
I'm in my
gap counter now
I have a
question about
analogy
I mean
I highly
agree that
analogy can be
regard as
fuel and fire
of our thinking
but how
does this fire
in a new way
in our science
and common sense
I mean
even now
reductionism
and logical reasoning
are still
dominate
approaches
to science
so
how will the
awareness
analogy
influence and
guider
or scientific research
in the future
I mean
do you believe
there will be
a paradigm shift
in science
which bases
on the analogy
and the metaphor
I understand
your question
I think that
that
you're wrong
about the nature
of science
all good
science is based
on analogy
and always has been
I know that
but I
I mean
the reductionism
is dominant
is dominant
in both
science now
I mean
we should put more
effort on
the essence
of analogy
in science
well let me
I still
let me
let me
I'll try to reply
to your question
I mean
the great scientists
you know
I'll take physics
that's the science
that I know the best
but say
Newton
and Faraday
and Maxwell
and
You know
Helmholtz
Planck
Boer
Einstein
Dirak
Schrödinger
Heisenberg
and on
and on
and on
I look
the fundamental
discovery is made
by these people
because I
I gave a course
on analogy
making of the physics
and it turned out
that every
single discovery
made was made
through analogy
through some kind
of logical reasoning
it was made
through analogy
and
nobody
all profound insights
come
at manner
and
very often
what happens is
that the analogies
that gave rise
to the deep insights
get buried
and get forgotten
and then only
recessed
unicates
are
given
and
are
sort of
defended
as if
they were
logical
as if
they had come out
of some kind
of pure
logical deduction
principle
but
when you go
backto the
history
of science
and actually
see how
the things
were discovered
it turns out
that analogy
is how

Bien took her to the zoo and she knows everything about the giraffe
I think that it's very good knowledge.
Do you know all about the giraffe?
Commun bearcibe the evolution.
Maybe this is due to the learning in the past.
What she is one year old or two years old.
One of the way to do is to start a new field learning is to make learning.
I think that the study of digital arts
不然Google Machine Translator sometimes makes mistakes
because it mainly care about the current sentence
just as this current sentence
not about the sentence in the context of the situation
where it came from
Well, it doesn't have any understanding of situations
so it couldn't possibly use the context
because it doesn't understand situations
So my question is
what about add some meta knowledge to the translator
so and how
What you have to do is
you have to add understanding of words
know the words stand for things
the words symbolize the world
they symbolize objects
they symbolize actions
they symbolize relationships
and the phrases stand for things
and if you're doing that
trying to get what Bar Hillel said
was, you know, getting an encyclopedia
he said an encyclopedic understanding
and he said that's utterly comarical
well, it may not be utterly comarical today
because computers are much bigger than they were back then
it's sixty years past
and maybe giving computers knowledge of the world
is a possible thing to do
and having them
interact with the world
in such a way
that words take on meanings
because these words stand for things in the world
that could be thought of as an approach
to the improvement
not only of machine translation
but of machine thinking
and as I say
here we get on to what I think of
a dangerous territory
because once you start going down that slippery slope
who knows where it's going to wind up
who knows whether we human beings
are going to be superseded
by a different kind of creature
superceded meaning
taken over by, you know, rendered part of the past
are we creating
wittingly or unwittingly
our own successors
do we want to create our own successors
or are we just going to ride
the tsunami like a surfer
and say what the hell
this is fun
oops, looks like I've been outmoded
looks like all
I and my children have been outmoded
we are now
trivia compared with computers
that we have created
computational devices
do we really want that
it's not a future that I would look forward to myself
I would like to get off
I would like humanity to get off of the wave
but the wave is compelling to many people
now I don't know in your case
I suspect in your case
it's compelling to be on part of this wave
out of some kind of intellectual desire
but I think in the case of
larger entities like corporations
it doesn't come out of any intellectual curiosity
it comes out of money making
and I think that money making
the desire to make money
is something that is unstoppable
unfortunately
so I'm just worried
that's my feeling
Hi Professor Ho
actually I followed you
to the Qinhua event yesterday as well
I'm a journalist
you can call me Isabel
and I'm not a science major
I was a language major
and then a journalism major
so I guess my questions are more liberal arts
kind of
my question
I have two questions actually
first question
it sounds like
machines may not be good translators
but they are already top players
in chess competitions
and other competitions
and that in itself
and many people are worried
it has already robbed
many people of their jobs
my question is
do you think
it's a big challenge
to us already
no matter how machines are unintelligent
they have already advanced
in a lot of competitions
and beat human beings
in those competitions
that's the first question
you know
I understand
I don't know
how many people have been put out of jobs
and I feel
that that is worrisome
yes and that's troubling
I'm not an expert
on the social impact
of artificial intelligence
I don't know how much of an impact
it has had so far
but of course
as time progresses
we have an ever larger impact
that's clear
for example we hear about
the idea that
drivers of taxis
and drivers of uber
and things like that are going to all be replaced by
machines
and so forth
I heard the other day
indirectly through a friend
that there was an attempt
to get a computer
program
or piece of software
hardware whatever you want to call it
to do simultaneous translation
at a conference recently
I don't know where
and I'm not aware of what
I don't know anything about it
and I was told by the person involved
that it was not a very big success
she didn't use
she used a word that was a little bit
less flattering than that
but she wasn't very negative
she said it just didn't work very well
something like that
and I was very delighted
to hear that
and I was
I wasn't surprised
I thought it sounded like
a very
unlikely thing to succeed
but at the same time
there's a professionthat might be considered
to be threatened
I certainly hope it won't be
and it would be shocking to me
if it were
but I can't predict
what is going to happen
so yes, I am worried about it
I dislike it intensely
but I had not foreseen this kind of thing
back in 1975
when I was writing GEB
I had not foreseen the idea
that there would be things
that would be
challenging humans in very human
domains
I had not expected that
I thought computers were always
for the next few hundred years anyway
going to be way below humans
that was my intuition
and that's what I expressed
in some of the passages
in GEB
that turned out to be somewhat wrong
it's shocking
and troubling to me
so that's the reaction
of one person
ok, my second question
is actually there are
robot journalists now as well
Tenson has a dream writer
who can write scripts
without human intelligence
and it has already
well many journalists are
in the threat of losing jobs
and so we are all deeply
terrifiedand it sounds like
you are also very worried
because you are afraid
of what will happen
when AI has really advanced
out of our expectation
but say if instead of when
ok, but the thing is
history evolves
no matter what we want
and what will happen will happen
so no matter how
unwilling we are
of this technology advancing too much
if it's going to happen
and
what should we do now
to
kind of how to say
to keep the value
of the human intelligence
no matter how technology advances
in the speed that we cannot imagine
you are asking questions
that I have no answers to
I couldn't possibly tell you
how we should prepare
but
you know I don't know
the answers to such questions
but
I will tell you that
I have been worried
about this
about this kind of scenario
by the way
you say that there are robot
journalists who can
they might put you out of a job
I find that
very very unlikely
but I mean
it is far too complex
Google Translate
can't even understand
the box was in the pen
it doesn't even understand
much
so I don't
that there are going to be programs
that can write better tech
so then it's a million times more complicated
than boxes being
plicated in pens
so
if they can do so
extraordinarily limited domains
if they can do so
it's only anextraordinarily limited
domains
if I'm proven wrong
ok what can I say
but I'm extremely skeptical
of this happening
the other thing
that I wanted to say though
is that for about 25 years
I've been worried about the future
of artificial intelligence
getting progressively
more worried
but at the same time seeing
all sorts of
evidence that we're not
anywhere close yet
like I just showed today
but there are books
written of course
about the so called singularity
by people like Ray Kurzweil
and Hans Moravec
write about the future
Hans Moravec
who is a roboticist
a famous roboticist
wrote a book
called I think it was called
mind children
mind children
and in it he envisions
a scenario in which
computers take over
they're much smarter than we are
but they're not only smarter
they're also more compassionate
more generous
more cultured
they're just better than we are
and he says
what could be better than to produce
one's own successors
he says this is great
mind children they will be our successors
I mean let's put it this way
I once wrote an article
I called it who will be
we in 2493
the word we is a tricky word
we the people in this room
use it to talk about
humanity
but how about
we a thousand years ago
can I say
what were we doing
what were we doing a thousand years ago
what were we doing ten thousand years ago
what were we doing a hundred thousand years ago
who does we refer to
who does we refer to when I say
I hope that we will be
wiser in the future
who is it referring to
three thousand years in the future
what if we
three thousand years in the future
is not the people that were created
by sexual intercourse
but people
things entities
thinking things that were created
by technological advances
and their computational
beings they are our successors
they are our mind children
and they're better than us
they're nicer and smarter
and more creative
and more generous
well maybe that's what
that's what Hans Moravec
says he welcomes that
he thinks what could be better than
to have given rise to mind children like that
that would be the best possible outcome
that's his view
I can understand that
when I look at the world today
all I see is conflict and horrible things happening
and I think these human beings
are not so great after all
even though I admire the human mind
the world is filled with
disgusting horrible things
maybe if we could create a race
of thinking entities that is kinder than us
maybe that's better
maybe that's the best
it's not what I really like but
maybe that's the way we're going
as you say history happens
things evolvewe can't stop it
maybe it'll be better
maybe it won'twe don't know
好
那我们那个就是
现场提问这个环节就是
占告一个段落
然后下面进入我们的第二部分
也就是关于这个
大家都熟知的这个
G.E.B.这本书
就是哥德尔埃射巴赫
这本书呢首先就是
我想表达一下
就是他对我的影响
实际上在2003年的时候也是我们
极致俱乐部的最开始的一个
这本书深刻的影响了我
一本书呢就是这个
complexity
但不是这个后世达的那个
学生翻译的那本而是一个
叫work job 一个人
然后技术的是盛塔飞研究所的故事
这本书让我
让我决定就是走到这个
复杂性这个领域里面来去做研究
然后第二本书呢就是
这本G.E.B.
哥德尔埃射巴赫
这本书影响了我
你一辈子就干这个了
对 第一本书还不足以让我下决心
但是第二本书让我下决心
然后下了这个决心以后其实才有
慢慢有的这些网站
才愿意去奉献很多的时间去做这件事情
所以对我影响是非常的深
然后后来到了这个
大概是09年10年左右的时候
我们开始
极致俱乐部组织线下的读书会
reader group
to read G.E.B.
这本书
在这个过程之中
有非常多有意思的事情发生
我就举一个非常简单的例子
就是在当年
在这本书里面
那么其中有一个小小的实验
非常有意思
就是我们可以把一个摄像机
和一个电视连在一起
形成一个视觉的一个反馈回录
这样的话你摄像机射出来的画面
直接就反馈到电视屏幕上
然后呢 但是这个还不是关键
因为关键的时候
是在于
这款有一个简单的视频
关键是在于
你这么反馈以后
你会看到就像两边镜子对着照
形成一个无穷远的一个
corridor 一个走廊
但是更有意思的是
摄像机上有一个旋钮
叫做zoom in
你可以放大这个画面
所以当我们看到一个无穷远的一个
亮点的时候
我们可以zoom in 把它放大
就非常有意思
当你调那个参数
就brightness 还有一个对比度
这些东西 你调合适的这个时候
它就会突然产生了
复杂的分形结构
这里面是其中的一个摄像机
射出来的结果
如果你换不同的摄像机
特别是那些低保真的
那种模拟的线路的那种摄像机
你看到的是另外一番景象
很像那种星系的爆炸宇宙的产生
所以当时
我在自己加 试验出这个结果的时候
我就真的是被垫倒了
被雷劈的那种 记住的那种感觉
然后后来我们在极致俱乐部
曾经花过一整天的时间
我们大概有10个人左右
没干别的 就一直在做这个实验
这是当天的一个情景
就是我们在做那个实验
在3号会所嘛
现在3号会所已经拆了
所以从这个角度来说呢
实际上我们已经明明之中跟
侯时达先生
有一个这种联系
就是跟鸡币有这种联系
所以呢 就是为了表达
就是对这个
我又说错了 侯导人先生
这样一个敬意
也是对这本书 鸡币的这个敬意呢
我们送上我们准备的这个礼物
谢谢大家
这就是本书
它是设计了
很多的设计
这本书
Picture
So
This is
Actually the Chinese name is
科学的机制
Because our club is
机制俱乐部
So we use the same pronunciation
科学的机制
And the second title is
Introduction of Artificial Intelligence
And within this book
There is a chapter
我又转换成英文了
在这个书里面有一个章节
就是在介绍这个鸡币
实际上整本书都是在做
在对这个人工智能
做一个总体上的
一个概栏性的一个介绍
其中一个章节就是
我写的就是在介绍这个
鸡币这本书里面的内容
所以也是
也希望那个侯先生
能够那个来读一读我们这个

Okay after that
We like to
Ask you to say something
About GEB this book
Maybe you do not like to say
To repeat the content of GEB
But you can talk about the feedback
From the readers
And of course you can talk about
How can your idea
Evolve from GEB
Into maybe the surface
And the essence
You can say something
I appreciate what you suggest
That I talk about
But I decided I would talk about something else
That's fine
I guess it's too tempting
To say I'm not a robot
So I won't say that
I want to go back and talk about GEB though
I want to talk about how it evolved
And then how the translations evolved
I think that's an interesting thing
To talk about some of the things
So GEB was originally
Something that I was thinking about
When I was revisiting
Girdle's theorem
As somebody who was in his late 20s
I had been fascinated by
Girdle's theorem when I was a teenager
And I was revisiting it
After an absence of about 10 years
And all of a sudden
I connected the ideas of self reference
Well I think I had already done it
When I was a teenager
But I had never done it explicitly
Explicitly I started thinking
That the ideas in Girdle's proof
Were closely connected to my vision
Of what consciousness
And a human eye
Capital eye to war are
So I started writing a book
In the early 70s
And I worked on it very hard
And I'm not going to tell about that
But in 1977
When the book was nearly finished
I became a professor
At Indiana University
And one of my first friends
Was named Don Bird
And Don was a computer scientist
Who was fascinated by music
Or he was a musician
Who was fascinated by computers
Both ways
And we had a lot in common
A great deal in common
We became very close friends
Well eventually GEB came out
In 1979
And well
Before it came out
About two months before it came out
I was sent six copies
Of the book in a box
And I gave one of them
Immediately to Don Bird
Who was thrilled to have
One of the first copies in the world
And then a couple
A few weeks passed
Two or three weeks passed
And Don was walking
Across the campus of Indiana University
And he saw somebody
Carrying a copy of GEB
And he had no idea
How it was possible
The book hadn't yet been published
As far as he knew
And here was some random person
Carrying a copy of GEB
Don excitedly went up
Ran up to him and said
Where did you get that book?
The guy said
Oh, I was over at Howard's bookstore
Now Howard's bookstore
Was Bloomington's best bookstore
At that time
It was rather small
It was about the size of this room
And David
This was more doorway
As it turns out
David had been there
Earlier that day
Maybe an hour earlier
And he had walked in
And right at that moment
Howard was opening
Howard the owner
Was opening a box on the floor
He was pulling open
A box of books
Now the reason Howard had
Pre-publication copies was
That his was the bookstore
In Bloomington
Which is the city
Where the author resided
And they wanted to have
The first copies
Go to Bloomington
And so the box
Was the first box of GEB
That was being opened
In any bookstore in the world
David watched Howard
Open the book
So the box
And he's looked at the title
And he said
I'll buy that book
He picked it up and bought it
He was the first person
In the world to buy GEB
The first person
And Don saw him
About an hour later
Walking across the campus
Don started getting
To become friends with David
And he introduced me to David
And we became very good friends
Of course David's name
Was not Motawe
David's name was David Moser
And David did not know
One word of Chinese
He had grown up in Oklahoma
Which is a state
In the middle of the United States
And his parents didn't speak
Any foreign languages
And David didn't speak
Any foreign languages
He had studied French
And German a little bit
But he didn't speak
Any foreign languages at all
Well, but he loved language
He was a writer
Principally a writer
And he was also though
At the same time
A music graduate student
A student of composition
And so Don and David
Became very good friends
And I became a very good friend
And then it turned out
That Don and David
Both moved to Boston
In 1982 or so
1981 or 82
Well, I had a sabbatical
Year coming up
And I for some reason
That I don't remember
Clearly decided to go
Spend it in Boston
At the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
In 1983,84
And one of the principal people
At the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
A hero to many people
In artificial intelligence
And probably most of you
Know this name
Was Marvin Minsky
And Marvin Minsky became
A good friend of Don's
A good friend of David's
A good friend of mine
And a good friend of my friend
Dan Dennett
A philosopher of mine
We all used to hang out
At Marvin Minsky's house
In the evenings
Not every day
I mean but often
And they would often
Order Chinese food
And so there was a good
Chinese restaurant
Just around the corner
And so one day
The Chinese restaurant
Bought the food to the house
And they put it down on the table
In little white boxes
And on one of the boxes
I saw the following shape
Gee
Gee
Two lines
And I said oh
That's probably chicken
And because you know
Gee or Gee
Depending on what the context
Gee
I said that's probably chicken
And on another one
I said oh that's probably rice
And David
Looked at me
Oh I forgot to say
About David
I have to say
He grew up in Oklahoma
But his parents
Despite not speaking
Any foreign languages
Always had international students
Living with them
There was a small university
In the town that they lived in
And they always had
International students
Some of them were from Africa
And some of them were from China
And David had been surrounded
By Chinese people
Ever since he was little
But he didn't know
A word of Chinese
And he assumed
That it was impossible
For somebody who was not
Born in China
To speak Chinese
He assumed that that was
An impossibility
A contradiction in terms
You had to be Chinese
In order to speak Chinese
And here was Doug Hofstadter
Looking at something
And saying
This must be chicken
And this must be rice
And he said
That's crazy
He is able to
Understand those symbols
Oh my god
Maybe I could do it too
And so I said
He got all excited
This is about the role
Of emotions and thinking
Talk about emotions
He got so excited
And I said
David look
I've been studying Chinese
For a couple of years
A few years
I have a wonderful book
That I like
How about if I record
The first few lessons for you
I'll just go through it
Read it sentence by sentence
And he said great
So I recorded
The first eight lessons
In the Chinese
Reader that I had
By John de Francis
And I gave
The little cassette tape
To David
And that way
That was David's
First lessons in Chinese
I was Maudawe's
First Chinese teacher
Hodauren was Maudawe's
First Chinese teacher
Unfortunately
I can no longer teach
him anything in Chinese
Well, I may be one
I might know some unusual
Character
That he doesn't know
Character
Anyway
That's not the point
He's infinitely better
Than I am
But so that was
That was kind of funny
David then came
First he went to Taiwan
And he studied Chinese
There and then he came
To Beijing and became
Part of the translation team
Along with Guo Wei
And other people
Many other people
Wang Pei and Yan Yong
And Liu Haoming
And others
And they had a wonderful
Time
And David did
Shangsheng
On television
And so forth
David became
A very famous person
In China
So but I jumped the gun
Because I forgot
To tell you something
Interesting
In 1980
After GEB came out
I realized that it had
The chance of being
Translated into another
Language
But it was so filled
From beginning to end
With word play
And playfulness
And games
Games isn't quite
The right word
But playfulness
And puns
Shuangguanyu
And so forth
It was all filled
To the brim
With such things
I wanted them
To be reproduced
I didn't want them
To be explained
In a foreign language
Reproduced doesn't
Mean copied exactly
It means approximately
Something similar
I wanted translation
To be done by analogy
And so I spent
A year
1980-81
Annotating a copy
Of the book
I had a copy
Of the book
And I every page
I wrote tons of things
In red ink on every page
Hundreds and hundreds
Of pages
Hundreds and thousands
And thousands of remarks
For translators
I didn't know
Into what language
I just knew
That this was
What translators needed
Then when I found out
There were going to be
Some translations
Into foreign languages
I wrote a cover letter
That was many many pages
Long
Into explaining
My philosophy
Of translation
To these people
And then in 1982
I received a letter
From a person in France
Named of all things
Bob French
And Bob French was
Going to
Was a French translator
He was American
But he was a translator
Of French
From English
Into French
Into English
And he's proposed
Writing
Doing a translation
With his partner
The two of them
Would translate
Into French
And I could just tell
From the letter
That he was extremely smart
And that this would
Be the perfect team
Well, so I went
To France in 1983
And met
With Bob and Jacqueline
And as it happened
David Moser
Was there with us
In 1983
In Paris
As was another person
Ronald Yonkers
Who was going to be
Dutch translator
Of G.E.B.
And so the
If I count correctly
Doug David
Ronald
Bob Jacqueline
Five people
We met day after day after day
In some cafes
In the
The Cartier-Latin
The student
The university area
Of Paris
Day after day
We would discuss
The translation issues
And it was extremely exciting
David was listening
And he wasn't going
To be a translator
Ronald and Bob
And Jacqueline were
David was just interested
And he was making
All sorts of intelligent comments
Little could he have known
Or ever suspected
That he was going to be
Part of the translation team
Into Chinese
A language of which
He knew not one word
At that time
Not one word
And that's really quite
A remarkable story
So that was in 1983
So I think
That's probably enough
Of some of the
Reminiscences about G.E.B.
I wanted to tell you
These things
Because it's a
It's a fun story
I can tell you more
If you have questions
But I thought
That would be a good
Launching point
For some discussions
About G.E.B.
非常感謝
讓我們還是
再一次感謝
所有參與
這個G.E.B.
的翻譯的
真的是非常不容易
我們感謝
