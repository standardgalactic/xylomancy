先简单的介绍一下我们这样一个活动
首先我介绍了我自己
我是来自北京师范大学系统科学学院
现在是一名老师
同时我也是我们今天这个活动的主办方
集职俱乐部的创始人
我的名字叫做张江
然后我们这个活动是我们跟腾讯研究院
一起合办的一个系列活动叫做AI & Society
这是系列活动的第五期
那么我们这个活动主要是聚焦在
就是现在人工智能对我们的社会的影响
以及人工智能技术对社会科学有哪些影响
做一系列的这种讨论活动
当然今天我们非常高兴
就请到了也是我们有史以来
无论是集职俱乐部有史以来
还是我们AI & Society这个活动的有史以来
非常重量级的嘉宾
也就是我们的这个猴道人先生
可能大家对猴老师
可能熟知的名字是猴氏达
但是这里中间其实还是有一些故事
有一些认知上的误差
那么他的现在的英文名应该是猴道人
所以大家这个名字很好记 对吧
猴道人嘛
所以很容易记得
现在猴老师当然是那个
他现在是印第安娜大学
认知科学的这方面的教授和专家
当然他为我们所熟知
主要是有他的这本名著
也就是我们大家都知道的
可能很多人也是根据这本书
莫名而来的
就是戈德尔艾奢尔巴赫
这样一本剧著 可以说
但是今天猴老师会给大家
讲的不是关于这本书的内容
而是他们和战独一起来合作
出版了一本新书
也是我们猴先生和Emmanuel Sander
这是一个巴黎大学的
也是在认知科学方面的一个教授
然后合著的这本书
Surface and Incense
就是这样一本新的
中文翻译版的这个图书
那么好 那接下来呢
就让我们来介绍一下
今天到场的各位嘉宾
他们包括腾训研究院助理院长
陈明霞女士
那么也包括
战独文化创始人韩晏女士
还有这个围草智库创始人
合伙人段永潮先生
还有搜狗科技发展有限公司
CEO王小川先生
还有咱们龙泉寺人工智能
与信息技术中心主任
弦度法师
接下来我介绍一下
今天下午咱们这个活动的流程
首先就是说
我知道大家都非常想
讨论有关及一臂的东西
但是大家一定要耐出性子
然后我们今天首先
当然是由侯士达先生来给大家做
关于机器翻译的这样子的一个报告
然后他做完这个报告之后
大家在过程之中一定要认认去听
然后在做完这个报告以后
我们先有一个讨论
就是关于他所讲的内容
今天所讲的内容
关于机器翻译的
然后做完这个环节结束以后
我们再进入机一臂的环节
首先就是当然是
我们有一个简单的一个回顾
对机一臂的一个回顾
然后其次我们在
包括嘉宾也好
包括听众也好
关于更多的
无论是他前面讲的
机器翻译的部分
还是后面的机一臂部分
来展开详细的讨论
所以大家要清楚这个环节
好
那最后接下来就重报邮情
我们今天的主讲嘉宾
侯导人先生上场
给大家做关于机器翻译的报告
我们在中国
在北京
在汤逊
在这个房间
在这里
所以我们来看看
我们来看看
好
好
我们发现了
转移
然后
转移的过程
这是我自己的新闻
和Emmanuel Sander
和
Bal Yojen
和Hu Hai
和Chan Chi
现在我将谈谈
传统
然后我将返回
传统的那一本
到最后的这个讨论
我只要找到
按钮的位置
然后确认
我能够推动它
对
我知道
我能够推动它
但是我只想
我只想看
那是转移的位置
所以这是我自己的讨论
好
我
我
我选择
谈谈
特别是
谈谈
传统
在中国和英国
还有

答案是 當然我做的
但我寫了在英文
你寫了罪犯罪嗎?
OK
我從來沒有在 Parthenon
你知道Parthanon是嗎?
哪裡是Parthanon?
Sila
對嗎?是在俄羅斯
當然我從Parthanon
但我在Parthanon在Tennessee
What's going on?
I thought I pushed the right button
There's the Parthenon
That's the one I was in
Was I in the Parthenon or not?
Yes or no?
Did I read crime and punishment?
Yes or no?
I read it in English
I read it in English
Did I read it or did I not read it?
Have I been in the Parthenon or have I not been in the Parthenon?
Think about it
What is translation?
What can it accomplish?
OK
I'm going to give you a famous classical poem
Lujai by Wang Wei
You probably all know it
You probably all know it by heart
So let's look at it
Lujai
空山不見人
當文人與響
反映入山林
復照清台上
Stop it
If you've studied Chinese for 12 years
you can't be applauded for saying 20 characters out loud
Please
I don't need applause for that
I did like the fact
the little symmetry inside there
You notice this
I thought that was pretty nice
And it impressed me
and we'll come back to that later
So this is the poem in Chinese
I will now show eight attempts
by thoughtful people
to convert this poem into an equivalent little poem
in the English language
Let's go through them one by one
Starting with probably the earliest one
I don't know if it's the earliest ever
but anyway it's one of the earlier ones
I hope you can read it
If you can't you can listen
And each one of them
I think has a different title
Maybe a couple of them have the same title
Dear Park Hermitage
By the way
The character Jai
I mean of course it's Jai
And I guess it's an old character
I don't really know what it means
I couldn't find it in any of my dictionaries
But I suppose it means something like
a place that somebody lives
I don't know
Or maybe it means a fenced in enclosure
I don't know
In any case
It was the place
That was being talked about
Was a place that Wang Wei lived in
And it was in the country
So just so that you understand
Why it's called Lu Jai
It's not obvious
That it has anything to do with
Dear or an enclosure
Or anything like that
But anyway
So here is the first translation
There seems to be no one
On the empty mountain
And yet I think I hear a voice
Where sunlight entering a grove
Shines back to me from the green moss
You can argue about
Some of these choices
I wish this buttons were clearer
But okay
There seems to be
I don't see where that was
In the original
But it's okay
No one on the empty mountain
And yet I think
In the anthology
From which I took these translations
Or some of them
The person who anthologized
These translations
Was extremely critical
Of almost all of the translations
He attacked
He had 19 translations
Or roughly 19
And he attacked
Almost all of them
Veomently and bitterly
And viciously
Which is very weird
To make a collection
Of translations
Of a poem
And then to say
How bad they all are
But that's what he did
His name is Elliott Weinberger
Now he hated
Wineberger hated the fact
That it's had the word
I in it
He said
There's no I in this poem
Okay
That's a possible criticism
I'm not going to try
To criticize these poems
I'm just going to point out
Some of their properties
Whether I criticize
Is not so important
Okay, the next one
Dear Park
Hills empty
No one to be seen
We hear only voices echoed
With light coming back
Into the deep wood
The top of the green moss
Is lit again
And now here we can say
We, who is we?
I don't know what that one is
I don't know
And what about the top
Of the green moss
I'm not sure about that
But whatever
Okay, just think about it
The Dear Park
Not the shadow of a man
On the deserted hill
And yet one hears
Voices passing
Now it's one
First it was I
Now it was we
Now it's one
Deep in the seclusion
Of the woods
Stray shafts of the sun
Pick out the green moss
Interesting choices
I don't want to comment
Too much on them
I want you to think
About them
Each one of them has its
Let's say virtues
And possibly its defects
So let's go on
Dear Forest Hermitage
That's a pretty long translation
Of Lu Jai
But whatever
Through the deep wood
The slanting sunlight
Casts motley patterns
On the jade green mosses
Well, we started
With the two last lines
I don't know why
No glimpse of man
On this lonely mountain
Yet faint voices
Drift on the air
It's poetic
It's interesting
I'm hard to say
Whether it's
How accurate it is
But it's interesting
Here's one
By a very famous
American poet
Kenneth Rexroth
Who decided for some reason
That I cannot fathom
To use seven lines
Instead of four
Let's look at it
Deep in the mountain
Wilderness
Where nobody ever comes
Only once in a great while
Something like
The sound of a far off voice
What is the background
Noise here
Like it's a radio on
Or something
Oh, okay
That's a little ironic
To be having simultaneous
Translation of a talk
On translation
I mean
I do admire
Simultaneous translators
Enormously
I hope it's not
An attempt by
Simultaneous translators
To do it by machine
Is it human?
Okay
That's very good
I hope they're translating
The comments that I'm making
Right now
Oh, okay
No, I deeply admire
Simultaneous translators
And it's a wonderful art
An extraordinarily difficult art
And so that's
What?
Yes, that's great
That's fantastic
Okay, so now I understand
Why there was noise
In the background
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, great
So deep in the mountain
In the wilderness
Where nobody ever comes
Only once in a great while
Something like
The sound of a far-off voice
The low rays of the sun
Slip through the dark forest
And gleam again
On the shadow we moss
Well, it's pretty amazing
To see seven lines
Divoted to twenty characters
I mean, it's really astonishing
To me
But here we have it
Lots of things here
That weren't in the original
But it's interesting
And I must admit
I like the form
Of course, in the original
It was probably not printed
With centered lines
It was probably all left
Justified
But when they're centered
It makes a pretty pattern
Right?
It's a pretty
Kind of a pretty pattern
So that's something
That I like
Because it kind of echoes
The geometrical prettiness
Of the original poem
Okay
Another one
The Deer Park Village
It begins with a word
That I don't even know
In English
I mean, I've seen it
Maybe a couple of times
In my life
White
No white is seen
In the lonely hills
Round here
But whence is wafting
The human voice I hear
So deep in the forest
The sunset glow
Can cross
That it seems
Just to linger on the moss
Now, the rhythm here
Is very pretty
Very nice
Things like that
It's a very pretty rhythm
And it has rhymes
Although they're not
In the same places
The rhyme pattern
Of the original was
ABAB
Here the rhyme pattern
Is AABB
But it's okay
It's not bad
And the lines are very long
And this funny wence
And wafting
And white
Old fashioned words
But what's wrong
With old fashioned words
To translate a poem
That comes from about 800
What's wrong with that
It's interesting
Alright
We go on
It's another recent translation
In pathless hills
No man's in sight
But still I hear
An echoing sound
In gloomy forests
Peeps no light
But sunbeams slant
On mossy ground
And this one
Does have rhymes again
Sight, sound, light, ground
And ABAB
Interesting
Let's go on to
One last one
By a friend of mine
A very famous author
Vikram Sate
And his is
Empty hills
No man in sight
Just echoes
Of the voice of men
In the deep wood
Reflected light
Shines on the blue
Green moss again
And I think it's
Very pretty
I could make
Many comments on it
But I'm not going to
Because we have to go on
Alright
All of these poems
All of these translations
Involve great thought
On the part of
People who were
Very dedicated to
Trying to render
This poem in English
So many thoughts
About the original
So many thoughts
About poetic traditions
In English
So many thoughts
About Chinese history
About Daoism
About Buddhism
About Wang Wei's life
And times
And so forth
All of these entered
In to the translator's minds
Every line
Involved innumerably many
Deeply subjective judgments
Enormous amounts
Of human thought
Each one is great
In its own way
I would say that
I like them all
I chose ones
That I like
But has any
English language
Reader of any of these
Poems or even of
All of them
Actually stood
In the Parthenon
Of Wang Wei's
Original poem
Have any of you
Stood in the Parthenon
Of Wang Wei's
Original poem
Which was written
About
1300 years ago
Can you
Be in his
Skin
So
Who has
Understood this poem
Most deeply
Very hard to say
Anyway
Some philosophical questions
About the nature of translation
Could there be
A perfect translation
Could there be
A perfect translation
So that you
Once you've read it
You have experienced
Everything there is
To experience
About that poem
Well
Sure
Of course
Machine translation
Will give it to us
Machine translation
Founded in 1947
By Warren Weaver
An American
Mathematician
Statistician
Who wrote this sentence
When I look at an article
In Russian
I say
This is really written
In English
But it has been coded
In some strange symbols
I will now proceed
To decode
Now if you
Read that sentence
And think about it
It implies
That there must be
Exactly one translation
Correct
Because decoding
Is a mechanical process
That leads you
To the right answer
So if there is
A right answer
Then this will
Get it to you
Machine translation
Will give you
The unique right answer
If that's
The philosophy behind it
Long years of struggle
Followed the founding
Of machine translation
And I'm going to go
Jump about 12 years
From the founding
1947
To 1959
When perhaps the most
Famous article
Ever written about machine
Translation
Was written by
Yehoshua Bar-Hillel
And Israeli
Mathematician
And philosopher
And logician
And linguist
And he was very, very deeply
Involved in machine translation
For many years
But in the end
He became very critical of it
Or even though
He was involved in it
And he was an advocate
Of it
He nonetheless
Was very dubious
About its possibility
So let's look at
This very famous article
As I say
Probably the most
Famous article
Ever written about
Machine translation
It was called
A demonstration
Of the non-feasibility
Of fully automatic
High quality
Machine translation
And this, of course
This acronym
FAHQMT
Very awkward acronym
But that's not the point
It became a well-known phrase
That was the goal
For machine translation
Okay
And he's saying
A demonstration
Of the non-feasibility
All right
Here's a part of the article
The task of instructing a machine
How to translate from one language
That it does not understand
Into a different language
That it also does not understand
Presents a real challenge
If in a translation task
Some step has to be taken
That depends on the machine's ability
To understand the text in question
Then the machine
Will simply be unable to make the step
And so the whole operation
Will come to a full stop
This was one of his claims
So I decided
59 years later
Let's call it 60
To be rounded off
60 years later
I decided
To put
Google translate
To a test
By the way
I also put
Many other machine translation programs
To a test
The same test
I did
I did
Microsoft
I did
Deep L in Germany
And other translation programs
So I'm not limiting myself
To just Google translate
But in this talk
I am limiting myself
To Google translate
I try lots of different versions
They're all about the same
They're all about the same
Because they all use the same ideas
Okay
This was taken
This is the most famous case
Of challenge to machine translation
That was ever posed
It was from
Yahoshua Bar Hillel's 1959 article
And here's what it says
Little John was looking for his toy box
Finally he found it
The box was in the pen
John was very happy
Now
If you don't understand this
That's because you may not know
The word pen has two meanings
One is Yuan Zhubi
And the other is Lao
As in Wang Yang
Bulao
And the
So those are the two meanings
And obviously
This is the meaning that was meant
Okay
So let's take a look
At what Google translate did
60 years after
The article was published
Into French
Little John
Searches son jouer boî
Well jouer boî
Is an impossibly clumsy
And meaningless French phrase
Doesn't mean anything
If it means anything
It means a toy
That is a box
If it means anything
But nobody in French
Nobody who speaks French
Whatever say that
The box was in the pen
John was very happy
In the pen
It means inside the fountain
Inside the Yuan Zhubi
That's what it means
Failure
On the most famous
Challenge to machine translation
Issued 60 years earlier
Tried in Chinese
Little John
Searched his toy
I don't know why I put that
And I was told that this was
That I made a typo
I didn't make a typo here
I copied and pasted
From Google translate
Okay
Finally
He found it
The box was in the pen
John was very happy
Okay
So
There
Sorry
Well
I guess I can go to the red
So there we are
Still today
The same problems in Chinese
In French
And of course other languages as well
This is the state of the art
Of MT
60 years after
Yohoshua Bar Hillel's article was written
The state of the art
Okay
His commentary
Anticipating 60 years later
Anticipating it
He says
Why is a translating machine
Powerless to determine the meaning
Of pen in this sample of text
How did he know that 60 years later
It would be powerless to detect the meaning
He was right
The explanation is extremely simple
What makes any human reader grasp
This meaning so unhesitatingly
Is knowledge of the relative sizes
Of toy boxes
And pens
In the sense of writing implements
And pens
In the sense of play pens
So
A play pen, of course, Lao is not a Lao
In the sense of something to keep
Animals in this case
A pen in this case is a play pen for a child
Which is about the size
It's about a meter and a half on a side
And it's got little wooden
Things to keep the baby in
It's got a little mattress
Or a little plastic thing on the bottom
So it keeps a child inside
A small area
That's the meaning of a play pen
And that's what anyone would understand
A translating machine has no such knowledge
When I pointed this out
To one of my colleagues working on memt
His first reaction was
But why not envisage a system
In which the translation machine
Has such knowledge
Understandable as this reaction is
It is very easy to show
It's futility
The idea that a translation machine
Should be supplied
Not only with a dictionary
But also with a universal encyclopedia
Is utterly comarical
If you don't know that word
It means a fantastic
Imaginary ridiculous notion
Impossible
And hardly deserves
Any further discussion
This was written in 1959
Tstate of the art today
Means deep learning
Which is many-layered
Artificial neural networks
Trained with back propagation
I'm not going to go into that
And big data
Enormous bilingual databases
I'm not going to go into that either
But they are very, very, very enormous
That's for sure
No world understanding is involved
Word disambiguation
That is whenever there's an ambiguity
With the word pen
Is made by statistical selection
Based on context
That is based on the surrounding text
To show this technique
I'm going to give you a few
Experiments carried out with Google
Translate just a few days ago
Okay
They all hinge on resolving the ambiguity
Of the word shingles
Which usually means
A kind of roofing material
That's what shingles
Usually means
But it sometimes means
A very painful skin disease
Also nerve disease
I might say
Dai Zhuang
Pao Zhen
It has that meaning as well
So I tried to
A few sentences
Using the word shingles
Allowing it
Trying to give it context
In which it would
Disambiguate the word correctly
So what happens in these cases
The word case here is a bit of a joke
Because a case of shingles
It means a medical case of disease
Okay
He had shingles on his waist
Now that's the most common place
For the shingles disease to take place
Is on your waist
So I gave it a good context
Shingles on his waist
What more could you ask
Output
他的腰上
Slu
一下
Well
Let's try to figure this out
Where did it get that
Slu
What is shlu
Well
Or in particular
This sh
What's that doing there
Slu
Well
That's the sh from here
And then the
I and G
I don't know what happened
But there's the L-E right there
And there's the waist
You know, there's on his waist
So it took the in as being
Some kind of a present participle
Sort of as if it were translating
A verb
All right
Oops
Well, if you don't
If at first you don't succeed
Try try again
Okay
He had a case of shingles
On his waist
Now a case of shingles
Is also ambiguous
Because a case can mean a box
Or it can mean a medical case
All right
But this sounds
Well, let's see what it does with it
Okay
Now the waist
The waist has a piece
A piece
That's a weird word for it
I think you would agree
Would you agree with me
That quai is a very strange
Measure word to use here
Yes or no
Yes
Very strange
So what do we give it
What grade will we give it
Mama
Okay
Sort of it's okay
Kind of
At least it got the idea
It's a disease
Right
Okay
How about the next one
The roofer had a case of shingles
In his pickup truck
Okay
Now in this case
I think it's extraordinarily obvious
That we're talking about
Roofing material
I've said the roofer
Let's see
The roof
Oops
Can we get this back
Control L
Sorry
Command L
Command L
Command L
Command L
Command L
Command L
Alright
The roofer had a case of shingles
In his pickup truck
Okay
So here we have
Wu Ding Gung
On my P Ka car
There's a piece of my P sa
So what grade do we give it
Here
jumple twa,pretty good,alright
now let's go on to the next one
the roofer came down from the hospital roof carrying a case of shingles
now we have the roofer and we have the roof
but we also have a hospital
what's gonna happen now
it's pretty obvious that if you're carrying a case of shingles
it's not on you in the sense of being a disease
alright
google asked me
the following question
it didn't just translate it,it said
oh did you mean the roof came down from the hospital roof
carrying a case of shingles
as if that was a help for me
as if I had mistyped what I wanted to say
and actually the roof came down from the roof
what does that mean
the roof came down from the roof
carrying a case of shingles
thank you very much Google translate for your extremely useful help
no but okay so here we have what it gave
and what I think is very interesting is
it came down from the roofcarrying
it a box of a box of shingles
a box of the disease shingles
the roofer came down from the roofcarrying a box of the disease
well complete and utter nonsense
oh well nobody's perfect
okay a third experiment
okay how about
Kungshan Bujianran
Tanghuan Ren Yu Shang
and so forth
let's see what it does with this
the empty mountain is not seen
oh really
the empty mountain is not seen
that's not what it seems to me it said
but the people reverberate back into the deep forest
to remake the moss
oh I didn't know that's what they were doing
well that's state of the art
what if you what happens if you add punctuation
so I added a comma a period a comma and a period
and now it says empty mountains are not seen
again completely wrong
but people speak loudly
returning to the deep forest on the moss
alright
then what happens if we do it line by line
in other words I just trans
gave it one line at a time
independently
empty mountain people
what does that mean
empty mountain people
if any native speaker of English who hears that
hears mountain as modifying people
so it's saying and empty also as modifying people
so it's empty people empty mountain people
what does that mean
doesn't have anything to do with the original line
but people speak loud
oh okay
returning to the deep forest
on the moss
that's what we have
state of the art
okay
we're not yet standing in the Parthenon
are we
interlude on artificial intelligence
founded in the United States on the United Kingdom
in the late 1940s and early 1950s
driven mostly by philosophical goals
such as what is thinking
can computers think
can computers be conscious
these were very admirable things to think about
and it was natural to use computers to try to figure
and to make a new approach to these questions
a very famous article written by Alan Turing
in 1950 called computing machinery and intelligence
was all about these questions and about whether a machine could think
you probably know this article
I'm not going to talk about it
it's just a very famous and wonderful article
very stimulating philosophically
somewhat later Joseph Weisenbaum
who was a researcher at MIT
wrote a program that interacted with people
it wasintended to be a psychiatrist
or acting like a psychiatrist
who interacted with a patient
and the amazing thing about this program
was that although it knew nothing
and understood nothing
and just used canned phrases
the people who interacted with it and didn't know
what they were interacting with
actually thought that the machine understood
not only their language
but their human psychological problems
they were deceived enormously
and Weisenbaum was very upset
at this fact
and it was called the ELISA
the fact because the program was called ELISA
and the ELISA effect was this idea
was this notion that people
attributed much more meaning
to the words that a computer
would print out
than was actually there
because the only experiences that they had ever had
with language were experiences where the language was generated by
a human being who did know what they were saying
and so it was natural to extend that
idea to the source of the language
even if it wasn't understanding
it was a temptation
and it was a warning that Weisenbaum made
that you should not overestimate
the meaningfulness of words
just because they are printed out by a computer
famous article
over the years
the next couple of decades
three or two or three decades
A.I. slowly drifted from universities to corporations
and philosophical goals got forgotten
replaced mostly by commercial goals
floods of hype
that's a short term for hyperbole
and hyperbole in case you don't know
it means exaggeration
hyperbole is a synonym for exaggeration
floods of hype
such as the term deep learning
and the predicted singularity
many sources of confusion
because the thing is that AI has had a number of
remarkable successes as well as failures
let's talk a little bit about some of the big successes
successes in chess and go as you all know
world champion players today are computers
successes in speech recognition
and understanding of rapid spoken speech
understanding I should not say
understanding I did not write understanding
I wrote recognition because it's not understanding
it's recognizing the words and transcribing them
but there are successes in that
successes in self driving cars
quite impressive
successes in music composition
this is quite dubious
but I've given many lectures on this
and you know I put a question mark here
and I put these
notice the color coding
I change the colors each time
the colors the color coding is meant to suggest that as we go down
and the color changes
this is the most positive and most real success
this is a less strong this is less strong
this is less strong and I put a question mark
the next one will have two question marks
successes in joke creation
very weak actually
and successes in machine translation
three question marks
now you can argue whether it's successful or not
and we're going to talk about that as we go on
another experiment with Google translate
and a first one with Hofstadter translate
okay
I am translating currently
a book by Yang Jiang
which many of you probably have read
我們撒
and it's a story about
well it's a memoir I should say
about herself and her husband
Qian Zhongshu who was a writer
and their daughter
and it's a sad story
but I'm not going to go into that
I just want to give you one little excerpt
that I thought I would
you know
demonstrate
how a machine translates it
and how a human translates it
and talk a little bit about it
okay
so
是定之日
晚饭后
有一位旧有特顾
黄包车从城里赶来
祝贺
客去后
中书
惶恐的
对我说
我以为我要做
南书房行走
这件事
不好
不是好做的
不求有功
单求无过
okay that's the
text that I would like to see what
a Google translate
I wanted to see what Google translate would do with it
so let's look at what it did with it
first paragraph
Google translate
on the day of the event
after dinner
an old friend hired a rickshaw from the city to congratulate
guest to go
the book of fear in the book said to me
so let's just look at this a little bit
guest to go is
客去后
guest to go
and the book of fear in the book is basically
I mean it's it's basically
it's something about中书
being a little upset
but the book of fear in the book is what it said
okay
he thought I had to do south study walking
that's
南书房行走
this is not a good thing to do
not for meritorious service but for nothing
well that's pretty meaningless
okay so those are
serious problems
here's my translation
on the day this position was offered after dinner
an old friend specially hired a rickshaw and came all the way from the city to congratulate中书
but after our guest had left
中书turned to me uneasily and said
he thought I was going to become a south study special aid
that kind of work is not easy
you can't hope for glory
all you can hope for is to do it without errors
thank you
alright
now this phrase south study special aid
I want to talk about
南书房行走 a little bit
because I took me a long time to come up with that phrase
a long time because I had no idea what it was
and I asked my wife who is Chinese
what it meant and she said well
she's always something like a messenger
but she didn't really know what it meant
so I decided I would use Google
but not Google translate
I just put these five characters in quotes
into Google search and came up with a web page
written by a human being
I was my question of course
and here's the web page
I'm not going to attempt to read it out loud to you
but I'll let you kind of skim it
you can take a look at it
give you a 30 seconds to read it
if you wish to
enough time
ok
so you sort of now now
in case you didn't know what a
nanzhu方行走 was
now you sort of know
although you must admit
I think you would admit that this is difficult Chinese
and it took me
a couple of hours to translate this
with the help of Hu Hai
and Hu Hai even didn't understand some of the things
and he had to ask a friend of his
who was a specialist in Chinese history
in order to really understand it all
so I'm not going to show you my translation
I just want to tell you
that I spent a long long time
trying to understand this passage
and when I finally understood it
I then chose the phrase
South study special aid
alright
here is
oh yeah well
South study special aid
ok here is what Google translate
did with that passage that you've just read
and this one I will read out loud to you
South study walking is not an official position
before the Qing era
this is just a messenger
generally by the then imperial intellectuals
Hanlin to serve as South study
in the Hanlin officials
in the quote select Chen Cai
only goods and excellent
unquote into the value
called South study walking
because of the close to the emperor
the emperor's decision to have a certain influence
Yongzheng
later set up military aircraft
the minister of the military machine full time
although the study is still Hanlin into the value
but has no participation in government affairs
scholars in the Qing dynasty
into the value of the South study proud
many scholars and scholars
in the early Qing dynasty
into the South through the study
state of the art
state of the art
complete and utter nonsense
not a sentence that you could understand anything from
Yohoshua Bar-Hilal
back in 1959
only under very exceptional circumstances
will MT be able to compete
with human translation
the reason is that
expert human translators
use their background knowledge
mostly subconsciously
in order to resolve ambiguities
that machines will either have to leave unresolved
or will resolve by some mechanical rule
which every so often will result in a wrong translation
ok let's look at human translation
contrast with machine translation
in particular involving two of my books
one old one and one new one
and I'm going to talk about the translation of GEB later
in more detail
but this is from
we'll first talk about GEB
and then we'll talk about surfaces and essences
so GEB 1979
ok
in roughly 1986
Professor Wu Yunzeng
came to Michigan
where I was a professor at that time
and stayed with me in my house
for about three days
and we had many discussions about translation
and he cited
a famous Chinese authority on translation
Yen Fu
and so
he said that there were three principles
of translation that Yan Fu advocated
and that they wanted to respect these principles
in the Chinese translation of GEB
fidelity
intelligibility meaning clarity
or intelligibility
literally means understandability
and polished style
all the very sensible goals
I fully agreed with them
100%
however
Professor Wu
use this as an argument for translating literally
Professor Ma Shiwen
and Professor Wu Yunzeng
they said that these principles
implied a philosophy of literal translation
supplemented by an enormous number of scholarly footnotes
so that for example whenever there was
a piece of word play in English
they would put a footnote and say
oh this word in English has two meanings
and so you should laugh if you
if you would laugh if you
if you were a speaker of English
and they were going to have thousands of footnotes
in the translation
well I was extremely worried about this
it was the diametrical opposite
to my philosophy
and so my philosophy was the opposite
and I sent
as my representative to China
Modawa
David Moser
who joined the translation team
he says
he claims and I have to believe him
that he didn't translate any of it
but he served as the
the agent
that turned around the team
which was like a gigantic ship
going in this direction
and he managed to turn the team around
and get it to go back in the other direction
with great effort
because they were going in exactly the wrong direction
and finally they wound up doing the right thing
thanks toModawa's
insistence and instruction
it was the only way to go
and it resulted in a very very high quality translation
one example that we talked about
in those early days
when they were working on the translation
was there was a phrase somewhere in the book
I don't know probably in a dialogue
that said speak of the devil
which is short
we never really say the whole phrase in English
we don't usually add this part
we just say speak of the devil
everybody knows what it means
but it's short for speak of the devil
and he will appear
and we say that when
you're talking about somebody
and they show up right then
it's just an amusing way of saying
speak of the devil
ok
so
David and I advocated using this phrase
说淘淘淘淘道
and the team
I don't know if it was all of the team
but basically there was great resistance
and they say
that would make
if you use that it would make it sound
as if the author had grown up in China
and spoke fluent Chinese
and so the response was
well what do you want
you want to speak awkward
stumbling Chinese
so that's what happened
they did adopt that
and they used
corresponding phrases in Chinese
not the translation of the phrase
but the corresponding phrase
the phrase that plays a similar role
in Chinese culture
not speak of the devil
in some literal fashion
so here's a cute case
of transculturation
that I learned about not long ago
in the introduction
there's a section
on musical fugues and canons
which is a round
it doesn't matter
it's not important
what a canon is
it talks about a three part canon
on the famous
English children's song
three blind mice
it doesn't matter
that it's about
three blind mice
what it matters is
that it's about a familiar song
to English
speaking readers
so in the Chinese version
this was replaced
by a canon on this tune
Bao Wei Huang He
that's a cute example
alright
and who was the author
of this big book
how about
was it the son of
Luo Bo Te
Huo Fu Shi Ta Te
that was it
Dao Ge La Si
Huo Fu Shi Ta Te
was that who
wrote the book
well it would
seem to make sense
because my father
already had
a Chinese
transliterated name
that was
my father's name
right there
according to
the Chinese people
so they didn't
use that though
they didn't
do that
they decided
to give me
a Chinese sounding name
is that bad or good
I'm not arguing
for or against
I'm just saying
it's an interesting question
so they gave me
a three
oh well
well I'm coming back to this
yes I was actually
David Moser's
first Chinese teacher
I'll come back to that
I'll come back to that
that's a very funny story
I will tell you that later
so
Huo Shi Ta
sorry
Huo Dao Ren was
well you know
that's the next one
Huo Dao Ren was
David Moser's
first Chinese teacher
and that was in 1983
or 84
and was it that person
which is who
I would have liked it to be
no
they gave
Huo Shi Da
I don't know
where that name came
well I do
I mean I understand
that this is
Hofstadter
Ha
Si
The
sort of
H and S
it's kind of a phonetic
vague mirroring
of my last name
but into three syllables
instead of into
five syllables
and this is
H
D
R
Huo Dao Ren
Hofstadter
Douglas
Richard
that's where the
H.D.
R idea came from
and I
thought that was nice
anyway that's just
a curious fact
now
let's move ahead
to surfaces and essences
by myself
and Emmanuel Sander
who is this
oh by the way
written into
this is the
French version right here
the
l'analogie coeur de la cognition
or coeur de la pensée
I'm sorry
and there we are
standing together
I'm holding the
French version and
Emmanuel is holding
the English version
in twenty
I don't know
it doesn't matter
when it was
so who were the
authors of this
book in Chinese
well it's
an interesting question
because if it's
gonna be
Hoshida
three syllables
what about
Emmanuel
shouldn't his name
be three syllables
so should it be
Douglas
Hofstadter
Hofstadter
should it
should those to be
you know with
Emmanuel
I
Imaneau
I
Sander
should it be that
should it be these two
this corresponds
these are atleast
similar in the
sense that they are
transcriptions
they are both
transcriptions of
foreign names
but no
it's actually
not going to be that
it's going to be this
a weird paradox
a weird kind of a paradox
very strange
so one of them
is a very
clearly a
transliteration
the other one
is a very
Chinese name
interesting
anyway
let's take some
transculturation
examples
done in the
Chinese translation
by Liu Jian
and Hu Hai
and Chen Xi
and
with occasional
suggestions
from Hou Dao Yuan
ok
my main piece
of advice
to them
as translators
of the book was
the more unfaithful
to us
you will be
on the
essence level
that was
my advice
to them
you remember
that pretty
well don't you
Liu Jian
be as unfaithful
as you can
be on the
surface level
and that way
you can
be faithful
on the
deep level
maldun
a little bit
not really
not really
so here's
an example
passage
the more
faithful
passage
how do wine experts
choose a wine
from several possibilities
on the menu
when they've never tasted
any of them
this is in chapter 4
we talk about this
Emmanuel himself
is a great lover of wines
and he has a big
seller of wines
himself
he loves wines
and so
he wrote this passage himself
and how do they do it
how do wine experts
choose a wine
from several possibilities
when they've never
tasted any of them
they do it by analogy
the wines
that are similar
wines from a similar
area, a similar
time, a similar
vintage
there are all sorts
of ways they do it
and he talks
about it
for several pages
so by analogy
and how do translation
experts
translate this
section of the book
by analogy
of course
so in the
Chinese translation
expertsin wine
became expertsin
tea
the whole
passage was
completely
expertsin
several pages
so that it was
about tea
not about wine
orhow to
pasta chefs
choose which
type of pasta to use
with a not yet
cooked sauce
which they have
not yettaste
when they have
not yettasted
the sauce
by analogy
of course
and how
to translation
experts
translate this
section of the book
by analogy
of course
and so
in the
Chinese translation
expertsin pasta
totally
rewritten passage
and of
course
Chungyu
Galore
I'm not going to
read these all out
loud to you
but this was in
a page
translated by
Adiogen
one page
maybe it was
two pages long
and I found
all of these
Chungyu in it
maybe they're
not all
officialChungyu
I'm not sure
about the last
one of that
would be called a
Chungyu or not
butall of these
expertsin
this is
written by
an American
author
and a French
authorusing
twelveChungyu
in two pages
I love it
exactly
what I wanted
exactly
what I wanted
this whole idea
ofusing
Chungyu
is precisely
the right way
for this book
to have been
translated
so
fully analogical
high quality
human
translation
fahqht
is not at all
like mt
fahqht
it sparkles
it scintillates
and it tingles
throughout
tingles
I don't know
how to say that
but it's
somebody can
figure it out
anyway
it's a wonderful
it's wonderfully
lively
and
full of
sparkle
one final example
that I'm very proud of
my own translation
and I want to show you
how distant
how enormously distant
we are from machine
translation
doing anything like this
I just want to give you
I'm not saying
my translation is great
I'm only saying
I'm proud of it
and I want you
to think about it
judge it as you wish
let's begin
once again
with the
Wangwei poem
what do you do
with theWangwei poem
you saw all eight
translations
there are many
many others
are
in the book
and
are on the web
but I was
shocked
that not
any of them
respected
the constraint
of twenty
syllables
the original
is in twenty
syllables
I thought golly
it should be
in twenty
syllables
in English
so and
they should
not only
be twenty
they should
be five
perline
five
syllables
self-evident
so this is what
I came up with
bleak peak
no one's seen
but here snips
of talk
late light
spins through
bosk
bosk is a synonym
for woods
shines back
on green bark
no no no no
no apologies
apologies
applauds
excuse me
my apology
anyway
I want to point
out a few things
obviously
I have a little rhyme here
I have a little
illiteration here
late light
I have some nice
talkbosk
bark
back
bleak
peak
lots of words
to end in K
which is
not an ending
in Mandarin
but it sounds a little
like Cantonese
lots of words
in Cantonese
end in K
so
anyway
there's
it's twenty
syllables
but I
looked at that
and I thought
there weren't any
commas
why is there a
comma
why are there
capital letters
it doesn't make
any sense
so
I revised it
bleak
peak
no one
scene
but here
snips of talk
late light
spins throughbosk
shines back
on green
bark
I revised it
again
I thought
gee
it was a
geometrical pattern
at one time
late light
spins throughbosk
shines back
on green
bark
I thought
that's getting there
but then I thought
wait a minute
the original was vertical
so
bleak peak
no one scene
but here
snips of talk
late light
spins throughbosk
shines back
on green
bark
and I thought
this doesn't look
like Chinese
let's make it
this is a character
this is a typeface
called brush
ok
so this is sort of like brush strokes
I want to point something else
else out to you
which is
ren and ru
or ru and ren
however it goes beyond that
it goes a little beyond that
on and no
and in fact
if you spell it backwards
on
spins
snips
no
I couldn't resist the temptation
so
I got quite a lot of
I said
wait a minute
Chinese characters
they are
they're square
they're not horizontal lines
as in English
so I went a little further
and I went like that
ok
I broke each word
each syllable
into two
into two pieces
and placed them vertically
alright
that was my translation
as I said
I was proud of it
it may be silly in some ways
but I love it
and I have also translated
a number of other poems
that fit in twenty syllables
in the same way
so
would an English language reader
of this translation
have stood in the original
parthenon of long ways
original poem
I'm not going to say yes
or no
I'm just asking the question
I'm not saying it's perfect
I'm only asking you
to bring you back
to the original question
that opened this lecture
ok
Kongshan Bujianren
it is at the top of a bleak peak
alright
so
some concluding thoughts
why is there such a vast difference
between getting a computer
to be able to play
world-class chess or go
and getting a computer
to be able to translate
very simple sentences
such as
the box is in the pen
reliably
it is because
today's empty
no matter how flashy
or deep in quotes
it is empty
it is because
today's empty
does not have any ideas
behind the scenes
it is because
today's empty
just throws symbols
around without any notion
that they might symbolize
anything
this is today's empty
which mostly reflects
corporate goals
not philosophical goals
empty could have been
otherwise
and empty
might some day
become totally different
but today
the fact is
that empty has no understanding
of situations
because it has no understanding
of words
because it doesn't know
words stand for anything
empty doesn't know
what a hill
or a voice is
or what green is
or what moss is
empty doesn't know
about space
empty doesn't know
about time
empty doesn't know
about up or down
empty doesn't know
about big or little
empty doesn't know
there are people
empty doesn't know
there are things
empty doesn't
know there is a world
empty doesn't know
that anything exists
empty doesn't know
that anything happens
empty doesn't know
M.T. doesn't know anything at all
M.T. isn't roughly understanding
or sort of understanding the texts it works on
M.T. is not understanding
M.T. is empty
Period
M.T. is empty
Period
Thank you
