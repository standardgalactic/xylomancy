You are standing on the verge of getting it all beyond the twirling foam, further than
the outlet and it's deep, deeper than deep in the black hole.
Feel your mind and your ass will follow, because once you've passed upon a no return,
you are caught in the cosmic storm.
The cosmic storm, won't you rise and dance with me between the cosmic stars?
They call me the doctor.
I'm the headman around here.
How are you seeing our guy through the black hole?
The way of strangers bearing gifts.
There may be strengths attached.
And what might be strange for some, may be a noose for others.
Let me show you what I mean.
Check it.
Bernie, some of these people have been out here since 2 o'clock this morning, though
the aliens aren't scheduled to arrive before noon.
But as you can see, the crowd is getting pretty excited as America prepares for its first
encounter with space since NASA went bankrupt back in 1998.
It's quite a circus.
Thank you, Striker.
Of course, we will go back to Plymouth Rock the moment the aliens are sighted.
To another news, the Environmental Protection Agency has added Hartford, Connecticut to
its list of cities to be evacuated by years in.
Carcinogen levels there have topped those found in Baltimore last year.
The gap between black salaries and white widen.
Wait, something's now happening at Plymouth Rock.
Striker.
As you can hear, Bernie, there's definitely something going on now.
We can't see anything yet, but this humming is definitely growing louder.
You know, ever since the aliens' signal was first received some three months ago, speculation
has run rampant as to their appearance, the size and shape of their craft.
Oh, my God.
Literally, full of spacecraft.
No, we're right over our head.
This is absolutely amazing.
This is literally an unbelievable sight.
You know, as I look to my left, I see Vice President Tomato and Secretary of State Buchanan
approaching the microphone.
For those of you who are concerned, President Taylor, of course, is safe and secure in an
undisclosed bunker until it's determined whether or not the aliens pose any threat.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this on?
Can you understand me?
I'm the Vice President.
Well, we are space traders bearing exquisite gifts that will restore your nation to its
former glory, nearly limitless quantities of gold and precious metals that will instantly
erase your deficit, machines that will renew your rivers and your air, cold fusion technology
for a safe, cheap and inexhaustible source of energy.
All we ask in return is the delivery to our vessels five days from now, every child, woman
and man in your nation, with at least 2,500 milligrams of melanin in their skin per square
centimeter.
What the hell is melanin?
Put more simply, in trade for solving all your most pressing domestic catastrophes, we
are asking for every person in your country that you would classify as black.
Are you kidding?
No, we are not.
What are you going to do with them?
Well, that does not concern you.
We give you five days to decide and the offer is non-negotiable.
We will not try to coerce you in any way, yet I hope we can do some business together.
We went all this time for a fucking UFO and they come here with this?
It's all bullshit, right?
Maybe, maybe this day is going to go down in history and end to poverty, end to pollution,
cheap, unlimited energy for every American.
Sounds like a hell of a reelection platform.
Sam, I have to go on record as saying this is crazy, but...
But what?
Well, welfare rolls would be cut 40%.
Food stamps, Medicare, drug abuse programs, slashed.
May I add something, Mr. President?
You know, if I could guarantee the prosperity of this great country by giving life or taking off of those space traders,
I do sell without a moment's hesitation.
You know, the Secretary's courage is not unlike that American men and women have exhibited
when called to military service.
There was some go more willingly than others, but almost all go with the knowledge that they might never come back.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
Doesn't anybody see a downside to this?
You know, Casper's absolutely right.
The guilt that many whites would feel for sending the blacks away could take a severe psychological toll,
with medical costs possibly reaching astronomical levels.
This is madness.
Our military services would be decimated, depleted of 30% of our manpower.
But with unlimited energy, think of the weapons you could create?
Mr. President.
Sam.
You were elected by the slimmest of margins.
Your African-American vote was key.
I don't expect them to be thrilled, but how can I put this delicately?
Their future electoral clout is going to be severely limited.
Casper, let's be honest.
Do you really think the aliens will treat them worse than we have?
The real issue here is spin control.
The decision has to be the will of the people and not the administration policy.
How about a national referendum?
Have MCI fire up a couple of those yes and no 900 numbers?
I'll be damned.
We're on to something here.
Uh, Professor Gollightly.
You look like you want to say something.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
As you know, Mr. President, I have been a lifelong card-carrying Republican.
I feel I was instrumental in your moderate wing, wrestling control of the party from religious extremists.
I have often supported this administration's repeal of affirmative action legislation,
not protested its decreasing handouts to the poor.
And in helping you undermine these policies, I realize that your reasons for doing so differed from mine.
And yet I was always a good soldier for the party.
I sincerely believe and still believe that black people need to learn how to stand on their own two feet
without the crutches of governmental legislation.
But I'm afraid I must protest in the strongest terms possible what I've heard in this room today.
What is being proposed cannot be passed off euphemistically as selective service at its best.
It is group banishment.
At its worst, it is utter and complete extermination.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, did I miss something? Who said anything about extermination?
Look, the space traders seem perfectly nice and civil.
Their planet might be one great big club med for all we know.
Sam, we do not even know if these creatures can deliver on their end.
You and I play poker together. What if they're as good at bluffing as you are?
Now, you whistlin' Dixie.
Don't look like a damn idiot if the aliens took off and left me nothing but big bag of tortilla chips.
Huh.
We'll ask them for peek at the goodies.
And if they're not BSing, we'll schedule a national referendum on the night before their deadline.
Call up MCI, ask them to fire up two yes and no 900 numbers.
Gentlemen.
Lady.
Yes, talk to me.
First of all, I'd just like to say I love your show.
I watch it every day, but my comment is this.
Black people have always been complaining about how bad they're treated here,
so I would think they'd just be tickle-pink to get a free ride someplace else.
Oh, yes, the free ride is spent. It's the return ticket I'm worried about.
Well, Dad, it looks like your chickens are finally coming home to roost.
Look, little Miss Millitant.
I mean, give Dad a break, all right? How was he supposed to know?
Besides, I'm sure this will all blow over in a couple of days.
Right, Dad?
All right.
We're gonna take a break right now.
We'll come back if you need a black psychic who says he's had his bags packed for three years.
Stay with us.
Well, I have to tell you, this is absolutely the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
The Statue of Liberty has actually been turned into gold.
Now, officials from Fort Knox here confirm that it is solid and it is pure.
Officials estimate the value of the gold at over $15 trillion.
Enough not only to pay off the federal deficit,
but also to give every American every remaining American a tax-free year.
This just in.
The alien craft have vacuumed the air over Denver and Los Angeles.
Small levels are reported at zero.
And live from Chicago, our news team is sending these pictures from Lake Michigan.
Gail, if you aren't a cipher, sore eyes.
Linda sends her regards.
He's in the back.
Good doggy.
Hello, Professor.
Travis is one of Millie's pups.
George gave him to me the night of the election.
You know, if this goes through, it's not going to be easy.
Drop it, boy.
Some folks might fight it.
Make the LA riots look like a slumber party.
The President needs you silent aboard this thing.
Professor, if you lobby on our side and the trade is approved,
our President promises that he's going to see to it that 100 black families are smuggled England.
You can drop the list.
I gotta go.
What's your word?
I bet he had a lot of words.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm not sure what they mean,
but he said that they'll smuggle us to England
if I lobby on his side.
So what did you tell him?
I'm not sure.
Gail, that they even need my help,
given the state of black leadership.
Please, unity will come out all speaking once.
All right.
Legislation.
What else?
The boycotts.
Arms struggle.
Arms struggle.
Look, my friends, very little is being accomplished here today.
Rather.
They tried this once before,
but I pledge to you that hundreds of thousands of Jews
will not allow another final solution in this country,
not now, not ever.
You just got what we got.
You all next.
Ladies' tracking polls indicate support of the trade at 40%.
The melanin content of 2,500 milligrams per square centimeter
that a trader's requested
roughly corresponds to a light brown skin complexion.
Dr. Eric Fanon of Johns Hopkins.
Excuse me, Dr. Fanon.
We'll explain.
The amount of melanin in one skin
varies according to how dark or tan we might be
at 2,500 milligrams per square centimeter
corresponds to the darkness of, oh, what I'd say,
to be an ordinary paperback.
Thank you, Dr.
In other news,
government sources confirm that France, England, and Germany
have offered their blights as well.
But the alien spokesperson is quoted as saying,
maybe next time.
Hi.
Hi, ma'am.
What's this?
Uh, a...
Um, all I'm saying is, is try it.
I mean, my God, it was the last box in the store,
and I just...
I thought...
Yes, sir.
And I'm taking all my sisters with me, too,
because they don't tell them what kind of electricity
the Malians gonna have on them ships,
because you know us black folks.
We don't, like, arrive in no-where old nappy-headed.
So you really think they're gonna send us away, huh?
And I told you the one about the American drain.
That's what all the niggas swimming back to Africa
with a Jew under each arm.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Hee-hee-hee.
You're outrageous.
But you know, Piggy, we could fight back.
Like the Palestinians.
Rocks and guns.
Niggas, please.
I'm like, I'm gonna give myself a kill just to stay here.
I just hope they got them little bottles
of Remy Martin on the flight.
Got to have my Remy Martin.
Remy Martin.
Wait, hold it. Where are you going?
I'll be right back.
Rich folks are crazy.
Police, and this is crazy.
The president didn't listen. Why should they?
Because they're capitals first, and Caucasians second.
What do you think I've been doing on these corporate boards
all these years? This is what it's all about.
The police haven't...
Black people have been calling me an Oreo ever since I was 12.
After tomorrow, they'll call me a hero.
And if it doesn't work, what about the family?
What about you?
Could we live with ourselves
if I help them send black people away?
Hmm?
No.
Call you tonight.
Gentlemen, first of all, thank you for coming.
Now,
I suppose to the rank-and-file American,
this unholy author by the aliens
must seem like an answer to their wildest dreams.
It seems to me, however, upon further reflection
that this trade could bring our nation
nothing but disaster.
He's right.
But I don't want you to take my word for it.
Because after all, I come from a very obvious
self-interest.
Leland,
why don't you tell the rest of the boys
how this trade would affect your distilleries?
Black string, 33% of my hard liquor.
48% of my cognac alone.
Who's gonna take up that slack?
Why, it'll decimate athletic shoe sales.
Cool and Newport cigarettes.
Pork!
15% of our best consumers gone.
Like that.
And we at the oil companies employ over 12 million people worldwide.
Now, the alien inexhaustible energy source
will wipe us out overnight.
Furthermore, the blacks are all gone.
How long do you think poor whites will stand
being at the very bottom of the barrel?
Exactly.
We'll have a revolution before the year's out.
We've got to tell those little green men
to go back where they came from.
Excellent, gentlemen. Excellent.
Now, I believe that this room
represents a few trillion dollars in assets.
I propose that we mount the largest ad campaign
this nation has ever seen.
We buy up every minute of radio and TV airtime,
every print ad, every billboard,
even every goddamn bus bench,
and we flood them with the anti-trade message S-O-S.
Save our souls.
We'll have whites on their knees begging blacks to stay.
Here.
By executive order, the president has banned
African-Americans from leaving the country
before tomorrow's revolution.
Mommy, we can't just pretend this isn't happening.
Can I ask this Ruth, my great-grandmother?
She used to clean white folks' houses
on the main line in Philadelphia.
She told me, you know, they may not like us,
but they sure can't live without us.
Don't worry, baby.
They can't live without us.
Who am I?
Watermelons clean their houses now.
After George Hamilton vowed today, he too will go.
Cigarettes! Cognac! Cigarettes! Cognac!
Did you know that the African-Americans
won over 500 of the 850 Olympic medals
awarded to United States?
Yes. Good thing.
Cigarettes! Cognac! Cigarettes!
Cognac! Cognac!
Hello, hello again, everybody. Thank you.
My name's Casey Caseman.
Welcome to Alien Trade Referendum.
Just say...
No!
Oh, boy, can you imagine life without jazz?
No!
Or without the blues?
No!
Or without rock and roll?
No!
Well, that's what life would have been like
in these United States
without the contributions of African-Americans.
If this referendum passes,
and we vote to send dark-skinned people up into outer space,
I'll tell you one thing.
You can forget about ever seeing another green team again.
You can't bring a new scientist or people yourself.
Just entertainers, you know?
Okay, this is what people is.
This is what people is. Eggheads.
So, tomorrow, when you pick up your phone to vote
in the privacy of your own home,
just think...
Privacy of...
My people?
Oh, my people.
The citizens and the boycotts have worked.
We are ahead in the polls.
Don't count your chickens before they come home to roast.
Oh, somebody bring me some milk,
because here come a big Oreo.
Yes, yes.
Give him a tan.
We are ahead in the polls.
But who knows how these people will vote
in the privacy of their own homes?
Oh, sit down, Tom.
I am well aware of how I am perceived.
But now is not the time for our petty squabbling.
Now, this came to me this morning.
In order to ensure victory,
we must stop resisting the offer
and urge the country to accept the trader's proposition.
The major motivation for racism in this country
is the deeply held belief
that black people should not have anything
that white people don't.
Not only do whites insist on
better jobs, higher incomes,
better neighborhoods, better schools,
but they leap to gobble up our language,
our dress, our music, and our dance.
Therefore, I propose
that from now until the polls open this evening,
we circulate the rumor
that the aliens have arranged for our transport
to the wealthiest and most beautiful utopia
in the known universe.
White folks will go ape,
wondering what we will encounter in this new land.
They will nash their teeth.
They will even argue
that to limit the space trader's offer to blacks
is nonconstitutional discrimination
against whites.
I cannot stand here any longer
and be influenced by a man
who has dedicated his entire life
to sabotaging his old people.
Now is not the time for trickery
and tar foolery.
My people, my people were brought here
involuntarily,
and involuntarily is the only way
they're gonna take me out.
Yes.
My power must use cunning and guile.
Well, today is the day of reckoning
of 20 million Americans of African descent.
Voting will begin in just a few seconds from now.
As you know, two telephone numbers will appear on your screen,
one in favor and one against the space trader's offer.
After dialing the number of your choice,
simply key in your personal security code.
Here, ladies and gentlemen, are the two numbers.
The polls will remain open for the next three hours,
but we should be able to project a decision very shortly.
Ladies and gentlemen, with just 6% of the vote tallied we project...
that the referendum will pass...
by a comfortable margin.
Oh, God.
Fine.
Collection centers will be set up tomorrow morning
by the National Guard.
The aliens say that...
the aliens say they will allow only one piece
of carry-on luggage per person.
Oh, wait.
Hey.
This is Bernard Shields.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Mom.
Dad.
Come on, this isn't the same.
You're just sitting here like nothing's wrong, nothing's going on.
We ought to do something.
I mean, can we get across the border
or get guns for everybody?
I don't know.
Jennifer, they stopped selling guns to us yesterday.
Two days ago, they quadrupled the border guards.
You know that.
Well, you and he did pledge the same paternity.
He just can't...
I don't want this.
Please.
Morning.
Kale.
Why, if you aren't a sight for sore eyes.
Linda sends her regards.
England?
Promise is a promise.
Get out of here.
That's you, Kale.
Promise is a promise.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No! No!
No!
Lenny!
Lenny!
No!
No, you can't go!
You knew it was hopeless
as soon as the idea was out of the bag.
Didn't you?
All right, people, off the bus and on the beach.
Come on, folks, let's go.
Get your belongings, get off the bus.
There you are.
You heard him.
You heard him.
You're a family.
Let's go.
Off the bus and on the beach.
Follow along.
If you can't carry it, leave it behind.
That's right.
Go, go.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
Go, go, keep going.
And so, as we say goodbye to our dark friends and neighbors,
we say hello to a new era of American peace and prosperity.
For World News Now, I'm Striker O' Religion.
Every bargain ain't a bargain, America kinda let the brothers and sisters down.
Let me see if I can call them aliens back, I'ma tell them we having a one sense sale.
They can get the rest of y'all for a penny.
The divine is beyond the power of words to define, but some people think that if you
name it, you can claim it.
When that happens, don't get caught in the middle.
That's about to happen to this young priest, he's about to get caught in the middle of
the cosmic.
