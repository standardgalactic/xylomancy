1. **Cellular Decision-Making**: The decision-making processes of cells—differentiation, division, regulation, or apoptosis (programmed cell death)—are limited and highly specific to their environment and needs. Cells can integrate sensory information over time and space but have a finite capacity for memory and prediction due to these limitations.

2. **Human Intelligence**: Similarly, human intelligence is also limited. We can learn and model our surroundings to some extent, but we are not universally intelligent beings with infinite knowledge or understanding. Our memories are short, and our ability to predict or model complex systems is finite.

3. **Learning Hierarchy**: The discussion suggests a hierarchy of learning capabilities, from the simplest ability to learn at all to constructing Turing-complete state machines, which can model agency and causality effectively.

4. **Turing Completeness in Models**: For a system or mind to be considered more advanced, it must be able to contain a Turing machine within its models, demonstrating the ability to simulate or understand agency and causality.

5. **Understanding Minds**: The next step for humanity might be to create truly intelligent systems, which involves understanding what intelligence is at a fundamental level. This is an area where human endeavors are currently focused.

6. **General Intelligence**: The question of whether humans can build generalizable intelligence—a form of artificial intelligence that can understand and learn any intellectual task that a human being can—is still open. Alan Turing's test is a foundational concept in this regard, suggesting that if we can build such systems, it would be evidence of our own general intelligence.

7. **Next Steps Beyond General Intelligence**: There is speculation about what comes after achieving general intelligence. One possibility is understanding existence itself, although scaling up existing intelligence without fundamentally changing its nature might not necessarily lead to new and profound insights.

8. **Future Interactions**: The conversation highlights the potential for future interactions where Josia Rieser could revisit the topic to delve deeper into these concepts or explore other aspects of intelligence and learning.

In summary, the discussion touched upon the limits of cellular and human intelligence, the potential for building generalizable intelligence, and the speculative questions about what might come after achieving such a level of intelligence. It's a reminder that while we have made significant strides in understanding intelligence, there is still much to explore and understand.
