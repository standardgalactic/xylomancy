Quote, I accept the matter of the whole world at the beginning as in a state of general dispersion
and make of it a complete chaos. I see this matter forming itself in accordance with the
established laws of attraction and modifying its movement by repulsion. I enjoy the pleasure
without having recourse to arbitrary hypotheses of seeing a well-ordered whole produced under
the regulation of the established laws of motion, and this whole looks so like that system of the
world before our eyes that I cannot refuse to identify it with it. I will therefore not deny
that the theory of Lucretius or his predecessors, Epicurus, Lusapus, and Democritus, has much
resemblance with mine. It seems to me that we can hearsay with intelligent certainty and without
audacity, give me matter and I will construct a world out of it." That's Emanuel Kant from his
natural history of the heavens, and that particular section is quoted by Friedrich Nietzsche in his
lectures on the pre-plotonic philosophers. What we see in this quotation from Kant is an
enthusiasm for science and for the explanatory power of the scientific method. Kant here sees
his forerunners all the way back in the philosophers before Plato and Socrates, referencing Democritus,
the father of atomism. Kant recognizes a resemblance in their theories but also a common spirit,
a common goal or quest, not just a praise of science for its ability to answer individual
empirical questions but to construct a world. And there is a beauty to Kant's expression here.
That one could begin with a few starting principles, laws of motion and dispersion as he calls them,
general patterns or properties of how matter behaves, and then from these starting parameters
come to gain a coherent understanding of the immeasurably complex reality that we live in.
For Kant, this is the allure of science. And so I want to pose the question to all of us,
what is the point of science? It may seem like a strange question for us to ask today,
but I think it's worth reflecting on because, I mean, first of all, it seems obvious that we
should be able to answer it. But secondly, it's not a question that science itself
can answer, at least science the way that we understand it today. And this is because it's
a question of values. Why do we value science? Why do we pursue scientific knowledge?
Admittedly, I don't think that for most of us these questions are all that difficult to answer.
But let's take the question seriously and assume for the sake of argument that it really matters
what our answer is and whether we have the right answer. And of course, we'll find that not everyone
has the same answer, which is a problem in and of itself. Furthermore, the framework on which one
should base their answer is not obvious either. I mean, suppose we appeal to what might be the
commonplace view that science is valuable because of its utility. Science gives us power over the
world. Or suppose we appeal to the more philosophical view that science is worth pursuing because
truth is valuable in and of itself. And science helps us gain knowledge and more importantly
to falsify incorrect knowledge so it gets us closer to the truth. Science is good because
truth is good, right? And science is the best way of verifying or falsifying truth statements.
Or maybe we take an older view, the view of Kant, as I quoted from him at the beginning,
that science is part of a broader project of human knowledge, attempting to gain a complete
rational understanding of the world around them. You could find positives or negatives to each of
those descriptions of what science is, or what the value of science is, and have arguments for
or against. But ultimately, my point in bringing this up is that we would have to conclude that
when it comes to questions of values, we have no definitive means of settling these questions,
certainly no scientific means. And so this takes us into territory that we might call
metascience, or a discussion of the philosophy of science. And so today, we're going to take
a look at Nietzsche's philosophy of science, and the great influence on his philosophy of science
that he derives from Friedrich Albert Lange. Now, philosophy of science is not something that
Friedrich Nietzsche is usually associated with. It's not uncommon to encounter caricatures of
Nietzsche as an irrationalist, or to see the interpretations of his philosophy,
which emphasize the postmodern aspects, the elements of Nietzsche's thought that sort of
emphasize the role of interpretation, or cleave to like a pure perspectivism. Now, of course,
Nietzsche himself is somewhat responsible for that. And so far as he writes of the problem of science,
the problem of Socrates, the danger that in excess of rational discursive intellect
will pose, you know, the danger that it will damage life's beautiful illusions.
There are many variations on this type of presentation of Nietzsche, and I've given
this presentation of his ideas myself here. And so that is to say, it's not wrong. This
kind of presentation of Nietzsche has its place. But we must ask, does Nietzsche have a philosophy
of science? And what one finds, if they search for it in his work, is that indeed he does.
And perhaps the most interesting aspect of Nietzsche's philosophy of science
is how it developed, and what it culminates in. Because what we find when we take a closer look
at this question of the Nietzschean philosophy of science, is that it is a secret beginning
to Nietzsche's philosophizing. That is, as Annie Anders and Carl Schlechter, who was in charge of
the Nietzsche archive for many years, the two of them have called it. The secret origins of Nietzsche,
first thinking philosophically, originate with his development of an understanding of the nature
of what science is, the point of science, and how science develops. During his early days as a
philologist, Nietzsche read and studied the pre-Socratic philosophers, or as he called them,
the pre-Platonics. Figures like Anaximander, Heraclitus, Democritus. He also became familiar
with philosophers of science, including Neocontian figures, some of whom were scientists themselves,
such as Launga, Helmholtz, von Baer, and others. And finally, many of those that we count among the
great philosophers today are scientists as well. It had important things to say about the philosophy
of science. People like Leibniz and Spinoza, Kant, even Schopenhauer. Because of course,
Nietzsche did not drop out of the ether. He's not a unique figure with no precedent. There are many
things that are unique or peculiar to Nietzsche. But like all the other philosophers, he's engaged
in a dialogue with the ideas of past thinkers. And his entry to the dialogue is in direct response
to disputes within 19th century science and about the philosophy of science. And so now you may think,
what is the use in understanding 19th century science and earlier views of science?
Like why familiarize ourselves with the ideas of Launga, or the theories of Spinoza, or the
mathematics of Poscovitch? These kinds of questions are why I think many of us avoid engaging with
Nietzsche in this way on the basis of what he thought about science and his philosophy of
science. Because inevitably, it seems outdated or irrelevant. If you want to understand physics,
pick up a modern physics textbook, you don't go to Friedrich Nietzsche.
But in my view, understanding these things is very relevant, actually. Let's take a step back
and consider what we'd like to get out of this. The questions we're entertaining now are not
properly scientific, as we've said, but rather meta-scientific, addressed to the questions
of the philosophy of science. And so is the goal of science to give us a true picture of the world?
Do insights gained through empirical data and the scientific method indicate anything to us
about the fundamental nature of the world? If there are patterns and laws that govern reality,
can we distill those patterns and laws down to as few principles as possible?
Or is it possible to even have a single principle?
What is the relationship of science to metaphysics? Does science require a metaphysics
in order to pursue the truth? In other words, if we have no theory of what the data from sense
perceptions indicates, no understanding of what an individual fact of reality corresponds to,
in the grand totality of things, then do we really understand anything? I might have a really
sophisticated knowledge of the turning of the seasons, for example, as many ancient people did,
or even potentially people before the dawn of civilization. But to what extent did they really
have that much of a greater understanding of the world just by virtue of this fact over somebody
who didn't know of the turning of the seasons? Because it still contains so much personified
things that they saw in nature and mythological knowledge. Given that they didn't understand
the turning of the seasons in context to be a phenomenon caused by Earth's axial tilt of its
orbit around the sun, right? So is science just the pursuit of a bunch of disconnected facts,
or is our ultimate goal to correlate all these facts into a coherent understanding
that counts for all of those facts, right? And it's difficult to say that discovering
the true nature of reality, however you want to describe what I just said there,
it's difficult to say that that's the point of any one application of the scientific method
in the form of an experiment. But if we don't ask the question of what we're doing when we do
science generally, I think we find ourselves in a very strange place where we have no logical
understanding of why we're pursuing what we're pursuing, even as we conduct the pursuit in
itself an apparently logical manner. And so these questions I think that I've just laid out,
there's all sorts of potential answers, I'm not suggesting by any means that they're impossible
to answer, but simply that you're not going to get the answer from the scientific method itself.
These are questions where you have to introduce an element of interpretation of where you there's
a point where you have to stop just looking at data and saying, well, this is what the data says,
and actually bring to bear your subjective interpretation, your pattern recognizing software
that your brain has given you, and go out on a limb and say what you think it is, right?
Or say what you think the answer to some of these questions are. Now, as we've said Nietzsche,
he first comes to consider these questions through his engagement with the pre-plotonic
philosophers. The pre-plotonic philosophers hail from a time when the intellectuals did not divide
off the question of why we do science from science itself. For them, the goal of constructing a
metaphysical view of the world, a view based on first principles, was deeply related to the
project of constructing physical principles for understanding the behavior of body and
phenomenas, you know, within the world. Now, a word on terminology before we go further,
I'm using Nietzsche's terms here, pre-plotonics rather than pre-socratics. The meaning of the
term is simply the pre-socratics plus Socrates. Now, why does Nietzsche call the massage? Because
in his view, Socrates has more in common with the other pre-socratics than he does with Plato.
Plato is a systematizer, and he blends philosophical influence from multiple archetypes,
whereas Socrates, like the other figures before Plato, are hemmed from a single stone,
as Nietzsche says, or hewed from a single stone, excuse me. So they come from a time
before there were formal systems of philosophy or any organized discipline defining what philosophy
was. Nietzsche had to define the type of the philosopher as his own innovation. And so when
I use the term pre-plotonic, we're talking about an era of philosophy as defined by Nietzsche before
the philosophical system building and the blending of philosophical styles and ideas that is found
in the writings of Plato. Now, Nietzsche has a particular theory about who the pre-plotonics
were, which he outlines in his lectures on them. And my primary source for today is a book that
has those lectures with commentary translated by Gregory Whitlock. And it's an indispensable
resource for understanding the development of Nietzsche's thought. And I highly recommend this
book. I'll be drawing on Whitlock's commentary as much as his translation, if not more so. And
so in any case, Nietzsche's theory, when it comes to understanding the pre-plotonics,
is that they were a series of Greek philosophers whose great insight, their collective project,
so to speak, whether in conscious collaboration or not, was the innovation of materialism.
That Greek philosophy leading up to Plato represented the critique of mythological
explanations of the world breaking away from the supernatural view of reality,
and an attempt to understand reality that increasingly moved towards materialist explanations,
physical laws governing reality. This is important first because Nietzsche believes that this
progression towards materialism is cyclical. While we see one example of it in the pre-plotonics,
Nietzsche believes we can see the same pattern in the European Enlightenment.
It's important to clarify, therefore, that what's repeating here is not the acquisition of the
exact same scientific knowledge. I mean, that would be kind of an absurd claim just given that
the things that are learning and the technology available is different in both cases.
But rather, it's a similar course of development of a worldview based on science. And what that
means exactly will become clear as we go on. But Nietzsche doesn't believe, importantly,
that this pattern is culturally specific to the Greeks. I think this would apply to us today,
right? Another reason why Nietzsche's argument may be relevant to us now is because he asserts
that the materialist understanding of the world is an inevitable consequence of philosophizing.
Furthermore, that the materialist understanding is both powerful and dangerous when it's taken
through to its ultimate conclusions. Nietzsche asserts that the ultimate conclusion of a
materialist philosophy, the goal or the end of materialism as he sees it, is the forging of
a single principle for understanding life and understanding reality, from which all other
equations and formulae can be derived, from which the no longer disconnected facts of reality
can be ordered, right? This revolution and thought happened in fits and starts, as all revolutions
do, and it should be said that Nietzsche saw some figures as dead ends or regressions.
But nevertheless, he charts out a new chronology of the pre-plotonic philosophers,
and he gives a picture in which each figure takes a further step in coming up with that
single coherent principle for describing and explaining physical reality.
And so the way Nietzsche is thinking about this, we might notice,
therefore may seem to conflate science and philosophy. Or you could even say it conflates
science, philosophy, and you know, metaphysics, right? They all become part of the same project.
And so are there problems that could arise from this kind of framing? I mean, of course, right?
But this is the way that many of the pre-plotonics would have thought about these things.
All of these disciplines, you know, disciplines of thought, right, are differentiated
to us now, but they are also part of this unified overarching thing that we call the pursuit of truth.
And maybe a good faith way or a steelman way of trying to understand the argument for conflating
these things, for doing the opposite of what we like to do in philosophy, right, make distinctions.
Here's maybe my steelman argument for thinking in a less granular way, the way the pre-plotonics
would, that a scientific understanding without the explanatory framework found in metaphysics or
philosophy becomes just a senseless cluster of trivial facts. That metaphysics without
philosophy or science just falls into dogmatism, you know, superstitious religious views of the world.
And that philosophy done without a grounding in science or without a concern for its first
principles, it becomes just context specific idiomatic sayings or idle speculation, right?
And so while we now understand the many disciplines of academia with greater granularity these days,
and that's very useful and certainly an innovation, we should still understand the sense in which
if one cares about obtaining some kind of world picture that even remotely approaches the truth,
the concerns of science and philosophy have to become unified. That's a view shared by Edward
Zeller, who's a philologist and another prominent 19th century figure who before Nietzsche was one
of the most important writers in the topic of Greek philosophy. Zeller writes in his outlines
of the history of philosophy published in 1883, quote, what particularly distinguishes this
oldest period of Greek philosophy is the complete fusion of philosophy and science, end quote.
Some have considered Zeller to be a Hegelian. Whitlock argues in his commentary that Zeller
bears far more similarity to the other Neocontian thinkers that influence Nietzsche than to the
Hegelians, although he certainly did have a Hegel influence. And in fact, we can see some
intellectual kinship between the two men in so far as Zeller would go on to quote from Nietzsche's
quote from Nietzsche's own work. Nietzsche often goes against Zeller in these lectures,
but they also find agreement on some points and where they align most is in their fundamental
attitude towards the Greeks, as both Zeller and Nietzsche held that the study of the Greek
philosophers was valuable in and of itself. In contrast to the view that the Greeks should
be understood as merely a prerequisite to modern philosophical or scientific thinking,
or that Greek philosophy is merely an early stage, something inferior or half formed,
in comparison to our modern ideas, it's simply a prelude. That was the common
historiographical approach to Greek philosophy. It was seen as maybe a curiosity, but nothing more.
The view of the Kantians was somewhat similar. That philosophy is separate from the history
of philosophy. You know, learning about the Greeks is valuable to the history of philosophy,
certainly, but it's not philosophically valuable in and of itself to study the Greeks.
We might also consider another sort of the inverse that we might find, right, of people who
wouldn't say the Greeks are unimportant, but say the Greeks are very important because we find all
of our initial ideas there. We might consider Nietzsche's own criticisms of classicists when
approaching the Greeks when he outlines his arguments in Birth of Tragedy that, conversely,
they saw great significance to the Greeks, but they made the mistake insofar as they approached
them only to project their own values and their own beliefs and meanings onto the Greeks.
Um, so that was happening a lot also. The Hegelians, on the other hand, they do something
that made possible a new understanding of the history of thought, by in some sense unifying
the history of philosophy with philosophy itself. After Hegel, ideas are not understood as originating
purely out of logical deliberation, as Kant had imagined. Hegel affects this historical turn in
philosophy, and in the wake of him, there's this concept that ideas emerge out of a dialectic,
that there's not a decontextualized pure origin of truth out of the lap of being.
Truth is a process, and therefore the Greeks must be understood as part of that process.
So, you know, we're getting somewhere, but nevertheless, the Hegelians still tended to
hold that the Greeks were a preliminary stage, right? Everything in history has merely been
leading up to Hegel's conception of the absolute. Philosophy and the history of philosophy are
unified, yes, but there is still a progression, upon which Hegelian philosophy is farther along
than Greek philosophy. And so Hegel gives the Greeks far more credit, but still ultimately
interprets Greek philosophy according to his own philosophical ideas. The difference in how Nietzsche
approaches the pre-platonics and Greek philosophy in general is informed by the influence on his
thought of the Neocontians. The relationship between Kant and the Neocontians is very fascinating,
but it's a bit complicated, it takes a little off the path, so the key aspect is that the Neocontians
share in common with Nietzsche on this issue the fact that they dared to look at the Greeks with
an eye for what the Greeks could teach us, not to see them as naive and less intelligent or a mere
curiosity, mere freaks of thought, as Hegel said, past, you know, historiographers looked at the Greeks,
and not to project their own ideas onto them, not as a preliminary stage, but as something
complete in itself. Many among the Neocontian philosophers of science look to the Greeks
as themselves being instructive and unique and possessing their own distinctive character,
and so Whitlock writes in his commentary, quote, operating in stark contrast to the dominant
self-projective methods of these schools, Nietzsche sought to learn something of the Greeks for their
own sake. He did this not because the Greeks could aid modern humanity with quaint phrases,
or because the Greeks were a necessary stage of Hegelian spirit, or because they discovered
the idea of beauty. No, Nietzsche sought to learn of the Greeks for the value of the knowledge itself
because the Greeks were themselves fascinating and insightful. He was careful to discover what
dialectic actually employed the Greek drive to philosophy. This dialectic is indeed one of natural
science, but science has understood differently than by either Kant or Hegel, end quote.
The reason why the Neocontians provided an ingredient that helped Nietzsche along,
you know, in moving beyond what we might call the view of Kant himself, or like the Paleo-Contian
view, it's found in the fact that Friedrich Ubervegg and Friedrich Albert Lange, both Neocontians,
wrote books interpreting Greek philosophers as being materialists, and they were themselves
materialists, right? And so they suggested that the Greeks discovered things in their pursuit
of understanding the material world that can be instructive to us still today. Zeller, a figure
that, again, has one foot in Hegelianism and another foot in Neocontianism, he gives a great
explication of this attitude, quoting from the same text as before, he writes, quote,
The systems built up by the Greek philosophers are not to be regarded merely as a preparation for
modern philosophy. They have a value in themselves alone as an achievement in the development of
man's intellectual life. It was the Greeks who won for man freedom and independence of
philosophic thought, who proclaimed the autonomy of reason and gave it a twofold application.
Wisdom in the Greek sense included not only a theoretical explanation of the world,
but also a definite practical attitude to life. Thus, apart from independence of scientific thought,
it was the freedom to live life as he pleased, autarchy, that distinguished the Greek wise man,
end quote. Or if we want to look to somebody who is more purely Neocontian, we could look to Friedrich
Albert Longa's statements in his monumental work, History of Materialism, which is really a
central work for Nietzsche. It's a work whose importance pervades all of Nietzsche's thought.
Longa writes, quote, With the freedom and boldness of the Hellenic mind was united
and innate ability to draw inferences, to enunciate clearly and sharply general propositions,
to hold firmly and surely to the premises of an inquiry, and to arrange the results clearly
and luminously. In a word, the gift of scientific deduction, end quote.
Now, I could see an objection here, you know, insofar as Longa, Ubreveg, and the other Neocontians
saw the Greeks as valuable, you know, they're the first ones daring to liberate philosophical
thought from superstition, allowing the advent of materialism, right? And yet, these people who
were saying this are themselves materialists, which means we're looking back the pre-plotonics
and we're saying, oh, they're just like me, right? So couldn't we accuse them of doing
what Nietzsche criticized the classicists for doing? Simply projecting their own views
onto the subject of their research. And further, might we not say the same of Nietzsche?
Because he gets many of his own ideas, he says, originate in these figures.
So Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche too projects himself onto the Greeks,
seeing them as discoverers of the will to power and of the eternal return of the same.
Their struggle is one of materialism, precipitating an unconscious slide over many centuries
into the abyss of nihilism, end quote. And so, while we inarguably see the first seeds of
Nietzsche's philosophy in his study of the pre-plotonics, we have to ask whether he genuinely
discovered something from them that he then brought into the present through his writings,
or whether he simply projected onto them. And we could ask the same of Langa and Ubreveg.
But suffice to say, I think this question is unanswerable, right? So whether these seeds of
the ideas came from the Greeks or were merely projected onto them, it's only through Nietzsche's
engagement with these figures that these ideas gestated. It's through the interaction of his mind
with the Greeks that these ideas emerged. And in the, you know, it's a simple fact,
before him no one else had found these ideas, as clearly put them as clearly, as powerfully,
as forcefully as Nietzsche did. And so in some sense, we can set that issue aside as to whether
Nietzsche was actually engaging with the Greeks in a truly original way or not, that transcended
the limitations of these other schools. But by understanding the dialogue and the evolution
of how philosophers tended to look at the Greeks, we can better understand where Nietzsche saw himself
entering this dialogue, this dialogue that was now running for centuries. And now we understand the
question being asked, how long we approach the philosophers of antiquity? What is the nature
of their significance? Nietzsche answers these questions following in the thought of Neocontians
such as Longa, that the pre-platonics charted a course forward into materialism as we've described,
and Nietzsche argues that materialist philosophy is a kind of prerequisite scientific experimentation,
at least as a methodological presupposition. And I think there's a good argument for that,
that whether or not you fully accept like a purely materialistic view of the world,
it's almost a prerequisite methodological assumption to go gather empirical data.
And so thus training ourselves to think materialistically is required for science. And so
Nietzsche believes that scientific thinking must arrive hand in hand with philosophy itself.
And the conclusion, therefore, is that the advent of the activity of philosophizing
and the philosopher as a specific type among other types in society necessarily arises mutually
with materialism. This doesn't mean you get philosophers, you know, some guy identifies
himself as a philosopher and suddenly your whole society is materialistic overnight.
It means that the tendency and the capacity to think in materialistic terms
as a presupposition necessary for the scientific method,
it begins to emerge and it does so with greater and greater force over time as the power of
science becomes revealed to a culture. Longa provides the basis for this idea in a section
from history of materialism as follows quote materialism is as old as philosophy but not older
the physical conception of nature which dominates the earliest periods of the history of thought
remained ever entangled in the contradictions of dualism and the fantasies of personification
the first attempts to escape from these contradictions to conceive the world as a unity
and to rise above the vulgar errors of the senses leads directly into the sphere of philosophy
and amongst these first attempts materialism has its place end quote and so there is a logic
to conflating these things the emergence of philosophy with the emergence of science and
the emergence of materialism we tend to think that some form of advanced
you know scientific materialist mindset that that's that's a type of ideology specific to
modernity but Longa and Nietzsche would both oppose that view philosophy emerges as a form
of wisdom which is critical of religion and which then pursues truth outside of revelatory
knowledge you know outside of you know in ancient Greece it would have been like
irracular wisdom and the superstitions of the mystery cults it attempts to systematize and
make things clear you know not vague or mystical and not like the disconnected fragmentary
aphoristic wisdom right of people like the sages of old and where this inevitably leads
is for philosophy to question explanations of the world which have to venture outside of what
we can understand or observe by personifying nature we're seeing the work of gods or spirits
behind the phenomenal world the more that the light of reason is applied the more these avenues
from explaining the material world in terms of a supernatural world the more those are cut off
and the completion of this process is to explain the material world purely in terms
of the activities and processes that we can perceive and measure the final or ultimate
end of that project is to produce a unified understanding of the world within those terms
and that's sort of the story of the pre platonics as Nietzsche sees it and here we see how another
influence underlying all this which i haven't mentioned um there's a very big influence in
Nietzsche's life that comes into the store here to provide a unique twist to his approach
and that is he brings in that opponent of Hegel as an influence on his thought and that is Schopenhauer
Arthur Schopenhauer is the great philosopher of the will as a contemporary of Hegel's
he raged against Hegelian philosophy that Hegel had taken cons great insights into a completely
unproductive direction nevertheless Nietzsche's use of Schopenhauer is not so much to bludgeon
the Hegelian view of history rather Nietzsche builds on the Hegelian as much as anyone else did
in the wake of Hegel Hegel was so ubiquitous and his influence that fighting against Hegel would
have been a bit foolish in some sense and that isn't what Nietzsche does instead he picks up
on something within Schopenhauer within his ideas that helps us to give a coherent narrative as to
how all this works what the Greeks were doing and why this phenomenon of the philosopher arises and
why it exists in a culture and what it's driving towards and that is by drawing on the concept
of a single will underlying everything so you might wonder why is drawing upon or explaining
the concept of a will that's driving philosophy even necessary and Nietzsche has a pretty good
argument for this and this argument is that there is no obvious need for a civilization to develop
philosophy it's wonderful I love when Nietzsche points things out like this because he's I mean
at this point in his career he's not exactly a philosopher he's still a philologist albeit
philosophically curious we might say but you know just not too many academics at that time would have
questioned the validity of or the usefulness of doing philosophy right that's sort of the
the the heart and soul of the university the most important among the faculties
but Nietzsche says there's no obvious need for it and that in fact we actually have counterfactual
examples so Nietzsche writes and this is in the introduction to the pre-plotonic lectures quote
the question is attractive enough how did the Greeks philosophize during the richest and most
luxuriant period of their power or more principled did they philosophize in this period the answer
will decisively clarify the Hellenic character for us in itself philosophy is of course necessary
neither for one human being nor for a people the Romans as long as they grew only from within
are entirely unphilosophical it depends on the deepest roots of an individual and of a people
whether he philosophizes or not it concerns whether he has such an excess of intellect
that he no longer directs it only for personal individual purposes but rather with it arrives
at a pure intuition the Romans are not artists for the same reason they are not philosophers
end quote so the Romans unphilosophical people as he says and so but so long as they only
grew from within what he means by that is that Rome received religions and philosophies from the
many places it traded with and conquered and incorporated into the empire but Rome didn't
have a homegrown philosophy it didn't have a homegrown class of philosophers you look through
Roman history the best you can do is maybe someone like Cicero you know but Cicero's like
he's a philosopher of law and government you know this like pragmatic forms of philosophy
and whenever he gets in anything deeper like ethics he's almost totally dependent on the Greeks
um for his ideas and so the Romans themselves they're an intensely practical people and their
thought was accordingly unartistic unself-reflective uh self-assured martial discipline and then on
the other hand the Greeks do produce philosophers during the height of their power as a civilization
and interestingly Nietzsche makes an etymological analysis of the term wise an ancient Greek
which is the term that would have been used for the type of person that philosophize
and in Greek it means something akin to useless this does not apply to all knowledge
but specifically to the type of knowledge of the philosopher the philosopher's knowledge
is not the knowledge of an art or a craft something which produces value or utility
rather the philosopher has useless knowledge that's what it means to call him wise you know in other
words being wise is itself a luxury it doesn't have practical utility it doesn't have value in the
sense that a certainly not that a Homo economicus would understand right uh and maybe it has even
less so in the martial world of ancient Rome to be wise is the privilege of those who have leisure
time and who can spend their energies and their efforts in directions that go beyond mere survival
or day-to-day existence Whitlock elaborates on this in his commentary he speaks of the first
philosopher Thales as an example here and I'm quoting in an upridged form quote
what Thales knew surely seemed useless to the ordinary Greek the adjective wise connotes
useless luxurious or super abundant intellect which Nietzsche will later connect to the Greek
notion of noose designating a person wise connoted to the ordinary language user a
knowledge of a field such as astrology shamanism or alchemy to such a person Thales would have been
indistinguishable from other uselessly knowledgeable people such fine distinctions between astrologers
and the rest would have collapsed into the adjective wise to the ordinary language user such
thought as a luxury requiring super abundance of time wealth or intellect noose and consequently
tied to an alien reality end quote you know and so we have a counterfactual during the flourishing
of their power Rome didn't need philosophers which means philosophers are not a necessary factor to
an ascending civilization but the Greeks did produce philosophers and so that presses the
question as to why which becomes all the more pressing when their term for what philosophical
wisdom indicates is that it's useless and thus in some way unnecessary so I would say at that point
it raises a question about what is it that drives the will to philosophize and it reveals
something about the Greeks themselves when we follow this inquiry the Greeks teach us something
insofar as they demonstrate to us an example of a culture that produced geniuses who all
drive toward an encapsulation of the world within these principles of reason and as Zeller says
doing so with the goal of clear annunciation of the principles of reason and so this brings us back
to some of the initial questions I raised what is the point of science what are we doing in
pursuing scientific truth and does science require a philosophy of science or a metaphysics and so on
and so forth Schopenhauer is the final ingredient in understanding the pre-plotonic specifically
and science generally within Nietzsche's new framework Nietzsche can come at this question of
why a culture would produce something ostensibly useless like the philosopher but now with the
understanding of the emergence of science and philosophy as driven by an underlying will
and the final object of that will is the encapsulation of the world in a single principle
the explanation of the material through the material world itself that's the ultimate
object of the intellect's desire as it seeks to liberate itself liberate itself from dogma and
from mythology and leap from specialized scattered or disconnected knowledge into some sort of
constellated coherent world picture it should be noted will to power is not a fully formed idea
at this point yet Nietzsche hasn't even coined the term really but he has a head start because
Schopenhauer has already provided the idea of the will as the inner character of all being
Schopenhauer also gives us an understanding of the various phenomena of the world as gradations
of the will's self manifestations so he has this working picture of the will to go on as a sort of
provisional explanation Nietzsche says something in these lectures then that shows a prefiguration
of his will to power idea and the idea that the pursuit of truth or the pursuit of scientific
knowledge is a rarefied form of a more fundamental drive or of a more fundamental will quote
the intellect must not only desire surreptitious delights it must become completely free and
celebrate Saturnalia the liberated spirit surveys things and now for the first time
mundane existence appears to him worthy of contemplation as a problem
this is the true characteristic of the philosophical drive
wonderment at that which lies before everyone the most mundane phenomenon is becoming
with it ionian philosophy begins end quote
so when he says the the intellect must become free and celebrate Saturnalia that is of course the
roman holiday where the slave gets to play the master for the day and the masters serve the
slaves so everything is reversed right the slave is a free man though is the thing that he's
invoking here and so taking joy and understanding the most mundane phenomenon that's the beginning
of philosophy in the beginning of science from this perspective we can see how an appeal to will
show up and how ours will to explain the drive to science makes sense it's the desire for freedom
of the intellect from all constraint that of course leads the intellect to seek dominion over
all the world because that's the only way to be free of all the world's many constraints and by
this token all the world becomes interesting even the smallest simplest inanimate things become
phenomena to be understood every object offers a potential explanation about some part of reality
and so we have the understanding of what this drive towards the scientific mindset is taking joy
and expending the intellect's energy to understand everything even the smallest things so now we're
going to look at the interpretations of the pre-plotonic figures as they appear within these
lectures Nietzsche's interpretations of them and through this understanding of Nietzsche's view of
the emergence of scientific materialism in ancient Greece we get an insight into or further insight
into the secret beginnings of his philosophy so the first pre-plotonic philosopher is Thales
and Thales is sort of the traditional first among the philosophers and you know that always
presents a problem Nietzsche acknowledges this in his lectures he says anytime we say that this was
the first one he says this is almost always like a sort of it's a falsification it's an oversimplification
of reality the way he deals with that question actually is very interesting but you know even
though philosophy existed in some inchoate unorganized form Nietzsche says that the real
question is not when philosophy arose but when philosophers arose he shifts the question in
that way he's not asking you know well when did a formal discipline such as philosophy become
codified or when did people first think philosophically right because how could you answer those questions
but rather when did the first person arise who appears as an entirely different kind of figure
from the ones who came before and when did that first figure arise who is definitively a philosopher
and not classified under something else he evaluates Thales as the first philosopher on that
basis and even though you know there could still be arguments either way that Thales could sort of
fade into the background of all the other sages uh Nietzsche thinks he's got a pretty good argument
as to why Thales is the first so to talk about Thales he asserts that water is the fundamental
element of all matter all matter as we experience it while it may be configured in a certain way
as to be organic or you know metallic or wood or fire or air Thales says it's all in its most
fundamental most basic form water it's also worth noting that Thales is also a scientist
he's noted for making a discovery having to do with eclipses he was a mathematician as well
Nietzsche believes that Thales has overcome the previous preludes to the philosophical approach
to life the the areas where maybe philosophy was sort of practiced in various scattered forms
but he overcomes all of this and steps forward as the first philosopher why well Nietzsche says
he's the first because he overcomes three things which Nietzsche lists and he overcomes them all
at once first the preliminary sporadic era of philosophy these are the sages who spoke in
aphorisms and sayings but created no system second the oracular revelatory you know precursor to
philosophy that's found in religion and third the various sciences Thales overcomes these
by positing his theory that everything is water that explanation of this might seem a bit bizarre
but we'll look to Whitlock's commentary once more quote Nietzsche's strange claim that Thales
overcame the various sciences strange because even if Greek thought is science it had not
specialized into various sciences it becomes clear when we realize that Nietzsche saw in Thales the
drive or will to reduce the world to as few laws as possible and Thales assertion that all
his water speaks from such a will however rudimentarily end quote and further in the commentary
it's actually some pages later Whitlock elaborates further quote Thales goes beyond mythic thought
use of sporadic proverbs and even individual scientific pursuits to arrive at a multi scientific
understanding his interests went beyond this or that physical phenomenon to the will to comprehend
all physical phenomena end quote and so there we have it the beginning of philosophy in Nietzsche's
view the first philosopher of the west Thales he represents to Nietzsche not just a philosopher but
a figure containing within him the entire story of the scientific drive the entire impetus for the
materialist project he's the manifestation of this will to comprehend the entire physical world
the will to render the world into as few laws as possible and of course the fewest possible number
of laws would be what it would be one law right but we'll get there anyway we can see the direct
influence again on Nietzsche's thought from Friedrich Albert Lange who also describes Thales
as a materialist and so this is from the history of materialism quote materialism only becomes a
complete system when matter is conceived as purely material that is when its constituent particles
are not a sort of thinking matter but physical bodies which are moved in obedience to merely
physical principles and being in themselves without sensations produce sensations and thought
by particular forms of their combinations and thorough going materialism seems always
necessarily to be atomism and so again the animated magnet of Thales harmonizes exactly
with the expression all things are full of gods and yet is at bottom clearly to be distinguished
from the way in which atomists attempt to explain the attraction of iron by the magnet end quote
and so very important things in this quote here Lange is not only setting up what sort of the
litmus test for how materialist your system is which is very important but he talks about the
animated magnet that's a reference to the idea that Thales said the magnet has a soul right the
soul in human beings is how we account for humans ability to affect our own environment right to
or to to affect movement to move around not simply be affected we're animate we're not inanimate
right so the soul we that must be the thing that creates movement in his view and thus the magnet
must have a soul because the magnet moves iron so obviously you know Thales is the first burst
of materialist thought he's not the completion of the project by any means but we see the nature
of this tendency the underlying will his position naturally creates problems however or confusions
which become questions for further figures to solve and so we'll see this play out again and
again with this sort of dialectic that emerges Nietzsche's parallels between Thales and three
other figures who emerged in the European Enlightenment first he compares Thales to Paracelsus
who was an alchemist a scientist and a philosopher of the 1500s and who had his own theory concerning
the transformation of water you know Paracelsus through his work in chemistry he came to believe
that water was the fundamental form of matter water for Paracelsus is associated with the feminine
so we see some like you know alchemical ideas in there it's the necessary condition for all flora
you know all plant life all organic matter alcoholic spirits oil based substances alkali
you know and so on and so forth and so that's why he would draw the conclusion that water is so
fundamental the reason why Nietzsche makes this comparison is for the same fact that Paracelsus
was definitely pursuing a scientific theory which was materialist in character or at least
somewhat mature driving towards materialism we'll say and furthermore it was roughly analogous to
the same hypothesis that Thales makes and so this helps Nietzsche to establish the case that what
Thales was doing can be classified as scientific in the same way you know another point of comparison
is Antoine Lavoisier a French chemist who lived in the 18th century and Lavoisier had done experiments
by which he'd attempted to boil water for a prolonged period to see if it created sediment or you
know became solid trying to demonstrate that you could transmute an element change it from water
to earth which was a form of struggle against the Aristotelian dogma Whitlock helps explain
why it's necessary for Nietzsche to therefore make the above two comparisons quote this lecture on
Thales does not simple-mindedly conflate him with Paracelsus or Lavoisier Nietzsche suggests that
the continuing tenability in modern times of theories like theirs lends validity to interpreting
Thales's fragments as scientific notions end quote the third point of comparison Nietzsche
makes here is he compares Thales to the Cont de plus hypothesis Nietzsche writes quote Thales
sought a material less solid and properly capable of formation he begins along a path that the Ionian
philosophers follow after him actually astronomical facts justify his belief that a less solid aggregate
condition must have given rise to current circumstances here we should recall the Cont de plus hypothesis
concerning a gaseous precondition of the universe in following the same direction the Ionian
philosophers were certainly on the right path to conceive the entirety of such a multifarious
universe as merely formal differentiation of one fundamental material belongs to an
inconceivable freedom and boldness this is a service of such a magnitude that no one may aspire to
it a second time end quote so he uses the same language there describing the Greeks in terms of
freedom and boldness and the Cont de plus hypothesis which Cont in some sense makes
reference to in the quote that we started the episode with it's the idea of a gaseous initial
state to the universe it's an apparent chaos which is transformed by physical laws over time and is
some more complex state as we you know the state that it's in as we observe it today which means
you're starting from one form of matter and then through physical forces you get many forms
so Cont is he's positing a fundamental form of material which acts in a certain way such
that as a necessary result you get all the conditions we see so again Nietzsche is not
saying that Thales and the Cont de plus hypothesis are the same thing he's saying that the same road
that Thales is traveling is found in the idea of a gaseous precondition to the universe i.e. that
we begin with matter all the same form and it changes an accord with the laws of nature right
or we get the situation we're in today as Cont says you know give me matter and I shall construct a
world out of it the next significant figure actually more significant than Thales is Anax
Semender Anax Semender takes things further he still attempts to hypothesize about the nature
of being but not by proposing another qualitative thing at the base of all reality as Thales does
you know something definitive like water Anax Semender posits a principle that exists
prior to any of the elements including water you know I think he still says water's the most
fundamental of them but before that he says there's warmth and cold these two forces are more
fundamental than water and when mixed together they produce water you know it's the semen of the
world that gives rise to all the other elements but so far that's just a small advancement on what
Thales had said Anax Semender's main contribution is that he then takes it a step further than that
it says this eternal flux of warmth and cold is not itself the most fundamental thing that
even that arises from something else from something that's still more fundamental
which is called the indefinite that's how Nietzsche insists I'm translating it but
Eperon the indefinite is this ultimate unity it's Anax Semender's first principle of nature
I'm quoting here from Whitlock in an abridged form quote as Nietzsche argues the cosmic
significance of the indefinite is not as a grand collection of all qualities into infinity
its importance lies in the fact that it alone has no qualities at all in contrast to the watery
universal flux with its countless qualities the indefinite is qualityless matter the substratum
to all predicates but not itself a predicate or predicated end quote
Nietzsche's argument is that the advancement here is moving from a type of fundamental matter with
a certain quality to the idea of the qualityless and again we're operating within this framework
that blends or fails to separate philosophy and science and so really we could say that Anax
Semender is the first philosopher to posit a thing in itself that's what his indefinite really is
you know by definition it has no definite qualities it's a fundamental form of reality
that we can acknowledge but not describe because anything describable becomes split off from the
indefinite it's an important point in the history of philosophy also because Anax Semender brings
a moral dimension into this his world picture his attempt to bound the boundless within a
single law or the smallest set of principles has moral implications insofar as he explains
this reality of temporal things with definite qualities that which are constantly rising
and passing away by asserting that every phenomenon owes a debt to the indefinite
for its individuated existence so you know like we're living in this world where everything's
arising and passing away and then this someone comes along says the fundamental reality is this
indefinite thing which is you know it never arises or passes away how do you get from a to b
right as the question is like okay why why is reality in this way that seems so fundamentally
opposed to the way you're describing what you say the fundamental reality is and so you need an answer
a theodicy to some extent right a theodicy is the wrong word but and so he says Anax Semender
that everything from people to rocks to trees to planets even the more fundamental elements or
patterns you know all of these things steal their existence from the indefinite and that means that
our existence within this dynamic change this becoming as we called it our very lives
are a form of injustice and that injustice is remedied when we're returned to the indefinite
at the end of things as for what all this has to do with the development of a scientific or
materialist philosophy Whitlock gives another excellent explanation I must say quote by introducing
the indefinite into natural philosophy Anax Semender raised the crucial philosophical issue
of time the indefinite itself is timeless as ungenerated and indestructible it is outside
time altogether for each individual world or monad time begins only when it breaks off from the
indefinite and ends only with its own destruction each individual world is its own monadic measurement
of time with a succession of worlds time begins anew again and again likewise within one success
of world each individual measures time according to its own monadic existence time begins and ends
for each existent thing with its own beginning and end the larger universe undergoes time
in a similar monadic fashion microcosm and macrocosm are time monads only the indefinite
is temporally indefinite Nietzsche calls this Anaximandrian time monadism a view of the world
worthy of serious consideration end quote this time monadism view is very similar to a fragment
of an essay that Nietzsche wrote in 1873 called the time atomism fragment which is something I plan
to cover someday although getting too deeply into this topic now may derail this talk and take us
too far off the path of examining materialism but while this type of thought from Anaximander is
awfully metaphysical in comparison to the way we regard scientific thought today again I think
Nietzsche is correct to perceive it was an attempt to hypothesize about the nature of time which is
a physics question as much as a metaphysical one and that perhaps we should notice relative to
his era that Anaximander is not talking about time by invoking Zeus or Kronos he's conceiving of
time in a non-anthropomorphic way and in a way that makes time a force which is
impersonal and emotionless this is in stark contrast to the Greek picture of the gods
and so this is another thing clawed away from the vague and cloudy explanations of mythology and
brought into the light of reason and furthermore this type of theorizing helps open up new avenues
of questions once again for future figures to come along and answer how can things with
qualities arise from something which itself has no qualities is there a force that governs the rules
of what is generated would not this force be something above and beyond the indefinite itself
right if it's in the fundamental nature of the indefinite to generate things wouldn't this
nature of generation therefore be a quality thus making it something definite something
that we can define by the fact that it generates right and so these are all sorts of the things
that come up in the dialectic now in the succession of or the chronology of pre-platonics we're going
to skip Anaximonies who Nietzsche sees as sort of a minor figure we're also going to skip
Gasp Pythagoras because as Nietzsche argues Pythagoras is really a cult leader and a
superstitious religious figure and that might seem surprising to say given that the Pythagoreans were
seen as scientific innovators you know they're mathematical atomists and so on so shouldn't
they be you know fit right in and the later Pythagoreans do but Nietzsche has an argument
about this which was novel for his time but I think is widely accepted now where he drew on the
work of his friend Erwin Road another philologist to argue that the Pythagoreans came later than
Pythagoras and that Pythagoras he's a very interesting figure in terms of his personality and in
terms of the archetype he represents but that he ultimately is very different from the Pythagoreans
who came later and Nietzsche treats them entirely separately and Pythagoras therefore ends up being
he's very important because he's archetypal as this like mystical regal law dispensing figure
you know he's got this culture of personality and Nietzsche sees the persona of Pythagoras
as an aspect of Plato's personality he's one of the three archetypes that sort of Plato blends
together and so that's not that Pythagoras is overall unimportant but for understanding the
development of materialism in ancient Greece he's not really a important figure. Another thing that
Nietzsche is very concerned with in this whole thing I should say which maybe I'm not getting
across it's also partly why I'm reading more of the commentary than the translation itself because
the translation of the lectures is very interesting but Nietzsche is very concerned in these lectures
with establishing the chronology of the preplotonic figures which it makes sense because it's key
to proving that his narrative is correct his narrative of how philosophy arose hand in hand
with materialism but since this is sort of an esoteric debate that you know it's taking place
among classical philologists right we're not going to spend any time talking about his chronological
arguments here we'll leave that to the philologists and we'll just take Nietzsche's arguments for
granted on that front. Moving on we come to Heraclitus. Heraclitus is of central importance
to Nietzsche we did a whole episode just on Heraclitus that's all the way back in episode five
and we also covered some of the material from this episode in order to contextualize Heraclitus
there so if you do go back and listen to that one you haven't heard it you might hear some
of the same points covered but we have to now include Heraclitus in this examination of the
preplotonics for a different reason because he's part of this descent into materialism
and so here we see a new development on this idea of finding a means of describing the fundamental
nature of reality and it ties in with these considerations about time which Nietzsche has
brought up in Annex Cimender. While Heraclitus is often contrasted with Thales as the guy who said
everything was fire whereas Thales said everything was water this is almost painfully oversimplified
by the time we get to Heraclitus fire is more like a metaphor for something which is
in some sense indescribable because we're talking about the nature of being itself right
so you have to draw on these metaphors but Nietzsche says that Heraclitus is significant because
he rejects being there is nothing of which we can say it is duration is an illusion
rejecting Annex Cimender's idea that injustice is done by things coming into being and that
the injustice is remedied when they pass away Heraclitus says on the contrary strife is justice
rather than Annex Cimender's indefinite which is a separate thing from all the individual
monads experiencing time and separate existence the thing in itself for Heraclitus is the world
of becoming in which we all live arising and passing away is the definite quality of existence
the nature of reality is revealed in how things arise and pass away rather than concealed by
that effect we don't hide a timeless reality behind things but rather this world of absolute
impermanence is itself the ultimate reality that's the Heraclitian view and so there is a definite
quality which is change change is eternal and all-encompassing the scientific associations
that Nietzsche draws here with Heraclitus are incredibly fascinating he invokes a thought
experiment of Carl von Beyer concerning pulse rates and he references the thoughts of von Helmholtz
on cosmic timescales also i'm gonna go into the lecture and read a rather long section of this
lecture on Heraclitus that is about von Beyer because i think the only way for the full implications
of what Nietzsche is saying to come through is to hear the whole thought experiment as he lays it out
and so quote a researcher in natural science at the petersburg academy Carl Ernst von Beyer
held a lecture in 1860 entitled which conception of living nature is the correct one
he offers a remarkable thought experiment the rates of sensation and of voluntary movements
thus of conscious life appear among various animals to be approximately proportional to their
pulse rates well then since for example the pulse rate among rabbits is four times faster
than that among cattle these will also experience four times as much in the same period and we'll
be able to carry out four times as many acts of will as cattle thus in general experiencing four
times as much the inner life of various animal species including humans proceeds through the
same astronomical time space at different specific rates and it is according to these
that they subjectively and variously judge the fundamental standard of time for this reason
alone only because for us this fundamental standard is small does an organic individual a plant or
an animal appear to us as something remaining at one size and in one shape for we could observe it
100 times or more in a minute without noting noticing any external alterations well then
we think it very important whether pulse rate rate of sensation and the human intellectual
process either decelerate or accelerate since in this way they're fundamentally altered assuming
that the course of human life with childhood maturity and old age were reduced by a factor
of one one thousandth to one month and that pulse rate were accelerated 1000 times faster
then we would be able to follow a flying bullet very easily with our vision if this lifetime
were reduced once more by a factor of one one thousandth limited to some 40 minutes then we
would consider the grass and flowers to be something just as absolute and persistent
as we now consider the mountains we would perceive in the growth of a bud as much and as little as
a lifetime like when we think of the geological periods of the earth we would be totally unable
to observe the voluntary movements of animals for they would be far too slow at best we could
conceive of them as we in our time frame think of the heavenly bodies and with a still further
reduction of a lifetime to a scale of one one billionth the light that we now see would perhaps
become audible our sounds would become inaudible when on the other hand we enormously lengthen and
expand a human lifetime we get quite another picture reduce for example pulse rate and sensation
threshold by one one thousandth and then our life would last at the upper end 80 000 years
then we would experience as much in one year as we do now in eight to nine hours then every four
hours we would watch winter melt away the earth thaw out grass and flowers spring up trees come
into full bloom and bear fruit and then all vegetation wilt once more many developments
would not be observed by us at all because of their speed for example a mushroom would suddenly
sprout up like a fountain day and night would alternate like light and shadows and but a moment
and the sun would race along the arch of the heavens in the greatest hurry were we to decelerate
this lifetime already reduced a thousand fold once again to a scale of one one millionth a human
being would be capable of making only 189 perceptions in an earth year the difference
between day and night would entirely vanish the solar ecliptic would appear as a luminous bow
across the sky as a glowing coal when swung in a circle appears to form a circle of fire
and vegetation would continually shoot up and vanish in great haste enough then every shape
appearing to us as persistent would vanish in the super haste of events and would be devoured
by the wild storm of becoming whatever remains the unmoving proves to be a complete illusion
the result of our human intellect in quote and so well heraclitus philosophize in such a scattered
aphoristic form in which there are so many interpretations and so many ways in which his
ideas could be thought of as merely poetic or you know something like that Nietzsche sees in
heraclitus's ideas the potential for a new way of thinking about duration of bringing
perspectivism to bear upon the concept of duration and what that does to our cold concept of time
Nietzsche is influenced in this by the neocontians again and by Schopenhauer and so far as both of
those camps tended to regard time as part of our representation of the world rather than
something innate to the thing in itself in other words time is something we experience
within our little monad of willing wherein our intellect represents existence to us
but time is part of the representation it exists at the intersection of our intellect and reality
as such time in our experience of it is infinitely divisible right as that's what Nietzsche is sort
of doing there he's infinitely dividing and as such our understanding of what time is can't
really be separated from our perception of it like talking about time outside of the perception
of time is a bit difficult I mean we can describe it mathematically of course but it becomes very
difficult to conceive to imagine what we're talking about right and so Lange had the following
to say about heraclitus in which we can see the influence on Nietzsche and so far as heraclitus
fitting into the development of materialism quote the boundless of annex semander from which
everything proceeds the divine primitive fire of heraclitus into which the changing world returns
to proceed from it anew are incarnations of persistent matter and quote so he's the term
boundless there but he means the indefinite or the apron of annex semander so you know heraclitus's
philosophy it begins by invoking natural law the logos heraclitus says there's a definite
governing quality a law according to which reality behaves or nature behaves and in logos
we have some element of intelligence within the essence of the natural world some quality that
you know perhaps reminds us of Thales placing a soul within the magnet and yet we're getting
closer to this attempt to perceive a world which is persistent matter and nothing more
existing merely in variegated transformations according to interactions between the different
forms of matter so Lange sees this as a step in the direction of human beings coming to
understand matter as being persistent but all this stuff that Nietzsche brings in with von
Baer comparing him to heraclitus yet again once again shows heraclitus is not somebody who's
typically thought of as having scientific notions right when he says that duration is
essentially an illusion in so many words and that changes eternal that's not taken as a scientific
statement but the reason why Nietzsche then brings in these scientific thought experiments
which are intensely neocontient by the way I mean if all of our world is a that we experience as a
representation it's you know the work of external reality interacting with our sense organs than
other beings who have other sense organs or a different physiology a different pulse rate
might be living in a different representation so to speak a whole different world and so
following from those neocontient principles and those ideas about time that we talked about
Nietzsche comes to compare the you know somewhat obscure sayings of heraclitus as scientific
notions yet again it's very fascinating so we're going to gloss over parminides next and this is
Nietzsche sees parminides and xenophonies as a dead end in the development of pre platonic
philosophy and now Nietzsche does see parminides as possessing a mastery of abstract thought
and he has to master abstract thought in order to assert his central idea which in parminides case
just to give a quick version there's only one thing you can say and that is the declaration
of the existence of being that it is it's the only thing you can sensibly say about being
and so of course in parminides case it's not that duration is an illusion it's that
motion is an illusion and that if anything change is the illusion and duration is the only reality
parminides is not a main figure in Nietzsche's eyes though and he says further in a letter to road
he considers parminides a great false step in the interpretations of pre platonic
philosophers so here's witlock i've abridged this quotation a little bit but he describes an
important difference between the thought of Nietzsche and the thought of longa and it concerns
parminides quote parminides claimed the abstract oneness of all being his assumption was that our
human intellect is the measure of all things becoming therefore belongs among illusions of
the senses Nietzsche called this twist of thought the most dangerous of all false paths
longa considered parminidian being to be a doctrine basic to but not identical with
materialistic atomism Nietzsche considered the atomists to be pluralists and parminides and
heraclitus to be monists he ultimately considered parminides to be the least substantive and fruitful
of the pre platonics parminides's idea of the senses as delusion led into an epistemological
cul-de-sac he should not be thought of as a philosopher of nature or physicist at all end
quote and so in light of this we're also going to skip past zeno with his famous paradox part of
the same school of thought as parminides although granted he had an impact on the development of
the dialectic and the discussion of problems sort of inherent to these current conceptions of
spacetime and motion the main problem Nietzsche has here is that he sees xenophonies parminides
and zeno as essentially being antinaturalists and so we could spend more time talking about
the nuances of them here but we're not going to go over every last figure so we're just going to
skip ahead the interest of time and just the fact that if we're giving it from Nietzsche's point of
view he thinks these are you know a dead end and next sagorous is a pivotal figure for Nietzsche
um who would come next uh in the character of an exagerus we see definitively that the string
of figures each attempting to describe the nature of the material world were not simply engaging
in idle speculation but following a dialectic an exagerus is a great exemplar of how in the
pre-plotonic philosophers we find many of the same conclusions concepts or frames of thought
that would be rediscovered in later eras um such as during the Enlightenment of Europe
so Nietzsche interprets an exagerus as having discovered the concept of the conservation of
matter which Longa saw he saw sort of a first inkling of that within Heraclitus and an eximender
conservation of mass is a principle we use in physics to this very day obviously and so
an exagerus holds that matter is indestructible and it simply changes form and so we get a great
leap here and it it happens with help from the iliatics the properties which were formerly assigned
to being and which are associated you know we might say especially associated with being among
zeno and parminides that being is indestructible right this is now applied to becoming to the
matter that makes up the physical world in which we live and so an exagerus revises the hypothesis
of an eximender the idea of the hyperon the indefinite the thing in itself right he says
uh that instead the unlimited is a mixture of all qualities it's not quality least
qualityless matter it's a mixture of all of them for an exagerus the fundamental reality
contains the seeds of all things that exist right so that gets over the problem of how
do you get things with qualities from a qualityless thing in itself let's get rid of the qualityless
thing and where an exagerus differs with the iliatics is and then he doesn't hold to their
view of the oneness of being an exagerus is in all things a philosopher of multiplicity
and so whitlock writes of him quote between an exagerus and the iliatics nisha argues existed
a great disjunction either the iliatics were correct that being is one and the many along
with motion do not exist or an exagerus was right and there are infinitely many beings in motion
an exagerus transferred the properties of iliatic being to his beings
end quote and so singular being to beings plural so in an exagerus we have a further
refinement of materialism further progress in explaining all the movement of matter
according to the fewest laws the principles he uses are mixing and separating so in the picture he
gives us there are infinitely many beings they emerge from an initial unlimited which
contains all the potential qualities and then they behave according to these two fundamental
behaviors of mixing and separating not being created or destroyed themselves these units
of matter but simply combining and recombining according to mechanistic principles an exagerus
only appeals to some sort of intellect to explain the workings of these processes
when his account of mixing and separating can't explain the effect so there's still a god of
the gaps here right in the form of the noose you know the intellect it's an element which is still
very much necessary but rather than being all encompassing as in the heracliton idea of like
say logos here intellect is only used as a last necessity some sort of divine intellect in the
system an exagerus is expressing this will to as much as possible interpret physical phenomena
as governed by non-intelligent mechanistic processes and so that's a further step on the
road of materialism but of course a dualism still remains here because that's one of the things
that philosophy that science has to overcome right that longus says it has to overcome so we
simply have a more refined dualism but it exists now we have this old problem of that you have
motion spirited motion which is found in organic life us animation right and then you have the
motion of non-living objects this still exists in an exagerus and so then we come to the question
of mechanical versus non-mechanical motion and the question can one's philosophical system include
both is it permitted to include both and so this dualism naturally must be answered and the next
person in the dialect or the dialectic to answer it is Empedocles. Empedocles is a very interesting
figure because he wavered between science and magic is how he's described by many people.
Nietzsche describes him he's a man living on the edge of reason and irrational passions
he dabbles in poetry and rhetoric art science religion oratory politics his significance
to our inquiry here is that Empedocles introduces the idea of an original non-mechanical motion
a first cause which sets all mechanical motion into play thus resolving the dualism right this
type of argument still employed today in theology in the form of the first cause argument for god
right personal being with an intelligence so even though there are the laws of physics which mean
that angels aren't individually pushing planets around the first cause that is god set everything
into motion after which all the mechanical laws of the universe can then govern everything
they don't need intelligence managing it at every moment but so we get this theological
argument today which we could say we find some form of it or like you could say it's indirectly
inherited from Empedocles and his particular attempts and in this struggling towards bringing
our world picture into the light of reason but Empedocles of course has these two sides to him
so he also introduces something which in its modern form is usually considered as one of the
opening salvos against religious thought Empedocles developed an idea of natural selection forms
which arise by chance but which are shaped or selected for based on conditions Schopenhauer
had recognized in his writings that Empedocles saw in plant and animal life an inner dwelling
desire Schopenhauer believed that this was akin to his own theory that the inner character of
all things is will and he considered Empedocles as a forerunner to his own philosophy you know as
it's given in world as will and representation more interestingly for our examination we might
consider how Nietzsche believed Empedocles to correlate in some sense with Darwin on this basis
in the same way that Thales correlates with Lavassier or Heraclitus with von Baer and so Nietzsche
once again shows his influence from Friedrich Lange who wrote in his history of materialism
quote what Darwin relying upon a wide extent of positive knowledge has achieved for our generation
Empedocles offered to the thinkers of antiquity the simple and penetrating thought
that adaptations preponderate in nature just because it is in their nature to perpetuate
themselves while what fails of adaptation has long since perished end quote
of course neither Nietzsche nor Lange could consider someone like Empedocles to be
a materialist and he's really not anything close but Empedocles holds to views like the
oneness of all things and he believes that existence is a form of punishment the strife
endured within existence is the satisfaction of a kind of moral recompense so we can see
the precedent for those beliefs in an ex-semender for example and how they're getting carried on
and those moral ideas are developing as well and so that's perhaps one of these pitfalls
of your science and your philosophy being unified right is that as you have this
dialectic pushing towards materialism there's also all this junk that's collecting
but Empedocles also sees these totally non-mechanistic forces of love and hate
sort of governing existence which means that Empedocles's overall understanding of the universe
is not materialistic at all nevertheless he's still very important because Nietzsche's knowledge
of Schopenhauer and Schopenhauer's comments on Empedocles probably helped broaden
Nietzsche's understanding of Empedocles's significance because in addition to his point
of comparison with Darwin he can be helpful to Nietzsche in introducing that conception that's
akin to the will the will that Nietzsche's sort of using to explain the entire drive towards
scientific knowledge you know this is the point of the story when that explanation that Nietzsche's
using to explain the drive to scientific knowledge is discovered by that same drive to scientific
knowledge right and so the inner dwelling desire this driving that exists in all things
which Schopenhauer associates with his own conception of the will is then carried over
into Nietzsche's interpretation we'll look at a Whitlock summary of Empedocles's significance
here and Whitlock sets up I think the implications for us in terms of understanding how this is
such a secret beginning to Nietzsche's philosophizing and how Nietzsche picked up things
from his examination of materialism arising in Greece that would inform ideas throughout his
whole career so here's Whitlock and I've abridged this reading yet again quote in this lecture
series the evolution of Nietzsche's theory of the will is most pronounced in the discussions of
Anaximander, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and the Atomists. Empedocles took a crucial step
toward Newton, Leibniz, and Boskovich for the philosopher from Agregentum approached the world
as force and matter. Nietzsche connects the notion of an inner drive, tribe, with the notion of a
primal power, mocked of motion. These are likewise connected to the notion of force, craft.
All these were crucial steps toward a theory of the will to power, Vilizou mocked.
The notion of an inner drive is the Schopenhauerian will rather than love, strife is its dynamic
quality. A great failure of Empedocles was his inability to overcome teleology.
His ordered universe arose from mind. Nietzsche's profoundly anti-teleological thinking demanded
a repudiation of natural purpose in the Aristotelian sense. Materialism presupposes
such a rejection of teleology so that Empedocles was ultimately not a materialist. It would be left
to Democritus to combine all the necessary elements of materialism into one system.
So, where we are so far is that Nietzsche, guided by Lange, as well as Ubreweg, Schopenhauer,
even Zeller, looks at each figure as a fascinating personality, offering a
wholly unique philosophical type, and yet, together, the pre-Platonics bring forth the
development of a purely materialistic world picture. We might think of how scientists and
philosophers in the Enlightenment, which Nietzsche is standing at the end of in his own time,
some people say we're still in the Enlightenment now, but I would say at the end of the Romanticist
sort of rebellion against a lot of the Enlightenment thinking, and then the transition
into the modernity of the World Wars, I don't know for exactly the same spirit of the Enlightenment
that we were, but however you want to say it, Nietzsche is much closer to that period, and
we might think of how those scientists, they emerged from a similar period of ignorance
and dogmatism, where the intellect was ruled by Aristotelian notions and by theological prejudices,
and it dawned on Nietzsche that the European mind once again had to proceed out of this
dualistic, personified, superstitious understanding of how the world functions,
and was now driving towards more and more mechanistic and material explanations, and that
this same pattern is what the pre-Platonics had done, but Empedocles is still thinking
teleologically, which is sort of the last thing to get over. Now, it could also be argued Nietzsche
has all the raw material for will to power in the pre-Platonics that he's discussed, and what is
will to power? I don't mean what is the actual will to power, the actual content, I'm saying like,
what is Nietzsche doing when he comes up with the theory of will to power? I mean, Nietzsche's
theory of will to power is his attempt to explain the world with as few laws as possible,
with one law that governs existence. And so we must consider the possibility that will to power
for Nietzsche is not just a meta-ethical principle, it's not just a psychological principle, it's
a scary thought, you know, scary for those of us who have safely compartmentalized the grandiose
claims about will to power into being, you know, purely psychological statements, right?
It's a scary thought that will to power may have started, may have originated as an attempt by
Nietzsche to philosophize in the manner of the pre-Platonics. Nietzsche's attempt to craft a
world picture that unifies both science and philosophy, and explains the material world
by by means of matter and the use of a single principle. Now, with Democritus, it's the last
figure we'll consider among the pre-Platonics, and it's the climatic part of the lecture,
where we finally have a complete materialistic theory. And this doesn't mean that Democritus
has solved all the questions in physics, right? It means that with Democritus, we have a view of
the world in which no intelligence or personified spiritual forces or dualism is necessary.
Democritus gives us a theory of the atom. We get the word atom from Democritus,
and so he says, all things are made of atoms. And we can see how this develops out of the work of
Anaxagoras, the philosopher of multiplicity. But Democritus refines it even further. Democritus
defines atoms as the smallest unit of matter, the most fundamental unit from which all other forms
are constructed. This is the universe as multiplicity, as Anaxagoras describes it, but Democritus makes
all things nothing but atoms and void. Rather than appealing to a non-mechanistic first cause,
or a metaphysical force such as love, Democritus sees, as Nietzsche says in his lecture,
quote, no chance whatsoever but rather the most rigorous lawfulness, only not according to the
laws of reason. Well then, Democritus derives all motion from empty space and weight, or mass,
the German word is Schwer. Heavy atoms sink down and drive the smaller ones upward by pressure,
end quote. Whitlock summarizes Nietzsche's overall assessment of Democritus, quoting in an abridged
form here, quote, the lectures on Democritus and the late Pythagoreans are the dialectical
culmination of the lecture series, for they arrive at a mathematical atomism, the most powerful of
the ancient systems and the inner expression of will that the Greeks had to explicate.
This lecture also clearly shows Nietzsche rejecting Schopenhauer's old worn out objections to
materialism, an enthusiastic favor of materialistic atomism. Though reading between the lines reveals
that Nietzsche was simultaneously developing his own theory of will within this materialistic
atomistic discourse, the lecturer does not hesitate to announce that atomism is, quote,
the truth for us, end quote. And what Whitlock quotes immediately afterwards is something that
I'll just read, it's from back in the lecture, because it shows how Nietzsche sort of identifies
with Democritus here at the end, quote, materialism is a worthwhile hypothesis of
relativity and truth. Accordingly, all is false has been discovered to be an illuminating notion
for natural science. We still consider then all its results to be truth for us, albeit not absolute.
It is precisely our world in whose production we are constantly engaged, end quote.
And so in these remarks that will be perhaps frustrating for the epistemological realists
out there, you know, Nietzsche again tells us something useful about the way that he thinks.
There's a general attitude at this point in his career that's inherited from the Neocontians,
that we live in a world of representations, that reality as we experience it is not an objective
mind independent reality. Now, this doesn't mean there's no external reality. Nietzsche
criticizes that idea in Beyond Good and Evil simply by saying our sense organs are not themselves
representations of our organs that would be absurd. Nevertheless, as the neuroscientist and noted
reality skeptic David Hoffman has said, when we look at the neuron, you know, at a neuron of the
brain, for instance, even through an electron microscope, we're still just looking at a pixel.
The neuron as we see it is a representation of something in the external world that our brain
is creating. We live in our nervous systems, right? We can break down the pixel into infinitely
smaller pixels, but it's still just all pixels. It's a symbolical representation for something
with which we have no direct experience. And so that's Nietzsche's mindset epistemologically.
And it's interesting how his thought did develop on this as he went on. But at the time of these
lectures, I think this is the world Nietzsche is living in. And I think in that mindset,
we can see the sense in what he's saying that mathematical atomism is the most refined form
of materialism. And that's true for both the Greeks and for those in Nietzsche's time. And
even though the state of science in Europe was far more advanced than it had been during the time
of the pre-plotonics, Nietzsche's argument here is really one more of philosophy of science than
of a scientific nature itself. That democratists coming from a time when science and philosophy
were unified brings about the dawning of a new mindset and a new view of the world.
And now that our science and our philosophy are seen as separate things, we perhaps don't see
the ways in which scientific knowledge or scientific hypotheses carry with them this shift in our view
of reality. We live in an atomistic world these days, just as democratists did, that we think of
our reality as consisting of particles of smaller building blocks governed by physical laws, which
are non-personal, non-intelligent, mechanistic. We live today in a democratian world. And I think
that's what Nietzsche is pointing to about how this is the truth for us. When we behold democratists,
we're seeing somebody who has come around to the same worldview that we have come around to.
And so the narrative Nietzsche discovers is what I've called, as the title of the episode,
the descent into materialism. It's an archetypal narrative, almost, of how the arising of philosophy,
the cultivation of this useless knowledge, this wisdom that endeavors to bound the boundless,
right, state clearly all that is obscured and secret in the world. This necessarily arises
hand in hand with science. It inevitably represents an ever stronger tendency toward materialism.
And the final form of this is atomism, which we get to a democratist or in Nietzsche's own time.
And I would argue we still tend to think about things that way today. Nietzsche, therefore,
reinterprets the significance of science in accord with his own cyclical ideas of time.
He sees the same phenomenon in ancient Greece as in Enlightenment Europe,
because both are expressions of the same underlying will, even though the details,
the conditions are different, right? But the will drives us to the same ends,
because it's the same thing fundamentally in Nietzsche incarnation.
And so I think it's best to describe this as a descent as well. And I intend this in both the
positive and the negative connotations, because on the positive side of things, I mean, the
pre-plotonics initiate this project of Greek philosophy out of a will to bring the Greek psyche
down to earth, to take us out of flighty abstractions, take us away from that mystified gaze up to the
personified heavens, you know, the psychodrama that the Greeks saw in the stars, and instead,
look to the smallest, most mundane things and take joy in understanding them.
This turn of our perspective inevitably leads us to learn the patterns by which
things on earth behave, and we begin to explain the world less and less by recourse of reaching
up into the clouds, until finally with Democritus, we can explain the world without reaching into
mythology at all. But there's a negative side, and there's a negative sense to the word descent,
that this descent into materialism is also a descent into nihilism.
We discussed this in the episode we just did on nihilism, and it's what Nietzsche called the
problem of science in so many words. It achieves its final form, so to speak, in the figure to
follow Democritus and the later Pythagoreans, who was Socrates. He's who basically comes next in
the dialogue, the mystagogue of science, the man who made reason, a universal and binding principle,
waged war on all the dogmas and superstitions and illusions. Science becomes this totalizing force,
even when it threatens the preservation or the expansion of life. And so here too, in this early
philological study, Nietzsche finds one of the central questions and the problems that
concerned his whole career. Nietzsche, at this time, places himself in the milieu of the
pre-platonics and their quest for a materialist world picture, and influenced as he is by Langa,
who's a materialist, Nietzsche considers the creation of a purely materialist worldview as a
form of triumph. But he nevertheless has begun to see where materialism will inexorably lead,
in life being sacrificed to the truth, and this arrives with the figure of Socrates.
And so, you know, his project really becomes, how can this tragic end to the development
of philosophy be overcome or dealt with? That's like a central project of Nietzsche's, but that
all begins here. All right, so that's it. We're going to do a similar subject matter next week,
we're going to actually continue with a lot of the same text, but we're going to,
we barely touched on Democritus, and he's in fact so significant to later Nietzsche,
in parallel with another figure, Boskovich. So we're going to spend the next episode talking
about these two people, they're scientists and philosophers of science, one ancient and one
sort of like, I guess you'd say, pre-modern, it's Democritus and Boskovich. And Schopenhauer
and Spinoza, I think, will make appearances to you, special guest appearances. Because what comes
out of this, which we've only barely touched on, is an attempt at a scientific theory to the will
to power. And so, the next episode is all about that, the world as will to power, and nothing
besides. So I'm excited, we're getting into, I like that we've gotten into more obscure stuff now,
and I guess this was another long episode, but you know,
just gotta go until it's finished, I guess. All right, so join me again next week, y'all.
All right, signing off.
Quote, of all the more ancient systems, the Democritian is of the greatest consequence.
The most rigorous necessity is presupposed in all things.
There are no sudden or strange violations of nature's course. Now, for the first time,
the collective anthropomorphic mythic view of the world has been overcome. Now, for the first time,
do we have a rigorous scientific, useful hypothesis. As such, materialism has always been
of the greatest utility. It is the most down-to-earth point of view. It proceeds from real properties
of matter, and it does not indifferently leave out the simplest forces, as is done by accounts of
mind, or that of final ends by Aristotle. It is a grand idea, this entire world of order
and purposiveness, of countless qualities to be traced back to externalizations of one force
of the most basic sort. Matter, moving itself according to general laws, produces a blind,
mechanistic result, which appears to be the outline of a highest wisdom.
End quote. That was Nietzsche from his lecture on Democritus in the pre-Platonic lecture series.
Democritus was the philosopher of ancient Greece who coined the term atom,
for the concept of the smallest unit of matter. Democritus asserted that all matter was made up
of forms constructed of smaller units, and the smallest of these were atoms. Through strictly
naturalistic processes, atoms interact, and from a totally blind nature, we get all of the movements
and emergent phenomena that we experience in reality. And so here we see in Nietzsche's estimation
the significance of Democritus, the first truly materialistic or purely materialistic
natural philosopher who overcomes all of these mythic personifications of the world,
and all of these appeals to a non-mechanistic first cause, or metaphysical forces such as love or
hate, such as what had been introduced by previous figures in their explanations of the world,
Democritus doesn't have to introduce a moral or metaphysical element to explain existence,
as, for example, Empedocles did before him. He does not have to appeal to Noose, the element of
there being some underlying intellect governing the world, as we see in, for example, Anaxagoras,
who also preceded Democritus. Anaxagoras sometimes has to invoke a divine intellect as
an explanation, even though he was driving, along with the other pre-plotonic philosophers,
towards this sort of methodological materialism. And Democritus, as Nietzsche interprets him,
the Greeks reach a zenith of materialism, and this is what he designates as a mathematical atomism.
In this, all qualitative descriptions can be put into quantities. All movement of the universe
occurs without the need of an intelligence, and this opens up the possibility for science
to branch off down its various paths. Nietzsche here acknowledges the power, the utility of atomism,
as a framework for understanding the world, and he believes that atomism is the direction in which
the science of his own day was proceeding. But notice another element in Nietzsche's words
about Democritus, something he sees in Democritus is very fascinating in light of Nietzsche's own
ideas, which he would not fully describe until much later in his career. He clearly shows an
interest in the grand idea, as he calls it, of an entire world being called forth in all of its
infinite complexities from a single force. Indeed, throughout the pre-plotonic lectures,
Nietzsche believes that the Greek drive to philosophy revealed that underlying the philosophical
project is a will to bound the world within as few first principles as possible. The zenith
of that attempt is therefore a single principle. This was the task of the philosopher in the days
of the pre-plotonics, when science and philosophy were still unified to explain reality by as few
possible laws. And so can Nietzsche dare to undertake such a task in his own time of finding
a single force to explain the entirety of existence, from which all the other principles can be
derived. I think the spark of that idea occurs here. And note again that this is a materialist
endeavor for Nietzsche. He does not conceive of this quest as in itself necessarily metaphysical,
because like Democritus, he does not reach into the heavens for explanations wherever there's a gap,
but rather attempts to explain the physical solely by means of the physical.
Nietzsche's own attempt culminates with the concept of will to power. Will to power is the
single principle, formula, law, or force, whatever we want to call it, by which Nietzsche will attempt
to explain the entire world. And while will to power need not be taken to this level of this
kind of perspective on it in order to be useful, I mean, many people employ will to power simply as
an ethical or psychological principle, including myself in many ways. But this strange intersection
of will to power with the explanations for the physical world is in the backdrop of Nietzsche's
philosophy. And it's tied in with his odd theories of time and with his notion of the eternal recurrence.
And it's been argued that will to power therefore first emerges for Nietzsche not in a moral or
psychological aspect, but while he's in the process of examining scientific ideas. And
insofar as we may say that science itself is doing ontology, that's what he's doing, right? So if we've
abandoned the true world and we believe the ontological reality to be the material world
that we all live in, in that sense, you could say that Nietzsche is talking about will to power as a
sort of ontological force. This idea comes with a million caveats, of course. And for all of those,
you can listen to the preceding episodes of the podcast. For today, however, the topic is
Nietzsche's scientific influences for the idea of will to power, and will to power as an
explanatory principle within physics or within the context of thinking about physics. Can we make
any sense of will to power in this sense? Does it have any use for us for today? And can understanding
this scientific angle on the will to power give us any insight into the other nuances of Nietzsche's
philosophy? And I would say that it does. It's not required that you listen to the previous episode
Descent into Materialism. But I'll just say at this point, you probably will get more out of
this one if you listen to that one first, since it gives a lot of context for the way Nietzsche thinks
and how his philosophy of science compares and contrasts with previous views of science.
But just as a summary, I guess, a brief synopsis, Nietzsche is heavily influenced by Neocontain
interpretations of the history of science. He draws as much insight from the pre-plotonic
philosophers of ancient Greece as he does from contemporary figures. And finally, Nietzsche is
himself very much engaged in a dialogue with the sciences and addressing himself to ideas about the
philosophy of science proposed by the great philosophers that came before him. And so more
than anything, if you didn't listen to that talk, the most important thing to know is that Nietzsche
was very much up to date on the developments in the sciences. He was very concerned with the
philosophy of science. And rather than being an irrationalist, he sees himself, at least in his
early career, as being a scientific materialist. Now, of course, some of his later statements
might actually contradict that. But nevertheless, I think that is how he understood his idea of
will to power at this point, as coming out of a dialectic between past materialist philosophers
of science. And the funny thing here is, I can't call it dialectical materialism, because Marxists
have claimed that particular designation. But what we're talking about here is quite literally a
dialogue, a dialectical development of a view of the world occurring between materialists,
in a materialist, in a scientific sense. And we could say that today, almost all scientists
are the product of this dialectic. And so far as they're all mostly materialists, at least again,
in a methodological sense. Sure, there are some oddballs out there who profess panpsychism and
similar things. But in Nietzsche's time, not everyone was materialist. And so that's why it's
important to zero in on the fact that it is this materialist branch of neo-continent philosophy
that's most influential in Nietzsche's thinking here, and that there were actually other options
out there at the time. And we'll get into those a little bit as we continue. Again, we find Friedrich
Albert Lange, who wrote the history of materialism, is a key influence on Nietzsche's thought.
We talked a lot about Lange last time as sort of guiding Nietzsche through understanding the
pre-plotonic philosophers. I thought I'd read some quotations here that more
straightforwardly established that link and helped support the case for this week's talk,
that democratis of all people would be a main influence on Nietzsche and his will to power idea.
But when we examine how democratis is treated in Lange's work, this interpretation comes
together very nicely. So in any case, George J. Stack noted that Nietzsche said that Lange's book
History of Materialism was a, quote, treasure chest of ideas presented to him, end quote.
This recalls Whitehead's phrasing that Plato's work is an inexhaustible mind of suggestion.
For Nietzsche, he found that in Lange. And so Nietzsche wrote in 1866, quote,
The most significant philosophical work to appear in the last decade is without a doubt Lange,
History of Materialism, about which I could write voluminous praise.
Kant, Schopenhauer, and this book by Lange. I do not need more than that, end quote.
Now, of course, Nietzsche would expand beyond those influences such as Kant and Schopenhauer,
and he would therefore expand beyond Lange as well. But while Schopenhauer's name,
for example, comes up all the time when we talk about Nietzsche's influences, Lange hardly comes
up at all. And so that's one of the reasons why I think it's important to emphasize him throughout
this sort of detour into Nietzschean science we're doing here at the end of the season, because
he's so explanatory of Nietzsche's thinking on this. So again, when it comes to Nietzsche's
interpretation of Democritus, Democritus is central to Lange's book. While Lange mentions the other
pre-Socratic philosophers, or pre-Platonics as Nietzsche calls them, Democritus gets far more
attention from Lange than any other among the pre-Socratics. And as a matter of fact, Lange's
book actually begins with a chapter entitled The Early Atomists, especially Democritus.
Not only does this discussion of Democritus begin the work, but Democritus plays a central role
in the entire book for Lange. Lange asserts in that work, quote,
the modern atomic theory has been gradually developed from the atomism of Democritus, end quote.
The centrality of Democritus as the main pre-Socratic figure was sort of shared in the
viewpoint of Zeller. We talked a little bit about Zeller last time. He's a semi-Hegelian
philologist with whom Nietzsche had some agreements and some disagreements. It's worth noting that
for the pre-Platonic lectures, Nietzsche mostly critiques Zeller. But one of the only points
of agreement that he finds is that Zeller is aligned with Lange when it comes to understanding
the importance of Democritus. And so Democritus is the culmination of the Materials Project in
Ancient Greece. He also presents us with another archetypal personality among the pre-Platonic
philosophers. So if we'll remember Nietzsche sees, he thinks it's very important that the
pre-Platonics emerge at a time before there's a definitive thing such as a school or cast of
philosophers. And each of them has to sort of define what it means to be a philosopher on his own.
And so he presents all of them as this series of fascinating, unique personalities.
And when it comes to Democritus, he's known as the laughing philosopher. He's often
contrasted with Heraclitus, the philosopher who was associated with sadness and melancholy.
And I personally might question these designations as maybe being a bit anachronistic.
But nevertheless, this is the common picture. Democritus is the philosopher who laughs, right?
And perhaps this is because Democritus praises cheerfulness in his own work.
And so we have a presentation of a worldview which is, for the first time, scientific and more or
less fully liberated from mythology. But this is done cheerfully by someone who meets this
entirely material existence with a laugh. And so we cannot help but see something resembling
a joyous science within the figure of Democritus. Well, you know, Nietzsche probably got that coinage,
the phrase, gay science or joyous science from Emerson. But Nietzsche's admiration for Democritus,
for the Democritian approach to life and to knowledge, that may have been one of the influences
that sort of led to him to conceive of the concept of such a gay science, right?
And so not only does Nietzsche describe the atomism of Democritus as constituting this most
consequential of all ancient theories, but furthermore, we see in Democritus and his
forerunner, Lucipus, another innovation. They produce a perspectival theory of human experience
in which we might recognize the prefiguration of the sort of phenomena, numinous split of Kant,
which influenced the scientific thinking of the Neocontians. So Democritus' description of thought
and of sensation are that images, or we might say representations, affect the body from outside,
or they stimulate the body from outside. There's an outside stimulus which is then transformed
into an image, and that even the basis of thoughts themselves are images or representations, we might
say. And so certainly Nietzsche would recognize, he recognizes the kinship here in this picture of
cognition with Schopenhauer and the Neocontians, von Helmholtz and Longa. But we must turn to the
most consequential aspect of Democritus. What is the atomism of Democritus, the man who gave us
the very word atom, which we use to this day? In the atomic theory of Democritus, we have the idea
of atoms as indivisible. They're indivisible units, they're the bedrock unit of matter,
so naturally they're the point at which particles of matter cannot be divided into any more parts.
Different forms of matter are simply different arrangements of atoms, or different shapes
that exist in different positions in space. Bodies are all constructed of atoms, and when bodies perish,
the atoms in them disassemble, but the atoms themselves are not created or destroyed,
so we have conservation of matter. And furthermore, Democritus sees atoms as moving entirely in
accord with laws governing weight, so they don't undergo, they're completely explained by mechanistic
processes, they don't undergo direct contact, and action at a distance does not occur.
Now, of course, this means there's an inevitable split or separation between what we perceive
through the senses and what actually exists, sort of the hallmark of Greek philosophy, right?
And that would seem to be required furthermore by the Democritian account of perception and cognition.
So if there are these units of matter that are so small, we cannot see them, you know,
with enough specificity to see the boundaries between them. Such a difference between what we
perceive and what the world truly is would seem to be required, right? And so nevertheless,
we can still say that there's something different has occurred here, though, just to push back on
that. This is not quite the distinction between perception and knowledge of the type held by,
say, Plato or the Christians, in which true knowledge of the world sort of reveals forces
and principles which transcend the material world. Democritus still holds some methodological
materialism, as we've called it. It's merely, you know, the difference between perception and the
true world, quote unquote, in the case of Democritus, would be the equivalent in modern times to,
like, the difference between what one sees with their eyes, with the naked eye, versus what one
sees through an electron microscope, right? Unless we're going to say that what we see through
the microscope constitutes a metaphysical world, which I don't think most people would,
then we can excuse Democritus on this. And it's worth noting that later scientific discovery
backs up what he said. We do see smaller and smaller building blocks. And so, Democritus has
been vindicated. Although I should say the term used for Adam in the modern day doesn't really
correspond to Adam's, as Democritus described them, since the Adam is by definition the smallest
possible unit of matter. So once you start talking about subatomic particles, you're using the word
in a different way than Democritus would have understood it, right? Just by definition there.
So furthermore, also, Democritus is not perfect in every sense as a materialist.
For example, he permits that between atoms of matter exist atoms of soul, and soul is conceived
as a kind of invigorating force, which Whitlock asserts might serve the function of being a
prefiguration of the will to power, a prefiguration in the mind of Nietzsche. The atoms of soul are
almost more like a field than what we would consider to be solid matter. But remember,
materialism doesn't mean that things like energy don't exist. Perhaps we could see the Democritian
view as sort of like a low resolution understanding that there has to be some sort of energy in the
system. So it's still a material explanation. And the other component in how Nietzsche thinks about
will to power scientifically might have been influenced by precursors to field theory, right?
And so he's maybe able to interpret Democritus in that way. In any case,
Democritus does have to account for mind and for consciousness and movement. And what all this
ends up being is yet another form of material of matter. And that's very different from how
Heraclitus or Anaxagoras or Empedocles might see something like mind or spirit. And so in a passage
from Longa, he expresses this aspect of Democritus as one of the triumphs of his natural philosophy.
Longa writes, quote, Democritus regarded mind not as the world building force,
but only as one form of matter amongst others. And this is just Democritus's superiority for
every philosophy which seriously attempts to understand the phenomenal world must come back
to this point. The special case of those processes we call intellectual must be explained from the
universal laws of motion, or we have no explanation at all. But he who devises some bungling explanation
of nature, including the rational actions of mankind, starting from mere conjectural a priori
notions, which is it is impossible for the mind to picture intelligibly to itself destroys the
whole basis of science, no matter whether he be called Aristotle or Hegel. Good old Kant would
hear undoubtedly in principle declare himself on the side of Democritus and against Aristotle
and Zeller, end quote. So maybe that passage started out rather clear, but then he starts
talking about all these other figures. So let's clarify this passage a little bit.
Well, the first thing we might bring up in clarifying the passage further, there's one
of Nietzsche's unpublished notes that Whitlock references. But Whitlock references this note
without a citation, only to call it overlooked and cryptic, which is funny because he himself
overlooked the citation. So I don't know where to find this in Nietzsche's work, but according to
Whitlock, Nietzsche wrote that his intellectual heritage is derived from anti-teleological
spinosists on the one hand and mechanists on the other. And I think that's justifiably a rather
cryptic remark because Nietzsche says he may be understood properly only in this context.
And that's a very, you know, on the face of it, that's a strange origin story for Nietzsche's
intellectual tradition for he himself to give. I mean, it would probably sound strange to pretty
much anyone who hasn't looked into this angle of Nietzsche's thought, his philosophy of science,
right? But so when he invokes spinosists, obviously that refers to Spinoza, Baruch Spinoza was a
philosopher from the 17th century. He was from Amsterdam or he lived in Amsterdam, but he was
of a Sephardic Jewish origin. And he's one of the leading figures among the rationalists. And he
crafted a worldview in which mankind and the world as we know it, and even God are viewed from a
sort of naturalistic lens. And Nietzsche had great respect for Spinoza. He called him a precursor
to his own ideas. And one similarity we'll immediately see when we compare Nietzsche and
Spinoza, for example, is that both reject the existence of free will, at least in the way free
will is normally presented. Spinoza's rejection of Descartes' mind-body dualism also aligns Spinoza
with Nietzsche's outlook, right? But Spinoza had caused something, he had caused a mighty
controversy called either the Spinoza's controversy or the Pantheism controversy.
This emerges in the German philosophical circles and the academic and philosophical circles.
This is because Spinoza had been a pantheist and he had thus seen God as the effective force in
all things. His picture of the world was therefore naturalistic, but not really materialist. I mean,
it's dependent on the power of an ever-present divine force. It's less personal in Spinoza's view
than the traditional Christian view, something more akin to a force or a field, right? But it's
nevertheless associated with God, and as an imminent, all-encompassing divinity. So what came
with the popularity of Spinozistic metaphysics in the German intellectual circles was a tendency
towards teleologist positions on science. What does that mean? It means even though there's a
genuine attempt to understand the world via natural law, this is still done within a framework in which
the world exists for some purpose. And that's what a telos means as a purpose. So it's still done
within a framework in which the world exists for the sake of some divine force, for the purpose
crafted by an absolute mind, or whatever the case might be. And this goes all the way back to
Aristotle, a teleology for the world in the Aristotelian sense. It implies that the reality we
live in and experience as a contingent reality, subject to some other dominant reality. If this
life exists for some purpose or ends, that means there's some other thing whose end it serves,
whether that's another world or this imminent divine intellect or whatever. And so that claim
of a teleological universe became very popular in Germany, and then there was a backlash to this.
There arose an anti-teleologist camp among German intellectuals, and this even included
many Spinozists. They took influence from Spinoza's ideas, but nevertheless came down
against teleology. And so these are the anti-teleological Spinozists that Nietzsche references.
In that quotation we just looked at from Lange, he sort of implies what this divide is. He shows
us the divide and who he's talking about, right, between the teleologists and the anti-teleologists.
So he brings up Aristotle, and he groups them together with Hegel. These are examples of thinkers
who had teleological explanations of nature. Aristotle's inclusion, rather obvious. Hegel's
included here. Also, rather obviously, Hegel sees life and history as a revelation of the absolute.
So for Hegel, life and history, therefore, have a telos, which is the revelation of the absolute
mind to itself or whoever. I'd love to have a Hegelian on. If anyone knows a good Hegelian,
maybe. I know of them, right? I know Gizek and things like that, but I don't know any
good Hegelian philosophers who are popular. So if you know one, let me know. But
anyway, that's just an aside. So Zeller, for his Hegelianism, he's included as another candidate
as an opposing figure to the worldview of Lange, who comes down on this anti-teleological side.
Right? So Zeller, as we mentioned, somewhat Hegelian. So he's included with Hegel and Aristotle.
Now, on the anti-teleologist side, Lange suggests Kant would stand over on his side of the question,
on his side of the aisle. And that would also be the side of Democritus. And we could recall the
passage we quoted from last week from Kant, where Kant sort of delights in the prospect that one
could give him matter and he could give you a world from it, right? That simply applying his
reason to understanding the laws and patterns governing matter and its interactions with the
world, you could start with the universe in a chaotic, unformed state of just one kind of,
you know, thing, one kind of matter, one form of fundamental form of matter,
and Kant could give you a world out of it, right? That's exactly what Democritus did.
So it makes Kant, Democritus, Lange, and yes, Nietzsche in the camp, which is anti-teleological.
So Nietzsche, accordingly, in his pre-plotonic lectures, draws the comparison between Democritus
and Kant. So, and since Lange drew that same comparison, we could conclude this is another
thing he possibly gets from Lange, that we might be seeing Lange's influence in that very passage.
And so when Nietzsche says in this cryptic note that anti-teleological spinosists are one
camp from which he descends intellectually, these would be figures like Lange and Ubreveg,
who were influenced by Spinoza, but rejected Spinoza's idea of a telos for the world,
and then the other people who would easily say are mechanists. And so we might just say people who
this would include anyone who has anti-teleological views or methodologically anti-teleological
views, especially those who existed even prior to Spinoza, and so figures like Bacon,
Kant, and of course, Democritus. And so another quote from Lange puts this even more directly.
Again, this is from history of materialism, quote, Aristotle complains repeatedly that
Democritus, leaving aside teleological causes, had explained everything by a necessity of nature.
This is exactly what Bacon praises most strongly in his book on the advancement of learning, end
quote. And so of course, Lange agrees with Bacon and not Aristotle. And it demonstrates in the way
how Bacon praises Democritus for the very same thing that Aristotle criticizes. It reveals that
dichotomy, anti-teleological thinking versus teleological. And so Lange suggests where Democritus
may have been lacking. And this, I think, provides an area in which Nietzsche sees a way that he can
innovate. And so Lange writes, quote, of all the great principles underlying materialism in our
time, one only is wanting a Democritus, and that is the abolition of all teleology by the principle
of the development of the purposeful from the unpurposeful. We find in him no trace of that
false teleology, which may be described as the hereditary foe of all science, but we discover
nowhere an attempt to explain the origin of these adaptations from the blind sway of natural
necessity, end quote. And so Lange argues the only true refutation of a teleology for the world
the refutation of the world having a purpose and intelligence or like some sort of world building
mind, it would be to show how purpose can arise from purposelessness. Because we as conscious
beings, we have minds, we have consciousness, we come up with concepts such as purpose, we create
things that do have a telos, and we give a telos to things which we did not even create. So you
craft something like a chair, which has a telos in its very creation, right? The chair is for
your sitting. But you could also use a tree stump to sit upon, right? And so it's the fact that we
have this mind which not only perceives things, but also imparts a purpose to things, according to
what we value, or need, or prefer. And so a materialist understanding is confronted.
I mean, in some sense, you could reduce it to what we today call the hard problem of consciousness,
where you have to account for a mind, which invents ideas like purpose, goal, and end,
which means your materialist theory ultimately has to take account of values, meaning, right? A
naturalistic theory, which doesn't reach outside the world of matter, that can provide a meaning
for mankind, or rather, more precisely, provides an explanation for how meaning arises,
where it comes from, why we have a notion of it. And that's, too long ago, would be the only
acceptable refutation of teleology, or the only effective thing, the only thing that will really
do the trick. And so that's an interesting clue, I think, if we take it seriously, as to what Nietzsche's
philosophical project becomes aimed at. It's another way of seeing how these questions are
opening up for Nietzsche, as we keep going here. But by refusing to engage in teleology, admirable,
as that is, without really giving that explanation that long assays as essential,
Democritus leaves his theories open to misinterpretation.
Democritus believes that nothing is up to random chance, but as Longan notes, his materialist
denial of final causes led some to misunderstand Democritus, as ultimately preaching just such
a belief in chance, right? And so, a distinction has to be made between chance and necessity,
which Nietzsche sees in Democritus's work, and on that basis,
sort of uses that to refute the people, refute the interpretation of Democritus as simply
believing in random chance by saying he doesn't believe in chance, he believes in necessity.
And we could say maybe there's a Nietzsche can see this in one of his other influences,
because Schopenhauer made this distinction between basing things on chance and basing things on the
principle of sufficient reason. And so, Nietzsche also makes this distinction between chance and
necessity here, or he's able to see it very clearly. And so, through the influence of Longan and
Nietzsche, we have a clear battle line, teleology as the opposing force of science, and Longan's main
critique of Democritus was that he rejected teleology, but he didn't adequately defeat it,
we might say, by accounting for telos naturalistically, or for teloi as we encounter them,
right? Or as our minds come up with them, the process of a teloi generation, we might say,
right? What is the production of telos? Where does that come from? And so,
Democritus sets the stage for future anti-teleologists, such as Nietzsche, to address this issue.
Whitlock writes, quote, Longan and Nietzsche nearly identified teleological reason
with religious anthropomorphism. Democritus' atomism rejecting teleology, if
incompletely, his intellectual discovery laid the groundwork for the mathematical Pythagoreans.
It's worth saying, Nietzsche would later grow out of this position.
Or out of pure mechanism, we'll say. And it's very subtle, the change in mindset for Nietzsche,
but it's difficult to place later Nietzsche within this, like, solidly and completely
mechanistic camp. And as his thought matured, he would later critique Longa and Ubreveg
as being part of the, quote, Church of Materialism, end quote.
And I think it's because Nietzsche eventually becomes skeptical and questions the whole belief
and cause and effect, which is, it's like almost a whole other can of worms, right? It's nevertheless,
still very instructive here, and we're thinking about what started Nietzsche down the road,
thinking about many of his later ideas, to consider how the foundation was mechanistic,
materialistic, anti-teleological. That's why I would say he starts from a truly atheistic position,
and I said he's the first truly atheistic philosopher, or I characterized him that way,
like way back in the first episode, as I recall correctly. So now, in discussing the often overlooked
significance of Democritus to Nietzsche's philosophy, we have seen how Nietzsche's thought is so
deferential to that, Friedrich Albert Longa, that in some sense we can't even really compare
the thoughts of the two, because the overlap is near total. But there was an aspect to Nietzsche's
thought that went beyond Longa, and that is insofar as he brought in a scientist who was regarded at
the time as an obscure, or even a fringe sort of figure, and that's the Croatian physicist,
mathematician, and philosopher of science, Roger Joseph Boskovich. I believe his name and his
native tongue would be like Rogiero, but I'm not exactly sure how to pronounce Croatian.
He lived and wrote in the 18th century, and his most famous work is published in 1758,
Theory of Natural Philosophy, derived from a single law of forces which exist in nature,
which contains Boskovich's atomic theory and his theory of forces. Boskovich was
attractive to Nietzsche for a reason that would be very obvious in light of our analysis of how
Nietzsche has been thinking about the project of science, because Boskovich provided a single equation,
a single force, for describing how every different manifestation of force
expresses itself in the physical world. And so, Boskovich's ideas, they actually did not find a
wide purchase at the time when he was writing, but his place in science has been somewhat rejuvenated
in recent years. There are some such as Dragoslav Stojlikovic, not exactly sure how to pronounce
his name, but he's called Boskovich the father of modern science and a sort of forerunner to the
quantum theory or quantum physics and all sorts of things. So, in bringing Boskovich into his
thinking, Nietzsche parts ways with many of these figures that we've talked about as being his
influences. Boskovich is the final element in Nietzsche's scientific thinking that we haven't
yet covered, and with Boskovich's help Nietzsche goes beyond all his precursors, and Whitlock
describes this, and I'm going to quote from his commentary on the lecture series once more
in an abridged form, quote,
Kant himself recognized the continual problem presented by motion within Newtonian physics,
that is, within his own account of the phenomenal world.
Kant's transcendental deduction of time and space as forms of intuition
does not imply any solution to Newton's great theoretical enigma of motion,
even though motion is not included in the three antinomies of reason.
As long as Newtonian physics provides the only reasonable account of the phenomenal world,
the problem of motion remains. This is crucial to note,
Newton introduced the existence of God to explain the enigma of motion.
For this reason, among others, Schopenhauer remarked that science solves enigmas only by
introducing occult terms. This agrees with Kant's deduction of the a priori judgment God exists.
Nietzsche knew well that motion is a physical enigma with profound metaphysical implications.
One of Newton's contemporaries, Roger Boskovich, attempted to solve the enigma of motion outside
the framework of Newtonian explanation via the principle of action at a distance.
Schopenhauer decried this highly controversial principle as another occult force, whereas Kant
saw it as a threat to both God and Newton, and so constructed the architectronic of his system
in part as a bulwark against Boskovichian physics. This controversy around Boskovich
was itself a dynamic and the larger cultural debate about spinosism and encroaching materialistic
atheism. Boskovich, although a devout Catholic, did not require God to explain motion in his system,
as did Newton. For a quite similar reason, Leibnizian monodology was seen as a non-Newtonian
alternative to Kantianism that avoided the Boskovichian point-particle system.
Uberweg and Lange, following Hemholz, rejected Boskovich. In this way, they decisively parted
company with Nietzsche. And so he brings up Leibniz at the end there. We don't need to get into
the specifics of that, just to understand he's sort of saying that Boskovichian physics was so
controversial, so scary to people, because it could explain motion without appeal to God.
He alleges basically Kant sees it therefore as a threat to God, into the Newtonian system which
appeals to God. And even if you must step outside of Newtonianism, well, here we've got Leibniz over
here who don't go to Boskovich, right? There's an alternative to that. And everyone had sort of
avoided Boskovich because of this, and Whitlock seems to think that it's because there's this sort
of undertone that with Boskovich, even though he's a Catholic, this encroaching materialistic
atheism comes with his physics because of what it has the power to do. And so Nietzsche became
very excited by Boskovichian point-particle theory. Boskovich's point particles are not
corpuscular atoms, or sorry corpuscular atoms, as in the Newtonian system,
which form the basis of Kant's understanding as well. So Kant's matter is Newtonian matter, right?
And it's made of these corpuscular atoms, and corpuscular atoms are extended their bodies,
we might say. And so force points, on the other hand, are non-extended, non-corpuscular, unlike the
Democratian atoms or Newtonian atoms. Boskovichian force points do engage in action at a distance.
They don't interpenetrate, and in fact, Boskovich mathematically demonstrated how they could both
attract and repulse one another in accord with the same underlying mathematical principle. It's
very fascinating, even though the math is very much beyond me. In Nietzsche's interpretation of
Boskovich, the units that comprise what matter is are less like solid atoms, individual bodies,
but more like a field. And these fields are sort of made up of the interaction of force points,
each could be called a quanta of power, or to speak the language of Nietzsche's later philosophy,
a quanta of will to power. And so will to power will become in Nietzsche's philosophical retelling
of Boskovichian physics, this qualitative description of what Boskovich's math showed,
that the world is endless points of force, all acting and exerting against one another,
and manifesting the way that they push against the other forces according to the distance that
they act. We might say the scale at which the force manifests. And so Whitlock writes that in this way,
Nietzsche went beyond Spinoza, Kant, Lange, Uberweg, Helmholtz, and all the Newtonian
mechanists. Whitlock writes, quote, Nietzsche sought to take the tradition another step further
into point particle theory, and to what he would soon call his, quote, force point world, end quote.
So by doing this, Nietzsche is trying to get over what you might call sort of like the epistemological
baggage he's picked up from his biggest influence. It's the transcendental idealism of Schopenhauer.
And that sort of, we might say is inherited from the teleology of Spinoza. Nietzsche is trying to
complete this vision of a strictly material world, which was first adumbrated by
Democritus. You know, he gave us the rough outline. But Nietzsche knows that his biggest influence
philosophically, Schopenhauer, can't help him here because Schopenhauer is not a materialist.
And so Nietzsche has to therefore avoid the objections to materialism that figures such
as Schopenhauer had raised. Schopenhauer used an argument that is very logical if one operates
from the first principle set by Kant, which Schopenhauer accepts. The starting premise of
this argument is that we never directly experience a mind independent reality and that everything we
experience is just a representation. Schopenhauer's argument is that then that means the atoms themselves
are only a representation. It's something I sort of referenced last week when we were talking.
I referenced Donald Hoffman last week. I think I called him David Hoffman, which was just a
genuine mistake, but I looked it up and his name is actually Donald David Hoffman. So congrats to me,
because I technically didn't misname him. But, you know, Hoffman remarks upon his realization
as a neurologist that looking at a neuron is sort of like looking at a pixel. It's the mind's
representation. It's a placeholder for something out there in reality. It's not the reality itself.
And so Schopenhauer essentially makes the same argument about the atom. And even if you find the
bedrock unit of matter from which you hope to explain all material things, all material processes,
you're still just explaining it by way of representation and that the representation
is something indirectly given as Schopenhauer puts it, right? It's not the fundamental reality,
it's just a symbol of it. And so attempting to explain reality by way of representation is compared
to Munchausen pulling himself up out of the marsh by pulling out on his own suspenders, right? Or in
some versions of the myth it's by his hair. It's, you know, where we get the phrase pulling yourself
up by your bootstraps, right? It's something that can't be done. Longa carried on this idea of
representation from Kant just as Schopenhauer had done. But he became open to Schopenhauer's
arguments against materialism because Longa wished to account for representation through the
physiology. He's giving a physiological and thus a materialistic accounting of what representation
is, right? Because obviously if the physiology produces representations and the physiology
is itself known to us through representations we have of it, aren't we assuming what we're trying
to prove by appealing to physiology as the explanation, right, for representation? And so
your mind can kind of get tied to knots if you think about this too much. Longa devotes a great
deal of his history of materialism to reconcile these contradictions and defend materialism as a
solid grounding for science. He took the time to really take Schopenhauer's philosophical
arguments seriously and try and rebut them. And so Nietzsche was content to let Longa's
arguments on that front do his work for him. And maybe the simplest way to say this without
getting too bogged down on this issue is that I sort of paraphrase the argument from Nietzsche
himself last week, we can't take the representation as the most fundamental thing because it would
mean that our sense organs are themselves the representations of our organs. And so it doesn't
seem that we actually gain anything by appealing to the framework of representation in order to
object to materialism, right? At best that would just be an argument that we can't make statements
about the basis of reality as it transcends the mind. But supposing we take it as a given that
that's not what science is doing, that we're making statements about the phenomenal world
as we experience it, then there's really no problem. And that's what science is doing. So
materialism I think Longa is correct, can serve as a basis for science. And Schopenhauer's
metaphysical objections to that are a bit sort of, I don't know, they're a bit old and contrived.
And Nietzsche feels he can get over Schopenhauer's metaphysical objections. And therefore,
fully go all in on the materialist project and use Boskovich to complete it. And Whitlock
summarizes, quote, Nietzsche could rest assured that Schopenhauer's old metaphysical arguments alone
would not refute materialism. Whereas Friedrich Albert Longa stood between Kant and materialism,
however Nietzsche went beyond both by rejecting their shared presuppositions of extended Newtonian
matter of the corpuscular atom. To do so, he embraced the iconoclastic thought of someone
rejected by both Kant and Longa, namely Boskovich. And thus, at the end of his lecture on Democritus,
Nietzsche soundly dismisses Schopenhauer's argument, and accepts Longa's materialism as
a provisional hypothesis, until theoretical amendations can be made, end quote.
And so the way in which Nietzsche is influenced is interesting, but it's all just as much so the
way Nietzsche goes against prior figures in the history of science is at least as informative for
our purposes. Nietzsche believes that in Boskovich, therefore, he's overcome the problem of motion,
which obtained in the Newtonian and Kantian model, and had prompted Schopenhauer to say that
scientific explanations always reach for occult forces, explanations which are not themselves
explicable. And this problem dates back to Spinoza's own deus ex machina of using God to shore up the
hypothesis. Spinoza, the language he uses, he drew upon the concept which originates in classical
antiquity, and had been used by Descartes as well of Canatus. Canatus is defined as a tendency within
bodies for movement. Obviously, we can't stop there with our definition, because that would be a
just so argument, right? It's an argument by definition, like the very things Schopenhauer's
criticizing as just being an occult force, or the way Nietzsche criticizes Kant for saying that we
can have synthetic a priori knowledge by virtue of a faculty, right? You're just sort of defining it
into existence. So what is the explanation for Canatus? What is it on a fundamental level?
And when we get right down to it, it's an expression of the power of God,
is how Spinoza can explain it. His conception of Canatus sees it as an inherent aspect within
physical bodies, driving them towards movement, and that it expresses the power of God. And further
more, he specifies that it constitutes a striving, particularly a striving to exist, and that the
striving constituted the actual essence of individual phenomena. And so if this sounds like
Schopenhauer's philosophy, we can see the definite parallels and Schopenhauer's conception of the
will to live. Will in Schopenhauer's philosophy is, if not teleological, a sort of metaphysical
explanation for reality, which appeals to something not given by empirical experiment.
Schopenhauer, if not a teleologist, you know, he's a transcendental idealist, and he's thus
opposed to the project of materialism, as we've said. And so the atheistic Schopenhauer is still
perfectly willing to say that all things have an essence, an inner character, which is universal,
and merely expresses itself in different manifestations, which is defined by Schopenhauer's
will. Cognatus is a clear influence on the idea of will. It's also an inner essence. It's a striving
to exist. And so Schopenhauer, just as Spinoza, is defiant towards any attempt to reduce his
conception to purely material explanations. Nietzsche's leap from Democritus to Boskovich is
the way Nietzsche sees it. It's a resolution to the problem. Emotions always been that gap into
which God flows. God flows into science, right? And so while Nietzsche, maybe something instructive
here is that Nietzsche considered the eliatics, like Parmenides and Zeno, to be a dead end in
the development of Greek scientific thought. But they are instructive to us in that way.
Insofar as they deal with the problem of motion by denying it altogether, right?
Parmenides says that motion is an illusion. Zeno, in his famous paradox, shows how motion,
when rendered into quantity, becomes absurd. Like, its infinite divisibility makes
nonsense of our own conception of movement in the passage of time. So motion is so problematic
that some philosophers just denied that it's real, since it was unreasonable for it to exist.
And so this is, you know, to Nietzsche it's a dead end, because it doesn't really get us
any closer to, like, reckoning with the reality of the phenomenal world as we experience it.
And so, you know, in the history of science and the history of philosophy,
we've marched on in spite of the absurdity of motion, always, you know, even if we have to
account for it by making reference to God. You know, something not dissimilar to Parmenides is a
conception of true being. We have to make reference to this static, eternal, unchanging reality,
God in the machine, making the machine function, either as a first cause or as pantheism or whatever.
And so what's happened here is that our final explanations are not rational.
Our accounting of the physical world doesn't rise to the standards of what's permissible
as a rational explanation. And so Whitlock writes that Nietzsche, quote,
acquired what we might call his second order theory of truth. This second order principle
requires that all first order theories be only representations within a deeper underlying will,
so that an adequate theory of matter must understand matter as a representation of will
and not as a thing in itself. Note that this still allows work on a first order theory of nature,
but only within the confines of the second order theory of theories.
Nietzsche believed that a great leap, even a revolution as grand as that of Copernicus,
would be affected if a first order theory were to abandon Newtonian corpuscular atomism
and shift paradigms to a force point conception of the world.
Boskovichian point particle theory overturned the Newtonian spinosist paradigm of extended
matter, bringing first order theory of nature into line with second order principles.
By reinterpreting Schopenhauer's notion of will, originally derived from Spinoza's idea of
Cognitus, in terms of an extended force point, all spinosistic metaphysics,
even substance, would be rendered useless. Like Kant, Nietzsche would then be in a position
to create the world from an unordered chaos, a world as will to power, end quote.
So here we have it. Nietzsche's will to power is, in one sense, a response to centuries of debates
in the philosophy of science, an attempt to philosophize about the world in such a way
that is adequately reflective of the force point world of Boskovich, which to Nietzsche is the
only way to understand the world materialistically in a consistent manner, in which our theories and
principles completely align, and shift things away from the stubborn teleology of Spinoza,
the deus ex machina of Kant and Newton, into a pure materialism, described by a single force
that merely manifests itself in various phenomenal forms. In other words,
Nietzsche is talking about a fundamental will, and this is what Boskovich's single
mathematical principle represents to Nietzsche, that fundamental will in a quantitative form.
Here's another quotation from Whitlock, quote,
The antithelialogical motives on Nietzsche's part suggest not that he was a nihilist seeking to
enlist science in his campaign against religion, but rather that he was already searching for his
own scientific hypothesis, one that would prove anathema to the real nihilists, those Europeans
who all still clung to a belief in God. He found the scientific vision to be exhilarating and
associated it with the tragic Heraklitean-Danissian perspective he had discovered philologically.
It proved to him a source of pessimism out of strength, not nihilism, end quote.
So as we talked about last time, these lecture notes on the pre-plotonics speak to a deep
scientific interest, and throughout the pre-plotonic lectures, we have Nietzsche's various references
to the Kant-Laplace hypothesis. You know, that's the hypothesis. The universe came from a disordered
gaseous state and was formed by physical laws into the various forms that exist today. We have
references to von Beyer's pulse rate experiments, or thought experiment, however you want to see it,
his discussion of Paracelsus and Lavassier. These digressions in the lectures are numbered at seven
and named by Ani Anders and Carl Schlechter as quote, seven excursions into the natural sciences,
end quote. Ani Anders then wrote the following synopsis of the implications of Nietzsche's interest
in the natural sciences and the references that Nietzsche brings up and how he uses them.
She writes quote, if we now summarize from the seven excursions what characterizes the
natural sciences for Nietzsche, it would be the following three fundamental matters of concern.
One, to comprehend nature as one continuous becoming. Two, to explain order in it, nature,
by means of purposeless simple forces. And three, to conceive qualities as quantities.
In contrast, the question of the essence of matter, as it might be posed, for example,
in relation to Democritus's theory, plays no role for Nietzsche. He finds himself in complete
agreement with natural science. It too brackets the question of the essence of matter. Nietzsche
will later demonstrate this impressively with regard to the Boskovichian system, end quote.
So, in the pre-plutonic figures, Nietzsche discovers for himself clarity about the activity
of the sciences. Thales, Anaximander, and so on, contemplated nature as one continuous becoming,
insofar as they attempted to find the fundamental nature of matter from which all other forms
can be derived. The attempts to explain nature by means of purposeless and simple forces occur
throughout the work of Anaxagoras or Democritus. And the last trait, you know, of conceiving qualities
as quantities. We see that in full force in the later Pythagoreans. They are distinguished by
Nietzsche from Pythagoras himself. Pythagoras himself is supposed to be more of a mythical
cult-like figure. The Pythagoreans, on the other hand, gave mathematical explanations of everything,
of music, of space, of all sorts of qualities and relationships. And this is sort of what it
means to translate qualities into quantities. And so it's like, if Democritus is atomism,
Democritus plus the later Pythagoreans sort of together birth this mathematical atomism, which is
it's the way we think about science today, yet again, right? And so the ultimate scientific
achievement in Nietzsche's eyes is the creation of a single law to describe all patterns and
relationships, makes nature into one single continuous becoming. And then what is the third
thing Annie Ender says translates this into mathematical form. Newton believed that the
laws governing physical bodies could not be reduced to less than three laws. Boskovich,
meanwhile, has a single law, right? And so, and with this one mathematical statement,
Boskovich connects gravity, chemistry, electricity, cohesion, attraction, and repulsion.
And so with the Boskovichian system, Nietzsche can rebuild the world from the ground up with
will to power as the basis. It's because of this sort of the
mathematicizing of the world of the later Pythagoreans.
Boskovich is called the modern Pythagoras. This is in the words of Boskovich's biographer Lancelot
White. He says that Boskovich is quote Pythagoras extended to cover process and quote.
And so, you know, White's assessment of Pythagoras is sort of at variance with what Nietzsche had to
say about Pythagoras. So we can just take it that by calling Boskovich a Pythagoras extended to
cover process. He's referring more to Pythagorean philosophy as expressed by the later Pythagoreans.
Boskovich can be associated with the later Pythagoreans because, you know,
these figures come after a Democritus. And similarly, you know, for Nietzsche's purposes,
he's charting a course of how materialism develops emerging in post-Enlightenment Europe,
just as it did in ancient Greece. And so Boskovich is the figure to stand sort of in correspondence
to the later Pythagoreans and thus completing the materialism that we see in the Greek arena
emerging with Democritus. And with Boskovich, we can finally give the material explanation for
things like consciousness, mind, values, and so on. Or if not Boskovich himself, Nietzsche can take
the Boskovichian basis and weave that into his philosophy. You know, look at one final quote
from Whitlock's commentary here, because I mean, he does such a good job throughout this, but here
he describes the similarity between the ancient Pythagorean worldview and Boskovich. And he gives
us an overall picture of how Boskovichian point particle theory sits in relation to Newton and
Leibniz. Quote, chemistry, atomism, Pythagoreanism, overlapped with Nietzsche's intensive and
extensive interest in Boskovich. A far greater importance, however, is the Pythagorean construction
of the world from points. Points in motion constitute lines, intersecting lines create
surfaces, surfaces connect to make the Pythagorean five regular solids. It is precisely in this
regard that Boskovich is known as Pythagoras extended to cover process. For such solids made of
points, though not of five types, in physical processes are what Boskovich's theory attempted
to describe. Boskovich also began with an image of the world as a vast mass of points in motion,
interacting dynamically and kinematically in pairs. He constructed solid objects from these
points and even described physical processes by reference to a point particle world.
Unlike the Pythagoreans, Boskovich saw his points as subject to inertia, retraction,
sorry, attraction, and repulsion as a function of their distance from each other rather than of
sheer number. Boskovich was eclipsed as the greatest European mind of his time only by two
contemporaries, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Philhelm Leibniz. The inventors of calculus,
Newton and Leibniz embraced corpuscular atomism and monodology respectively.
Boskovich purposely devised a point particle theory between Newton and Leibniz, but his system
would suffer highs and lows of respectability, until the advent of Michael Faraday, James
Clark Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and other late 19th century scientists who acknowledged his genius.
Leibniz's monodology was closely related to Nietzsche's own experimental time atomism,
but Nietzsche rejected Leibniz's windowless monads for the Boskovichian principle of action at a
distance. Boskovich's centers of force were to have inertia and forces dependent on the distance
between two points. Nevertheless, even Boskovich's dynamic properties and non corpuscular atomism,
his action at a distance and field theory, did not posit an inner driving force.
Boskovichian forces external. By conceiving of the will to power as the inner dynamic,
Nietzsche would go beyond Boskovich and Leibniz, though he would only rarely refer to Boskovich
by name in his major published works. And so, after his study of the pre-plotonics
interpreted through the light of the modern philosophers of science, in which Nietzsche
sort of finds the culmination of this project in Democritus and the later Pythagoreans,
and then in his own day in Boskovich, the only remaining element Nietzsche needs is the will
to power in order to provide qualitative expression of the world. And of course,
this expression includes the mind itself, Nietzsche and the subject, the willing subject,
the conscious subject. All of us are the will to power expressing itself.
Nietzsche can explain philosophy through his new theory because he, like all philosophers,
is an avatar of the faculty of reason attempting to bound the world, which is yet another form
of these quantas of power attempting to push against and overcome other things,
overcome resistance and challenges. Nietzsche thus encounters kindred spirits in his study,
which is another thing he gains from this. It's not just his philosophy of science. So for example,
his favorite is of course Heraclitus, but this should not overshadow the other admirable forerunners
of Nietzsche's task in philosophy, especially figures like Democritus. But Nietzsche goes
beyond all his influences. He goes beyond Longa by involving Boskovich in his system at all,
and he even goes beyond Boskovich by sort of drawing on the Schopenhauerian idea of an inner
content or essence. Nietzsche finishes his lecture on the later Pythagoreans with another cryptic
remark that, quote, if only the Pythagoreans really knew what calculates the world, end quote.
The implication is perhaps the will to power, but Nietzsche didn't really have that exact
formulation at this point in his thought. Maybe he had the notion of it, but not the words,
so we don't really know. Maybe we'll simply be left to wonder about that.
Now, okay, let's take a look at some of the more extreme and therefore more interesting statements
that Nietzsche makes about will to power, where he seems to speak of it not merely as a psychological
explanation, but as the single force that explains the world. We can even see this kind of talk about
will to power in at least one place in Nietzsche's published work. It's a passage that's particularly
instructive because even though Nietzsche puts material in quotation marks in this passage and
seems to raise questions about some of the things he might have well taken for granted during his
philological period, his pre-philosophical period, this passage makes a lot more sense in light of
this physical aspect of the will to power, and it makes a lot less sense if you're thinking of will
to power in a purely psychological sense. And so we're going to look at Beyond Good and Evil,
aphorism 36, which I've slightly abridged. Quote,
Suppose nothing else were given as real, except our world of desires and passions,
and that we could not get up or down or to any other reality besides the reality of our drives.
For thinking is merely a relation of these drives to each other.
Is it not permitted to make the experiment and to ask the question whether this given
would not be sufficient for also understanding on the basis of this kind of thing, the so-called
mechanistic or material world? In the end, not only is it permitted to make this experiment,
the conscience of method demands it. Not to assume several kinds of causality until the
experiment of making do with a single one has been pushed to its utmost limit, to the point of
nonsense if I may say so. That is a moral of method which one may not shirk today. It follows
from its definition as a mathematician would say, the question is, in the end, whether we really
recognize the will as efficient, whether we believe in the causality of the will.
If we do, and at bottom, our faith in this is nothing less than our faith in causality itself,
then we have to make the experiment of positing the causality of the will hypothetically as the only
one. Will, of course, can only affect will and not matter.
