Okay, we are on the stage officially listening.
That's right. Yes.
All right. Good to see you. Can you hear me okay?
Yep. There was a little bit of interference there, but right now it's good. So it's good to see you guy.
It's been too long to connect and I want to officially congratulate you on your new edition.
Thank you. That's got to be a pretty exciting thing to bring, bring another life into the world.
I know.
Three times. Yeah, beautiful. Beautiful.
Right.
Yeah, three times totally.
Yeah. In fact, in fact, I, I'm not, I'm not in the place I'm normally at because my mother came to visit for the first time.
So she's meeting Teague and it's so, so, so guy, guy got kicked out.
He's, he's at the park.
Well, that's what happens when new ones come along, you know, the old ones get shuffled out.
Absolutely. Right. We see the priority here.
Amen.
Yeah.
So one of the things I wanted to talk with you about, right, and I think a lot of this has to do with,
with the way that I see you really linking a lot of things together, right.
And I want to, I want to set some, set some frames up here and then we can just see, see how it leads all together.
But, you know, it's precisely, precisely your work and the way you situate that sense of the primate, right.
Mm hmm.
That goes then into justification, right. And that this, my understanding is this primate level is the level of like attachment, right.
Yup.
Of attunement, attachment, all, and there's, of course, stuff with bulby and couples therapy. I mean, there's the evidence for that is just astromont, you know, it's so predictive how that goes.
Right.
It's very powerful force.
It's surprising anyone ever missed that.
We somehow missed that.
Right. I'm glad we'll be picking up and others. Yeah.
Mm hmm.
Yeah. Absolutely.
And how that goes into justification, right. And in the social arena where you become in your, in the way you're talking about, become a person, you know, some sense become initiated in a, as a person in terms of socially justifying your own existence in front of others.
Yup.
Right.
Exactly.
And also the way there's another way that you talk about it, just to set this frame too, which I really, I appreciate is that, of course, it's in the
justification where things get really fucked up.
Right.
And we end up totally split. So in order to justify my existence, I can't talk about this part of my existence and then I feel guilty. Then we have the splits.
Then we see the psychologist and the psychologist is all about helping unite these lower systems and these orders and sharing the story.
Right.
And I think that's one of the things that you can open around these, these defensiveness, this defensiveness and adaptations, right.
Absolutely.
Yeah. And all of that coming together and how and in what way that in some sense is is connected ontologically to things, right.
Right. Absolutely.
And, and so as we were talking about, I'm just going to summarize what we talked about before we hit record, right, which, which, you know, one of my,
one of the things for a while that I've been really thinking a lot about is this notion of school lay, the Greek sense of school lay, which, which usually translates into English is leisure.
And of course, leisure and idleness, leisure is, is, is the core. It's kind of, it's, it's so core to economics, right. And metaphorically to everything that that if everything going well, people work and then they have leisure, right.
Right. They work too much.
They don't have leisure that bad, right.
Yep.
And, however, it's very different. That sense of leisure is not doesn't get at the deeper sense of the way that they talked about school a philosophically and religiously.
Right.
Yeah.
The Greeks.
The Greeks saw school lay.
I mean, use this example.
For example, Aristotle said that all fear, fear aria in geometry happens in school lay.
And then in, in the apology, I think it was Socrates said that I actually think you guys shouldn't kill me. I think, I think, I think Athens should pay me to be in school lay and
speak philosophy talking about those conversations, right.
Right. Right.
And so you get this sense with school lay that like for the Greeks, whereas in leisure, there's a sense in which there's time.
And then you fill time.
And then if, if you work, if you work hard enough and right enough and the economy works well, then you can work for a certain amount of time. And then at the end you have free time or leisure.
And you notice that conception of time is the same throughout. It's just a matter of if it's filled with stuff or not filled with stuff. Yes.
But with something like, with something like the aria or philosophy or geometry, right, these higher levels of essentially contemplating being is a very, very different sense of time.
Right. It's really precisely the pinnacle where, where, where means and ends come together as one thing.
Love it. Right. And so bringing this back into me having a kid, right.
And, and everything that we're talking about was attachment, right. Right.
Is for the Greeks.
The root of school lay means holding to hold. Right.
And in that really only makes sense in relationship to time.
So, so school lay in the Greek sense was that time was something for which was of our concern. It was an essential concern in the sense that there was a way that if there's a way to hold time.
Such the time in turn turns back and holds us. Love that.
Right. The school lay was a way of being in time and holding time, but then of revealing time. Right. In a way that they're mutually disclosant. Right.
And so that was the essence of time itself. So there's this really sense we're meaning in time, right. Being in time would would receive their pinnacle.
It's not like you're in school lay and then not in school lay. No, it was more, it was more this was connected with the revelation of what time was, right.
Which was the direct concern for us.
And so, if you look at it now though, without that sense of time, we're time now is more this kind of anatomical force in which it, of course, we're subject to it and it concerns us but there's no sense in which time.
It all responds to us. Right. It's like we're subject to it.
And therefore, I think what, what that's done on some level is we no longer see meaning and time as unified.
Right. Or as a couple.
So therefore, time is just this force, right, that can't really hold meaning. It can just give lawful, you can get lawful, like sustaining an entropy to circumstance.
So therefore, we need to find meaning in the, the sensations of our circumstances that you will write us the drama, but there's nothing about time that it all responds to us, right, and that sense that the Greeks had about it.
And that, and just this idea that in Schole, that it's, it's this relationship to the ontology of time that, that, that, that, that the way I am comport is already a comporting or a holding of time, and that time is that which is holding me.
Right.
And now I think about that now I have a baby. Right. No, I'm thinking about all this and now I have a baby. Right.
And, yeah.
And somebody asked me how T was, and before I responded I noticed that I had this picture of T, right.
And that, that I hadn't noticed that there is no T to simply T being held, right.
At every picture, like either literally by our hands or by held by our attention or being held by the thing we set up for the crib. In fact, if there's like a second where we don't have our eye on him, it's like a big deal.
Right. And so, right.
And so there's no such thing as T. There's T continuous with being held.
Right. And then if we think about that, right, so there's something real and like, okay, what is this, this connection between time, meaning ontology, our vulnerability as human beings the fact that we primordial
like this, like a deep vulnerability and an openness to the very holding.
Right. Which then that holding in turn, hopefully they internalize and as they internalize it as he grows up we will then let go and he will take on the whole holding.
And so in some sense I'm wondering about this idea of holding. What does that reveal about the ontologically the case with us and human beings right.
Totally. All right. So those are all the thought islands.
Let's see if we can see if we can peer underneath the surface. Yeah, some sort of synergy out of that. Yeah.
That's a beautiful set of observations. Let me just say that. Okay. I love I didn't know about the Greek word school a can you say yeah. Okay.
I didn't know about that word. So let me give you just some thoughts to start to ground us in relation to the holding environment that we can then cultivate. Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
So the first thing couple things that come to mind one is our vertical integration. Okay, vertical integration of us as organisms first.
Yeah, into animals, which then is the base of our feeling system, and we can feel that, you know, in our gut and our loins and in our gut. Okay. Yeah. And and that's the way the position of the body, and whether we got pain or emptiness in our stomach or
the corny and longs and the loins. It's an appetite of desires is very platonic play to version. And that's our animal in our organism into animal level from a to okay view so you're a biophysiological entity.
And then the first thing is hey you got to take care of survival shit. You know, right. Okay. Yeah. And then we're social primates. Okay.
And then we go into the what I metaphorically refer to the heart. Okay, and the hearts the relationship attachment system.
Okay. And there's nothing more central to an infant than this. I mean the whole because the entire safety food and relational matrix are all intimately intertwined in virtually every infant's experience.
Yeah, you see that in the holding that whether they're being prepared and connected. They're so dependent. And for the first six months they are completely dependent upon the environment in which they're held.
Yeah, right. Yeah, I know they're there. They're absorbing stuff they have enormous plasticity. They're upgrading the various models but they're just checking shit out basically. Yeah, they have a little bit of hand movement and a lot of put you in their mouth.
And they track everything really fast with the head. So it's a visual auditory learning system but the body is doing, you know, it's barely roll over.
Right. Right. Yes.
Right. So they're so the system then in what they're doing from it that we can we spoke about John Bulby. Okay, so what he noticed is we the early systems of psychiatry psychology.
And the key really is food. So you know we had orphanage we just fed them, as long as they stayed alive and the temperature was thing and they didn't have any threat and they were getting fed they should be alright, and then all of these kids and orphanages that weren't being were all broken in
some ways, you know, they were underdeveloped. They felt the whole socio emotional systems was out of touch they got these weird attachment structures that was a fundamental set of insecurity.
That the that the environment would drop out of them at a particular level. Yeah, they weren't known and valued and they wouldn't be protected.
Yeah.
And then they had to they were kids would respond in certain ways to either get very hyper dependent. Oh my God just try sending out alarms all the time hyper neurotic sending out alarms to be so that they try to get what little attention they could.
Or they would go avoid which is hyper independent they try to crush this need of the heart, and then be I don't need anybody I'll just try to suppress it, or they would get really especially if they were abused and they get really erratic and disorganized attachments.
Okay, yeah.
And this is what later attachments about the circle of security that you're actually wanting to see build which is a fundamental participatory dance between the caregiver and the infant, where you're tracking eye movements and building a shared attention intention
space. Yeah, you can then create the ground the socio emotional ground that you will be cared for. And if you have particular needs, you can signal them and I'll be able to empathize with you and I'll meet them.
Yeah, yeah, this creates the ground of the secure base from which the infant can go at six months into the next couple of years and start to move away from the base.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then return to the holding environment if it falls if the kid falls and you know scrapes his knee runs back to mom and dad and gets immediately returned to the holding environment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, because the entire primate animal organism system is like check Okay, am I held safe, or am I in the dark woods somewhere by myself the ultimate panic, right, which is a complete.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
So that's an unbelievable that darkness is unbelievably, you know concerning the poor panic abandonment and felt sense of worthlessness and this felt sense of insecurity.
You know, and are you and then you get poly vagal defensiveness throughout the system when you're getting this structure.
Yeah, so you're being you're either being held in the matrix of care or not. Yeah, and those are the two basic secure insecure and of course there's a lot in between basically that the matrix as they're actually these two equilibrium states at a
distribution of being held, and then you track the interpersonal world and indeed we know kids can be feel pretty safe with mom and not with dad or vice versa depending on the dance, the relation, it's called the circle of security, and the more advanced
simulations that then afford right when it's there, it's a particular holding environment so right when you have that you're going to create coherent integration in the environment into the body into the animal into the social primate.
Okay, and that's really the first couple of years is trying to create that fundamental secure base. So the system can then trust basic trust to use, you know, the world, and that you're going to get your needs met or basic mistrust this is the
Smithsonian formulation. Okay, a basic trust is mistrust. Hey, yes, my needs met because the environment will hold me in a particular way and the environment holds me because it sees me as valuable.
Yes, exactly that connection between value and holding right and what that means seems to be super deeply central. Yeah, and I make a very important point about my own development and this theoretical structure called the influence
matrix, which first emphasized it from an evolutionary instrumental way which is totally valid, but it's incomplete originally, and that is what I call that the social influence line.
Okay, and social and it was to bind in sort of instrumental terms to what extent, can you influence others in accordance with your interests. Okay, if I cry will you come help me, or will you ignore me so it's an instrumental framing, which at a pragmatic
level of survival is key. However, what I saw in the clinic room is that a lot of people could have influence but feel very empty inside. Okay, and why because they weren't really valued.
Okay, and they would go around and they wouldn't or they would feel that they were not valued. And I realized that actually the ultimate in sort of core, even from evolutionary perspective the core equilibrium safe space is to be
valued, not just to be able to manipulate others instrumentally, because if the contingency of manipulation disappears then the, then there's no intrinsic motive for mom and dad to love you, then they're out of it.
Okay, yeah, but if they're totally if their motivational system is attached to you by its own value instructor, then that at a particular level that's really key.
The other thing that's going to get back into why this is so important is because modern science basically thinks and economics thinks in terms of instrumental means and relationship and trying to maximize productive control.
Okay, they then in fact the entire social capital labor is basically influence and investment and return on investment and instrumentality, but modes of production and control.
Okay, yeah, the whole basically is like how do we efficiently maximize our influence and power over the things for the least amount of money in relationship to particular outcomes so now you create the doing instrumental mindset that then
fundamentally merges as the dominant mode, and this now brings in Eric from the dominant mode of doing that then becomes so salient for the way in which we all think that's a quantifiable and, and, you know, many
evolutionary sciences, oh, we're all just selfish anyway and this is what we really care about and blah, blah, blah.
Yeah, you know what you can do is you, you know, there is really any God there's no real purpose but you can at least get the most toys that you have and get as much accomplishment and then that's, that's the doing of what you know, you get rich,
you get status you get leisure time and that's what you're trying to get.
Yeah, you know, do do do.
Yes.
But at least we can hack it.
Yeah, at least we can hack it at least I can get the most toys, but like, at least I got a big fucking Vita that's going to substitute, you know, for true love, but at least I got a big fucking Vita or have a nice Lamborghini or
something or not and then you're on the low shit and you can't do and then you fail and all of that.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then it's like, well, okay, well, what am I doing here? Well, I'm just trying to, I'm trying to everything's a means to an end relation.
Money. I mean, to the extent that then money becomes then the symbol it's the ultimate instrumental symbol, yet for some people they get it so confused that it's like I want to make more money.
Yeah, you know, it's like as if that is some sort of quantifying in it's that's empty calories that they've had the course level.
Yeah, yeah.
And I think that we're, we have driven the doing mode to try to control energy and time in an instrumental kind of way to enormous excess.
Yeah.
And then that's not good calories for feeling spending time in an attached relational environment in nature, feeling the oneness of the self world modeling structure feeling held by the feeling fundamentally present and fulfilled in
relationship to feeling the integration between the body into the animal into the heart into the justification into the spirit mattering value purpose that's what I call vertical integration.
Yeah, you get vertical integration I would say then for me the labels wisdom energy and what you feel is just a massive presence, a fundamental fit between the self world environment and a massive presencing of that.
Yeah.
And then that is a you diamonic ultimate endpoint you are then in in sync incoherent integrative sync with the system.
And then finally to bring it back to kind of the leisure at least I feel like I got lucky with Socrates I'm a public intellectual get paid.
And I tell people at the level of leisure is like, people like well how often how much you work I was like well, I work either five or 75 hours a week.
Okay, yeah.
Because you know I have five hours of shit I need to do that is the kind of labor. And you know here's a paperwork thing sign this prep this is like, while I'm doing it the only thing I'm doing is for for instrumental purpose to get something done so I check the fucking
But I'm super lucky that I'm now at a place as full professor blah blah blah that's like a huge amount of like this is this work. You know, are we are am I I don't I love this I feel that enormously just present I feel connected to you.
I feel our souls connected in a particular way and then we engage in D a logos, and then that's a, then my experience of being in the world is just enriched by these things so yeah no it's like you know it's productive and in growth promoting, but it
doesn't feel like I've had to, I'm trying to control something to get to some place, I'm in the place of being itself.
Yeah. And that's, and there's somehow in some sense implicitly there and a couple of things that kind of link all of that together all the way down to that with the first six months, because the second six months, right, all the way is like mature professor, right.
One is it sounds like your relationship with time is very, very different. Right.
In some sense that there is a way that you relate to time that seems like these things these meetings or something like the pinnacle or express this fundamental relationship where you're not instrumental but there is a sense in which it holds you and inspires you there's
time disappears is there's the flow state D a logos, all of that. Totally. Now it's, it's interesting to that.
There is sense about when you talked about after the first six months and then they start the child starts to venture away from the whole thing and then they come back right such a cool, it's such a cool image of that because you can see that to because they do they venture out
they'll check back and then they go they're going to see what they're going to do right and then they'll check back really quick and he's still there right like
look back right they they they're test they intrinsically are testing something that's right and and God and there's so many different ways that could get fucked up right like because I was thinking about that when
if the what happens when the child comes back and then the mother's destroyed and angry because the child left her right like and then and so there's all kinds of ways that that dynamic relation can can get all whacked out right
and it addresses itself in all these you know and marriages and well we're right and then we tested all the time for good reason you're like hey I'm going to I'll drop up cry over here or I won't do other things and yeah
not with conscious justification but the design of the system is to know where it is so and we do this with our spouses you test them. Yeah, drop like very rarely I'm going to just my what some people that but you do it intuitively because you want to see where
your own attention is okay yeah I mean my kids I mean they've got five and three and you know you cut two piece of cake hey he's cakes bigger than mine you know it's like yeah and I was like okay yeah you know they're going to check that and they're going to be like hey you
you cut it in that reflects something in your heart doesn't it you love him more than you love me or you better right attention to that you know there's a little like you know that's a chronic state of is this environment really holding and then I'll test it and see what happens
totally like I
well the other thing about that that I didn't I think I saw as you're talking about this differently than I saw it before which is this back and forth right relation
that it's really it's it how dynamic it is it's like I know we talk about it in terms of like okay is that is is the child starts to objectify right will that object hold me right is that
but really when we look at it this that they're not actually checking to a thing but that the stability is precisely a way of a modal of relations happen right so it's not like there's something stable in a thing like way it's a dynamic and nexus of relations that are going on
totally in which they start to feel a certain kind of safety with and of course the world is a chaotic network of relations right that they're trying to tolerate and then go back and forth
right and that and that that's actually and that it's also it seems to me this relationship in some sense that seems that back and forth implies a certain temporality
right now in some way this sure all right is my past if I turn around and look back will it still be there
this future right there's something drawing me and I don't know about yet therefore it's chaotic but then I'll turn around this past and this back and forth movement seems
I
there's something there about temporality
right well the system starts to be able to extend itself over time that's one of the first things okay so then then the way in which you might I mean at first that it's pretty immediate and then the
capacity to then and indeed it is the argument that John and I and Chris were making in the elusive eye was it is this capacity to begin to extend the self over time through
multiplicity of possible simulations where the environment then changes as you but then it is the extension of self in that time that really starts to give the self agent environment relation and then the self other
relational matrix that then creates the model of the self okay so that means that we start to carry and then we extend so that issue of who am I across time basically is becomes the modeling structures that afford you the
you know on the world right so how you build that is through the attachments of first mom and dad need to be present or that there needs to be a security system present the first six months then all of a sudden that
that begins to extend into an autonomy versus shame and doubt that's the next at least title which autonomy is like hey I can now actually start to exhibit I have the motor work and cognitive capacity start to exhibit control over the world and distance
to myself okay yeah but as soon as I get distance in any way out here in the darkness and I'm I'm still just learning shit it all of a sudden becomes a dark scary world I have to quickly touch is mom going to be there.
Yeah, you know, if I move away, you know when I look back and so then you have to expand the temporality of the field of consideration because now the opportunity across time is increasing and you have to start to really protect what's going on in relationship to
I'm so interesting just to kind of grok the sense of if I turn around and there if I look up and it gets scary and I turn around are they still there that there is so linked to value right and my valued enough such that people stay around right it's so it's
so interesting to think about it like that right being valued is so primary.
Totally. That's it. The fund that is this core of the heart soul is to be known in value by important others at least court and unified theory is the fundamental calories.
Okay, of that part of your psyche, and it's as absolutely as crucial as good calories for the body, you know, it's a fundamental in some ways even, you know, at the level so am I known in value.
Yeah, it's not just can I manipulate but fundamentally, they care about me.
And my essence. Okay, and in non contingent ways they care about yeah.
Yeah, that's what people really track and they desperately need. And unfortunately because of our humanness though we get to a stage where we can.
There's an access to the interior through justification which they need to start talking. Okay, yeah, little kids don't have to deal with this as much but as you start to get older.
The cognitive capacities of justification start to say well okay, I know mom wants to hear shit from me or dad wants to hear shit or my friends want to hear shit, and they can ask me questions so then I find myself basically generating a persona public justification out here.
Okay, yeah, and that's creates then the opportunity for imposter syndromes which then emerge in middle to older childhood, where you actually start to then create a public face the persona.
That's young call that the mask, okay that you then wrote where in relation, and you realize you do that for social influence purposes meaning because you wear the mask you avoid their judgment in a particular way or you obtain their praise.
And at the same time it creates a fundamental social versus core self split, because it's like this, they love me now as a function of the contingencies that I give them.
But if they really knew me I'm terrified they wouldn't that way see that all the time relationship to once adolescents start to struggle with mental health and it creates this very very, you know, brutal dichotomy and there's no holding environment
that can be really generated, that's fundamentally embodied, because you can't really, you can't bring yourself to test it so you fake it, but you then don't trust that you would actually be held I have many many clients who had to work through that process to afford coherent integration
In fact, in fact, it's interesting because I to because I work with people one on one to and in so many cases, like it, I just started it's at the point where I could just kind of almost look for it, right.
There's something like life was fine, right, everything was fluid I was loved, and then we moved.
And there was a new school, and then, and then I had to like your, and then there's the socialization right the break the break with something sometimes security, and then they're in a new social matrix and then there's all these breakdowns.
And at some level, right, that's their so much of their personality has been defined in that adaptation, right, which has all these dichotomies in it, right, and that's usually what we end up talking about right or our issues around that that fundamental break.
Yeah, totally.
Exactly. And then that activates the insecurity of not being held in the environment, and then people struggle with various strategies testing defenses coping strategies etc.
And, you know, if they are constrained and limited and they also lead to additional problems you get an entrenched maladaptive problem of a social phobia, a fundamental sense of insecurity and inability to articulate what's going on a hyper reactivity the vulnerability
that you're always on edge. And then, and then of course that makes you very difficult to then engender, you know, the risks that are necessary.
And they perceive them often as great risk to then go out and try to find a new secure identification matrix identification matrix is the self world identity process of these are these are the elements of the world is my map of that, not necessarily conscious but just intuitively
and what you map it my place in that world and this is what's going to happen to me if I behave in Z ways.
Right, right, right.
You know, the sense about right one of the things that's interesting to me about this is this, you can see through all of this, that you know I often talk about it like this it's like you know,
do you I don't, I don't know about all the biology but the milk like in terms of mammals. The, I don't think there's anything more helpless than the human infant is there.
Not even close.
Not even close. And what's interesting about this is always struck me is like, we all start off like that. Like, like, the way we start is completely dependent completely helpless in every in every dimension that you can imagine.
Totally.
And who's going to Mars.
Right, who's on top of the food chain, who's right, who's the one as far as we can tell, I mean who knows, ultimately, but as far as we can tell who's the one that caught a site of its own existence and then can relate back with that existence right.
And I feel a kind of vulnerability or transparency or porousness going on.
And I think about this and this is where it starts to get kind of ontologically where I want to bring this in and just curious how this weeds together is.
So there's a deep vulnerability that seems to afford the highest levels of theory right of, of, of, of, of mystical realization of, right, deep conceptualization right these, these unitary things and abstractions and all of that right.
And has seems to be, it seems to, in one sense there's this so there's this helplessness that also, right, in this relationship with that vulnerability in its hold it, right.
Yes.
And, and it's all. So, if you think about this statement, I think is it Jesus, I think it's in the I think he says this in the Bible I'm, I'm so not up on that stuff but where he says the meek shall, shall inherit the earth.
You think about that statement, right such a weird, such a weird thing at face value, the meek shall inherit the earth.
Think about it like that. Right. Like, in the terms we're talking about you can start to get worried talking about like that there is a way that, and I think what he's basically saying is the meek when loved, right, that that can
put vulnerability into something very, very powerful. Right.
And, and, and so, so, so there's that part of it that's just that it seems I'm wondering is like there's something ontologically about vulnerability, right and holding right that is expressed here.
And, and then also, but it also strikes me as human.
Sorry about that. That's fine.
I've got to figure out a way so when it calls it doesn't blank out.
You know, it's like yeah so that so that something about the essence of being human right is really really tied with being vulnerable, but like, I don't know anybody in fact I've been teaching courses for, I've been teaching courses for years and, and, and I've never had anyone said not once
I ever had anybody say respond to me when I've said, well hey you know maybe this is a good time to be vulnerable, where they're like, oh, I'm so I was what someone had to say it's right thank God.
No, it's always this sense of like, oh, like, all right, right.
That, that on one level, our humanity seems to be very much about this deep vulnerability, right, but there's a level at which it can be, we can, we can also be exposed.
Right, which is I think what we're really afraid of when we talk about being afraid of being vulnerable or really really afraid of is we collapse that with things with the involuntary sense of art being subject to something in which I'm exposed to which I think is really really
different. Vulnerability seems to, at least in my mind has more of a sense of, I'm volunteering, right there's some sense of the I'm willing, right to be vulnerable both will positive sense and willing, right and the generative sense.
But when, but when that holding environment right breaks down.
And we develop defenses.
And so, so I don't want to be human so what I do is I put a shell around myself.
And here's the paradox is like the moment, but the moment I put a shell around myself and this is why our psychological defenses on one level work but the cost to them are great I think it has to do with this is because the moment I put a shell around myself is the moment I become brittle.
Yep.
Right.
So, so it seems, it seems to me that this, this relationship to, to, because, because on some level you could say the mystic realizing on the top of the mountain realizing being right.
You can almost see that is, is in some sense a profound relationship with his own vulnerability such that he's so vulnerable that he's vulnerable to the deepest depths of himself transparent to it, such that he realizes the ultimate depth of oneness and
he's very paradoxically in that full realization of vulnerability these invulnerable right because he's everything right we think about that as symbol.
Yeah.
And this kind of this ontological sense this verticality, right that has to do with holding time vulnerability, bringing those things together what, what, what, what, what, what stands out for you in that.
A couple of things.
So, yes, I think, I think you're, first off, we should highlight the boner, the vulnerability aspect of our nature. Okay, that we're born into the world vulnerable.
Yeah.
And then that affords us a wonderful set of both opportunities and serious risks at multiple levels, and then our potentialities are structured around trying to mitigate and navigate those risks.
Okay.
And potentially can be realized through a huge amount of affordance. Okay, so let's just talk this through so that I think the bottom I why are we so vulnerable from an evolutionary perspective.
I think the fundamental answer is because we're incredibly plastic. Okay, I was just listening to Heather hiring on Jim rut and she was like from hunter gather perspective, we're sort of the niche generalizers meaning that we can, we can bounce from one of the things
that we can bounce out as we can bounce from niche to niche. Okay, and learn what to learn strategies in a wide variety edition niches. I mean that's our cognitive language, collective intelligence capacities are creative capacities, afford us that.
How the hell do you know get the all the cognitive gadgets and the availability to do that well super long time of development.
The other thing that that probably the mechanics of the size of the head then that requires to hold the brain, and then the birthing process is like well, you can't stay in there forever we're gonna have we're already have serious problems at birth.
It's a hell of a process. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, so you got to get the thing out of there.
Yeah, before it's ready.
Basically, and now all of a sudden you have this really neoteny is the extended period of neonatal development and Steven J group points out that this is a really almost certainly a central feature of our development so a whole bunch so nature basically says alright if we're going to get systems that can
have this unbelievable cognitive learning flexibility that they can learn repertoires and then repertoire off attack so that makes most animals just learn repertoires, we earn repertoires on top of our repertoires they put them all together and evolutionary new ways through our learning.
Yeah.
And now we justify on top of that so we are really do our behavioral flexibility is really in a class by its side. Okay, yeah, to get there, the system has to have be able to download and manipulate all that.
Plus, so then it comes out very very vulnerable.
Yeah, so now let's think about what that means about our condition. If I am fed and held well.
Okay, I can then grow and network into a collective intelligence that is enormous amount of power and be a part of something belonging.
Actually, my doctoral student is probably going to do a dissertation on suicide called the ontology of belonging and suicidal behavior and adolescents.
Basically, it's the ecology and ontology of belonging in her estimation that affords coherent integration.
And what gets deviated for so many people is the breakdown in that and then an internalized critical looping that then alienates and leads to psychic and then a crash and burn and alienation.
So you see then you have this whole all of this potential. First off, you might get neglected and abused that's horrifying, right, or you might get situated so that you're in a contingency where you have to fake it.
But then you feel empty inside that's another sort of developmental line, an aberrant or atypical or less than fulfilling developmental line, and then there's this enormous potential to grow in connection with each other in nature in a fulfilled
way because of the enormous plasticity and learning potential of the structure of the system.
Right, so so our developmental trajectories are enormously variable.
And so the idea that we're sort of like trying to track oh guys this is a bad sign is this a good sign, where are we and have potentials that afford that.
Another thing that I was thinking of when you're talking I hooked up with a theorist a while ago.
Who really centered on this core split of our potential. He actually called his framework called the one divide. Okay, and he basically argued that birth and early events inevitably result in trauma.
And then, and then you have the activation of the low relational value low social influence panic of abandonment death, desertion. Okay, and that that core panic is something that you are really programmed to like void.
Oh my God, am I going to be seen and devalued and dejected and removed. Okay.
What happens then is a self system begins to model what makes me vulnerable, and then how do I create a defensive self structure that's trying to compensate and avoid and control in an instrumental way the avoidance discovery about abandonment.
And he argues that many, many people and I think this is true many people then live their lives, essentially, on the cusp this is really a felt sense of insecurity is you're, you're building a defended character armor structure.
Right talks about character armor from a psychodynamic perspective you build this up. And the function of that is to avoid the terror.
Right with the fear that if you fail to do this, you would be revealed and you'd be rejected and you have a fundamental abandonment. Okay.
Right, right structure of that if you think the vertical integration structure that it's basically it's an empty dark core that is speaking to you constantly, and the rest of your character structure, then is a compensation to try to avoid falling into
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
You know, and that is now I need to work really hard to build stuff. And then the felt sense of its existence is, you know, how far can I stay away from it but everything then you're doing is actually negatively reinforcing what that means is you do shit, so that you avoid the potential
of consequence and it takes, it takes a little bit of the edge off periodically but then you have to keep doing stuff to keep the abyss falling away.
I've met a lot of people that live their lives like that and it is, it's pretty tragic because the entire structure of being, then is like it's just how do I avoid falling into abyss, as opposed to how do I live in the divine bliss.
Okay, yeah.
The fullness, not the negation.
Exactly. It's like, it's like, oh my God, you mean to say that I can be valued and value that into my animal body into my soul and my cells and feel at oneness, you know, with the sense of divine with the ultimate purpose with the negentropic, you know,
complex, coordinated, integrated processes that's my spirit into my system of justification and you drop into that and you just feel a perspectival heart, you know, flood with a sense of appreciation, gratitude, love, all of that and then down into the body and that is then that's the true self,
what he calls the true self integration. And it creates the basically the stack of an affirming belief system and spirit that has some sense making that makes sense of the heart that's known and valued that's into the body that's felt held insecure in the in the environment itself and then, and then I think one of the
things that we should be really emphasizing my friend Rob Scott emphasize this calls it the fundamental shift is those moments. Okay, of being itself, you know, are, are the awe inspiring glory of being itself, and, and to be just in the moment of awareness,
and to cultivate the taste of that beauty of awareness itself. I mean, I find that to be, and then you get back to the whole leisure place is sort of like to have the opportunity to simply be right, and then to be and to, and to have that beingness be so fill your existence in the world.
I mean, that's a beautiful thing. And that's a beautiful thing. And I think we there's an opportunity for us to achieve that he certainly makes this case I believe this too, that we're just we don't so we socialize towards instrumental control and doing
you know, and kind of do more and do more and do more and get more and more and the whole, and then you can rest and or watch your damn, you know, whatever's fun for you and it's like, yeah, you're missing the entire point of being in becoming modes of you know, we should be working when certainly
we have to at some levels not like you don't do, but the cultivation of that fundamental being in the world, and being held by the world in a moment of the infinite now in a particular kind of presence to be able to taste that to be present with that.
I've certainly grown in the last five years in that mode. I'm, you know, even as a clinical psychologist we weren't socialized too much to orient to that I think that's a great.
Many wisdom traditions do orient that way and I've really felt fortunate that I've been hanging out with people over the last five years really shine the light on that rich way.
Well, one of the things that is you've been describing all of this it's just been. It's a marvel to realize our pre reflective organismic sense knows this relationship with holding it we it's embodied embedded right there's a deep
it seems super intelligent to me it's it's network of is intelligibility that seems to somehow be oriented to to this right so it's just this idea of that because I've seen this over and over and over again where, you know, like it is it's really true it's like, I think,
I think it's set up in such a way, and it says a lot to do with nihilism, it says a lot to do with the meeting crisis, all of this right where we're not really.
We don't even consider that we don't have an understanding of being that isn't contingent, right.
Not this sense of contingency the sense the sense of that there is there are principles, right, that in some sense govern, you know, got govern the orderliness, or make it possible for orderliness and sometimes philosophy, right.
The philosophy at the deepest sense of the word was really in some sense about getting close to and beholding those principles, right.
That that in some sense the principle itself you can't read what's interesting about is the principle itself is like you cannot. It's one of those things where you cannot. Ultimately, you can't put into language.
Right. It's, I think, yes, it's a the way you know you go down and catch this is pretty early I think when they say the dow's not the dow is it's a participatory perspectival presencing.
Yeah, that is that is definitely at this animal heart, you know, felt sense of being it and then and and also I think it often is when we have our transcendent states it's trans justificatory so in virtually all mystic states it's you know the ego dies or dissipates that
it's just a little the narrating regulator seeking justification control and legitimacy. Right. That is crucial.
But it is a particular kind of mode that I think our modern style is like way over activated.
And then it kind of controls the shit, and it's trying to regulate and make sure everything fits in the damn boxes that is trying to control and it will get anxious or pissed off if it doesn't, you know, when it's justification in a particular way and that is, that's definitely
not the the coherent stacked innovation in fact that's just one piece of it and you need to be underneath it and above it.
Yeah, rather than just trying to use it as the primary, you know, propositional reasoning network which is really modernity.
It basically started to said that in many ways was like probably gonna reason our way through justification and science into this. I know Ian McGillchrist makes a number of points in these directions and I agree.
Yeah, right. And this, this sense of witnessing and I'm sure you've probably experienced this being a therapist to have.
I would imagine the therapies a lot like this but just when you start to get real about it, people start to have these these insights that it's usually when they're defensive strategies, don't like actually start the balance, the benefit right of that goes down
because usually I've noticed this with like kind of psychological forms of defensiveness is that is it creates these this immediate sense of safety but but in a way that numbs you or has you not see the long term consequences.
And I think that thing that you're talking about this Nemo this emptiness inside in which if you fall into that it's all over.
That's the felt sense. Then you, then you live such that you're not that and then you articulate a whole way of being it's about an avoidance of that right but then you're dependent on that in some weird sense.
So you go, you go in, you know, you go in with people and you start talking about this and he's like well, what do you what would happen if you just didn't do that.
Yeah, totally.
Like in this anxiety comes up and then you know there's a way where it's like you take something to be with the anxiety and the annihilation, because there's a deep mistake going on in there.
Right, but when when people can tolerate it right and the conditions are right and they can tolerate it and they can open to it that and go through that initial.
It's like feeling it's like that level of experience is so it's so intense right it's like it's like imagine it's like the feeling.
It's like the most haunting nauseating like everything unattractive that you could imagine in your very pores is the recognition that that's all that there is that's what it feels like right it's like a total awfulness right in the deep sense of the word and it
is something to even get any leverage to be able to turn towards it. Right.
Absolutely.
When you do.
There is something though because and I'm kind of getting this through this conversation and it and it and it in a different way they don't know if I quite saw like so concurrently here is
that we have our our our nervous system is really knows how to open to that deep open right it's like something catches like if you can feel through that barrier right and you can like at some point you're like all right.
I don't know what I'm being right.
Totally.
At some point you're like.
Well, there is a lot of room is kind of spacious in there in fact there's like an affording spaciousness and like it but that your, your nervous system knows how to.
How to take in that in the most generative sense.
Right.
Yeah.
Right. It has that potential. Okay.
It also the reason people get all tangled up is precisely because the way that egoic narrator frames it all. Okay, if you frame it in a particular way, and you do have a core anxiety thing.
And then you get a lot of reinforcement that this in structure because the system basically is reading this is that this is annihilation itself. Okay.
And then you build all the justification around that. And then what you, if you do it in the right way, and afford the person to bring to bear what that annihilation actually means at first it's terrifying, right.
But you're right. If, if the opening of what this might mean and what might be on the other side of it is afforded to the individual, and they can hold the egoic defenses off, or participate in a flow that don't lead to the reciprocal narrowing and the need to
escape and safety, but actually get present and take the step off into sort of like what appears to be the abyss. And then it's like, and then you're like, huh.
You know, here, here I am not meeting up my dad standards and here I am not being this and here I am being the person that's rejected and here I am, and here I still am.
And here I am like, so many other people and then here I am like living my life and then it's just like and then here I am living and then it's like, was it this fascinating that this is that this is all part of the drama, you know that that
this isn't the relationship to this instead of the doer controller manipulator avoider defender is just the beer, you know it's just like, huh. And of course that is that.
When I see it, you're like, you start noticing like what is this am.
If you follow me around everywhere. What is this yeah right there you go.
You're getting of all of it yeah of the whole yeah you start to make that fundamental shift. And then I think that you know to coach people into the mode of fulfillment, you know what is fundamental fulfillment and certainly from my
point, you know, it is in the now of of of existence in that felt sense of being this being in becoming the doing is crucial, but it's that's means to end shit. This fundamentally is the you diamonic point, you know, that affords the particular capacity,
whether it's by some design design or at least just a hell of a fortunate system towards neg entropy that affords us what it is like to be coherent and integrating across multiple levels, and then to have the reflective felt sense of appreciation for that, which to me to
I mean, it's not a cultivation but is now super available. Yeah, and that's, that's a nice place. I remember when you talked about when you when you talked about that.
I think part of what you mean with that is when you talk about when wisdom energy. So would you say wisdom energy and is in the way you're talking about is that is that that felt experience of all of that intelligibility coming through a like
feeling in your body from the inside out. Right. Exactly.
In a way that you. Yes.
Yep, so it expanded my, you know, I had my framing or whatever but that I did reach another layer both above and below my justificatory narrative of expansion and coherent integration and afforded a presencing of that being this and then
basically it was, I am energy I'm in this energy information blob.
Okay, but it's actually the arrangement of my energy information blog then affords a profound experience of wisdom and that's what I meant as wisdom energy is just sort of like yeah, you know, this and it feels the way you know it's just on walking my dog there's
an opportunity here for profound sustainability meaning it's like, if actually if I just relate to myself and the world a particular I don't need a course I need to eat a few things but I mean it's like the consumption and the doing and the you know all the
stuff is just sort of like, God, you know, I don't know that we really are well balanced in this regard like what the hell is this? Why don't I just like, you know, I can just be in love, you know, basically just being in love with existence.
I said I described it as loving being without memory or desire.
You know, and that the ego and facility sort of drops it out.
And it is a profound sense of being held you I really do feel held the universe, and at one with it in a particular way and that self other just grip of the world.
And that it's a level of feeling that I think that's what I kind of I think I'm like reflecting back with you about this to the earlier part of our conversation.
Is it?
It's, it sounds like an embodied optimal grip with being, right?
That's great.
You know, me and John as cognitive scientists will tend to describe it that way. Yes.
Yeah.
In fact, in fact, to talk to with John the other day about this about because he's been looking a lot more at attachment and he the way he described attachment, right, was
as
the result and demonstration of optimal gripping.
Right.
This whole thing about that there's and that's it doesn't make sense because it's
we're not looking at objects right there. It's it's it's dynamical relations all the way down right we're no something that's it's I think that in fact I think the mistake is often we start to relate to ourselves as a thing.
Right, they can have something right but it's really a dynamical affordance of that. And would you say that that that you feel that resonance that you're talking about that embodied resonance.
It seems like your attachment systems, right, our system. It's what do you feel that through the same. I don't know if you want to call it circuitry.
That one feels deeply valued in a parent relationship. Is it a similar like circuitry.
Yep. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, so certainly at the relational level. Yes, I mean I was sort of expanding beyond and through the entire self, and it was I will as a social mammal I'll feel it in relation.
Okay, but so in terms of so in terms of my attachments just say let's say with myself.
You know the attachment with yourself is the internalized interject the interject is the ego builds its model of the self and then build a second order justification system of, you know, I me relation, and then starts to hold the standard of self,
reflecting on the self, the intuitive heart level and self esteem and self acceptance refers to the way the interject treats the heart. Okay, and that then often, it's not always the parent the way you do it but to the internalized other and the normal standards
are you can internalize the standards of society the super ego. So you know what contingent society is going to tell you that's loved and acceptable, and then you judge yourself accordingly so you jam the shit that's not acceptable into the closet, and other people can't see it
and then you won't, and you won't lose influence in value but then of course you break the structure of coherent integration across the verticals because you're now taking a poor aspect of the self that thinks it's an organismic value in processes like hey this is how I want to express myself.
You know, like, you know, like my friend who was gay in 1985 is like, you can't be fucking gay, you know, you know, all the homophobia is like jam that shit in the closet, you know, and then you had to figure out how to come out of the closet.
