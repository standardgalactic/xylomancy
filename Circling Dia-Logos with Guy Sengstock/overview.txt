Checking Circling Dia-Logos with Guy Sengstock/＂The meek shall inherit the earth＂ Ontological Vulnerability ⧸ Gregg Henriques & Guy Sengstock.txt
 The conversation revolves around the concept of wisdom as an energy-information phenomenon and the experience of being deeply connected with and held by the universe. This connection transcends the ego and facilities a state of being that is characterized by love for existence without the interference of memory or desire. The discussion then moves to the idea of attachment, which John, a cognitive scientist, describes as an expression of optimally gripping reality.

Attachments are not just about physical objects but are dynamic relational processes that involve how we relate to ourselves and others. The interject, a part of the cognitive system in the brain, is responsible for how we internally experience and respond to the world, including our self-perception and the way we treat our heart's desires or intuitions.

The interplay between the interject and the heart can lead to either healthy self-acceptance or, conversely, to the internalization of societal standards that may not align with one's true nature. This can result in certain aspects of the self being suppressed to maintain a sense of belonging and acceptance within society. Over time, this suppression can lead to disintegration or fragmentation within the self as different parts of the personality or identity are at odds with each other.

The example given is of individuals who, due to societal pressures, suppress their true sexual orientation, which later may lead them to confront their identity and find the courage to live authentically. This process of coming out can be seen as a journey towards integrating all aspects of the self into a coherent and whole being. The conversation emphasizes the importance of recognizing and accepting all parts of oneself and aligning one's life with those values and processes that are organically meaningful, thus achieving a state of profound wisdom and integration.
