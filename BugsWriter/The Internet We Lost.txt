Let me see where it can be a doll.
You look like an angel, your skin is a cry, you float like a feather,
in a beautiful world, I wish I was special, you're so very special,
but I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo, what the hell am I doing here?
I don't know what I'm feeling, I don't care if it's different, I want to have control, I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul, I want a pretty nose, but I'm not around, you're so very special, I wish I was special,
I want a perfect soul, I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul, I want a perfect soul, I want a perfect body,
love, she's love, love, she's love, I'm a weirdo, I want a perfect soul, I want a perfect body,
love, I'm a weirdo, you're so very special, I wish I was special.
