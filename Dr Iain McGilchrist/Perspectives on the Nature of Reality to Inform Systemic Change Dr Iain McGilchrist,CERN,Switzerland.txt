What am I going to do this evening? I'm going to try to do the impossible. In the old days
students used to have nothing very much to do at university, so they used to entertain
themselves with pranks like how many people can you fit into a telephone box and it's
going to be a little bit like that tonight. I'm going to see how many ideas I can cram
into whatever time has allowed me. I want to begin by talking a bit about what I call the
hemisphere hypothesis, the question of the difference between the hemispheres, but mainly
as a portal to a further exploration of reality. It seems to me that at the moment we're puzzled
about reality because there are messages that come to us particularly from some areas of post
modernism that there is no such thing as truth. Everything is just whatever you make up. I don't
believe that for an instant. I believe passionately that there are truths that they are rarely simple
and they may sometimes conflict with one another. So it is hard to set up a program of them but we
can learn to look for them and be more successful in finding them and it's in that project that I've
been writing for 30 years, first the master and his emissary and then the matter with things which
came out a couple of years ago, well less than that now, November 21 and in it I try to take
strands from what we know about the brain, what we know about our thinking patterns in consciousness
and what we know from physics. These seem like three pretty core ways of looking into
the nature of reality. I'm not suggesting there is one single easy reality. I'm not suggesting
there is one ever knowable truth. I'm suggesting we mustn't ever give up on the idea that it is
worthwhile for a human life. In fact it is imperative for a human life to be searching
for such a reality and such a truth, otherwise we are frankly deluded and I believe that much
of the world I now live in is suicidally deluded. Well I come on to that later. Now let me see,
oh that's good. So this is a quote from Pascal, the twofold nature of man is so evident that
some have thought that we had two souls. Well he's not the only person to have said something
like this. Kant said something like this, Schopenhauer, Bergson, Goethe, Nietzsche,
the wonderful German philosopher Max Sch√§ler who in my view is underrated and underread these days.
They all had this instinct that there were two sort of almost people or points of view within us
that were somewhat in conflict. Each could be helpful for some things but neither of them was
complete in themselves. And in fact incidentally in writing this book I found that there are stories
like the story of the master and his emissary which gave me the title of my earlier book 2009
from all around the world. The story I took there was supposed to resituate the way in which we
think about the left and right hemisphere. When I was in medical school it was said that the left
hemisphere sort of was terribly important because it controls the right hand with which you do the
grasping and it controls certain elements of language mainly speech through which we say we
grasp things. But actually it turns out that the right hemisphere is far far more important
for getting a hold on the world than the left hemisphere and indeed when people have had a
stroke it is harder for them to recover from a stroke in the right hemisphere than a stroke
in the left hemisphere. Even though the left hemisphere stroke often affects their speech
and affects their ability to use their right hand. So I could say at this point that in the
later book that I've written the matter with things which came out as I say November 21,
I begin by looking at what I call the various portals through which we can
get a grasp of the world at all get some kind of understanding of it receive information from it
and I take it that those are attention perception which is not the same as attention judgment the
ideas we form on the basis of what we attend to and what we perceive emotional and social
intelligence cognitive intelligence in other words IQ and creativity because that enters
into our ability to interpret what it is we're seeing and in all of these I demonstrate at length
over 400 pages and I draw on 5600 pieces of research I can demonstrate conclusively that all
of these are better carried out by the right hemisphere it is more vertical it is more intelligent
more perceptive and much better guide to reality and when people have right hemisphere damages
has been commented on by neurologists over the Easter century they lose any sense of reality
they become deluded start hallucinating and indeed in schizophrenia which is the the topic that
probably rings bells for most people when one mentions delusions and hallucinations
what is going on there is something like a defunct or deficient right hemisphere which
has been compensated for by an overactive left hemisphere anyway that's all by way of
an introduction but first of all let me just ask this question most of you here will have
heard something like this what hemisphere differences that's all complete rubbish that
was all blown out of the water 30 years ago it's all nonsense don't even listen to it
and there's a sort of circular thing that happens here this is what people were taught
so they never looked because they never looked they never found anything different from what
they've been told so much later in their careers they don't want to spend 30 years like me actually
finding out what are the differences between the hemispheres because it would mean the end of
their career they'd be despised by their colleagues they wouldn't get promotion so I'm afraid this is
a question of a and what you might call an urban myth it is an idea that itself needs powerfully
to be debunked if you don't believe me read my work it is enormously well referenced you can
look up everywhere what it is that I'm referring to and why is this scientifically based I just
like to ask you three simple questions why is the brain divided this is a picture by the
sailors and we were in Basel the other day and passed by accident a house and said here lived
this age so in 1542 this slightly grumpy looking man had the top of his head lifted off and here
you see the left hemisphere pushed slightly to the side to expose this band of fibers at the base
of the brain called the corpus callosum why is the brain divided in this way if the power of the
brain is in making connection connections why have it so massively divided and it's not just our
brains by the way is all the brains we've ever looked at mammals reptiles amphibians birds right
down to insects having separate different ganglions wherever you look and in fact the oldest creature
that we know has a neural network which is said to be the ancestor of the mammalian brain a sea
creature called nematosella vectensis the brain is the neural network is somewhat divided and
asymmetrical which is the next thing I'm coming on to why is the brain asymmetrical here you're
looking up at the base of the brain as if you're looking up your own spinal column and you can see
that the right hemisphere which is hopefully on the left is larger than the the corresponding
frontal over the left hemisphere and similarly at the back the left hemisphere is larger than the
right when I was in medical school that was always said to be because of language but we
know it is nothing to do with language it has become used by language now that the brain has
this expansion that the expansion was not caused by language because it's there in chimpanzees
gorillas orangutans and other creatures that we've tried to teach language to and got nowhere
and the third thing is the corpus callosum itself this band of fibers which only two
percent of brain fibers actually cross from one hemisphere to the other
it's rather wonderful this suburban doorbell suddenly coming in from the cosmic reaches
what I've got here is a normal human brain over whoops there
and over here I've got I was very privileged I got a slide through
Donald Trump's brain and um oh no sorry it's a dog's brain but anyway what you see is that
the dog's brain is smaller than a human brain quite a lot but the corpus callosum which is
if I can do this this oh band of fibers here and the same thing in white over here in the
whoops in the there the dog didn't have a drink and so you can see that it's it's not as big
comparatively with the brain so the the corpus callosum is getting smaller over evolution and
it only started in mammals prior to mammals there wasn't a corpus callosum at all and get this the
main purpose of the corpus callosum is to inhibit to tell one hemisphere to the other one keep out
of it many of the fibers across the corpus callosum for those of you in neuroscientists are
excitedly they glutamatergic but they abut on GABA
allergic neurons which are functionally inhibitory and that why this might have a reference to
human culture is expanded in this book the master and his emissive why would this have
anything to do with human culture but I'm going to explain to you that the two hemispheres have
evolved to do completely different things and in this book I go into that and the philosophy of it
but I also look at the history of human culture and suggest that there are times when we have
got these two aspects of our brains out of balance I'll come on to that now as was mentioned by Amir
a central concept for me is attention when I discovered that one of the most important
distinctions between the two brain hemispheres was the way in which they pay attention to the world
it didn't immediately dawn on me why this was so significant because I had been trained in a
mechanistic way of thinking about the brain which was that attention is just another cognitive
function that can be measured in the lab and it could be simulated by a machine a machine can
be directed towards something but it can't pay attention to it and attention is something very
special indeed because I believe it actually creates the world the only world that any of us
can know is the world that comes into being for us and that world is a combination of something
coming from us and something out there and I believe that this is a two-way relationship in
fact that all things in the cosmos have two-way relationships are reverberative in their nature
and I'm trying to get away from naive realism on the one hand and naive idealism on the other
naive realism I call rock that the reality is out there ROT and that's just nonsense
that there's just a world out there and we record it passively like a photographic
place or a sound recorder no something of us goes into what we find there which is why
what we find there has some very general common ground but is not identical in every experience
even by the same person never mind by different persons but I also don't think that it is
what you might call mumbo made up miraculously by ourselves MUMBO which is the kind of post-modern
idea that it's just a fantasy out of our brains it is something that happens between in what I
call a betweenness but betweenness is not just a gap between it is it's like an electric current
where is the electric current is it in the positive terminal no is it in the negative terminal no it
needs them is in the space between no it's in the whole ensemble and between this is what happens
when two things come into a new union and something comes about that is different from either of any
of its component parts but subsumes them so they're necessary but not sufficient now this is the
mountain behind my house its name derives from a Norse word which means a sloping rock and you
can see why because from the sea this mountain was a signal to the Vikings who came there
a thousand years ago that this was a very dangerous bay in which they would be shipwrecked
so to them this mountain was a landmark that meant life and death but there were people here before
the Vikings there were the Picts and they've left their broths their stone houses and we know that for
them this mountain was the home of the gods then in the 18th century people came to draw and paint
in Scotland it's a very beautiful landscape and they would have seen this as a many coloured many
textured form of beauty and then in the 19th century people came and they were interested
in geology and it just happens to be an extremely good example of columnar basalt formation
so to all these people it was something different and then to a physicist you ask a physicist what
it is but 99.99 percent of it is empty space and the other bit 0.01 percent we don't really know
what it is after all so which of these is the real mountain I ask you now my answer to that is
that no one of them is the full story but each of them is the real mountain each of them is a real
way of looking at the mountain and if you say to me yeah but come on it's just a big lump of rock
that already is a very specialist way of looking at it which betrays your values and your particular
narrowness of way of viewing because it's many many things now if you apply that across the world
you realise that attention is a creative act attention is a moral act because what you make
of the world is something that really comes out when I attend to you in a certain way I can
bring something that is warm good beneficent perhaps healing as a good therapist or doctor
might be able to do if I pay attention to you in a clinically detached way I can make you feel very
small very alien and so on we create the world around us we actually make things through our
attention so how you attend matters because it forms up like this once you start looking in
one way you find only the bits of the world that respond to the way you look the world is a machine
so you look at it this is mechanical that's mechanical the other's mechanical the whole
thing's a machine but that's because looking at it as a machine all you see are the bits that
respond to that mechanistic view and if you do you then start to look further in this same way
thinking that was a good start and now you just harden up so after a few decades it's very difficult
to break out of a habit of mind that we are instilling into people in the west which was never
held at any other time in human history never held in other parts of the world and the west until
very recently and is extremely odd this is the kind of attention paid by the left hemisphere
targeted on something the reason that we have these two hemispheres you measure why do we have
these two hemispheres is because the left is good at one thing only it's much better than the right
at grabbing at grasping and and even the processes whereby we say we have grasped something we have
big difference or indeed comprende comprende comprende is to grasp hold of or apprehend
is to grasp onto comprehend is probably different it's to sort of see the whole together which is
what the right hemisphere alone can do but this is how the left hemisphere looks at the world
a leads to be job done but the broad view of the right hemisphere sees that a and b are connected
but not as directly as you thought and that the system is living hence the birds and the tree
and complex not just complicated you may say it's very facile to talk about one hemisphere
as a whole and of course I am neurologically trained I'm psychologically trained I know
that there are different areas in the brain I know they have different functions if you
read my writing you will find that the different areas do but it is also now known that instead
of thinking modular in a modular way about the brain we should be thinking more in terms of
whole networks and indeed when you excite one part of the left or the right hemisphere there
will be excitations that spread much more widely throughout that hemisphere and this is to show you
a couple of sort of if you like the super highways of transmission the superior longitudinal
fasciculus and the unsonent fasciculus showing connections between the posterior part of the
brain and the frontal lobes and between the frontal lobes and the temporal lobe
so this pains me I'm going to do something it's extremely simple-minded and much more black and
white than I would like it to be but because I just don't have time you'll have to take it
as a bit of a caricature but broadly speaking it is what you can accept and if you want to know the
depth in s and all the details then read my books
so there are various differences and one is that the the left I put the left hemisphere
version on the left and the right hemisphere version on the right and in these dichotomies
that are somewhat false dichotomies because nothing can be cut and dried when it comes to
anything as complicated as the brain but nonetheless there are strong tendencies for the
right hemisphere to be able to apprehend new experiences of whatever kind new music new person
new shape whatever it might be whereas the left hemisphere latches on to what is already known
and familiar because it's looking for food it's looking for things to pick up with its right hand
and the evolutionary point here is that if you're only attending to food and a twig to
build a nest and all the utilization of the world the manipulation of the world which the left hemisphere
is good for you'll soon be eaten by another creature while you're getting your own lunch because
you need to be looking out for predators for your mate for your constipation and so you have to have
some part of your brain that is holding the whole picture together while you go about grabbing and
picking what you know it prefers what is certain to what is possible in other words it likes things
to be cut and dried black and white whereas the right hemisphere is more open to ambiguity
the left hemisphere prefers fixity it can it likes to fix things and literally when
people have a certain kind of damage to the right posterior hemisphere they begin to see
normal flow of motion broken up into like a sort of an old-fashioned cine film that's got stuck or
stop go animation because after all it's targeting something and wants to catch it so it fixes it
and fixes up so it sees a lot of static bits whereas the right hemisphere sees that everything is
flowing the left hemisphere sees parts where the right hemisphere sees the whole the right
hemisphere has the body image in it which is the whole image of the body in all modalities the left
hemisphere has a nose an elbow a knee a foot explicit versus implicit so the left hemisphere
understands what is explicit what if you have a dictionary and a grammar and perhaps a computer
could put them together but all that is implicit which is nine tenths of what matters to us things
like love and a sense of the sacred and the meaning of music and the understanding of poetry the
understanding of humor sarcasm irony all these things that change the way the world is to be
interpreted are taken at face value by the left hemisphere though understood by the right the
left hemisphere tends to abstract things from their context and if you take things out of their
context they change their meaning completely and the best way to understand something is to see
it in the context which makes it what it is nothing is something outside of its context
the context is what actually creates it which is one of the reasons I say that relations are prior
things the title of my later book is the matter with things which is a pun about our obsession
with matter and our obsession with things but things I say arise secondarily out of a web
of relationships they're the things that catch our attention they are the little hubs where things
cross but actually they are only what they are because of their relations in abstracting it turns
whatever it has into a general case not a unique one and here because I'm in Switzerland this first
time I've ever talked about this with two wonderfully described cases rather sad cases
one is of a woman who spent her whole life describing and writing about the birds of
Switzerland and you have a wonderful bird life here in Switzerland and she had a right posterior
temporal parietal stroke and afterwards she said all the birds look the same
this is pretty tragic and another is a case of a farmer Swiss farmer who knew all his cattle
by name but after a stroke he had difficulty telling a cow from a horse so you see it deals
in very broad categories but the right hemisphere sees the unique case sees the ewness of you and
the thisness of your friend the left hemisphere is mainly interested in how much of something the
right hemisphere more in but how what is the quality of it naturally this world becomes
inanimate and the right hemisphere sees the animosity and you can actually isolate one hemisphere
as a time painlessly experimentally using something called trans cranial magnetic stimulation
and if you if you suppress the right hemisphere people see what they would normally think of
as living as inanimate if you suppress the left hemisphere they see things that we would normally
think of as inanimate like the sun as a living being the left hemisphere is remarkably optimistic
ridiculously optimistic you again you can isolate one hemisphere at a time and this is
done sometimes prior to brain surgery and it's called the wada test and while one hemisphere
is isolated the other one is not contributing last for about 15 minutes during that time
some psychologists administered a personality inventory to the subject and also to the subject's
relations and friends and discovered that the left hemisphere has a very high opinion of itself
compared with what other people think but when it was the right hemisphere's turn the right hemisphere
was a little bit too negative about itself but more realistic and the most extraordinary
demonstration of this is denial this is terribly important because I believe we now
live in an age of denial all around us we are denying a whole host of things trying to not
see them at all or saying the opposite is the case and this is very literal after the left
hemisphere stroke somebody may have a paralyzed right arm or right leg and they'll be very unhappy
about this they will weep about it complain to the doctor but if they've had a stroke in the
right hemisphere and the left side is paralyzed they may completely deny there's anything wrong
so you're going to see them in the morning after they come into the stroke in the night say how are
you and they say fine oh that's very good and any difficulty moving anything no no
can you move your left arm yep can you show me and they go there but nothing actually moved
if you bring it round in front of them and say move that they say that's not my arm that belongs
to that person over there or it belongs to you doctor and the most important but least exciting
perhaps of this list is the difference between something that is truly present and something
that is represented now represented literally means presented again after which is no longer present
is therefore already past finished dead and presenting is something that we don't allow
the world to do nowadays because we're so quick with our representations oh it's one of those
it's a picturesque scene it's a lake it's a car it's a water we don't only if we practice mindfulness
are we able to get back to that state in which we are fully present and the world is fully present
to us okay that's because I didn't know how to build that slide hello yes we've heard from you
before now so effectively what you've got here I'd like to draw this together so you see the kind
of world that the left hemisphere brings into being for us it's effectively I think we may have
more problems with my poor skills at building slides but let's see oh that's all right so
first of all you've got a world in what we take for reality
better
does it
yeah yeah has it stopped working or
well I it's been very quiet all along I'd like to be louder but I'm not a technician
no I'm fine oh that's better that's a bit too much
is it
thank you so first of all what we take to be reality is in fact just a representation
a map a picture a diagram but not the complex living home one that is in fact made up of isolated
things things more over the known familiar decontextualized fixed predetermined and made
up of bits fragments disembodied having no meaning or coherence until we give it to them
where all is abstract generic in nature infinitely reproducible and quantifiable
and therefore inanimate and mechanical and the future is a fantasy which would be
only better if we could get more of it under our control whereas
in the right hemisphere one sees that nothing is ever entirely certain or predictable that all
things are ultimately interconnected that there is nothing that is ever fixed but in fact that
as heraclitus said everything flows that what exists are holds the parts are an artifact of
the left hemisphere's way of looking at it that meaning is implicit and that the world of uniqueness
is real not just categories that can be quantified but having different qualities
and an essentially animate world and here there's a future that is a product of realism
not denial we've got one hemisphere that sees just a theory of the world it's very simple and
pleasing and is only going to get better the right hemisphere is seeing the whole embodied
impassioned business of vitality and seeing that it is not necessarily leading somewhere we want to
go there was a relationship between the brain and the structure of the cosmos
that's something I'm going to try and explain now there is a sort of hierarchy of the right and
left let me say this first of all I think I've explained that the right hemisphere is more
veredical that it is a better transmitter of producer of reality and the left hemisphere
has certain limited uses what it sees is not wrong it's not that it's got no use it's just
that its use is very limited and its knowledge is limited the problem only becomes when it thinks
it knows more and we pay attention to that very narrow way of thinking as though it gives us
the full picture which it doesn't so there's a hierarchy there and I think this is also
demonstrable in physics I've explained that and I would say that when we're talking about you know
how we would like to make a world it's a fantasy for us to imagine that we can just make up a world
without understanding both our own brains and the cosmos and so this is where we need to start from
in all our exercises of imagination and if whatever exists there is a replication of this
thing about the brain which is that the left hemisphere tends to divide in order to understand
but then cannot put it together again but the right hemisphere tends to see the whole
and see the whole picture of which what the left hemisphere's been looking at is just a part
now we need both these kinds of attention but one of them is more important than the other
the capacity to see the whole and there are these forces for division and forces for union
throughout the physical cosmos as well as the metaphysical one and what we need is the unity
of the forces of division and union not the division of the forces of division and union
do you understand I sometimes say we don't want either either or or both and we need both either
or and both and I hope that's entirely clear so this idea hello the unity of difference and unity
is the first asymmetry the cosmos is founded on asymmetry so this is all played out in this
recent book of mine in two volumes 1300 pages of text 1500 all together
now it's based on this idea that science and philosophy should never have been divorced
the word science in English only began being used to specialised meaning in 1830 until then
science meant knowledge and indeed what we call science is called natural philosophy because in
fact what scientists don't see anymore is there is no such thing as just looking because the
way you attend the preconceptions of which you attend alters what you find if you don't know
anything about philosophy you just think it's obvious that everything is mechanical because
that is the philosophy of our age that is what people suck up from all around them as they grow
that everything is mechanical but it is not actually mechanical organisms in particular
are not like machines in at least eight ways which I explained in this book and here I'm
approaching from my favourite English philosopher the last hundred years the antagonism between
science and metaphysics is like all family quarrels being disastrous and from Collingwood
science and metaphysics are inextricably united and stand or fall together any of you who here
are scientists please take that away and think about it it does matter and one of the things
that I wanted to talk about was the centrality of attention to what comes into existence I've
talked a bit about that already then the coincidence of opposites now to our way of thinking now
how can opposites coincide it sounds impossible we're taught at school that if it's this then
the opposite is as far away from it as possible but this is not the case actually because mental
space metaphysical space and indeed physical space is curved it's not linear and the further
you go in a certain direction the more you find yourself coming back to what you are running away
from it's a truism that anarchy leads to tyranny that something extreme gives rise to its opposite
because it has its opposite in it I've always thought that politicians as extreme left and
extreme right you can hardly get a razor blade between them they've got the same mentality
which is to miss all the shades the complexities the subtleties of human existence and I've already
mentioned that I believe that relations come before relata the things that are related and
I just want to say something about limit cases being inverted this is my view of reality that you
know in the old world in the old world of physics we thought that this was a Newtonian world that
things are naturally static and they don't move unless they're given a push but now we know that
there is nothing that is actually static in the entire cosmos everything is in motion and stasis
would be the limit case of motion not motion the limit case of stasis representation is the limit
case of what is actually real total independence is the limit case of interdependence because
everything is interdependent there is no such thing as total independence but if it existed
poor it would be the limit case of the norm which is interdependence discontinuity is not the norm
which then gets connected continuity is the norm you may say how why do you say that I can quote
physicists who say this metaphysically I believe it to be the case from observation of the world I
believe it to be the case but discontinuity discontinuity is the limit case of the continuous
the explicit is not the norm and the implicit some very strange thing that happens in a poem
implicit is what all our knowledge is explicit knowledge is a very special case that we learn
how to say in words through the process of education the literal is the limit case of
the metaphorical everything is metaphorical everything even the words in fact particularly
the words used by science and philosophy a point that has been made by philosophers themselves
are based on metaphors because they're dealing in an abstract realm and they therefore have to draw
things from a real world in fact the word abstract is itself something that means being dragged away
I mean it's very physical so meaning is effectively metaphorical the literal is only a
special case of the metaphorical in which you privilege one kind of meaning randomness which
actually doesn't exist anywhere in the cosmos would merely if it existed be the limit case of order
which is everywhere simplicity represents a special case of complexity because the more you
go down even into the into the the the quantum vacuum this is the simplest thing that we know
and according to David Tong professor of physics at Cambridge it's unbelievably complex so
simplicity is what we make when we clear away all the complexity I've got a mechanism how lovely
that gives me a little tweak power and the determinant is the limit of the indeterminate
everything is actually ultimately indeterminate but in its very special cases if you take the
window narrow enough you can say it looks determinant and straight lines are the limit
case of curves not curves some special case of straight lines so all that exists is a kind of
form and in the words of whitehead beyond all questions of quantity there lie questions of
pattern which are essential to the understanding of nature and form is a matter of tension
um can I go back yes this is from my favorite pre-socratic philosopher Heraclitus or my favorite
philosopher frankly they do not understand how a thing agrees with variance at variance with itself
it is an attunement turning back on itself like that of the bow and la what did he mean
he meant that things are always in balance of their opposites that wherever something exists
it's dark side the other end of it is there as well and that what you look for is not to collapse
this creative tension into just this or just that but to hold the tension for us this is uncomfortable
therefore we try to collapse it oh it's just that or it's just that no you have to hold the two opposites
and the bow and the lyre is the string of the bow the string of the lyre gives rise to the note
that gives rise to the flying arrow and if you let that tension go slack and didn't pull into
opposite directions pulling in opposite directions is logically a waste of time but actually it's
essential to everything that exists because this tension is creative you want to make a good apple
pie you don't get boring bland apples you get nice tart apples and put lots of honey with it
and this is one of his deepest sayings grasping which means the coming together of things
hose and not hose conversion divergent constant dissonant from all things one and from one thing
all i would love to have time to unpack that for you but take it away and read it and think about it
and that relates to the idea of one and all i have a chapter on the coincidential positive or on
the coincidence opposites and a chapter on the one and the many and i say it is wise or he says it is
wise listening not to me but to the logos which is like the founding ground of being to agree that
all things are one and i foot in brackets and that the one is all things because the greek grammar
allows this ambiguity of dual interpretation as i say he also and this is a second important
point about physics is that everything flows that's not the same as everything changes there is a
buddhist saying that everything changes it's good as far as it goes but everything flows is better
because not only does it suggest there's a difference between the meaning of flow and just a succession
of things but also it contains within it the important idea that when things flow they both
are different and the same the river that flows by my house is always the same river but the water
is always different and heraclitus said famously you can't step into the same water twice but that
is beautiful because you also said by changing things remain the same see this very interesting
idea that comes from observing the flow that in the flowing it remains what it is but it also
becomes something other then here is democratus another early greek philosopher the cause of
coming into being of all things is the vortex vortex of course is a whirlpool and this is
terribly important because well this is about flow really um this is david tong again from
cambridge at a fundamental level nature is is nature discrete or continuous i see no evidence
whatever for discreteness all the discreteness we see in the world is something which emerges from
an underlying continuum quanta are emergent they're not built into the heart of nature so there we
need discontinuity and we need continuity but continuity trumps if you like discontinuity it
is able to overarch the two and here is the vortex and there's various interesting things about the
vortex first of all if you look at a whirlpool in a stream a whirlpool is photograph or measurable
it can move stones is it in the water no it's not in the water like the stone is in the water it is
for that moment it is that water and i believe that beings including every one of you here
if you think about your nature and your being you are like this whirlpool in that you are not
distinct from whatever it is that constitutes as a sort of indigestible lump you are from something
that is already there that takes the form you take at the moment and when you go it will be passed on
and will still be part of the flow of the river so there are various things about vortex one is that
it's as the nature of a spiral as you see and spiral staircases are very important because
they are a good image of how we progress in life ts Eliot said that the end of all our
voyaging is to return to the point where we started from and know it for the first time
but that's not actually true we don't ever return we can't ever return to the point we
started from because it's gone we come back somewhere higher on the spiral and look down
at where we had been before but nonetheless the progress is in one sense circular but it's also
up and this is uh jacob's ladder as depicted by the poet and painter william blake romantic
poet and painter and it's the only jacob's ladder i know which shows it not as a straight line to
heaven but as a spiral that climbs in this way forever and this is really just to say if you
look at a spiral down its axis you see a perfect circle which is static and eternal but if you
look along the side of the spiral you see that it's actually not a particle but a waveform
and that it is extending somewhere in space it has linearity and circularity recurrence
and newness uh in one and this is just to show that in flow there is always movement which is
reciprocal that's one of the things that flow gives rise to and and these are rather interesting
these are photographs taken of the flow uh in water and what has been done is simply a
straight line of uh rectangular rods that are rectangular in cross section immersed in the
stream so absolute rigidity straight straight pieces bars in a line and what you get is this
completely wonderful creative newness which flows and changes um this is something called
the carman vortex vortex street which is created by an obstruction simply stuck into
the flow of water and it results in this amazingly beautiful form this is suggesting that
flow and the obstruction of flow are creative in my philosophy resistance to flow is as important
as flow resistance is creative without resistance nothing can happen what is friction it's what
stops movement but it's also what starts movement without friction I can't take a step so these
things come together in this way and this is from Leonardo he's showing an old man leaning on a stick
in the water and there he shows the patterns that follow which he describes as like braided hair
coming from the stick and the most beautiful ratio on which many aesthetic
figures and pictures and so on are based is the so-called golden section which is asymmetric
it has this interesting asymmetry built into it and this is just to say that each of those
rectangles is in relation to the next rectangle in the ratio of one to one point six one which
is roughly speaking that of the golden ratio and it relates to a spiral here you can see
the generation of the spiral out of it this spiral is again part of the asymmetry of nature
and they're both going forward from something but completing something at the same time
these are snowflakes they are all the random we say expression of form they are all beautifully
in one sense themselves but they are also fractal so as you go down the stem you see further
expressions which are of the overall nature of the whole snowflake and this is fractality
which is another expression of difference in unity so there is a unity and as you go down into it
and things differentiate they become more and more versions of the same thing in the way that
beautiful things often have this asymmetry built into them I mentioned the
the golden ratio but here is an example so many of them from Japanese art where there is
both symmetry and asymmetry and get this it's not just asymmetry that matters it's the asymmetry
of symmetry with asymmetry look at that in a way it's asymmetrical but in an important way it's
also asymmetrical and it's the coming together at least two opposites that creates beauty this is
very profound in beauty here here is Palladier's Villa the Villa Capra now known as the Villa Rotonda
in the region of Vicenza Padua and you see that in this in some ways very formally perfect
symmetrical facade there are little signs of of life there are these figures that this is a very
strange thing I've got hold on that these figures that are living and asymmetrical and here there
is a goat which was the family the coat of arms of the Capra family and so it has a sense of the
beautiful symmetry but complemented by asymmetry now look at this which is a copy of it basically
built at the University of Virginia by Thomas Jefferson who is a not inconsiderable architect
it's just symmetrical
I had to put that in because there's asymmetry and symmetry and the asymmetry of symmetry and
asymmetry so something about sameness and difference is very important we don't just
want difference or sameness but both together and this is from Goethe from his father Lieter
dividing the united uniting the divided is the very life of nature this is the eternal
cisteri and diasterly the eternal coalescence and separation the inhalation and exhalation of
the world in which we live and where our existence is woven and cisterly and diasterly are the two
beats of the heart cisterly is the lup and diasterly is the top of relaxation
now just to finish on physics I wanted to quote Pasteur who of course was a biologist
the universe as a whole is asymmetrical and I've come to believe that life as it is manifested
is a function of the asymmetry of the oh hello the asymmetry of the universe I would even say that
living species are primordially in their structure in their external forms functions of the cosmic
asymmetry from his inaugural lecture in 1854 at Lille and here some 40 years later is Pierre
Coulis of course a great physicist certain elements of symmetry may coexist with certain
phenomena but they're not necessary what is necessary is that certain elements of symmetry
do not exist it is asymmetry which creates the phenomenon the effects produced may be
more symmetrical than the causes and I just put this here in 1956 this Chinese lady made this
discovery of the violation of parity which means the left and right hand are not symmetrical
in the case of the weak interaction all the other forces that have been discovered were
symmetrical but then she discovered this is asymmetrical and I'm sorry to report to you that
about three or four years later two men got the Nobel Prize for this discovery
there we are now what has this got to do with the world we live in I'm going to do this very
quickly you'll be glad to know I believe that over the course of the history of the West we've
gone through phases in the Greek civilization there was a sudden efflorescence of everything
of the arts of the sciences together then in the Roman world there was something similar
and in each of those cases it tailed off over three or four hundred years and that civilization
disappeared and then again in our age there's sudden eruption of wonderful working together
of the right and left hemisphere which are both necessary for science in fact the more important
one is the right hemisphere so don't ever quote Mia saying the left hemisphere is science and the
right hemisphere is the arts we need both for both and in both cases the right hemisphere asymmetrically
is more important than the left even in science I believe that in our world like those worlds in
which I've shown in the second part of the masternismacy that things have drifted further and
further to the left hemisphere point of view it's happening to us now now if I'm right let's do the
let's do a kind of little
fantasy let's imagine that actually the left hemisphere was the only one we were listening
to what would the world look like well there'll be a loss of the broader picture knowledge would
be replaced by informations tokens or representations of true understanding wisdom wouldn't get anywhere
near it because wisdom is much too unmeasurable the product of a properly lived human life
has nothing there that the left hemisphere can get hold of can't be operationalized there'll be the
loss of the concepts therefore of skill and judgment which are essential to being a fully
functioning human being they'd all be taken over by machines that had algorithms and things like that
so we'd spend hours talking to machines and getting nowhere instead of talking to people who would
exercise skill and judgment I'd hate to live in that world and there'll be simultaneous abstraction
and reification so one of the same time things would become more and more abstract the stuff you
read would have more and more abstract nouns in it wouldn't refer to reality at the same time
matter would become just lump and matter I always say that materialists are not people who overvalue
matter but undervalue matter because matter is very very special even if you believe there is
only matter then you've got to accept that matter gave rise to Bach's and John's passion so it's
pretty amazing stuff bureaucracy would have a field day because according to Peter Berger a
great sociologist these are the characteristics of bureaucracy I'll let you read them and the
beer loss of the sense of uniqueness just categories on those things you had to fill out which box
there's never a box for me but wait a minute with whom on which day in what circumstances
you know and in what mood um quantity would become the only criteria not quality there'd be a
sort of either orness no you can't have well it might be this it might be that you've got to go
yes it's this or yes it's that um reasonableness would be replaced by pure raciocination which
is not the same thing in German there's a distinction as you know the German speakers here between
for nuns and for stamp and we don't have this distinction in English so I make the distinction
between reason which is a embodied thing that comes with experience and being able to think clearly
whereas rationalization is just the application of logical rules there'll be a failure of what we
call common sense and there's now extremely uncommon there'll be systems designed simply to
maximize utility loss of social cohesion depersonalization paranoia and lack of trust because
the left hemisphere wants to control its only power is control so if it thinks things are
slipping out of control it's starting how can I control them better we need more cameras we need
perhaps a a database yes let's have a database of the genomes of the population um there'll be a
need in other words for total control and anger and aggression would be the would be the term of
our conversations people think the bad old days used to say oh the left hemisphere is down to earth
reliable but not emotional whereas the right hemisphere is a bit given to moods you know that's
terrible but actually the emotion that most strongly lateralizes of all emotions is anger and it
lateralizes to the left hemisphere not to the right and we would you remember how when something
doesn't work oh it's nothing to do with me I can't be responsible remember that well we would be the
passive victims of other people's doings never a problem with us and in this world art would become
purely conceptual it would have a latin a sense of depth and bizarre perspectives these are things
that only the the right hemisphere can fully understand and therefore came into being three
times in Greece in Rome it wasn't just invented in Florence in 1453 it was invented serially and
then lost the civilization decayed because it's how the right hemisphere sees depth in the world
not just the screen in front of it music would reduce a little more than rhythm because that's
the only bit the left hemisphere gets the complexities of melody and harmony are interpreted
by the right hemisphere there is a distinction in professional musicians who train their brains
especially but that's the norm and language would become I hope not too much like mine diffuse
successive lacking in concrete reference there'll be a deliberate undercutting of the sense of awe
or wonder because what does that mean it just means you don't you haven't done enough research yet
of course we understand everything one more experiment and we really have got it but actually
to be fully present in the world and to understand it and to be appreciated of it with gratitude
which is the secret of a fulfilling and happy life we need to be able to rediscover the sense of awe
or wonder and flow would just become an infinite series of pieces like a goods train
there'll be discarding of all tacit forms of knowing everything having to be explicit
network of small complicated rules strangling us this is what the top field saw in America
in 1837 that was a very prescient man and we would be like Descartes proudly calling ourselves
spectators rather than actors in the world sitting on the sofa with a six-pack watching it all go by
on the telly and all this would be accompanied by a dangerously unwarranted optimism well thank
goodness we don't live in that world so this is my last words values Shaila created this pyramid of
values and I say these are the only ones that we now respect the values of utility and pleasure
all the other ones what he meant by laban sweater was courage magnanimity fidelity generosity
all of that seems to be the sort of thing that nowadays only suckers do that and other people
profit from it so why would you do that why don't just be a dog with each dog values of the intellect
geistigaveta of course you know that geist means both mind and soul these would be things like beauty
goodness and truth and platonic virtues and at the top is das heilige the holy and I believe we
have inverted this so in our left hemisphere world the holy is just a fiction that enables
certain priests to have power the values of the intellect are really just to do with sexual
selection the values of vitality as I say are those espoused by people who don't know any better
and thank god they do because we can take advantage of them and really it's all in the service of
use and pleasure well we live in an upside down world my friends this is where we are now we've
lost value we have a lust for the power to manipulate which is the left hemisphere resondage
we seem to have lost any sense of purpose because we think of purpose in the utilitarian way like
the purpose of a of a of a copy of a copying machine is to purpose the copying machine
is to produce a copy and whereas we have a purpose even with it's not a utilitarian purpose
and lastly there's a blurring of boundaries between truth and falsehood now there's a war
on truth basically all around us from politicians and from various sectors of society which is that of
of bureaucracy and AI turning everything that is living into a series of processes
and I can talk as you can well imagine for a very great deal of time about those and have
done on other occasions that I'm not going to do now thank you
