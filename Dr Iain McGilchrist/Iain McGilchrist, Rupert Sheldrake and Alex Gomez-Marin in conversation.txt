Okay, so I feel like I am the luckiest and happiest corpus callosum, separating and
reaching these two gentlemen, Ima Gilchrist and Rupert Sheldrake. I've had the honor
and pleasure to spend many hours in conversation with you two, and we're here at Rupert's
house, because we've recorded a series of conversations with Rupert and also with Ian,
the last one covering his book The Matter With Things, and so we couldn't miss this opportunity
to be the three of us, and especially you two in conversation, so I'm really glad we're doing this.
So am I. You too. So let's start with any curiosity back and forth, maybe from Rupert
about the hemisphere apotheosis, and perhaps from Ian,
about morphine resonance, and then see where we go.
All right. Well, Ian, I confess I haven't read the whole of your book, but I've read several
chapters of it, and I've watched many of your talks and so, and one thing I deduced is that it's
something to do with the two hemispheres of the brain, and that has come through quite loud and
clear in every chapter, and there are two things I'm curious about, about the hemispheres and
your chosen central terrain. One is that when people started doing these split brain operations,
they were done, I think, for epileptics mainly, weren't they? They severed the corpus callosum
that joins the two halves of the brain together, and this enabled Sperry and other scientists to
look at the lateralization of function in the two hemispheres, and they had to do very sophisticated
experiments to show this, that all that leads to this idea of differentiated function. But the
bit that interests me is that they were doing these operations on patients who had their
brain split in two, or at least all down to there were still a few connections in the basal brain,
but largely severed the connections between them, and the reason they were able to get
to do this and go on doing it was because when people went home it seemed to have solved the
seizure problem, and they seemed perfectly normal, and for me that's the most astonishing thing
of all in this research, that people who'd had their brain completely cut in two, not completely,
but largely cut in two, would co-ordinate the movements of both sides of their body,
their mouth moved co-ordinationally as they spoke, their spouses and loved ones hardly
noticed any difference, and for me that suggests either that the nervous connections to the two
halves of the brain are completely or largely unnecessary, which is very surprising, and all
that the co-ordination between the two halves of the brain, which must be there in order to walk
and speak and swim and dance and do all the normal movements of life, and I'm just talking about
motor co-ordination here, not just about, you know, the more sophisticated cognitive functions,
that then there must be still some co-ordination to the two halves of the brain, and for me that
suggests there's a kind of resonance between the two halves of the brain, resonate either
electromagnetically or through something like morphic resonance, that there's an overall
wholeness within which these two parts are co-ordinated by resonance, if they're not co-ordinated
by direct nervous connections, as one might otherwise have assumed, so for me it raises
a completely different view of how the brain may actually work, and how the two hemispheres may be
co-ordinated. So what would you think about that? I mean, why is it that severing the
connection of corpus callosum that links the two halves has so little manifest effect?
The first thing to say is that the corpus callosum, many people don't realize, is a mammalian
invention, so although reptiles, amphibians and many other creatures lower down that tree
have two centers in their brain, they're not connected in this direct way. The corpus callosum
started with the first mammals. The second thing I think that's worth reflecting on is that it's
not uncommon for people to be born with what's called colossal age genesis, in other words,
they don't have a corpus callosum, and it's often a chance finding a post-mortem.
So quite clearly, the finding that you can sever the connection and people can lead a reasonably
normal life, almost impossible really to, if casually encountered you wouldn't notice that
there was a problem. These are consonant findings and they are a bit mysterious, I agree, but what
they think they show is that, first of all, this direct connection between the hemispheres is not
the only way in which the two hemispheres can communicate. For example, they very obviously
share a body and the eyes and the senses take in both parts of the body so they know as it were,
if you like, they can sense outwardly as well as inwardly what's going on. But mostly in these cases
the operation was done in somebody who had a longish life and had got used to the coordination
of the two hemispheres. They communicate with one another through the endocrine system. There are
all sorts of ways in which they have a common internal environment and as you say, they communicate
at the level of the brainstem and even a little bit above it. So there is definitely connection there
of a kind. I don't know quite how to understand the resonance though because the immediate question
is, I mean, when you think of things resonating, you think the brain waves from this hemisphere,
are they literally resonating with the other hemisphere? I don't know of any evidence of that.
So what sort of a resonance exactly is it that they might have?
Well, I'm not sure but what I think of it, say that there was a field, a morphic field, covering
the whole brain and brain activity that included within it the activity of the two hemispheres,
then the way in which they're coordinated might be through this field, coordinating the two parts
within a larger hole and the coordination wouldn't necessarily mean that one echoes the other in a
most literal resonance way but the way in which, say, the different organs of the body or say
different atoms within a molecule are coordinated within a larger field. Now, if you take a molecule
like a very simple molecule like H2O or CO2, the atoms, the carbon and the two oxygens in carbon
dioxide are bound together by bonds but the bonds that bind them together have an electron cloud
that goes around the whole molecule. Covalently bonded molecules have a cloud of electrons
surrounding the whole molecule like a membrane around the whole molecule and the bond between
the actual individual atoms is there are shared electrons that bond them but there's a cloud,
an electron cloud around the whole thing and the vibratory patterns of carbon and oxygen within
the CO2 they have different vibratory patterns but they're coordinated together by an overall
field which influences both through its influence on their vibratory frequencies and coordinates them
and is sensitive to changes in both in a way that communicates it to the other.
Yes. Something like that, I mean this is a crude model and I haven't actually tried to work it out
in detail but some overarching field of whatever kind I mean my favorite kind of morphic fields
but some overarching organizing field in which both are parts and which coordinates the two
would seem to me to be one way of thinking about this. Well immediately of course I think of the
way in which quantum field theory suggests that the way we tend to think in terms of
little balls or particles is at most of metaphorical meaning and that what is being referred to there is
a very particular state of something that is an overall field that has energy and exerts influence
so such fields are very basic and without the idea that there is some sort of coordinating field
it's difficult to explain how a simple organism a single cell organism can detect changes and
respond to them in other parts of even that cell. I mean this is something that has been puzzled over
by many biologists and there seems to be some overall coordination and of course this
goes much further when you come to a multicellular organism and how do the various parts of
this organism know that certain things need to be responded to elsewhere in the organism look at
we know we don't at the moment have any way of understanding how this communication takes place.
Yes you see I think it even applies to physical systems like crystals I mean there's a
long-standing problem as you know with snowflakes you know Johannes Kepler wrote a monograph on the
six-sided snowflake. He did yes he was fascinated by snowflakes all these people have taken wonderful
pictures of snowflakes. Bentley is one of the great ones the classic pictures what you see with
the snowflake is they all have six sides or arms and the six arms are the same as each other I know
but each snowflake is different. So the thing is how come that they're coordinated because
you could say well the particular branch is on the thing a random to do with the immediate
environment but then you'd have to say to explain the whole snowflake being the same the every arm
of the grain snowflake was exactly the same on that snowflake and all they're all the same just
because they were in exactly the same fluctuating environment fluctuating the same way and the
next snowflake was in a completely different environment or you could say as I intriguingly
the late editor of nature Sir John Maddox no friend of mine in many ways puzzling over this
question of snowflakes said there must be some kind of internal resonance within the lattice
structure of the snowflake that enables it to be coordinated. You must be reading you possibly.
But you see there are resonances within crystal lattices there are resonant patterns and harmonics
and stuff and so say there's a coordination between these seemingly separate arms of the
snowflake which could depend on some kind of field that's over and above the individual arms.
So that's the kind of model yes and one would expect with any holistic model of organisms that
there's a field for the entire body that helps coordinate the development of the body and all
the organs within it. But this field also helps coordinate development of different parts so for
example when the fingerprint patterns are similar on right and left hands and when the right and
left hand side of the faces are similar they're not exactly the same of course but I think in
normal morphogenesis there's a kind of right-left resonance going on all the time which helps
coordinate bilaterally symmetrical structures. Now of course the brain's not exactly bilaterally
symmetrical as one of the points that we know from its anatomy as well as its function but
some overarching field that enables this to happen. That to me is why one reason I myself got interest
in split brains in a sense the opposite from your own interest which is about the differences and
I was just interested how come the coordination is still so remarkable and so integrated
that we don't experience two, most people don't experience two sub-personalities all the time
and the idea of a coordinating field that includes and both and that coordinates both would help to
explain why we don't go around it with you know right hand Rupert and left hand Rupert
one with a wonderfully integrated view of the world and the other with a kind of obsessively
literal one. Is your question perhaps rephrased by saying is there an organizing principle that
unites the master and his emissary or can the master do it on its own? No I think well one way
of thinking about what you're talking about is that just as in the developing organism there needs
to be differentiation so that on one part side of the body there'll be a liver on the other
spleen and so on. These things are also part of a single overarching field if you like and the brain
could be seen as similarly asymmetrical but part of a note that asymmetry is already part of a
single field. I think you must have been reading McGilchrist actually because of course I have
have wonderful images of snowflakes actually and talk about exactly this issue which also
occurs in deer antlers for example. Deer antlers have a particular form peculiar to that deer if
you cut them off they regenerate exactly according to that pattern but where this pattern is stored
is not known and so overall we have problems that are generally neglected because they're difficult
to answer but as soon as you start thinking about it in a more inquiring way which I would have thought
was the point of science, that's a difficult question. How is it that these things have this
overall cohesion? I mean no for example you know in the brain I forget the exact figure but it's
something staggering like 500,000 neurons are generated every minute in the in the business
of gestation in the womb and all those neurons have to end up precisely in the right place
in the brain and the brain has minute architectural where exactly is this information
stored about the three-dimensional structure alone of the brain? I don't think it can be
even encoded in simple linear code in the sense that we think of code of course we've now
dropped the idea that it's a taller linear code in the way the computer is coded but instead
must be a three-dimensional code and so we know about the conformation in epigenetics of different
of the genes involved but nonetheless where is this you don't see anywhere in that this
intricate three-dimensional structure stored and the simplest thing I can imagine is that there is
some overarching field. Can I just add a couple of other amusing or interesting things? I mean
one is the striking fact that people who are born without limbs nonetheless have the sense of the
limbs they've never had them but nonetheless they they have an internal sense of those limbs
and Ramachandra describes a woman who had no limb no upper limbs having phantom limbs which she
couldn't stop gesticulating when she talked so this part of evolutionary history that the hand
movements are coordinated with speech was there in her although she had never experienced hands or
arms. The other thing which is raised by F. S. Schiller the Victorian philosopher Oxford philosopher
which is a very good point is we know of course that when people have damage to one part of the
brain other parts of the brain can take over the function but how is this coordinated how does one
part of the brain that's supposedly doing whatever it does know we need speech how are we going to
get it back I mean in a way there's a there's a need for something overarching to draw out that
function in a new place in the brain. Well of course my own starting point for my ideas on
morphic resonance was morphogenetic fields form shaping fields and I started my scientific career
working on plant development yes and how is it that leaves and flowers and and stem ends and so on
develop and the idea of morphogenetic fields first put forward in 1920s was exactly that of a
co-ordinating field that that brings forth these patterns and underlies regeneration and so for
example in the regeneration of salamander eyes so-called a wolfian regeneration you cut out
the lens of the eye of a noot or a salamander and it will regenerate a new lens from the edge of the
iris which is not how the lens forms in the embryo it forms by folding in the skin from the
outside so there's a completely filling a missing structure by modifying some other structure would
never normally be modified exactly to create to fill that function so and this all this similar
kind of coordination applies in social insects if you remove some of the workers or remove some of
the soldiers or remove some of the hive or something the whole system we adjust some of
they stop they stop doing what they're doing some of them take on different functions and roles
so these co-ordinating fields I think underlie all of biology actually all of nature of self
organizing systems and phantom limbs are particularly interesting because I think in a phantom limb
the phantom is the field of the limb which is experienced from within
but which doesn't have a material structure associated with it and as you may know one of
the experiments that I proposed in my book seven experiments that could change the world
is on detecting phantom limbs I recruit amputees through veterans organizations
tried recruiting them through hospitals but they were extremely uncooperative
but and then I have the phantom amputee but they push their phantom arm through one of six
positions in a barrier a door for example and on the other side that's done in a randomized
sequence on the other side I have people who do subtle energy medicine Reiki helos and so on
and one at a time I lead them in I say one of those panels has a phantom arm sticking through it
and the others don't which has got the phantom and they sort of feel in the different places
and they say that one and they are right more than chance so far substantially more than chance
so the main objection I've had to this is well how do you know it's not just telepathy
I think if we've moved if the skeptical argument says it must be telepathy and we've moved
beautiful yes yes but then as a test for that I haven't done this yet but the control the telepathy
controllers you asked them to imagine pushing their phantom arm through yes or you asked them to
extend their phantom arm the step back a yard or two to start with and extend it so it doesn't
actually go through the door and so that would be another control yes now these experiments are
not expensive and in fact they're free yes but the so I think that actually this whole question
can be taken much further yes it's this is not the kind of thing people do in in labs at the moment
but they could but I before we leave the subject of the split the divided brain and and all that
I have a more probably a simpler easy to answer question you could probably refer me to page
3027 in your magnum office which is I'm a pianist and and so obviously playing the piano involves
coordinating the right and the left hand and the left hand which which mainly does the rhythmic
section as well is clearly controlled by the right brain yes and and the right hand which
does the sort of melody and all the rest is by the left brain yes and in playing the piano these
are coordinated yeah and how does this map on to your interpretation I'm sure it maps wonderfully
well but I just love to know how well one of the mysteries is that music is abnormally lateralized
in the brain of performers so in the general population who are not professional musicians
or full-time musicians the only bit of music that is really understood or or interpreted by the
left hemisphere is rhythm and melody and harmony are almost exclusively understood and experienced
in the right hemisphere so that seems on the face of it very different from what you're describing
and one of the things one of the things is that for most instruments the two hands need to be
coordinated for all these activities and so when you look at professional musicians what I've just
described is not the case so they have developed a left hemisphere which is also capable of
understanding melody and harmony and the right hemisphere already actually understands rhythm
anyway in fact complex rhythms in the ordinary person are understood by the right hemisphere
not by the left it's only simple rhythms the left can get and the sort of thing that I constantly
hear everywhere I go blaring out of cars on speakers in shops and so on which is just boom boom boom
that is the left hemisphere speaking but I think what you're describing is is an effort
for coordination which actually modifies the brain I see because you see I thought on the basic
I mean my understanding of McGillchrist 101 was that actually the right and left hand
should be reversed and there's no reason why in when the development of piano playing took place
the keyboards shouldn't have been the other way around but the deep notes at the top yes well
yes with the keyboard reverse so you play the with the left hemisphere the right hand would do the
rhythm and the left hand would do I mean it could have been exactly the mirror image of the way it
is now there's nothing in the technology that says it has to be that way around it's quite right
I never really thought about that I think that you'd have to have had not just a reversal
of you'd have to have had the higher notes on the left hands part of the scale yes that's right
the thing is that in the brain there are certain things that are positionally it seems like for
example the sequence from left to right in which things grow is is is innate in for example chicks
they tend to see that thing a series of numbers grows as you move towards the right which is the
way in which we see from one to itself and so we start from lower to higher and it may be that this
is also the way in which it seems fundamentally that the lower notes are basic they are the base
and that the other is what is built more complexly on top of it and so it may be
natural that an instrument developed in this way but I haven't studied all instruments around the
world to see whether or not if there's a project for somebody with nothing else to do well look
at Islamic music you see because they read from right to left yes and so their whole way is sense
of the way things develop yes you start at the back of the book by our criteria and you you read
from right to left is the exact opposite of course if if if pianos had first been developed in the
canaphe to in Baghdad or somewhere perhaps the the upper part of the keyboard would have been
the lower notes and the rhythm section and and it would have might have been a mirror image of
existing pianos it's a hypothetical but some research anthropological search would be interesting
yes I don't know why why it's ended up that way in brief but that is the way it is and it's also
true of course of all instruments I don't know of any instruments that are just played with one
hand I mean it's one of the things we do even with sort of playing a flute playing a violin
both hands have to be coordinated at least in western music that is a almost a society quite
known so and that the hands have to work together in this way and the brain is modified in those
who do it so that it can't I wonder how much learning the piano you see I started learning
piano was as five I come from a musical family yes and my son Merlin learned at five because
of who started learning at four and that means from a very early age I and they and lots and
lots of other people yes have actually been using brains in a way that would be somewhat
counterintuitive if they read McGilchrist first and so so this is does this affect the actual
development of people do people who learn the piano or other instruments in early age
develop differently I mean professional musicians you've said are noticeably different but what about
amateur musicians who play every day so well of course the distinction is not between amateur and
professional but between people who are constantly playing and those who are only occasionally playing
yes and so I don't think there's a problem with that and but I would imagine that starting
early to learn an instrument like this will modify certainly we know in respect of the
appreciation of sound but it does modify the brain and I don't see why it should not modify
the brain in other ways you and your two sons have interesting brains that work
perhaps slightly differently from the standard Western brain
yes yes well that's a really interesting possibility isn't it and I don't know if anybody's done
more tests on on professional pianists or you know I don't know of any no well it would be a good
research area from the point of view of brain naturalization wouldn't it absolutely work but I
have seen reports saying the people who learn the piano or other instruments have a different way in
which they think and stuff okay I but it would be an obvious thing to do because this involves a
close coordination of the two hemispheres in a way that yes I mean we need it in every physical
activity walking running jumping sports skills presumably you know playing cricket playing
football etc right and left feet presumably all these physical skills involve coordination
of hemispheres well they do but the difference is that the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere
and motor performance of each control the other and there's not the you know there's the distinction
that there is between melody harmony and rhythm if you see what I mean yes so music introduces
a whole different aspect yes there's there's no reason to suppose that we should be discoordinated
when removed and animals that have no corpus callosum are perfectly well coordinated you know
this question of yours could be scaled up to in asking how could we nurture young brains so that
they have an easier time to grasp the world as you've proposed in your book or another way to put it
would be how to nurture the rupers and eons of the future which is something I'm very concerned
with and what can we do to facilitate those intuitions that you both have been pursuing in
different ways but but scientifically and and beyond you know if you have some thoughts on that
well one thought one thought I have that seems relevant is that I think that
um to the extent that what you're asking for is people who think more flexibly
and there is a problem with dogma in both in philosophy and in science it's a natural tendency
for things to ossify to fix prematurely and not allow evolution it's natural for thought to evolve
and to do this it has to be creative and the best kinds of thinking that will allow this
are those in which analytic acumen is there but coupled with rather like the left hand the right
hand coupled with a more imaginative and intuitive way of thinking and I describe the the insights of
many scientists and mathematicians and it's quite extraordinary how virtually all of them
describe this so-called aha moment as being the creative thing that reveals the new gestalt
and this aha moment is robustly associated with the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus of the
right hemisphere so we know that this is right hemisphere mediated and the trouble with our
education now is that it's very much technically oriented more and more we're saying what's the
point in teaching people unless it's teaching them some mechanical skill that will be useful to them
but in fact the point of an education is to draw out of us our humanity and humanity used to be
part of what we discussed in school the humanities and I think that a greater emphasis on music on
poetry which also involves very largely the right hemisphere whereas ordinary
discursive language is probably more dependent on the left hemisphere than on both
that these ways of thinking should be part of the way we educate children what do you say Rupert
yes well I think the there are some forms of education like sports physical skills crafts
which are part of education I mean they're always being squeezed out by the sense on more
science more literacy more language more learning and yes I think training well training other
skills like intuitive abilities and emotional intelligence all these things they seem to
be really important but we've got a system of education which is designed for well basically
it follows from kind of Victorian design doesn't it of preparing people for life in an industrial
society one thing is to make children used to getting up and showing up for school at nine
o'clock in the morning and fixed hours I mean which you need in industrial societies you do
disciplining from an early age and I think a lot of it's about that I think that's very important
myself which is important but it's it's it's not primarily about creativity and obviously actually
for most people I don't think creativity is that I don't think we necessarily need to have creativity
built into the entire educational system because it's a major disadvantage it's a disadvantage
for a lot of people to be creative I mean if you've got a regular job and you're creative
you're going to have an awfully difficult time and you there's most jobs require a lack of
creativity yes and you know I went into the the science a scientific career believing that the
importance of science was to be original and creative and I soon discovered there's every
obstacle to to doing that um you know I've I've found whenever I'm trying to be or am being or
you know doing something that seems to me original and creative instead of people saying how wonderful
I mean the vast majority of people say rubbish nonsense where's the evidence etc and if you
have the evidence and you do an experiment you think is creative as well you've got these results
but where's the theory you know and you know so and as as Alex sometimes says you know one of
the responses I get to my research on telepathy and things like that is you know it's all very
well in practice but does it work in theory yes no I so actually originality is a major
disadvantage for a lot of people well it may be but it depends what we mean by an education
if we mean simply preparing people for routine jobs then we're limiting their potential and we're
prescribing what is valued in society whereas if we were to encourage some people definitely need
their originality um enhancing or not even enhancing but liberating I think it's there
in a lot of people but it does need disciplining as well this is why I see that both parts are
important I think that modern education both lacks discipline and lacks originality it's about
sticking information into people inefficiently and then hoping they can regurgitate it later
but that's not an education at all an education that is about enabling something that is innate
to to to grow but that growth also if you like needs of a formal field in which to grow and that
should be provided by good teachers and was I hope for you and certainly was for me by
highly disciplined intellectually acute but also imaginatively inspired teachers from whom I learned
you know this was extraordinarily important now I was very lucky too with my teachers at school
and at university yes but I I mean what I want to emphasize is it's not about letting it all
hang out I mean it was an enormous amount of discipline you know at an early age one had to
know trigonometry and calculus one had to be able to understand greek grammar and that and all these
things and and these are difficult I mean there are all things that you get by sort of going oh
well whatever I mean they really require serious application so one does need that structure
and I'm you know I believe that in the learning a skill and you talked about that and I think you
you know and you're talking about manual skills largely I think they're very important crafts
and skills but to begin with you have to do rather laborious copying of things but then
you're in the position to be able to go further than that but you need that first element to be
there before you can go further I mean I didn't write this book out of not knowing anything about
neuroscience or years of hard work involved yeah and your work it also involves years of hard work
I know it's that commute from right to left to right that you mentioned yes it needs to go from
right to left and back to right by which I mean that one's first apprehension of something is
is a perceptive and imaginative understanding and then one needs to as it will learn more by
the process of analysis and seeing the structure of what one's doing and making comparisons and
putting things together in a certain way but that they must never stop there that is an
intermediary phase and then it needs to be reintegrated into a new hole in which those
that laborious analysis has been not lost because that suggests that it was pointless but it had
its point at a certain period in time what your discussion reminds me of the simple organisms
I used to study E. coli how they navigate the world okay it's like learning to tumble and
learning to run they need to run and tumble so in a way a certain dose of dogmatism is needed
to just keep on going for some for some while because it would stop at every point to make
and see there you would get nowhere but if you don't stop and tumble then you just you also go
nowhere so it's it's this balance in a way it's very interesting and of course science needs
to balance its openness to change and newness and its willingness to stick to certain things
unless there's a good reason for moving on otherwise it would be changing its mind about
everything all the time so as everything in life is a matter of balancing things and coming to a
position which honors and respects and enhances by integrating the two things that we think
are separate in some way but they're not really separate now I agree now let's not make of your
particular biographies as a friend of mine says a universal category but I'd like to hear a bit
about your own paths because it's clear that you've gone through the margins or the edge you could
even say cutting edge you haven't followed the prescribed path at your risk and just you've
succeeded and that's why maybe we don't have your other people who didn't make it but you've
you've made it and in a way your paths are similar in that respect and what does that tell us as a
model or what it doesn't tell us as a model for other people well I mean I suppose we're both
feral academics and we were both fellows of colleges at Oxford me at Cambridge and we somehow
escaped from domestication and lived in the wild as much in the wild as you I mean you were treated
the fastness is Western Isles I'm merely on the edge of Hampstead Heath
but I find I didn't know if you do very often now and I didn't think this was always the case
but very often now the really interesting ideas are coming forth from places that are not in the
middle of the mainstream they're coming from people who are working on their own or working in
small groups and these are producing highly interesting and imaginative propositions whereas
in the mainstream there's far too much emphasis on not stepping out of line not rocking the boat
not if you say something that isn't what what your colleagues are saying when you won't get promoted
you won't get a grant and all the rest so it must be deadening actually living like that and I'm
just not prepared to live like that and I don't expect you were right no no um but it does I mean
it's not a career path one can recommend to other people because it's not very easy to survive
outside the framework of regular salaries yeah Alex is a uniquely privileged being Spanish
in a way that we can't be being British yes because being a scientist in Spain is to be
part of the civil service and once you've got tenure as he has then you've got it for life
and so he can do what he likes so he's in the uniquely privileged position of having an actual
salary which neither or you or I have had for a very long time and the freedom to be inquiring
into all these things and talking to you and me and investigating all sorts of areas of science
with a remarkable freedom two caveats here one is once you got tenure yes yes yes and what has
happened to those who didn't get it yes and were yes perhaps more valuable and also those who got it
how the whole process has shaped their minds that's one thing and the second paradox is I have many
colleagues who got tenure but they they continue I mean probably they some of them may want to
continue doing what they're doing but even having tenure like some people say I'll wait until I retire
and then I'll write that book or I pull out that idea and perhaps that's also a good idea to do it
later but maybe it's too late I don't know maybe it's too late often so it doesn't go
well you need to get to tenure and even if you get there it's no guarantee for anything of that
no I doesn't guarantee people or take you seriously I mean even you know I used to think that people
who got the Nobel Prize would have enough confidence to do and say what they think and would be taken
seriously but actually even the Nobel Prize is no guarantee Brian Josephson for example at Cambridge
well as soon as he got interest in psychic phenomena and the nature of consciousness
although he's a professor with tenure as a Nobel laureate a fellow of Trinity College
you know his colleagues make sure he doesn't get students and that he's marginalized etc
because his views are untenable in their eyes so so even the Nobel Prize and tenure
doesn't it may guarantee a certain freedom of maneuver but it doesn't guarantee that
what one does will have much influence the influence is perhaps another matter but I
haven't found that I mean largely being in the mainstream race of my life has impeded me
I mean because I was you know I was a fellow of Knoxford College and I became a
psychiatrist and director at the Bethelman Morsley Hospital in London which is of all the
institutions of mental health one of the most you know central in the world but you know and I
was salaried but of course there was freedom to to use what one saw and think in another way and I
think it's open to more people than one thinks they don't have to go out completely on a limb
but if you look at what you experience and think about it in a deeper broader context
you see something different and I just think that an awful lot of people see what they're doing in
science as sort of self-evident and not not not raising further questions is it's a rather
unusual kind of mind that that asks the question so why does it actually do that why does it work
like that and and I know have found one of the best books on this topic is Erwin Chargaff's
autobiography Heraklite and Fire and you know he was a very great honored biochemist at Yale who
laid the groundwork for Crick and Watson and so on the author of Chargaff's Rules but he writes
brilliantly and with enormous imagination about what he sees science to be and he contrasts it with
this extremely deadening simple following out of linear paths I think it's partly a result of the
massive expansion and professionalization of science I mean so he would say World War yeah
it becomes a career path yes it was a struggle in the 19th century a lot of scientists in Britain
were either amateurs like Charles Darwin yes he had an academic job Faraday was at the Royal
Institution not in the university in a rather eccentric small institution yes and so but when
it became professionalized something that T. H. Huxley was one of the drivers of in Britain you
know to make science a professional like a priesthood where only people who got the right degrees
and qualifications could teach it and influence people through universities the school system and
what was taught in schools and all that was professionalized and then you've got to have
the right qualifications his aim was to squeeze out country vicos who did wonderful natural history
they did who believed in God he thought no one in science should believe in God or if they did
it should be kept at least very much their private life you've got to have two priests
no that's right you you you have one priesthood and then this model of scientists as priests then
spread to you know in the Soviet Union scientists were the highest rank of the intellectuals and
all that kind of thing and so it became all over the world you know in countries like India and
China engineers and scientists of very very high prestige they're not terribly high prestige in
Britain because they're regarded as boffins and geeks and things and you know the highest prestige
goes to people who've been to Eaton and Oxford and who belong to the Bollinger Club and become
conservative prime ministers at least for a while they don't know that the person you're
referring to currently enjoys great esteem in the country no no it's only temporary it shows these
things are always temporary but still the point is that in Britain scientists have never commanded
I mean Newton's being venerated and Darwin's being venerated and so on but it's never been like
there's quite the priesthood level that it achieves in many other countries but nevertheless it's
the idea is of a kind of priesthood and then you've got then all the ranks of those sort of
deacons and sub-deacons and stuff it becomes a whole professional thing then it becomes a career
and when I lived in India it was I worked with Indian scientists I was an Indian
international scientific institute most of my Indian scientific colleagues had not
gone into science because of a deep curiosity about nature they'd gone into it because their
parents believed in education and science and medicine and engineering were the three top careers
and and so any bright children had been pushed into that and pushed in their studies and pushed
through the university and then they they got jobs in high prestige institutions if they worked
hard enough and their whole social status and the ability to marry off their daughters to
more prestigious husbands in an arranged marriage system it moved them up the social scale instead
it wasn't at all about curiosity for most of them and I think for many scientists in today here in
Britain it's not primarily about deep curiosity about nature it's about being a functionary within
a system well as Whitehead said this divorce between science and philosophy is has been
concessional to both and I think that science properly understood is a is a form of philosophy
it's an investigation of philosophy in certain particular empirical methods but it has philosophical
implications and it draws on philosophical principles at its outset it may not understand
that it does that yes but that's more dangerous when people don't realize what it is they're doing
they don't do it well but I think that you know we need to get back to the understanding that
science is has philosophical meaning and that this is not enough discussed so one needs philosophically
minded scientists and scientifically minded philosophers philosophers who are willing to
you know spend time learning about the science that will give them insights into the forming of
their philosophy well I mean here in Britain the word science wasn't introduced until the 19th
century and before that it was called natural philosophy and you know Newton's great book
Principia Mathematica the natural mathematical principles of natural philosophy so I think
that natural philosophy is actually a really good word and for it I'm a member of the main
Cambridge University Scientific Society which is called the Cambridge Philosophical Society
because when it was started in the early 19th century it was called natural philosophies Cambridge
I subscribe to biological reviews which was on the main review journals in biology the
subtitles of the Cambridge Philosophical Society yeah um so I think natural philosophy is what you
are I'd like to think is what I and Alex are too and I think the probably most people who listen to
us are natural philosophers and and it's so in a sense it's a matter of recovering
what was the root of what we now call science before it was hijacked by you know this professionalization
movement and this creation of this priesthood and and making it an exclusive professional
organization that you that you have to obey the rules of one of the things I feel about the age
we live in is the predominance of the administrative or bureaucratic mind over almost every aspect of
our lives and I think this is deeply damaging and I think it's an exhibition of the left hemisphere's
way of both trying to understand but misunderstanding what it's dealing with and above all to control
and I think that what has happened is that yes I understand the analogy with the church but
the what has really happened is that something much less glamorous has happened in science
which is simply that it's become a huge bureaucracy it has money to spend which it which follows
people who tow the party line do more of what everyone else is doing and it's very difficult
in this sclerotic hierarchy as it would be in the middle of an enormous Byzantine civil service
to be able to break out and see something else or do something else so I think the future will
depend on the development of small private colleges where people are very much you take in only the
brightest people I think that's very important we're we're sort of worried by the concept of
elitism but looked at another way education depends on and our future depends on people
who have the capacity to think clearly and to think imaginatively being encouraged and that's
what a good college should be doing in my view and so I think it's from those small institutions
which are beginning to spring up in competition with the with the great universities that the
future will flourish and I'm sorry about that because I have a great allegiance for the enormously
interesting and valuable history of our great institutions I'm very sorry to say this but
they're beginning to turn themselves into something that can be easily dispensed with
how to prevent those institutions from following the same path and also how to solve the accreditation
problem there because in a way that I wanted to ask you both this very question like you have
navigated outside the institutional seas but nevertheless there's some appreciation for
institutions still in both of you and so how much of it can we still embrace and how much
we need to just reject so this is back to the future these future scientists and philosophers
are they going to be in institutions and if they're not how is the new order or the new
business going to be in terms of accreditation and and so on it's like it's like designing a
new Atlantis a new new Atlantis you know what's the new new Atlantis 400 years later
well I don't have a crystal ball I don't know but but I think that what you say
in the sense that there needs to be an institution but it may not be these institutions I think is
right I mean everything evolves and evolution is partly that things have their proper period and
that the great universities Oxford and Cambious for example you know have a thousand year history
they're currently committing suicide in my view by not sticking to their guns and and so this means
that other institutions will spring up because there's a natural need to nourish those who will
benefit from being given freedom and discipline together and the time to fulfill these things
I let me tell you tell you something about my own experience which which which will sound horribly
you know I don't know unusual but I got this fellowship at 21 of all souls and I was to
embark on a doctorate on 18th century English literature and this fellowship was a seven
year fellowship after examination there's this strange thing that doesn't have any equivalent
at Cambridge or anywhere else in Oxford of a college that consists only of fellows not of any
students graduate or otherwise and when you become a fellow after examination which is a three-day
examination if you become one you get seven years in which to do whatever it is that interests you
intellectually and Derek Parfit a very well-known philosopher said to me don't do your doctorate
anybody can do a doctorate that's part of the sort of machinery but you've been given something
completely extraordinary which is seven years in which you can pursue ideas and I thought he was
absolutely right and at the time I followed all kinds of interests in science in other languages
in literature in philosophy and at the time I thought you know this is wonderful but I didn't
realize until much later in my life why it had been so important and I'm not sure that even
I don't know enough I mustn't speak about what I'm not certain of but I think that the
the ethos of all souls is rather changed as everything does and there's more of that you
know we must keep an eye on what he's reading and has he published a paper and all that but I was free
of that and and later in life I thought well what did I make of that and to me the answer came with
the publication of these books because I couldn't possibly have written them unless I'd been allowed
to range wild as you say over but I did it within an institution over the fields of things from
which I drew the bigger picture I've tried to express in these books which can only be done
if you've had the ability to range so this business of range which is exactly the opposite
of the tendency towards ever greater specialism is very very important and I think that more
institutions ought to follow what happened in the 60s which was you know institutions used to
take people that had proved themselves to be intelligent and give them carte blanche and
they gave them an office gave them a you know an income for a few years and then said follow your
instincts you know what what you find interesting and out of that came many many inventions
well I had a very similar period of freedom to you and actually I feel enormously grateful for
it and I had two periods of freedom and first of all when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge I
became increasingly disenchanted with mechanistic science which I was studying I started reading
Goethe and I had the idea of a holistic science and I just everyone assumed I'd go on and do a phd
because I got a double first you know but I wasn't sure if I wanted to I mean I liked science but I
didn't like killing animals all the time and I didn't like the trunk treating them as machines and
the whole attitude of mechanistic science so I found there was this fellowship at Harvard that was
open to people from Cambridge for a year in the graduate school I applied for and I got it and
when I got to Harvard to do history and philosophy of science to step back to see the bigger picture
that's what I wanted to do I found that they treat graduate students at Harvard in a way I hadn't
been treated and I since I was about 15 read these pages this week read those and we'll test you to
make sure you've read it was spoon feeding there was no freedom I tried doing what they said
after about a month I just couldn't do I mean you'd have to stay up till midnight every night to
read all this stuff and they tested me there's no time to read anything else to study anything else
that interested you it was completely on her own a track but so I went to see the professor of history
of science who was in charge of me and I said look I love being here at Harvard and I'm really
interested in these subjects this isn't the way I learned and this isn't the way I work and I don't
really need a master's degree from Harvard because I can buy one from Cambridge it's only five pounds
you know in those days you could all you had to stay alive for three and a third years and pay
five pounds and you've got a master's degree yes you've got a bachelor's so presumably you bought
yours yes it came to me automatically I don't think I had to pay oh yes I had to pay five pounds
so I said to the professor I just don't need your master's degree and he said are you sure and he
said there's a Harvard master's degree and I said well I'm quite sure I'll get a Cambridge one and
I said is there any way I can just be here for a year and be part of the university and not do all
these exams and tests and things I said I think that would be much more useful and valuable for me
he said well actually we do have a rarely used provision called special students and he said
but you know and I said well can you make me one and he said well I'd have to talk to the
committee and stuff so anyway I got him to register they agreed and I was registered as a special
student so I was there in the graduate school at Harvard I was doing a bit of teaching to earn a
bit of money in the natural sciences program in biology labs in biology 101 I was teaching lab
classes but otherwise apart from my obligation to do that I had complete freedom I went to
lectures in history of art and philosophy and classics in history and I had the entire I got
the university catalog and I went through the list of lectures every week and and I did a lot of
philosophy in history of science but I had an entire university at my disposal and you know and
whenever I was doing exams I just caught the train to New York and had fun in New York for a few
days so I was the most blissful way of being at a university and then later when I got my fellowship
at Clare College in Cambridge it started as a research fellowship and it was a I had a six
year research fellowship where my teaching load was limited to six hours a week of tutorials and
since in Cambridge like Oxford the vacations last six and a half months a year this is only six
hours a week for five and a half months a year and actually less than that because half a month is
exams so it was not exactly an onerous teaching burden it was the nicest form of teaching to
students at a time informally in tutorials and the rest of the time I was completely free I
didn't even I don't think I even wrote annual reports then I got a research fellowship from
the Ross site and I did have to write a one-page annual report but I was completely free in what
I inquired into and when I said to the college you know I just got this thing from the Ross
Society about the Tropical Research Grant and I'm going off to the University of Malaya for a year
to study rainforest plants and traveling through India on the way they said well fine you know
so I it was incredible period for me laid the foundation for everything I've done since so
like you I was given an extraordinary freedom within an institutional framework which was
vastly valuable now very very few people have that opportunity absolutely and you know what I
want to emphasize is I like like you I think it's very important like you I feel very grateful
for having been given it my worry is that it won't be given in the future to many people
but I think it's important we live in an era of micro management and I think micro management
produces only mediocrity if you're constantly controlling and dictating what people read and
think you'll only get mediocrity yes and that if you give people a degree of freedom okay there's
a risk that they will abuse it and they won't come up with something but it's it's a much smaller
risk than the risk of micro managing them which ensures that they will never come up with anything
interesting so you actually have to in a way trust and give time to to people to explore things that
are of interest to them otherwise it's the death of the life of the mind it's for this reason that so
many as we both know in in the past so much of the science of the 18th and 19th century and even
into the 20th century comes from the work of of priests or of vickers of monks I mean Mendel
was a monk yes they weren't part of any particular mainstream but they they had the security of a
place and they were allowed to think and observe and ask interesting questions why do people
aren't working this way well I think one simple way this could be achieved at the strike for Penn
is is simply changing the name of unemployment benefit to research grants
so then we could have lots and lots of people on research grants and the stigma of being
unemployment would be transformed at least for some people yes very nice because we
after all have a lot of people who are economically idle as it were in the classification yes yes
who are actually being paid by the state yes and so much of that could be repurposed I mean
mostly people are disempowered by being unemployed yes but if this could be seen as a as a positive
thing and also take on and also another idea that it's any academics really that have sabbatical
years which is supposed to be a year in which you can enjoy the kind of freedom we're talking about
to be refreshed and and and so on and so another scheme would be to make sabbatical years optional
for everybody so when you're 40 or 50 or 60 or something you could take an optional sabbatical
year and you kind of take a cutting income you have to take leave from your regular job
and you get the unemployment benefit which would now be redesignated a research grant or a sabbatical
grant it wouldn't cost the state anymore because they're paying lots of people not to work anyway
and by empowering people who are not working in regular jobs to think of themselves as doing
something different I mean it could be voluntary work it could be natural history
it could be scientific research it could be there could be small grants for people on sabbaticals
to set up experiments in their garages and and stuff I mean there could be it could fuel a whole
wealth of invention throughout the population I'm sure you were right almost no extra cost and one
thing I've known from experience is that in the few cases where I've learned a practical skill
that it has been enormously satisfying probably more satisfying than almost anything else
and so encouraging people not just to feel demoralized and not have any goal it might be
better to allow people to train to develop a skill which which is a very life-enhancing thing and
useful to society yes there's not enough skilled labor ones always looking for people who can do
this or that or the other and maybe that should be part of the the scheme as well
there's already government schemes you know for people in areas deprived areas okay economically
for training there's already retraining grants yes but if those I mean I haven't looked into how
they're administered but I imagine that that if one got into the details of existing bureaucracy
and existing grant structures some of it could be repurposed and or re-visioned in a way that's
along the lines you're suggesting I mean some of it's intended for that yes yes and and so I think
there's within the present system there's probably quite a lot of potential for revisioning
these what people can learn and do so drawing things together perhaps I mean there's a need to
to break out of the straight jacket of you know these people are unemployed and therefore
just waiting to get back into this horrible machine there's life outside the machine there
are other things that can be developed for all of us depending on what is what is both practical
for us and and enjoyable for us to develop and it's about abandoning this micromanaging
administrative approach to education to science and allowing people to develop the skills that
they have innately in other words education should be a matter of growing things not inserting
things and at the moment it's mainly about inserting things but it's interesting you see
one of the things that's happening at the moment is the so-called skills shortage or employment
shortage that there's you know I read an article just yesterday there's the mystery of why that we
have low very low unemployment at the break at the moment in Britain and yet you can't get people
to do jobs but but there's large numbers of people who are economically inactive yes and so
most people in Britain assume the skills shortage or labour shortage is because of brexit
no immigration from Europe but um there's a very similar when we were in Canada in the summer
they have the same situation there in western Canada it's the same in the United States it's
same and what seems to have happened is a large number of people have just voluntarily retired
from the labour force before retirement age simply can't be bothered to have a job and that must
mean a drop in income but there's millions of people prepared to take that rather than carry on
yes well what that tells you is a lot of people's jobs are very unrewarding yes and and I think what's
really sad is that jobs that are in the past obviously rewarding like being a teacher or a
doctor I think people are probably not keen to we know there's a shortage of doctors there's a
shortage of teachers and I think that's partly to do with the way again a management culture
has taken over from a professional culture and the individual is no longer allowed to pursue
interests and it's entirely micromanaged like the Harvard thing today you read these things and
tomorrow you read those so we need to stop this and it was a wonderful moment of creativity early
on in the COVID crisis when managers couldn't keep up with the situation and doctors said well
the hell with it we're going to do what we think will work and lots of things were experimented
with and some of them were successful and some of them not but this is a good situation is one in
which doctors use their experience are not told what to do by a manager who has no experience
and in closing it's not the same as teachers yeah important we talk about it but again let me say
both of you are examples that this can be done so I think it's useful again to have the discussion
but to show that they're living examples and it's not easy but it's it can be done and hopefully
more people in the future will I hope so yes be able to we've been very fortunate yes very fortunate
yeah both within and outside institutions exactly yeah all right good thank you very much well thank
you enix thank you enix
