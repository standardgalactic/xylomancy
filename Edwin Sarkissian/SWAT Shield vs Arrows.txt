I figured if I put a puppy in the video, I'll get more thumbs up and more likes.
Oh, yeah, for sure.
So hello to Kobe.
It's Jasperito's dog. How cute is it? Right Jasperito?
Yes.
Not super aggressive, very mellow like you, but we'll do for now.
Okay, as you guys know, on this channel we've done a lot of videos including crossbows, arrows, bows, traditional bows,
and also shields, lots of shields, different kinds from different part of the world and
also a lot of riot shields.
And that's why today's video is sponsored by Rise of Kingdoms.
Rise of Kingdom lets you choose from 11 different civilizations such as Rome and Ottoman Empire.
I personally chose in Britain as they use longbowmen as it's sort of like using a rifle because they're long range.
This game also features a massive seamless map that's always moving in real time.
Right now I'm gathering some resources, but look right over there.
It looks like the Roman base is wide open.
Roman troops use swords and shields.
So let's see how they stand up against long range bows.
To be safe, I can even send some troops to the back line.
So it looks like long range wins this battle.
I can even share the resources I want with the Alliance to help them get stronger as well.
What did you say? What? You can't wait to go download the game?
Okay, okay.
Kobe said if you want to join in on the fun, please click the link below to download Rise of Kingdoms.
It will mean a lot to us to show your support since they are supporting us.
Rise of Kingdom is also going to be doing a giveaway for AR500 armored backpacks.
So check the link below for that giveaway as well.
What are you going to do if they don't download the game?
Go bark at their house?
You better download.
You ready to go play?
You want to go play?
Let's go play.
We have shot the shield with several rounds.
It's a 3A shield.
This is what SWAT unit uses and SWAT team and it can stop all the way up to 44 magnum.
And it did stop all the way to 44 magnum.
I think even a 50AE if I'm not mistaken.
You'll see some of the bulging here on the surface.
It has a pad over here.
This was actually sent to us by RTS Tactical.
Thanks to them for sending it.
It's about a half inch thick.
Okay, Jasper, are you ready?
I'm ready.
I'm going to use a traditional bow.
It has a practice tip.
So Jasper, let's go back and shoot this thing.
See what happens.
What do you think is going to happen?
I'm going to go through or no?
No, no, no with this one.
Why are you going so far back?
It's not a gun.
Cabron anyway.
These things fly back.
Yeah, for sure.
Come this way.
No, I'm okay.
I don't think it's going to come back.
I don't know.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Okay.
Stuck.
Okay, so it's stuck, but it did not penetrate.
You see that, Jasper?
Yeah, yes.
It did not come out from the back.
I can probably just hit it and pull it back.
Here we go.
Comes falls right out.
It did not go through this Kevlar ballistic shield.
Okay, so traditional bow.
It's a no go.
We're going to try something else.
It's called a pocket shot.
Let me grab that real quick.
Jasper, you do this one because you have a bigger,
stronger arms than me and you're expert at this one.
You've done it before.
So this is, let me show them.
This is called a pocket shot.
The arrow goes right in there, slips in.
It's a really good application.
If you're out in the wilderness,
it's got a rubber over here.
The arrow slides right in that pocket.
It hooks in and knocks in and you just put a release
like he's doing right now.
Pull and fire.
So Jasperi, the master disaster.
Your release attaches right over there.
Wait.
Okay.
Let me record you from this side.
But I'm really scared.
Why?
Because if, for sure, this thing go through.
I don't think so.
There's no way.
Yeah, all right.
This is a little weaker than I should have started with this one,
but I didn't.
So imagine if this thing, I make this thing go through.
No, what I think is going to happen,
you're going to hit it right in that window
that I already shot and broke.
Probably.
That's what's going to happen.
Or you're going to somehow miss
and we have to go chase the arrow.
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
One, two, three.
Who is he?
Oh, you hit it right on the edge.
Right on the edge.
We have to shoot again.
I think this is, we need, wait, wait.
It's not bad.
No, it's a, it's a, it's a good call.
It's better to, the only one.
Yeah, Camero, look at this thing.
It went a little tiny bit deeper than the other one.
Yeah, let's go shoot.
I think it's just the way you pull it.
You have stronger arms.
Okay, you want to shoot it again one more time
because it's so much fun.
I'll cover them.
Yeah, like this, right?
Yeah, just shoot it like that.
I'll cover them.
Okay.
Okay.
Another arrow, just buddy wants to try it again.
Did it knock in?
Okay.
Okay, good.
You want to go a little closer?
Go closer because I'm just interested to see how much deeper,
because we have a strong pull.
Okay.
I, okay.
Same thing.
The second time didn't stick.
So it's almost doing the same thing
to the traditional bow.
To the traditional bow, which is not bad.
It's not bad.
That's powerful.
No, it's super powerful.
Yeah, that is super powerful.
Okay.
Enough playing around.
Let's step it up to the compound bow.
Okay, next I'm going to do a PSE compound bow.
This puts out about 330 feet per second or so.
You walk 31.
It's one of the professional lines.
So this is also no joke.
Just ready, ready?
And I'm going to use a practice tip for this one too.
Just ready, ready?
I'm ready.
Okay, here we go.
I can't believe it.
A 44 Magnum won't go through,
but this arrow just when it comes from the side.
Look how deep it went in.
It even went through that little extra cover.
That's about, that's a two, three inch.
I don't think it would hurt you.
If you have your wrist right on it,
it'll go right through your, through your arm maybe,
but it's not going to really come out
to where it's going to put you down.
You're going to get wounded, but not as bad.
So that's what happens with the compound bow.
Let's step it up and go to the cross pose.
That's ready to put this one back over here.
Let's move on.
Okay.
So that was the practice tip.
Let's shoot it with the broad head.
This is a really sharp broad head is used more
in the hunting applications,
even though I don't hunt.
Just for you.
Ready?
I'm ready.
Okay.
Let's see what happens.
Let's see.
Where should I go?
I'm going to go sideways.
I don't hit that metal.
Fire in the hole.
The, the practice tip came out three inches
and the broad head got stuck on this panel over here.
So that didn't come out as I thought
it was going to come out even deeper, but it didn't.
Okay.
Next bow.
This one is a sharp stainless steel broad head.
I'm going to be using the Viper S10 from 10 point.
I will put a link in the description for 10 point.
Also, they make some of the best cross pose ever.
Let me show you how you cock this bow.
It has its new caulking and deculking system.
It just stays right over here.
That goes in, locks in.
Put this in here, just cock it back silently.
If you are in a tree stand position,
makes it very easy right there.
And then you release back a couple of times.
This goes back in there like that.
And you are ready to fire.
Always point away.
Make sure your arrow sits all the way back there.
Hands out of the way.
It goes automatically in safety.
So you want to take it off safe to fire position
and you're ready to shoot.
And this is how skinny it looks when it's all cocked in.
Viper S10.
Thank you 10 point for sending this over.
Just better.
You ready?
I'm ready.
Final hole.
Went right in and out.
Yeah.
Oh my god, if all the boots got stuck at the arrow.
In and out.
In and out of this ballistic shield.
And the arrow is right over here.
There it is.
Oh, here's the exit wound over here.
You see the blades cut it right open.
Isn't that crazy?
Arrow will go right through this thing,
but it stops all the bullets.
Okay.
Let me go back reverse and shoot it with the practice tip.
See what happens.
Okay.
I changed the tip.
We put a practice tip on this one.
I need to clean this little bit.
Give me this thing.
Let me hold this thing.
Hold that for me.
Okay.
One more time.
Let me demonstrate how this works.
You take out your tool.
Stick it in there.
Okay.
This drops right in there.
Locks in.
Take your tool.
Cock it back.
Easy, right?
Yes.
No ropes needed.
You hear the click.
Come back.
Couple turns backward.
And this tucks right in there.
Okay.
Arrow, please.
Practice tip.
The arrow looks good.
No cracks.
Fingers out of the way always.
I'm going to go in the middle this time.
Safety.
Off.
Fire in the hole.
Fire in the hole.
This one got stuck.
Big difference.
Big difference between the...
Oh, it stopped because it hit the metal.
It hit the metal right over here.
Oh, yeah.
But still, I don't know if it would have gone all the way through.
Still, that's a kill shot.
If this thing comes out like that.
So the broadheads obviously are doing a lot better
cutting right through that Kevlar
than the regular practice tip.
