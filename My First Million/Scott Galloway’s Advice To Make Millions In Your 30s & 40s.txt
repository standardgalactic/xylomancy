My first Nellian.
Let's go.
My first baby mama.
My first catamine experience.
My first addiction.
Here's what I want to start with.
I love some of the things that you say.
And one of the things you said is,
don't follow your passion.
People who are already rich
tell you to follow your passion.
You should follow your talent.
Can you unpack that? Can you explain what you mean?
I wanted to be an athlete.
That was my passion.
And then I'm going to UCLA was a blessing
because I figured out pretty quickly
that I wasn't in the 0.1% you need to be
and to make your living as an athlete.
And there's a fair...
There's some pretty basic axioms
that should guide your career choices
around where you invest your most
the first is
the sexier the business, the lower return on investment.
You want to be in fashion,
the arts,
movies,
modeling, sports.
Unless you get really
incandescent green lights
from a very early age that you're going to be in the 0.1%,
try and
make a living somewhere else and then do that
on the weekends.
And that is
if you...
If you're the most talented actors in the world,
it's hard to get a SAG after a union card.
You have to actually ban something.
These are the most talented actors in the world.
182,000 of them.
87% of them don't qualify for health insurance
because they don't make more than $23,000
in a given year.
So the key is finding...
Not finding your passion, but finding your talent
and then committing to developing mastery.
And if you can develop mastery
in anything that has a 90% plus employment rate,
which 98% of sectors
enjoy,
the economic accoutrements,
the camaraderie, the prestige, the relevance,
just the sheer joy of mastery
will make you passionate about whatever it is.
And
I'm passionate about taking care of my kids.
I'm passionate about being able to step in
and help my aging father. I'm passionate about...
I'd rather be Raphael Nadal
or
Federer, but kind of...
I'd rather be
me than the number three or number four tennis player
financial security.
I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms
and not be as nervous and not throw up
or before a match.
So yeah, I'd rather be Nadal,
but pretty much anyone else playing tennis,
I'd rather be.
And I got there with moreing companies.
So the less sexy
of business, the higher the return on investment.
So I would suggest
that we stop...
Think about, well, what could I be good at?
I think that's what your 20s are for,
and also getting it wrong. I started in investment banking
and I was terrible at it. I didn't like them.
They didn't like me. And I had to go back
to business school and just start workshopping.
Where could I be great?
What industry could I be great in?
So don't, you know,
find what you're good at
and then get great at it.
And then be a DJ on the weekends.
By the way, congratulations.
Today's the release date
of the book, right? Algebra of Wealth.
Today is the day.
So that's going to be huge.
I read the Algebra of Happiness a while ago
and I've been watching the videos forever.
And so I kind of... I didn't get an early copy
of the book, but I will buy it and read it.
And so you'll get my $23.
By the way, we're number one on Amazon today.
I just thought I would drop that because
I'm desperate for your affirmation, Sam.
That's all right. I'll give it to you.
I won't starve you from that. You've got it.
I look up to you. I think you're the man.
Thank you. Well, let me ask you about the number one
on Amazon real quick.
You're a pretty stoic guy. In fact, when you come on the pod,
it's always surprising to me
that you are so even-keel.
But it's the launch day of your book.
You worked on this thing really hard.
You're number one on Amazon.
How does Scott Galloway celebrate?
Oh, you know, I'm not... I'm pretty flat.
I don't...
I congratulate the team. It feels great.
It's very gratifying.
I love benchmarks. I'm addicted to...
Everyone's addicted to something.
I'm addicted to Stranger's Affirmation,
and that's a form of affirmation.
But it's very rewarding because
so many people work so goddamn hard on this thing.
Just not me, but, you know,
my researchers, my analysts, my PR people,
my social people, my publisher,
my book agent, you know,
greatness is in the agency of others.
So it's just very gratifying.
And plus, my podcast co-host
got to number three on the best sellers list.
So, goddammit, if I'm not going to get to number two,
I must beat Kara Swisher.
So, Sam,
if you could go buy several thousand books,
I'd appreciate it.
And if you like it, write a review,
and if you hate it,
please buy more and send them to an enemy.
But yeah, I'm addicted to
external affirmation.
It's really pathetic.
Well, so, I mean,
the book, from my understanding,
is that it basically talks about
the people who have money and the people who don't,
and what are the commonalities between the winners and the losers.
And you have,
I've read this for years.
There was this awesome Fast Company article about you,
and I've seen you say this in videos
where you were shockingly calculating
when starting your last company, L2.
I think you said something like,
Deloitte did a study.
They did a study that shows what's the difference between
the people who sell their companies for five to ten times revenue
versus those who just sell it for one or two times.
And you had these, like, four or five things,
and it was, they own a niche,
they have recurring revenue,
and they're focused at their core,
and that they're international,
and then finally, they have defensive IP.
And then you went on and said how,
like, in your 40s, when you were starting L2,
40s and 50s, you were, like,
only focused on money.
You said, I worked my ass off.
I was there at the office at 2 a.m.
You said, but I don't regret it.
You said it was totally worth it.
And when you were starting L2,
I don't really know too much about that industry
or that business other than a handful of articles.
The story ends with you selling it for $120 million.
$160, boss.
Jesus, get your facts right.
And by the way, I'm number one on Amazon today.
I don't know if I told you that.
Yeah.
I didn't have a lot of money,
and for me, work was about
getting economic security.
I was very focused on money.
And I'm not saying that's the right way.
It was just my way.
And I had done a lot of analysis
in this study referring to.
Where companies that sell
in any industry,
the lowest 10 percentile,
the upper-desile of the valuations
they get taken out at.
And this study looked at the common features
of the companies that got sold in the top-desile.
And it was all the things you talked about.
And that's literally how I shaped the business model.
I opened a London office right away.
I set a charging consulting fee.
I said, pay me a quarter of a million bucks a year
and I'll answer your toughest questions using data.
We focused on luxury
and then consumer brands.
We broadened our niche a little bit.
I raised $17 million
to create a series of technology
and scraping tools so that I could collect
more data points than anyone in the world,
such that when the inevitable guy
from the analytics department came in
with his arms crossed to play gotcha,
they just couldn't
argue with our data.
We just collected more data than anyone in the world
on these issues and tried to distill it down
to something actionable.
We focused on exit.
We sold for eight times your revenue.
So, yeah, man,
my basic pitch to people was
you're going to work your ass off
and I'm going to try and get you to,
you know,
I'm going to try and get you to where your parents were
20 years earlier.
And if you're looking for balance,
this isn't that place.
If you're really into management or other things,
tell me and I will try
and shape a role around what's important to you.
But we are a small business going all in
to try and create
economic security for us and our families.
With Prop Team Media,
we're about 14 people now.
I purposely didn't take outside capital.
I'm not on that hamster wheel again.
I'm not trying to
Jones for an exit. I'm trying to build something
interesting that has relevance,
that has a little bit more impact on the social issues
we think about and also pay our people
really well. I used to pay people below
market and give them equity and I was
throwing nickels around like they were manual covers
because I wanted to have a profitable company I could
sell. Now my priorities have changed
and the people who
joined the company, I tell them this isn't the kind
of company that gets sold, but what I'll do
is I'll share, I'll give
you equity or participation
in my book deals. You know,
you are a junior analyst, you get
one or two percent of any
book deal I get. You get,
you know, try and create some economic upside for them.
My natural starting point
is that people come to work
to develop economic security for them and
their families, to increase their currency,
their currency in the marketplace experience
and also to
develop relationships. The workplace
is a great place to meet friends, mentors,
additional, you know, co-founders
and we spend a lot of money on
we saved, with COVID
we gave up our office, we save about $800
or $900,000 a year on an office because
of course as a narcissist I had to have this
amazing office in Soho which was stupid
and
I have this rule at work or not this rule
but this benefit. If any four of them are together
they get my credit card.
They can go to Broadway or they can go to
Tulum and they've done those things without asking
my permission. As long as there's four of them
they got my credit card
and the number one source of retention
I think the key to building a small business is
retention because if you find good people
you just don't want them to be with you
a year or two years and go to Google
because the switching costs are enormous
and if you find someone good
your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO
is just to create an environment where they want to stick
retention of employees in my opinion is just huge
and
I find or I read a study, another study on this
and it said the number one
source of retention or the number one lever for retention
people think it's compensation
people think it's culture
it's whether or not that person has a friend at work
if they have a friend at work
they look forward to going to work
and they are less likely to leave
and so what I try and do
everybody interviews everybody when we hire people
but these kids it's really inspiring
they'll go
six of them will go on vacation together
they'll say oh Scott you're speaking in Hamburg Germany
all six of us are going to come
and they have a great time together
they like each other and it's a
powerful kind of business
weapon if you will. Now I don't think you can do that
when it's a company
scales beyond 50-100
people
who have found for a small business it's really powerful
Hey real quick as you know
we're big on ideas here

brainstorming ideas for the podcast
well a lot of people ask what do you do with all those ideas
can we go find them is there a list somewhere
the great people at HubSpot have put together
a business ideas database it's totally free
if you just click the link in the description below
you can go download a collection
of over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive
listed out for you curated
and so what are you waiting for go download it
free check it out it's in the description below
all right back to the show and is the trick there that
you don't try to be their friend because
I've had that problem before I wanted to be the friend
and that made the management
a little bit messy and I realized
it is much better for me to not be the friend
and not be included in the
the hangs the whole company functions
better even though even personally I was like
oh man they're all going out
without me but actually it was
far better that it went that way
I always had a healthy sense of what
the border was me and my
kind of my president
my committee and the
partner at L2 we're both
about the same age and
we have the same view
we have parties all the time we show up
early as soon as shit
starts getting a little like crazy we leave
yeah we don't we don't need
to see them see them drunk
they don't they definitely don't
need to see me drunk and
my attitude is
what you're interesting
or what you're saying Sean is really interesting
and that is I'm just coming to the realization
as a dad
I'm not their friend I'm their
dad
because it was really upsetting to me that my kids did
kind of I don't want to say I don't want to be my friend
but I just naturally assumed that my kids would adore me
and be really into World War II history and CrossFit
because that's what dad is into and guess what they're not
and what I realize
is I'm not I'm not
their friend I'm there to be their dad
and it's kind of the same way I think
I work with such young people
I think the you know the average age
is probably 30 or 34 because I'm there
but the mean or the median
is like 25 it's basically
a bunch of kids over educated super
ambitious kids
and it's easy
they're doing dinner and drink somewhere I show up for dinner
I leave before dessert
and then they can you know they can enjoy each other
without thinking they're being judged by
by Scott
so yeah I don't I don't
I don't I draw sharp relief between
you know work and fun with those guys
I love it I go out with them
but I go out for the first couple hours and then I
disappear so they can they can have their own fun
I love the
if four of you together you get my card
that's amazing little tidbit
I'm here to collect little lessons
learned from you today and that's
that's one immediate one for me
so like obviously you're kind of
you're I don't know if you're at the peak
but you're you're at you're kind of killed it
right now in terms of your pod and kind of
being a public figure the books and everything
and then before that you had the company so you had
a huge financial outcome
one of the things that I think it's kind of brushed over
in your history is what you're
doing with kind of being an activist investor
I know you're on the board of New York Times
and you made a few other like pretty like
substantial investments I know you're working with
the hedge fund to do that
what were some of the deals that you were doing
what were some of the kind of the best deals were some
of the worst deals what were some of the signals
that you had where you were like
this is an interesting deal I should pounce on this
sure so there's a bit of a backstory
there I started coming to run on
below but when public I was on the board I got
into a fight with arguably
the most successful venture capitalist in the world
spoiler alert
he won the fight I was kicked off the board
so I was kicked out of the band that I started
which was like emotionally and mentally very taxing
for me and then
I got angry I was a really weird
time in my life my mom was dying
and I moved in with her and during the
day I would take manager
health care at night she was living in Vegas
I'd go to downtown and get shitty
drunk with strippers and
quote-unquote friends and then
go back and manage
my mom's health care and watch everyone loves Raymond
and Jeopardy with my mom it was a strange
time in my life I was also very
angry because I'd just been kicked off the board
of red envelope so I took
like a half a million dollars in my money and I filed
a proxy to replace the entire board
and I learned
everything about activist investing and shareholder
governance and I tried to kick everyone off
the board
and I own 10% of the company
and I think I got 12% of the vote
and my proxy solicitor said the 2%
was probably a mistake so basically no one
voted for my slate and that was kind of a low
moment for me okay now
the world has told me they don't want me involved
in this corporation or in
this company
and then
six months later I got a call from a hedge
fund that said you're crazy
but you are kind of crazy we have some
stakes in companies
and we need someone to kind of go in and
rattle the cage
and it just struck me that at your lowest
moment you really don't know
where that might lead
and I got
backed I went into a company called I bought
10% of a company called United retail
let me build your website
you don't have a website this is a while ago
where I'm going to try and replace the board
this had fine stock went from 2 to 8
and I'm like wow this is easy
and I did it at Sharper image
bought a big stake there went in there
the company seemed like a mess
the stock had gone up a little bit I got out
I did it at Gateway computer went on the board there
that was more difficult we made a small amount
of money but I never lost money doing it
so then I went and raised $700 million
and became the largest shareholder in the New York
Times and went on the board there
and timing is everything
and in this case I went on the board in March
of 2008
and the stock went from 16 to 3
in about 5 months at one point
I think I was losing 10 or 12 million dollars
of other people's money every day
and we almost lost the business
the company almost went bankrupt I don't know
if you guys remember that
but in the world of media
people just stopped advertising they just stopped
it was like our tap a revenue just got
turned off and
it was sort of the great financial
recession it kind of ended my
career as an activism because one
I don't think I was very good at it
and two I was getting to a stage
in my life where I just didn't want to be
combative anymore I didn't want to go to war
with CEOs I didn't want to
I was just exhausted by being
an antagonist I thought I'm never
going to go on a board again unless the CEO wants
me there so but I did
that for a while I learned a lot
a little bit of money but
you know I was in my early
40s and quite frankly just trying to figure out a way to make
a living so I could stay in New York which isn't
easy and
I think I was flailing a little bit
but it was
a great experience I learned a lot about human
nature about shareholders about
governance I get called a lot by
boards when they're being challenged by an activist
because I was one and I think I have some
insight into how these people think
but yeah it was just a strange time
in my life
but it was
interesting it was fun
I just wasn't very good at it
yeah that's cool you've had a bunch of different careers
and I like that
I like variety I like people who have
different chapters and sagas of their life
and you mentioned like your 20s are for figuring out
what you actually like to do
or what you're actually good at
or the intersection between those two sounds like yours
went past your 20s and you just kept experimenting
you know
along the way is that a
fair assessment for you
yeah
investment banking no good at it business school
started a brand strategy
firm called profit
grew it to a couple hundred people sold it for
33 million what do I want to do I know
I want to teach
the dot-com
implosion it took me to you know
from what I thought was being wealthy to not being
wealthy teaching wasn't going to help
me or help me maintain the lifestyle
I needed or wanted to maintain with two young
kids in New York so I needed to find
other ways to make money
and I did the hedge fund thing for a while
did boards and then
saw an opportunity in analytics and benchmarking
and started that company I think 09
or 010 and that was my kind of a big
win and the time
timing is everything I got swept up
into what is the greatest bull market economy
in history 08 to present is
probably going to go down as the greatest
extended bull market run in history
people don't understand
just what an anomaly the last
16 years have been relative to
the history of the market
and just as I was coming into my prime income
earning years you know the winds
just just just
filled up my sales
and I caught you know I finally
got all the moon sort of lined up if you
will but I've always said
you know
you got to be humble when things
work because a lot of your
successes and your fault
at the same time I wish I had been
more forgiving of myself when things didn't
work because
I have trouble forgiving myself I
struggle with anger and I the person I get
most angry at is myself
and I have trouble getting past
it you know I was on
I was at a book thing last night and I said
something and it just came out wrong and I like
sitting in bed and I can't get past that one
thing but it went really well but I
can't think that way I focus on
what's what's wrong
and that would be my advice to people is be humble
when you have winds because
a lot of it isn't you but also
forgive yourself because you know
again a lot of it isn't you
my roommate in college had the poem if
on the I think Richard Kipling
on his wall and one of the great lines
of that poem is you know
if you can meet triumph and disaster
and treat those two imposters just the same
and that's always stuck
with me that's kind of what you're talking about like
your greatest triumphs
maintaining the humility and then in your
greatest failures not beating yourself up
too much you're a big proponent
of stoicism and that seems like
a pretty stoic way to be
give us the like you know
there's a lot of people listening to this right now that may be
familiar with stoicism don't practice
don't kind of know how it applies to their life
like make your pitch what's
why stoicism
why stoicism matters to somebody
and emotional health and
Ryan Holiday is kind of my Yoda
on stoicism and he distills it this way
life is not about what happens
to you you can't control that but you can't control
how you respond to what happens to you
and I've tried to always
remember that and I have trouble
practicing it but
you know
the ultimate
stoicism piece of art
in modern history or modern media is
Brokeback Mountain if he can't fix it
how to stand it and that is
try and focus on the things you can control
and you can control
your emotions it's very difficult to control
what happens to you
and you know just also recognize
and this
is more atheism than stoicism
everyone on this podcast
everyone we know everyone we care about
what they think of us
they're going to be dead
in a hundred years in a blink
of the history
nothing you say or do
or what anyone else thinks of you
is going to matter for very long
and something that really has helped me
when I was embarrassed or I thought I didn't
equip myself very well
is what you realize is just imagine yourself
when someone says or does something stupid
you think to yourself oh
that was stupid and then you go back to thinking
about yourself
and you know people aren't thinking
about you your wealth
your failures or successes as much as
people are
and so the key is just trying to be comfortable
with yourself and comfortable in your own skin
and not only that
really kind of focus on
what your spouse thinks of you
is your spouse happy do you have a good relationship
with your kids
because what Twitter thinks of you really isn't that important
and because I had so much trouble
actually footing my emotions
to that logical notion
I know it doesn't matter what people on Twitter
or the Twitter mob think of me
I don't incorporate myself from it
I don't have those skills
so a role model of mine is again Sam Harris
he's like oh I got off Twitter I can't handle that
he's like why don't you get off of Twitter
and I'm like yeah I can
so I stop I'm off of Twitter
for the last nine months and it's been one of the most
accretive things to my mental health
and I didn't like to admit this but I would say
five or six weekends where I just got really bummed out
by something probably two or three of them
started on Twitter
I thought why am I on something
that's freaking me on a regular basis
upset
and
there's an addictive nature to it
I think it must be just and that's what freaks me out
I can modulate it
you know can my 13 year old son
and I even know that he's upset
when he goes we have a rule in my house
our boys aren't allowed to go into their rooms
or their phones alone because I think this thing
can literally take a teenager
especially a teenager girl down a rabbit hole
and kind of zero to 60 really fast
or content oh you're worried about
dieting well here's extreme dieting tips
despite the fact we know you're 5'10
95 pounds
oh you're depressed
well here's some videos of people considering suicide
we're going to normalize it for you
and I don't think parents are
really in touch with just how ugly
and how fast it gets really ugly
so
you know I'm trying to be very thoughtful about
what it is as a
stoicism controlling what I can control
and then
trying to be in better touch with my emotions
and recognize that
when you're down
it's more about the chemistry in your head
than any legitimate reason to be down
it's
at the end of life the biggest regrets
my colleague at NYU Adam Alter did great research
on people who are very near death
and palliative care
and their biggest regrets are one
they wish they'd stayed in better touch with friends
they wish they'd lived the life they wanted to lead
the life society or their parents wanted them to lead
but their biggest regret
is they wish they'd been less
hard on themselves
they wish they'd forgiven themselves
they wish they'd allowed themselves to be happy
and that's kind of been
that's something I've been very focused on
it's like okay stop beating yourself up
you're going to be dead soon
why wouldn't you squeeze as much juice out of this lemon
as conceivable
and like
afford yourself the opportunity to be happy
and sad if you need to be
but I think of stoicism as again
life isn't about what happens to you
it's how you respond to what happens to you
and decide what is in your control
and you know
try and be good to yourself
try and forgive yourself and also just try and be humble
you are never more
prone to a really big mistake
than right after a big win
because here's the thing you start thinking
you're good at picking stocks
you start thinking you're so skilled at work
that someone senior to you took an interest in you
and championed you
you start thinking oh I'm great at real estate
I just didn't get lucky and buy a home at the right time
so
be try and just
try and ignore the market
when the market tells you you're a failure
and this is personal too
you know there's been moments in my life where I thought
I don't think I'm ever going to be able to work again
I think I've ruined
everything
I don't think I'm ever going to make a very good living
saying to my partner at the time
let's move to a low-cost neighborhood
a Charlottesville or a Raleigh Durham
I'm going to teach, try and write
you know make decent livings and just have a really nice life
and my partner's like that's giving up
I'm like well that's not giving up
but I thought this is it
I just need to substantially downgrade my expectations
and I don't mean to say
that that's not a great life
I remember thinking after my divorce
like I don't think I'm ever going to
have someone who I can share my life with again
I'm like this just is never going to happen to me
I'm an unattractive
broken man who's never going to find
like a partner again
I believe that for a short time
and I think that it's
important that everybody recognize
that you know
you are the answer to a firm's problem
you can find someone
who you can love and is going to love you a great deal
the key is
putting in yourself in a place of success
getting out of the house
being friendly
being risk aggressive
surrounding yourself with people
and exercise nutrition
that makes you feel good about yourself
such that when the winds kick up again
your sales are up
and I've always tried to do that
I've had a lot of failure
but I always had my sales up
such that when the winds kicked up again
I was in a position to rumble
so to speak because I have a lot
I know a lot of people who are very successful
a personal failure
a death of a parent
they can't quite get over a divorce
a company that fails
and they get stuck
they can't forgive themselves
they can't forgive others
they can't forgive the market
or they don't, they lose their mojo
whatever it is
and 2, 3, 5 years, 7 years
goes on
and they just haven't progressed
and they start, their skills start atrophying
so what I say is
put a statute of limitations
when everything bad happens to you
you've got to put a statute of limitations on it
a parent dies
within 12 weeks
you should still be sad and thinking about your parents
but you should be able to function
you go through a real emotional trauma
or a breakup
well how serious was it, how much time
what's the statute of limitations
a business goes out of business
more and for a little while
2 months, 3 months
but if you aren't better
if you aren't back sending out emails
trying to raise money, going out trying to meet new people
whatever it might be within that timeline
you need to reach out for help
and get unstuck
because time goes really fast
and your skills atrophy
in a sort of a downward spiral
and something I've always been able to do
is mourn and move on
Churchill said the key to success is the ability to move through failure
without losing your sense of enthusiasm
and I've tried, I've been pretty good
at not losing my sense of enthusiasm
you've got brilliant ideas
I think you're a good business person
but you talk about not just following your passion
but your talent
and I think that what you're most talented at is communication
I've seen you speak live
I've listened to the pod, I've seen your videos
you do such a good job at picking
really sharp words
and sharp phrases
for example, it's like a Kutriman
I've noticed that you love that word
and I've never heard anyone use it as much as you
and I'm like, I love that word
it's a beautiful word
or you sign your emails with
Life is Rich
you've got beautiful phrases
I think that, by the way
I even had a chat GBT
uploaded like 150 of your blogs
and I would ask it questions to help give me ideas
for phrases because you're really good at that
who do you steal from when it comes
to language, I mean, you seem like someone
if I had to guess, like you're a George Carlin guy
something like that
who do you steal some of your delivery from
or inspired by for writing
because you're really good and do you have
a bank of when you see a phrase
you're like, oh, I'm going to take that phrase
and use that somewhere
If you don't have a kitchen cabinet of people
that you learn enough about that you can mimic them
you're trying to play a team sport
so you're on the field alone
and I didn't figure that out until I was older
it was something inspiring
I'd read maybe one book a year
people think I'm well read, I'm not
but I'll find a book that's really meaningful
and I'll try and read it two or three times
so I can adopt it into my grey matter
like Daniel Kahneman's
Thinking Slow and Fast
I've read that book a few times
and I know everything about loss aversion theory
I know a lot about the relationship between money and happiness
I read Observations of the Bytes Standard
by Peter Drucker
I read Sapience several times
really, you know, in bed stuff
lately I'd write down things
in my phone that I just think are fucking hilarious
like jokes
you know, I wrote down something today
as a prank when my doctor
walks in, I put on gloves
I'm going to try that, I love my doctor
I love the idea of him walking in and me snapping on gloves
just to see his reaction
we were talking about
Trump today and I saw this great quote that said
consequences rarely show up lubed
I love that
I just, whenever I see something that really
I just think
you know, I love going out in the public
except for the fact that the public is there
you see these things every day
and I will write them down
and incorporate them into my rap
and especially
great phrases, you know
greatness is in the agency of others
I remember my VC said that and I'm like
that just makes so much goddamn sense
I'm going to use that over and over and over
so I have a lot of inspiration
I surround myself
with really intelligent young people
I know that's ages but I think young people
have a different frame on things that help me
so
but to not, to not sort of
if you're just reading something and not
you don't take away stuff you're going to remember
you haven't really read it, you haven't really absorbed it
but it's all
manner of stuff, I think
you're right, I'm totally inspired
by George Carlin, I think he's fantastic
on society, I've been inspired by Ricky
Vase, I'm inspired by this comedian named Michelle
Wolf, I think she's fantastic
but
I've read a lot about Muhammad Ali
I think he's, you know, be courageous
be poetic but yeah
absolutely every young person should find a couple people
they find really inspiring
and try and learn everything about them and what they said
such that you can kind of turn on
your Muhammad Ali
and you know, Madeleine Albright
secretary of state, you know, 4'10
I find her inspiring around
her policy on geopolitics
so I've read a lot about her
you know, our memory is long
and our reach is far
I love that, she used to say that about America
to its enemies, right
basically a really eloquent way of saying
don't fuck with us boys
and I just love that this 4'10
woman only in America can wield
you know, the most powerful
nation in the world in terms of our
foreign policy abroad and I found her
and she was an immigrant, I just found her inspiring
to learn more about her so I could be her on occasion
anyways, yeah, build a kitchen cabinet of people
Scott, I got a
my notes app here
it's called Funny Phrases and I just
I collect these, I'll give you three of my
Funny Phrases on here, they're completely out of context
so you won't get it, but you'll get it
because it sounds like you can do this too
when somebody's thick, you could say that they're
built like a baguette, I like that
somebody's got the body of a baguette
okay, next one
if you want to
talk about something that other people are avoiding
you say, look, I'm going to address this
like an envelope right now
that's a dad joke
another one would be
for CEOs who have bad
you know, a terrible
sense of vision of the future
if this CEO was the shooter
at JFK, he would have died of natural causes
I love these little
little isms, little phrases, little sentences
you're going to lose this game, okay so
he looks like
a suicide bomber that's having second thoughts
this is more serious, I absolutely
love this one, this is more
true life advice, your goal isn't
to get the apology, but to forgive
the perceived debt, I love that
I love that
I could just sing down, this is really bad
teaching my son about
sex ed, so I walked into his room
with a banana in a condom and he said
what's a banana for, and I said I can't get hard
to get out of my stomach
I literally think that's
the funniest fucking
that just hit Sam, that literally
just hit Sam, I just think
that's so inappropriate
and so anyways, sorry guys
alright, I'm not going to, this is like
getting into a rap battle with Tupac
I'm not going to, I'm going to put away my swipe file
right here, even though I just had a good one
I'm going to give up, you win
what are you excited about right now
like what are some things that are going on
in the world, or products, or ideas, or trends
I think you talk a lot
about stuff that's wrong
with America, with the world, culture
with society, but I want to know the opposite
what are you pumped about?
that's not easier for me, to be blunt
I'm a glass half empty kind of guy
I think a lot about loneliness
I think a lot about struggling young men
I think about the threats of AI
what am I excited about
I work with a really talented group of people
that are really inspiring, I love the work
I just really enjoy it
I get to travel a lot
with my kids, I got kids
that are at a great age
and I get to do a ton of fun stuff with them
that's really intoxicating
you know, I'm just
I get to have a really nice life
at this point, and I'm just enjoying it
with a partner
just really leaning into my kids
you know, just the hallmark
shit, I'm just really
having a nice time with
the people closest to me
and I'm healthy, I got good
healthy kids
you know, the boring stuff
man, it's not anything kind of
I mean, I'm going
on my book tour this week, I go to
LA for Bill Maher and then I'm meeting a bunch
of college buddies and I'm going to stagecoach
and then I go to Miami for a bunch of speaking gigs
and then I go home to London
I mean, I just have a
really nice life right now
and everyone I care about is healthy
I feel relevant
so I just have such a wonderful life
and I'm trying to slow time down so I can
really appreciate it because
you know, there's no getting around it
I had
lunch with Ted Cirendos
which I realized is a name drop
but I'm desperate for
for your guys affirmation but
his wife wrote a book on grief
and there's this great line
she has this great line and that is
grief is love's receipts
and I just love that
I just, if you really care about
I didn't have a lot of grief until the age of 40
and I realized it was because there was no one in my life that I really loved
or really loved me other than my mom
and so
you know, what I would bless or wish
for anybody is they have a lot of grief in their life
because what it means is they have loss
and when you have loss it's because
you had something wonderful in your life and you miss it
so
I'm just trying to appreciate how just
nice things are and really
you know, I don't, you know
I'm not really excited about
the Euro Finals in Germany although I am excited
about the European Finals in Germany
I'm just enjoying myself
I'm rounding third, I have a really nice
life right now, I'm just trying to enjoy it
because I know everything
everywhere ends
What do you say for people who are not rounding third?
Like
people who are just batting
lead off right now, so you talk a lot to young people
one of the phrases
I really liked or one of the quotes I really liked was that
opportunity is a function of
density, you said
I get to a place that is crowded with success
What do you mean by that? Because that seems like
really good advice for people
Well, and sort of the motivation
for the book was you know that study that you are
kind of the average of your five closest friends
there's this weird
study that peer group, the five people you hang out with
you end up being the same body mass index
you end up with similar political
values, same jobs, same neighborhood
it means it's weird, you become the same person
what's different though
where there's greater variance is that of those five people
even though they make kind of similar incomes
one will end up poor
three will be okay and one will end up quite wealthy
and I try to understand the behaviors
that are different in the strategies
between the person that ends up
financially secure and the others
that are less financially
secure
and there's some general best practices
around youth, you absolutely
want to get to a city. If you're ambitious
I'm not suggesting
this is the right way, it's just my way. If you're ambitious
and you want to have influence or economic security
before you collect dogs and kids you got to get to a city
two-thirds of economic growth is going to happen
in just 20 cities
and so if you're really ambitious
I mean get to the biggest city in your nation
then get to London if you're in Europe or New York
in the U.S. or if you're in San Francisco
because
those cities are really competitive and you're going to
be playing, you know how when you play tennis
against players better than you
your game elevates
when you're in this big city you're playing against
the best players in the world
it's hard to live in Brooklyn, it's expensive
which means you got to be really good at what you do
and you're surrounded by people
who are going to inspire you and who really
will elevate your game
and at some point you'll probably have to move out of the city
because it's difficult with kids
but while you're young
get to a big city, try and
find really high character successful
people to hang out with
just find people you want to
be like or that you admire
professionally and personally and try
and establish those friendships and try and hang out
with them because you rise
or fall to the level of your peer group
and the thing about
cities is you're just bumping off
opportunities and
I've moved to London and my reductive analysis
of the U.S. versus Europe is the U.S.
is still the best place to make money
Europe's the best place to spend it
so if you're in the making money part of your life
it's hard to beat the U.S.
I didn't appreciate the American economy
until I left it, people start from
yes here, how can we work together
how can we build something together
how can we make money together
London it's sort of like a very
polite indefinite maybe
there's very little actual organic value
creation in London, it's people servicing
other people's wealth that they made elsewhere
there's nothing like
there's nothing like America that says to a young person
if you work your ass off and you're really good
and you get a little bit lucky
you know
things can happen for you here
all my British friends they say that they grew up
being afraid of tall poppy syndrome
meaning they didn't want to stick out
because their teachers would tell them
shut the hell up, get in line
whereas in America if you do something
interesting even if you fail
you're rewarded as being a hero of like
well that's awesome man you got after it
even if it sucked the outcome wasn't good
we praise you for getting after it
and I think that's a very unique
American thing compared to Europe
in Europe if you stick out you're chastised
well not only that
but people say in America we embrace failure
that's not true but we do tolerate it
and so only one out of
seven businesses succeed
so my strategy has been to start nine businesses
and
I got to two wins and all you need is one
and if you aren't trying really hard
and taking risks and failing
and knowing when to pull the plug and move on
you're not taking advantage of the American
embrace of risk and failure
I've never had trouble
raising money because of past failures
people didn't mind that as long as you treated
your investor as well as long as you
were a decent person
you didn't do anything stupid or unethical
people don't have a problem funding you again
you know I'm not
I've had a lot of failure professionally
but I've never had
let me just say when I couldn't raise money
because I had failed before
and that's true in relationships
so yeah the embrace
or the acceptance of failure in America
is um it's singular
and it's a wonderful thing and if you aren't trying
and taking a lot of riskier you aren't taking advantage
of an economy that's one of the few in the world
one of the few societies
I mean if I was born in China I'd probably be in jail
because I'm outspoken and say stupid things
if I was born in Europe
you know I think I'd be a talented
business person but I wouldn't be
a entrepreneur that had recognized this success
because they don't embrace failure
or that's wrong they don't tolerate it the way we do
can I ask you
a question about hard work
and the reason being is I found
I found some what read
as contrary things in your work
or at least in your story and what you write
and so Sean and I have talked
a lot about this about hard work
and I think people who say they work 80 hours
a week for a really long time
I think they're either lying
or they did a lot of bullshit work
I think it's to work 80 hours a week
for an extended period of time
it's incredibly challenging
and you talked about in this book
as well as some of the other
blog posts you're saying
in my 40s I grinded my ass off
all I was focused on was money
and it worked out but that's all I did
and I'm happy I did it but it was really hard work
but then I read about how
you delegate a ton
I think you said something even as crazy
when you pick out your clothes
and you wear mostly the same thing
you have your workout outfit
and then your work outfit
and how you
at PropG Media you said something like
you only meet with your executive producer
twice a month you only have one hour meeting
once a week with the editorial team
you haven't planned vacations in 20 years
and all you do is focus on
a handful of things
but even though you're crazy productive now
I don't know are you still grinding
knowing what you know now
could you have gotten to where you've gotten
without that 80 hour a week
for multiple years work ethic
well things have changed dramatically for me now
I'm not working nearly as hard
and I hire a lot of people
and I'll over not over hire
but everyone works hard but I don't
I mean when you have a small business
and you don't have a lot of money
you know you just you gotta get
everyone needs you need to work hard
you need to set an example and you need to
create an environment where everyone's working hard
I'm not sure I was ever working 80 hours a week
consistently I definitely had weeks like that
but when I look back on it
kind of I don't know
10, 20, 10, 15 years
I don't remember much else
other than work I mean I worked out
when I had kids I tried to spend some time with my kids
I still found time for fun
and vacations but
you know I would vacation two weeks a year
now I vacation a lot
more than that
and but I don't see
any way around it it's really
my kids when I say my kids my students
I'll ask them how much money they expect to be making
by the time they're 35
and about 90% of them expect to be in the top 1%
which is $750,000 a year
in America
and then they'll talk about that
like that's what I expect but I'll say what's most important to you
in your life and moving forward
and a lot of the time they say
balance
and I'm like so you expect to be in the top 1%
by the time you're 35
but you also believe you're going to have balance
in your life
I've never seen that
you can have it all
you just can't have it all at once
and by the way
that may not be the way to go
you may say I want to live a nice balance life
I'm going to move to a suburb of St. Louis
coach Little League work 40 hours a week
be a good citizen
find a good partner
coach Little League have a nice life
but the majority of the people I know
the young people think they're going to be in the top 1%
and also have balance in their life
and I just think it's ridiculous
I'm like okay the only way to get there
to achieve that is if you have one thing
and that's rich parents
otherwise expect to go all in on your career
or scale back your expectations
around your economics and your influence
because it's a competitive market
and one of the things people can control
is how hard they work
I don't think you want to
much that you sacrifice your health
or your relationships
there is going to be some trade off with your relationships
I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little
I was divorced I think it was a contributor to that
I was always working in services
companies and never saying no to any opportunity
the CMO of Samsung
can you be in Seoul tomorrow for a board meeting
sure I can
I just said yes to everything
to try and move the company forward
but I
for a long period worked very
very hard
and sacrificed a lot
and it takes a toll
and I did it such that I could have a lot more balance
now
but yeah I don't
this notion the myth of balance
get over it if you expect to be influential
or economically secure
you're not going to have a lot of balance
for a long period of time
some people are such geniuses
that they can work a modest amount of time
make a lot of money, work out
have a relationship with their parents
be fit, donate time at the ASPCA
and have a food blog
assume you are not that person
so just have a sober conversation
and also have a sober conversation with your partner
how much money do we expect to have
who's responsible for making it
what's your approach to spending
where are we going to live
the number one source of divorce
is not infidelity
or lack of shared values
it's usually got something to do with money
we're not allowed by women
who's still and we don't like to say this
because we like to pretend women have no agency
and that they're just doughy little foes
is
the man loses a business
becomes broke
or has a mental breakdown
when a man loses a status as a provider
he's very inclined
to be on the wrong end of divorce
so I think a lot about young men
I think a lot about financial security
I think every man should start with the notion
of being responsible for the economic well-being of his household
and by the way
sometimes that means getting out of the way
and being more supportive of your partner
who happens to be better
at that money thing than you
and that's a wonderful thing
but start from a position of
this is my responsibility
and make sure you're aligned
with your partner around this stuff
because the thing we don't talk about
is that your kids are going to have higher blood pressure
if you're economically strained
kids in low-income households have
greater systolic resting blood pressure
than kids in middle and upper income homes
you're much more likely to get divorced
you're much more likely to have a stroke
you're much more likely to be the victim
or the perpetrator of domestic violence
when you don't have money
you know America becomes more like itself every day
and that is it's a loving
generous place for people with money
it's a rapacious violent place
for people who don't have money
so all this bullshit that money doesn't buy you happiness
oh my god is that a myth
I'm not saying you need to be
incredibly wealthy
but middle-income people are happier than poor people
and wealthy people are happier
than middle-income people that's the bad news
the good news is that it tops out
you get diminishing returns
and you have to be cognizant of
when you do get to some level of
economic security
that's the means
the ends is such that you can
have an exhale
that's the anxiety that you feel
and then use the opportunity
to really spend a lot of time
with your loved ones
and cement those relationships
and the problem is you get on the sadonic treadmill
and you get so absorbed in your own success
and your professional identity and money
and making more money
that you never get to the ends
you wake up a wealthy person
or someone who's financially secure
who's always thought about their economic well-being
and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids
and you really leaned into your partnership
and thought okay let's take time
to really enjoy each other's company
let's do nice things
your parents die before you have a chance
to really spend time with them as adults
I think that happens to a lot of people
they just get so caught up
and I need the next promotion
I need the next amount of money
and once I get here
I have someone very close to my life
it's a family member
and I'm taking them to Africa
they were making excuses and I'm like
you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa
before you're dead right
you're 50 fucking years old
when you go when you're 70
but you gotta get back to work an extra day
I mean what are you thinking
we're gonna be dead soon
and I just think so many people
don't realize how fast it's gonna go by
and never really
never really like
not only super lean into the relationships
but just allow themselves to have a great time
I'm going to stagecoach this week
I'm gonna go to country music festival
I can't stand country
but I'm going
I'm gonna buy a pair of boots
I'm gonna have a great time and I'm gonna do an edible
and I'm gonna drink a shit ton
and I'm gonna have arrested adolescents with my friends
and I'm gonna look ridiculous
and it's like yeah
why not
why the fuck not
what am I gonna do watch c-span all weekend
I mean anyway
I can't stand it when people who are
blessed with being in this country have some level
of economic security have people in their life
that love them and they love
and they don't like crazy lean into it
because you guys are younger
it just goes so goddamn fast
it's just crazy
it is just crazy how fast it goes
anyways
well I don't know how to respond to that
Scott here's what I do know
I feel like I learned something and I feel
a little bit bad inside
I feel a little bit good
and you made me feel a little bit bad
and I need to go and I need to like
burp or something
I need to get a little bit out of my system
I just need to unwind from that
do they not have Zoloft in London
I haven't hit the antidepressant
I just had ketamine therapy though
that was a trip
I'm trying to just
the good news is I hate my life less
and less every day
so
I'm sort of getting there
you're like if Mitch Hedberg
had a podcast
and opened an LLC
are we going to talk about my book
do you think I got to number one talking about
doing therapy with you guys
on these Joey Baganonas podcast
are you going to bring up my book?
tell us about the book
we talked a little bit about the book
but tell us the floor is yours
make your case as to what I'm going to
get out of this book because I'm going to buy it
I'm going to read it
but I'll read it with a different level of enthusiasm
if you give me a little teaser of what I'm going to get out of it
okay so the algebra of wealth
is the following
find your talent, focus
workshop your 20s
in an industry that will pay you
once you have a certain amount
of momentum professionally
really try and develop a savings muscle
wealth isn't about how much you make
it's about how much you spend
try and just get to the point at a fairly early stage
the brightest companies and minds in the world
are all here to convince you that
an upgrade from economy to economy comfort
to economy plus to business classes
and investment in yourself, no it's not
it's consumption
don't try and impress other people with your shit
no one's as concerned with your shit as you are
you don't need to order a bottle of vodka
at a club for 450 bucks
get a Hyundai for God's sakes
travel coach, save money
start saving money early, lean in
if you're young, lean into your advantage
develop that savings muscle
diversify the moment you have any real capital
start diversifying
that way no matter what happens
you have Kevlar
you can have a stocker to zero and a bullet hits you in the chest
it doesn't kill you because you're diversified
and then take advantage of
the flaw in the species and that's time
and recognize
that time will go faster than you think
and if you're just a little bit of discipline
a little bit of maturity, a little bit of that savings muscle
early
the S&P is up 11% a year since 2008
well that sounds boring
now that means every 21 years
your investments are up 8x
and that 21 years will go really fast
so hope you sell a bestselling book
hope your company goes public
hope your album goes double platinum
or some rich uncle dies and leaves you everything
but just in case
make sure you're financially secure
and I can get you there
if you follow these principles
and show a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity
because the good news is I can get you rich
the bad news is the answer is slowly
we can get you there
so the algebra of wealth
equals focus plus
stoicism
times time, times diversification
that's the formula
you're the formula guy
a lot of your talks
you use formulas to explain stuff
you've had the algebra of happiness, now the algebra of wealth
is this going to be a whole algebra of blank
series
anytime I see that, I'm into it
if it's an equation, I'm into it
yeah so
humans need constructs to remember things
you can read a book and if it doesn't have constructs
or visualizations, it's pretty easy
to forget about it so I really like constructs
equations
I read the algebra of happiness, the algebra of wealth
out today
I'm about to sign a three book deal
I'm writing the algebra of masculinity
the algebra of work and the algebra of mating
those are three topics I'm super interested in
and I want to try and do enough research
I can distill it down to some best practices
that people can hold on to
well I want to talk about the first variable in this
you said focus
because we talked about stoicism, I know about time
I know about diversification but teach me about focus
I'm pretty bad at focus
trying to get better
give me a couple words on focus
as part of this equation
if you have a side hustle
you need to find a different main hustle
you're better off
the time you spend on a side hustle
investing that incremental effort in your main
hustle and if you constantly find
a side hustle is fine if you're investigating
a new main hustle
but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things
it's being really great at one thing
so that's the focus and the term we use
is mastery or ninja like capability
but try and find something
you could become great at
and that is
that's not easy
but also, again we talked about this before
finding it in an industry that's not very sexy
because if you're in the top 10%
of tax law
or of
installing HVAC or energy efficient
HVAC
or you're in the top 10% of people who know
how to install soapstone kitchen counters
you're going to make a really good living
and taking care
of your kids is just so much fun
being able to be there
for your parents is economically
is just
really exciting and really a lot of fun
and I think young people mistake passion
for their hobbies
not recognizing when they get older
to be able to give money away
to be able to do nice things
to be able to relax with your partner
you know it's just super
enjoyable it's almost as fun as you know
spinning to
I mean that shit is fun
that is really enjoyable
and so put yourself in a position
when you're a little bit older because it'll go really fast
to just do wonderful things
with people you care about
and the way you get there
is by making more than you spend saving
but the first thing you got to do is find the
focus you know find something
you know we are living
we live in a specialist economy
find something like
that's your try and just think
could I be great at this
could I be great at this that's not the question
because if you become great at it trust me
you'll become passionate about it and you can't become great at anything
you hate that's not that's just going to be
automatically screened out
I'm not suggesting
drudgery is the way if you find something
drudgerous or whatever the term is you're just not going to be great at it
but I found
consulting I never I didn't know
what consulting was when I was in college even
business school I figured out wait
people will pay you to wrench your brain
wow
and I was always really good at establishing these proxy father-son
relationships with powerful men
and then basically
my core deal with them is
I understand brand better than you
you're the CMO I'm going to make you the CEO in three years
in exchange for that you're going to pay my company
a million dollars a year to answer
very deep hard questions
and I figured that out
at kind of my late 20s which was a blessing
and then when I sold the company I'm like
I don't want to be in services anymore it's a young person's business
I'm sick of being on planes
so I had to workshop my life again
and then I figured out okay I'm a good teacher
what does it mean to be a good teacher it means you have to be a good storyteller
but what if I story told
in different mediums could I make money in books
could I make money speaking could I make money
in podcasts
and I figured out yeah I'm good at this I could even
be great someday
and that mastery has led to a really nice
nice life but I've always
tried to
spend reasonably spend less
than I was making sometimes more than others
I finally
learned to diversify the hard way I lost everything
twice in 2000
and again in 2008 because I thought it was so awesome
that whatever is my focus
this is naturally going to be successful through my sheer
force of character
that's not true so I started
diversifying
and you know just kind of follow
these basic principles and let time take over
and really started saving a lot of money
in my 40s I deployed
an army of capital to start
fighting and killing for me and my family
and my sleep
and that army just grew
in the whole market
and you know came home
with just immense spoils for me
because I deployed this army
early and often and I kept adding
to it I feel like here's a tank
alright
okay I'm saving money I'm not going to have the fat apartment
right okay here's some more artillery
go kill more people and come home with money
that's a little bit much
anyways
we're still working through that one
wrong choice
of words accoutrements
the accoutrements of my army
Scott thanks for going on man
