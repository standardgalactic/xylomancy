Checking Chris ＂The Brain＂/AI is NOT Artificial Intelligence, the real threat of AI is ＂Automated Stupidity.＂ ｜ Words MADDER.txt
 In today's episode of Words Matter, Chris Doe clarifies the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) versus automated intelligence. He emphasizes that AI is a real and significant technological advancement with the potential to change the world, but not in the way the hype often suggests. AI can automate various tasks, from mundane mental activities to specialized research, writing, and even some aspects of creative fields like animation and graphic design. However, as we delegate more tasks to AI, there's a risk of becoming complacent and relying too heavily on these systems without fully understanding their limitations.

Chris argues that the term "artificial intelligence" can sometimes be misleading, as it suggests a level of autonomy and consciousness that these systems do not possess. Instead, he suggests using the term "automated intelligence" to better reflect the reality that AI's capabilities are directly influenced by the quality of the data it is fed and the sophistication of its programming.

He also points out that companies selling AI products should be held accountable for their performance and outcomes. Businesses considering AI solutions must understand that the effectiveness of these systems is not a magic solution but a tool that requires careful management and oversight to ensure it operates as intended without introducing biases or errors.

In conclusion, Chris urges us to approach AI with a clear understanding of its capabilities and limitations, rather than being mystified by its capabilities. The true threat of AI is not an uprising of intelligent machines but the potential for humans to abdicate responsibility and fall into automated systemic stupidity.
