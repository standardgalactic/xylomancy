Good afternoon everybody, I'm Andrew Ross Sorkin and it is a privilege to have with
me Peter Thiel this afternoon, one of the great legendary investors in Silicon Valley.
He has been involved in just about everything that you touch and feel, including being the
co-founder of PayPal, the co-founder of Palantir, he made his first outside investment, made
the first outside investment, I should say in Facebook, his firm Founders Fund is a big
backer of Stripe and SpaceX, his firm backed numerous other startups through the Founders
Fund and Thiel Capital.
He also started the Thiel Fellowship to your program that's an alternative to a college
degree which I want to get to at one point and more importantly than all of it he has
touched some of the people and found the people who you read about in the headlines every
day from Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk to Sam Altman and so many others and it is great
to have you here.
Thanks for having me.
We're also going to talk a little politics as well, along with maybe some of the issues
and culture conversations that are happening in Silicon Valley but here's where I want
to start the conversation because I want to start the conversation talking about people
because I think there's something actually extraordinary when you think about your track
record over the years of involving yourself in investing not just in companies but ultimately
in people.
You wrote a book which is coming on a 10-year anniversary and by the way I re-read it and
it stands up in a very big way.
It is called Zero to One and you wrote the following about founders, the idea of founders.
You wrote that the lesson for business is that we need founders.
If anything, we should be more tolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme.
We need unusual individuals to lead companies beyond mere incrementalism and I mention that
because I also just mentioned a number of individuals which we read about all the time
and some of those people would be described as unusual perhaps or even strange.
And I'm curious about how you think over the years you have found these individuals, what
it is that has made these individuals as successful as they have become.
Yeah, it's obviously, if there was some simple magic formula, this is what a founder looks
like and you invest in this category of people who's a founder, it probably gets faked.
It's like, I don't know, it's a 20-year-old with a t-shirt and jeans or something like
this or you end up with all kinds of really fake ideas.
But yeah, I think a lot of the great companies that have been built over the last two decades
were, you know, somehow they were founded by people where it was somehow deeply connected
to their identity, their life project, they had some kind of idiosyncratic, somewhat different
vision of what they were doing, they did something new and then they built something extraordinarily
big over the years.
And of course they have these sort of extreme personalities, often have a lot of blind spots
and there are all these ways in which it's a feature and there are ways in which it can
be a little bit buggy, but it's sort of a package deal and I net out to it being massively
advantageous versus let's say a professional CEO being brought in.
The prehistory of this, I would say, would be in the 1990s, the Silicon Valley formula
was you had various people found the company and then you'd replace them as quickly as
possible with professional CEOs, professional management, and there are variations of this
that happen with Netscape and Yahoo and even Google, all these sort of, all these companies
and sort of the Gen X people founded them, the baby boomers came along and sort of took
over the companies and stole them from the Gen X founders in the 90s.
In the 2000s, when the millennials founded the companies, they were given more of an
opportunity and it made a big difference.
The Facebook story I always tell is it was 2006, two years in, Zuckerberg was like 22
years old and we got a $1 billion offer to sell the company to Yahoo and we had a board
meeting, there were three of us and we thought we should at least talk about it.
It was a lot of money, Zuckerberg would make $250 million and serve an eight hour long
discussion and he didn't know what he'd do with the money and he'd just start another
social networking company kind of like the one he had and he didn't know what else he
would do and so he really didn't want to sell and if you had a professional CEO, it would
have just been, man I can't believe they're offering us a billion dollars and I'm going
to try not to be too eager and we better take the money and run and getting that one thing
right makes a big difference.
Let me ask you a different question and all of these individuals had a huge impact on
society and have an enormous individual power and I think one of the things that you've
argued in this book and that you've argued over the years is that we need to give them
that power, we need to offer them a latitude that in many ways we don't offer others.
Well, I think one of the frames I always have is that there are many ways in which the United
States, the developed countries have been relatively stagnant for the last 50 years.
Progress has slowed.
We had progress in computers, internet, software and many other domains, things have kind of
stalled out and it sort of manifests in low economic growth in the sense that the younger
generation is going to have a tough time doing as well as their parents and there is sort
of this way that there has been this broad stagnation for 40, 50 years and we need to
find ways to do new things.
I don't think, you know, startup, tech startup companies are the only ways to do them, that
is a vehicle for doing it and yeah, if you don't allow these companies to have a certain
latitude and flexibility to try to do new things, we shut it down right away, you know,
the stagnation will be worse than ever.
Okay, but here's a separate almost philosophical question.
I'm going to read back something you said to the New Yorker, there was a piece about Sam
Altman.
This is right around actually when open AI began, 2016 and I think it actually might
even be representative of how you might think about Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or some
of these other kinds of major players.
This is what you said, you said, Sam's program for the world is anchored by ideas, not people
and that's what makes it powerful because it doesn't immediately get derailed by questions
of popularity and I thought that that was actually very indicative of most of the people
that you have invested in, it's really been about ideas and in some ways you could even
argue is disconnected from people.
It's, you know, I think it is really about a whole wide, people are, they're able to
think about it a wide spectrum of things.
They're able to think about, you know, the good founders have theories of how to hire
people, how to manage them, how to build teams, they have theories about where the culture,
the societies were going, they have technical things about the product, the design, they
have ideas about how they should market their company.
So they're sort of polymaths are able to think about, you know, a lot of these things
but yeah, I'm biased towards a lot of the ones where it's more intellectual and maybe,
but I think that quote has held up pretty well with Sam Altman, maybe he needed to pay
a little bit more attention to the board and things like that and there was probably a
people dimension that he had ignored a little bit too much in November 2016.
Since we're on the Sam Altman of it all and since Sam was here yesterday, I'm so curious,
you were a mentor of his, what do you think of open AI and what do you think of AI more
broadly right now?
I mean, are we in a bubble?
Is this the future?
What is this?
Wow, it's a broad question.
I think, I'm always hesitant to talk about it because I feel there's so many things I
would have said about AI where I would have been very wrong two, three years ago, so maybe
I'll start by just saying a little bit about the history of what people thought was going
to happen and then the surprising thing that Open AI achieved and that did happen and if
you had this debate in the 2010s, there was sort of one, maybe frame in terms of two paradigms,
two books, there was the Boston Book Superintelligence 2014 which is that AI was going to build this
god-like superhuman intelligence.
This was, it was heading towards this god-like oracle and that was what AI was going to be
and then there was the Kaifu Lee, a rebuttal 2018 AI superpowers which was sort of the
CCP rebuttal to Silicon Valley that no, AI is not about god-like intelligence, that's
a science fiction fantasy Silicon Valley has, AI is going to be about machine learning,
data collection, it's not conscious, it's not any of these weird things, it's surveillance
tech and China is going to beat the US in the race for AI because we have no qualms about
sort of this totalitarian, not the word he used, collection of data in our society and
that was sort of the way the AI debate got framed and then, you know, the thing I always
said was, man it's just such a weird word, it means all these different things, it's
annoyingly undefined but then the sort of surprising and strangely unexpected thing
that happened is that in some sense what open AI with chat GPT 3.54 achieved in late 22,
early 23 was you passed the Turing test which was not super intelligence, it's not god-like,
it's not low-tech surveillance but that had been the holy grail of AI for 60 or 70 years
and it's a fuzzy line, the Turing test is you have a computer that can convince you
that it's a human being and it's a somewhat fuzzy line but it pretty clearly hadn't been
passed before, it pretty clearly is passed now and that's a really extraordinary achievement,
it's extremely, it raises all sorts of interesting big picture questions, what does it mean to
be a human being in 2024?
You know, the sort of placeholder answer I would have been tempted to give a couple
of years ago would be something like the Noam Chomsky idea that something very important
about language, this is what sets humans apart from all the other animals, we talk to each
other and we have these rich semantic syntax things and so if a computer can replicate
that, what does that mean for all of us in this room?
So it's an extraordinary development and it was also somehow, even though it had been
the holy grail, somehow in the last decade before, it was not expected at all and so
there's something very significant about it and very underrated and then of course you
get all these questions about, is it going to, the econ one question, is it a compliment,
is it going to make people more productive or is it a substitute, good, where it's going
to replace it?
So what do you think of all of this and how bullish as an investor are you on this?
I mean what do you think our society, when you hear Sam Altman talk about this, you
say he's right, that's what it's going to be, do you think it's going to be something
else?
You lived through 1999, there's some people who say this is a hype cycle, other people
say this is the future.
Well it's, I'm very anchored on the 99 history and I somehow always like to say that 99
is both, it was, the peak of the bubble was also in a sense the peak of clarity, people
to realize the new economy is going to replace the old economy, the internet was going to
be the most important thing in the 21st century and people were right about that and then
the specific investments were incredibly hard to make and even the no brainer market leader,
so if you said 1999, the no brainer investment would have been Amazon stock, it's a leading
e-commerce company and they're going to scale and they'll get bigger and it peaked in December
1999 at $113 a share, it was $5.5 in October 2001, 22 months later, you then had to wait
till the end of 2009 to get to back to the 99 highs and then if you'd waited till today
you would have made 25 times your money from 1999, you would first lost, you'd have gone
down 95% and then made 500x, so even the no brainer investment from 1999 was wickedly
tricky to pull off in retrospect and I sort of think that AI, the LLM form of AI, large
language models, large language models, again, that's passing the Turing test, I think it's
roughly on the scale of the internet and so it's an incredibly important thing, it's
going to be very important socially, politically, philosophically, about all these questions
about meaning and then the financial investment question I find unbelievably hard and confusing
and yeah, it's probably quite tricky. If you had to sort of concretize it, one thing that's
very strange about, if you sort of just follow the money, at this point 80% to 85% of the
money in AI is being made by one company, it's NVIDIA, it's all on this sort of very
weird hardware layer, which Silicon Valley doesn't even know very much about anymore,
we don't really do hardware, we don't do silicon chips in Silicon Valley anymore, I get pitched
on these companies once every three or four years and it's always, I have no clue how
to do this, it sounds like a pretty good idea but man, I have no clue and we never invest
and then there's sort of this theory that the hardware piece makes the money initially
then gets more commodified over time and it'll shift to software and the multi trillion
dollar question, is that going to be true again this time or will NVIDIA sort of have
this incredible monopoly? And what's your bet at the moment?
I suspect NVIDIA will, I think it will maintain its position for a while, I think the game
theory on it is something like all the big tech companies are going to start to try to
design their own AI chips so they don't have to do the 10x markup to NVIDIA and then how
hard is it for them to do it, how long will it take, if they all do it then the chips
become a commodity and nobody makes money in chips and so then do you go into hardware
and you should do it if nobody else is doing it, if everybody does it you shouldn't do
it and then maybe, I'm not sure how that nets out but probably people stay stuck for a while
and NVIDIA goes from strength to strength for a while.
I have a related but maybe personal question for you, you happen to have this very interesting
relationship with Sam Altman and then also a very interesting relationship with Elon Musk.
You both worked at PayPal, you famously were part of a coup effectively to push Elon Musk
out of the company, you're now friends with him all over again and have a stake in SpaceX,
you can maybe walk us through that friendship.
We had some rough moments in 2000, 2001 but it's been cool.
We can get into that if you want but we're always going to go with this actually is one
of the things that's been fascinating and fascinating to the valley and I think to the
country has been the commentary we've heard from Elon Musk who helped build open AI with
Sam and the break actually between the two of them as creating this not-for-profit and
what's happened to it, in fact, Elon Musk originally sued Sam earlier this year and
then dropped the suit recently but how do you think about this idea of a company that was
started as a not-for-profit and all of the safety concerns and things that you hear from
Elon on one side and Sam on the other?
Man, it's whichever person I talk to last I find the most convincing probably so you
know I talked to Elon about it and he made this argument it's just completely illegal
for a non-profit to become a for-profit company because otherwise everyone would set up companies
as non-profits and take advantage of the tax laws and then you turn them into a for-profit
and this is the most obvious arb and they just can't be allowed to do this is obviously
just totally illegal with what Sam's trying to do at open AI and then like half an hour
after the conversation was over I was thinking in the moment it's like oh that's a really
strong argument and then half an hour later it's like but you know the whole history of
open AI is that the biggest handicap they had was a non-profit and it led to all these
crazy conflicting things culminating in this non-profit board that thought it was better
to shut down the company or the whole venture or whatever you want to call it rather than
keep going and nobody is ever going to take the lesson from open AI to start a non-profit
and turn it into a for-profit later given what a total disaster that was.
But whoever I listen to last I find the most compelling.
Let me ask you a different question you left Silicon Valley you have now moved to Los Angeles
that's your home.
We left San Francisco specifically yeah it was sort of just it just felt it was time
to get out.
So tell us why it was time to get up because I think a lot of the issues that actually
we read about whether around an open AI and some of the culture issues add a lot of these
companies are the reason you decided you don't want to live there anymore.
It was man it's hard to it's a bunch of things that came together but it was there was a
sense that it was sort of the ground zero of the most unhinged place in the country.
It was you had this you had this catastrophic homeless problem which maybe is not the most
important problem but sort of a and it was it was never getting better.
You had it was by 2018 when we moved to LA it felt like it had become extraordinarily
self-hating where you know everybody who is not in tech hated the tech industry and this
would be this is very odd it would be like the people in Houston hating oil or people
in Detroit hating cars you know people in New York hating finance and so it had had
this it had this unhinged self-hating character in the city itself and there were all these
things that seemed extraordinarily unhealthy and and if you asked me in 2021 you know I
would have said man they are they are finally you know yes you're they're sitting on the
biggest you know they created all this wealth and yet they are going to succeed in committing
suicide three years later you know I think the jury is a little bit more out because
it may be maybe the AI revolution is big enough that it will save even the most you know I
don't know the most the most ridiculously mismanaged city in the country.
It seemed to me that's sort of the I thought that part of the issue that you had with San
Francisco was the politics of it and and and not just the politics of it but how politics
had seeped into the culture of so many of the companies and feeling I think that you
thought that it had moved in a very progressive way.
Yeah that's that's always that's always a that's always a very clear dimension of it
but and that's sort of the tip of the iceberg that's the part that's above the surface that
people always focus on and it and then the part that's you know below the surface is
is just the the deep corruption the you know the mismanagement of the schools the buses
all the public services the way things don't work the way the zoning is the most absurd
in the country you know there was I don't know there's a house I was looking to buy
where you couldn't you couldn't build access into the garage and Gavin Newsom who's the
lieutenant governor of California at the time said he'd help me get a garage access
permit again it's not clear that's what the lieutenant governor of the fifth largest economy
in the world should be doing get it but he said he knew how to do this in San Francisco
and the circa 2013 and then and then you know you needed to get it you need to get the neighbors
to sign off which was maybe doable and then you needed to go to the board of supervisors
because you had to build a a staircase and it was a public walkway and that the whole
public had a comment nobody knew what happened then but then even harder there a tree had
grown where the driveway was supposed to be and needed a tree removal permit and this
was the sort of thing that that you would you would never get and so you can describe
all this is like crazy left-wing ideology but I think it's more you know it's more like
you know really really deep corruption and then this is you know this is in a way the
San Francisco problem it's the it's the it's the California problem the analogy I have
if you want to think about the economy of California in some ways it's analogous to
Saudi Arabia you have these you have these you know you have a very mismanaged state
government there's a lot of insane ideology that goes with it but you have these incredible
gushers called the big tech companies and and then there's a way the the the super insane
governance is linked to the of the gold rush of the place and and so yeah there's sort
of though there's there's some point where it'll be too crazy even for California but
California can get away with a lot of stuff you wouldn't get away with elsewhere San Francisco
my judgment had gone a little bit too far maybe the I thing is they found one more giant
gusher and you know maybe you don't have any Saudi money in your fund I hope virtually
not no just just in case here's a different question though because it gets to the politics
of this which is there's been it seems like a shift inside Silicon Valley and a shift
in terms even the way the companies are managed around in a political dimension and you were
very outspoken obviously you supported President Trump in the in the last go around but speak
to what do you think and I want to get to that part too but I want you to speak first
to the the shift in the valley at least what seems like a shift perception wise from being
a very progressive place to maybe less so maybe not maybe it's just the you know large
summers and I spoke this afternoon and he said there's you know 10 people he thinks
are very loud on Twitter and that's why the world thinks you know that between David
sacks and you know a bunch of other people that and Elon Musk that's that that that's
not representative but I think you may have a different view well you know I don't I don't
think you know I don't think you'll get a majority of tech people to support Trump
over Biden or anything like that I think you'll get way more than you had four or eight years
ago so you know I don't know if you're measuring a relative shift or an absolute number those
are those are probably two different measures on that but I would say that if we ask a very
different question about let's say you know extreme wokeness or I don't know what you're
supposed to call it there is probably you know a broad consensus among the the good tech
founders startup CEOs people people across a pretty broad range that it's gone way too
far I talked to a lot of these people a lot of them are you know I'd say more centrist
Democrats but it is just you know we need to have a secret plan to fight fight this and
they are what they tell me behind closed doors is way way tougher than what they what they
dare say in public and so it is like you know we need to have a plan to hire fewer people
from San Francisco because that's where the people the employees are the crazy if you
want to have a less woke workforce we need to you know we're gonna have targets about
how we steadily move our company out of San Francisco specifically and and yeah these
are these are the sort of conversations that I've and you agree with this and by the way
let me just read you probably know that you probably know Alex Alex Wang scale AI CEO
yes who said that he's he's put together what he calls a merit based hiring program he said
he's getting rid of DEI says hiring on merit will be a permanent policy at scale it's a big deal
whenever we invite someone to join our mission and those decisions have never been swayed by
orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is I think of our guiding principle
as MEI merit excellence and intelligence Bill Ackman went on to say that he thinks DEI is
actually inherently a racist and illegal movement yeah I again my my my feel for there aren't
that many people who are willing to say what Alex says but I think there are an awful lot
of people are pretty close to thinking this that you know there were there were ways they
leaned into the the DEI thing it was like an anti-Trump thing it was like a everything was
sort of polarized around Trump for the last four years of his presidency and so you know you
have to demonstrate that you're anti-Trump by being even more pro DEI that's of course not
necessarily a logical thing but yes people somehow ended up ended up in this in this in this
place that was that was very different and then you know that they're probably there always are
questions what drove the the DEI movement the the wokeness in these companies and it probably is
over determined you know they're there probably is a there's a bottom-up you know woke millennial
people who are brainwashed into DEI in their colleges that's sort of the bottom-up theory
there's sort of a I don't know there's sort of a cynical corporate version where this is you
know the leadership of the company either believed it or used it as sort of a as a way to to manage
and control their companies in certain ways you know the part that I always feel is a little bit
underestimated is there was probably also some top-down level from a government regulatory point
of view where you know if you if you don't do DEI there is some point where you get you do get
in trouble you know if you if you know I don't know this is part of the ESG movement now I mean
well look we talked we talked about this year there's an ESG movement and then there were probably
all these these governmental versions and so I don't know this this would be probably if my
candidate for the company in Silicon Valley it's still probably the most woke would be would be
something like like Google and it's less woke than it was two three years ago but in some ways
you know they have a total monopoly in search and so there's sort of some way in which you know if
wokeness is a luxury good like you can afford it more if you're a monopoly than if you're not and
then and then the problem for for Google as a pretty big monopoly is that it's always gonna be
subject to a lot more regulatory pressure from the government and so if you have something like the
Gemini the Gemini AI engine and you know and it's sort of sort of this comical absurdist thing where
it generates these black women Nazis you know and you're supposed to find famous famous Nazis and
then the diversity criterion gets applied across the board and so it just generates fake black women
who are Nazis which is you know a little bit too progressive I think but but but then but then if
you think of it in terms of this larger political context on Google will never get in trouble for
that the FDC will never sue them for misinformation or anything like that that that's not that that
stuff does not get fact-checked you don't really get in trouble and you probably even get some
protection where okay you know you are you're going along with the woke directives from the ESG
people or the government maybe you overdid it a little bit but we trust you to be good in other
things so that there may be a very different calculus if you're a sort of a large quasi-regulated
monopoly let me ask about large quasi-regulated monopolies and also concentration but I want
to read you this is something you actually wrote in your book 10 years ago about Google and it being
a monopoly you said since it doesn't have to worry about competing with anyone it has wider
latitude to care about its workers its products and its impact on the wider world Google's motto
don't be evil is in part a brand employee but it's also characteristic of a kind of business
that's successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence in business
money is either an important thing or it's everything monopolist can't afford to think about
things other than making money non monopolist can't in a perfect competition a business is so
focused on today's margin that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future only one thing can
allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival monopoly profits were you
writing in favor then of the monopoly idea or against oh I I will I said well look my book was
giving you advice for what to do and and from the inside you always want to do something like what
Google did if you're starting a company you know you know it's always a competition is for losers
or you know capitalism and competition people always say their synonyms I think their antonym
because you know if you have perfect competition you compete away all the capital if you want to
have Darwinian competition bared red and tooth and claw you should open a restaurant it's like
an awful awful business you will never make any money it's perfectly competitive and completely
non-capitalist and so so from the inside you want to always go for for for something like like
monopoly and then and then yes there are in other parts of my book I also qualify it that you know
there are there you know there are dynamic monopolies that invent something new that
create something new for the world and we reward them with patents or you know the sorts of things
like that that that they get and then at some point there's always a risk that that these
monopolies go bad that they become like a you know like a troll collecting a toll at a bridge
that they're not dynamic and that they sort of become that fat are we there yet I mean Lena
Khan if she was sitting here would say we got there a long time ago I I think man I there are
all these all these ways I would I would if I had to defend Google and I would still say that
that it's it's it is it's still better run even in its silly woke way even in a in a slightly
troll-like toll collecting way than whatever a completely destructive path Lena Khan would
have for the company and so we're still getting more good from from Google as I do you feel the
way about all the big tech companies do you I mean you have lots of investments in smaller
companies that need to access the app store on Apple's phone do you say to yourself that it
should be opened up do you say they created the store there's therefore they should control
the store how do you think about that kind of stuff there's sort of our there yeah there's
sort of our a lot of complicated questions and all these things it's obviously yeah they're
much bigger we're in a very different place from where you were you were ten years ago on
these things I still worry that in many cases the remedy is worse than the disease a lot of
these businesses are you know you know if you have a natural monopoly the remedy is not to break
it up the remedy is to it's like a utility company and then the remedy is to you know
regulated or tax it or do various things like that so if you if you could convince me that we are
a static as a utility company then then maybe the the remedy is to is to do something like that
but but you know the you know to the extent the the the the real monopoly problems in our society
I think are are much more these old economy racket like companies you know I spent three months
during covid in Maui and there's like a there's a single hospital in Maui and the line and the
Hawaiian island and there was sort of this line if you have a pain get on a plane because it's a
local racket it's completely mismanaged and and that's probably you know the the really dysfunctional
monopolies in our society are these you know pretty big ones that control these local markets
and that are you know 100% troll collecting and I I think yeah I think even with all my
misgivings about something like Google it is it's a vastly morally superior place to to your local
hospital how do you feel about it in the context of AI which is to say that if you believe AI is
this transformative product and that there's only going to be three or four players who are going
to control all of these models whether it be Google or Microsoft with open AI or maybe an Amazon
along the way but I don't know where you think Apple is going to land in this in this conversation
but is that a good thing or a bad thing and also I would argue even as an investor who looks at
startups how do you even look at startups down the line that could effectively get competed away
because I'm going to basically build my app with AI and I'm just going to copy what you've made
well I think I think it's uh I think it's in a very different place from the consumer internet
type businesses or which yeah there's been a history they've been around for for decades if I you
know if I had to make the anti-google argument it would be you know they they they won at search
in 2002 and there's been no serious competition for 21-22 years they beat Microsoft and Yahoo in
2002 and and then you know it's somehow very hard to to to disrupt that and then I think
I think the AI piece is extremely fluid it's extremely hard to know
it's very hard to know where the the value is and as I said it's like the the obvious monopoly
right now is is Nvidia and but it it it doesn't seem right that durable that's you know if you
thought Nvidia is as durable as Google I mean the stock's really cheap you should just you should
just buy it like crazy and so the the market pricing is telling you is yeah they have a temporary
monopoly but it's it's not very robust and then on the yeah on the level of the of the software
companies I worry that it's you know open AI has a lead all sorts of other people you know are
going to be able to catch up pretty quickly and it's yeah if you have three or four doing the same
thing that's a lot more than one I want to pivot very very very different set of economics I want
to pivot the conversation again because another investment that you've made and been very public
about is Bitcoin and you have remained a very big bull you have come out publicly and you said that
enemy number one to Bitcoin is the sociopathic grandpa from Omaha that you described as Warren
Buffett can you tell me what you were thinking when you said that it got a lot of laughs so somehow
people it probably had some kind of a some kind of a nerve but it uh it was um it the the uh you
you know the in it was in in a 2022 Bitcoin convention talk I gave and and the I had there
were there were three separate enemies there was a Jamie Diamond Larry Larry Fink who's no longer
an enemy by the way yeah he's sort of he's sort of shifted with maybe that maybe I but yeah well
that's I'll I can say the mental Larry Fink things too but um and then there was uh and then there
was uh Warren Buffett and the the uh the rough context was uh you know I my my sort of I know
political sociological analysis was the cryptocurrencies were it was a revolutionary youth
movement but for them to really take over you needed you needed um it couldn't just be a student
uprising like 1968 you needed to get the rest of the society on board and um and as long as the old
people were going to sit on their hands um that was the big blocker for um for cryptocurrencies to
to go to the next level and uh are you still convinced I think it's gotten partially unlocked
with the uh the um the the Bitcoin ETF um um uh but then there you know probably the the part where
I'm um less less convinced of is this this question of um the sort of ideological founding vision of
Bitcoin or these cryptocurrencies as sort of a you know um cypherpunk crypto anarchist libertarian
anti centralized government thing you know this is always you know the line what got you interested
in the first place that's that's that's what I that's what I uh that's what I thought was terrific
about it and the and then you know the question is does it really work that way or you know has
that thread somehow gotten lost and so when people in the FBI tell me that they'd much rather have
criminals use Bitcoin than hundred dollar bills um it suggests that maybe you know maybe it's not
quite not quite working the way we're supposed to have you sold any of your Bitcoin I I still hold
some I yeah I you know there are all these ways I I I didn't buy as much as I should have um and uh
I I I'm I'm I'm not I'm not I'm not sure it's gonna go up that dramatically from here from here
yeah I think we got the we got the ETF edition and I don't know who else who else buys it
quickly from here it's an interesting investment advice uh that that that actually surprised me
because I don't think I've heard you I thought you were still all in it um I still have a small
position it it probably still can go up some but it's going to be a volatile bumpy ride and uh and
uh I am I'm I was I had a dual dual reason one was the sort of you know ideological decentralized
future of computing world that I I really do believe in really believe would be would be better
and it seemed like the perfect vehicle for that for for such a long time and I'm
I am just much less convinced of that and so I interesting so maybe so maybe maybe
maybe Larry Fink with the um BlackRock ETF surrendered to the forces the anti ESG forces
or maybe um um uh it's it's more like Bitcoin's been co-opted by by them and I worry it was more
the latter okay different question uh SpaceX that's another big investment for you you after
ousting uh Elon Musk you you became friends with him again what does that look like to you in the
future is that is that going to be the biggest investment you've ever made when this is all
said and done um man it's uh it's I'm always sort of hesitant to to um to uh to sort of pitch
pitch these companies um too much but um I think uh yeah I mean there were sort of a
lot of different different things that came together uh you know when Elon was building
both Tesla and SpaceX in the 2000s I mean people thought you know he was just really really crazy
and I think you know even even a lot of those of us had worked with him at PayPal there was you
know this I know there's this PayPal book that uh uh David Sacks and I thought of writing and the you
know the um the Elon chapter was um I think entitled something like The Man Who Knew Nothing
About Risk or something like this and you know there are all these sort of crazy Elon stories I
could tell and then um and then you know if one of the two companies had succeeded you would say
well maybe he still got really lucky but when two out of two companies that people thought were
completely harebrained in the 2000s when they they both succeed um man you have to you have to
somehow reassess it and somehow the rest of us somehow are too risk averse or there's something
about risk he knows that we don't or or something like this um and uh and so yes I think there's um
and then you didn't invest in Tesla we we did not invest in Tesla we you know we we should have
invested we should have invested in that one it was it was public at a much earlier date and then
you know there's always sort of you know self-imposed limitation that we tend not to invest in public
companies or you know 20% of the venture fund you could but uh but that was sort of the the uh
and I think I think the they started Tesla in 2002 it went public in 2010 you know I remember test
driving the the Model S in October 2012 and um it was just wow this is just a terrific car
and um you could have I think the correct thing would have been to wait till they came out with it
and then nobody liked it it was such a you know hated stock shorted by everybody and you could have
just waited waited 10 years and just bought the shares in the public market and you would have made
10 times your money in 18 months and 100 times and in the next you know six seven years um
um seven eight years and um and then um and then there was something also um about SpaceX
that looked like it was a very crazy hairbrained idea and yet it was very straightforward you
know it was the uh the the launch rocket launch business um if you the government will pay or
the customers pay for the vehicles before you build them so it's actually cash flow positive
from a very you know there's there's some money they needed for expansion but it was
basically a cash flow positive business it was a weird investment in 2008 they didn't need any of
the money but there was some um I think some NASA or government rule where they needed outside
investors and so um so they were forced to take investors and then you know we were on good enough
terms that we did it and everyone else thought it was too crazy if you had been a Tesla shareholder
we've all been reading about it would have you paid him the big compensation package um I would have
well I I think the I think the nuance dancer is I would have voted in favor of the compensation
package because you would know that if it failed the share price would have gone down a lot the
next day because people would wonder whether Elon would quit and that would be bad for the company
so um whether you believe in the package or not the rational thing would be that you should
vote for it uh and then uh if you if you think it's a bad idea maybe you sell your shares after
you get a pop or something like this so uh and that that's that's the obvious game theory on why
Elon was going to win that vote no matter what and uh and it was it was really crazy that that we
listened to people in the media and I'm sure yourself but uh we're all saying it was this
harebrained thing and the shareholders are all going to vote against it and if you just did the
basic analysis it was uh it was obvious it was obviously Elon was going to win the vote regardless
what the shareholders what did you think of him investing in x did you he think by the way x is
what he wants he wanted PayPal to be did you did you give him money for that um I uh we we um we
did yeah we didn't do we didn't do anything on the on the on the on the on the on the on the current
xai company because there's sort of a lot of different things that have x in the name uh with
Elon but um um but it um but yeah it basically uh I I don't know I I I think it was a um
incredibly um you know I I do think we like a broader surface area for debate in our society
and so and so I think um and you know obviously all these very complicated trade-offs between you
know how much speech do you suppress how much you know you know how much good speech are we
suppressing how much bad speech are we allowing how do you get those trade-offs right very very
very hard to do my judgment is you know we should have just um a lot more surface area for debate
discussion and uh I think what you know what Elon did with twitter was I think extremely important
and I I support it as an ideological project I worry about it as a uh as a financial
as a as a financial thing I don't know if that works you know we've we've looked over the years
we've looked over and over again at you know starting some kind of media company and there's
always sort of this thought you could do can't you do something else in the sort of right of center
media space and you know it doesn't have to all be as lame as fox news you know can't isn't there's
opening to do something else and then uh the question you always have to ask is it you know
is it is it the murdoch family that keeps it lame or is it why do you why do you think you call
the lame so why do you think I think it's lame because they're controlled by the advertisers
and there's there's a very there's a there's a very narrow limit on what they they can do
and then the uh the elon question with twitter was um you know are you really allowed to do this
and keep the advertisers and so that's that's where would you would make it harder it's it's
super important what elon did as a as a non-profit but it's yeah it may not it it's gonna be tough
as a better what about what about truth social um uh they have a they have a few other problems
they have to solve first now it's something you'd invest in um you get your head around the six
billion dollar valuation you know if I if I wanted to secretly funnel money to the trump campaign
violation you know get around the campaign uh limitations so the stock price goes up and
he can sell some stock and fund his campaign that might that might be a reason to invest do you
think people are doing that um uh I probably not that they probably don't think of it in quite
quite that literal term but that's maybe that's what's you know people who have you talked to
people in in your realm who've said hey that's nobody's nobody's nobody's nobody's said that but uh
yeah it's probably I suspect a lot of the investors are gonna vote for trump so
so they're they're thinking about it at least on some subconscious not articulated level
sure I want to talk about trump a little more about trump just one more second but I want to
ask you one last one last related social media question which is the search in general was here
in aspen um and I I think you've probably seen in the last uh couple weeks that he came out and
genuinely believes that social media and the facebook's of the world really
have done a real disservice to young people in in the country and I just wonder what you think of
that as somebody who invested early in facebook um man there's uh
uh uh I I think you know I I can't say that he's 100 wrong um I the place where I always push back
on is that I feel it's uh it's too easy to turn tech or the social media companies into the scapegoat
for all of our problems and so yes there's probably there is some kind of a interesting critique one
can make of the tech companies um and um and if you ask how many of the executives in in those
companies how much screen time do they let their kids use and there's probably sort of an interesting
critique one could make what you do not very much and I think that's very what's not very much
an hour and a half a week an hour and a half a week something like that um how old how old are
your kids three and a half five years three and a half and five years old okay but but um but
and I think I think that that is sort of if I had to do the if I were to make the anti-tech
argument it's that uh there are probably um a lot of people in tech who do something quite
similar for their own families and that and there's some questions that that might lead you to ask
and then on the on the other hand um it you know I don't think this is you know uh the main cause
for all the different types of social dysfunction we have and uh it's maybe it's a 15 percent 20
percent cause you know there's you know there's there's sort of a lot of other things that have
gone super haywire in our society and and uh and by putting all the blame onto you know this this uh
onto tech or onto one company you are uh you know really ignoring a lot of other stuff we could do
a whole panel on this but one related question uh because we haven't mentioned it tiktok do you
think of tiktok as a national security threat it's um yeah it's it's it's it's it's a very it's
a it's something very strange going on since obviously the tiktok algorithms for the us are
very different from the bite dance algorithms in china and so would you shut would you shut it down
in this country uh I think um I probably would would lean towards towards a a tougher response I
think just to shift from the normative to the I don't think we're going to do anything you know I
I met the tiktok CEO last summer and I I was the Singaporean guy the tiktok CEO and I and I told him
he didn't need to worry about it being shut down in the US and maybe I'm wrong but I think because
you know because because because it will not we are incompetent and slow and bureaucratic and we
will never get our act together and dealing with the problems of china until the day they invite
bade taiwan and then it will be shut down within 24 hours and and since I think there's a 50 50 chance
that china will invade taiwan in the next five years my advice the tiktok CEO was you should
take all your people and computers and get them out of china because once once once taiwan gets
invaded it'll be uh it'll be too late so that's that's my advice but you don't need to worry about
us doing anything before then and then his his and then his somewhat you know is somewhat I'm not
good or worry some answer was that they had studied world war one and world war two very
carefully and there were a bunch of companies that were able to trade with all sides in those wars
by the way that implies that he also thinks that china is going to invade taiwan he he did not
you know again it was again I didn't frame it deterministically I said 50 chance five years
we are over time but we're going to keep going just for a little bit because I promise you we're
going to talk a little bit about politics and I want to talk about your own politics your own
personal politics you were very vocal and outspoken about supporting what who is now the former
president the last time um you have been less outspoken this time we're all going to watch
the debate tonight so before we even get into the lessons and everything that you've you've
learned and all of your private prior experience are you planning to support the president this time
you know um I I'm the former president I should say you know you hold the gun to my head I I
I'll I'll vote for Trump I'll still I'd rather I'd rather have him vote than Biden I'm not going
to give any money to his super PAC and you know I'm going to be be be less involved um in in all
these ways and uh and man look it's it's it is um and then I I don't know I I think you know I think
I think Trump will win I think he will win quite quite solidly it it's not I don't think it's going
to even be close um and then then my my my pessimistic look ahead function is after he wins there will
be a lot of buyer's remorse because the elections are ab tests you know it's if you ask me to make
a pro-trump argument I I wouldn't but I can probably come up with anti-biden arguments
and Biden is not going to make a pro-biden argument he's going to make anti-trump arguments and it's
it's these two different hate factories that we have targeted at each other and that's
that's the way the politics work and I my judgment is Trump will easily win that but um yeah the
election is a relative choice the post-election is absolute and then it'll be like you know if
Biden wins like how did we get this senile old man and if uh if Trump wins it'll be wow this is
you know can I just ask you it's it's still like this this this clown show or whatever whatever
people will say I'm not going to ask you to make the pro-trump argument but that's that's that's
sort of I understand but let me ask you about what I imagine is your anti-biden argument I look at
the last four years and say to myself if you were in Silicon Valley and you owned stock and these
tech companies over the last four years they virtually did nothing but go up and I know and I
just I wonder if you can make the argument because we can talk about Lena Khan and we can talk about
regulations and uh potential taxes and all sorts of things but it's hard for me to look at the
last four years and say especially if I was sitting I would imagine in your seat and say
this was it this was a terrible travesty but maybe maybe I don't understand well I mean I I don't
know this this may not be believable to you but I you know I um I don't think it's uh the only thing
I care about is whether the country is good for the tech billionaires and uh and I think there are
a lot of people who have not experienced the last three or four years this way I I think you know
one of the things Carvel said in the earlier the presentation just before this one that I thought
was quite good was you know there's been a shocking loss of support by the Democrats in the you know
18 to 35 year voters and it's because you can't get on the housing ladder um you you can you can
you know the college debt's overwhelming you can never get started and so there's sort of a sense
that uh and you think he'd be able to fix that um I don't I there's uh I think it's I think it's
it's just an up-down referendum on the incumbent at this point and you know the my guess is that
the census Biden's definitely not going to fix it and his time will will run out and that's
and then and then no and then this is where I'm not overly excited I you know I don't think Trump
will particularly fix it but but look the the place where people you know at at this in the
audience here I think are just maximally divergence yes your your stock market has been great for
people here um you're in this you know wonderful bubble in aspen where it's like I know clinton
is still president and it's 1995 and um and uh and everything is just getting better every day
in every way and it's like some new age chant if you just say that to yourselves it's true and um
and uh and then you know the the the the the part of the trump statement that I think was
um the most offensive thing he said it was very offensive not just you know democrats and to
republic to love republicans and especially silicon valley was make america great again
because that was a pessimistic slogan it was the most pessimistic slogan a major presidential
candidate ever had because what it says implicitly is this is no longer a great country right and
that's what you are never supposed to say especially if you're a republican that's why I
like the bush people probably hate him more than anybody in this audience you know and um
and uh and then and then silicon valley was you know it's not it's somewhat offensive to people
new york city but you know the bankers on wall street don't really think they're making the
country a great place so it's not personally offensive it was personally offensive to to
silicon valley and uh and yet I I I always think you know there is there is this this problem of
stagnation there is this problem we're stuck there's a sense that um you know we are we're not
progressing in all these ways as a society as as much as we have I don't I don't think trump has
all the answers uh but I think you know the what I what I said in 2016 is the first step
you know towards solving promises at least talk about them what about the polarization part the
polarization part the uncertainty part uh the questions about democracy and the rule of law and
the future of of a country and I think there's a lot of people who worry about those things uh
sure those are those are all those are all still um those are all still uh those are things you
probably wouldn't worry about if if biden was the president right I feel the country is still very
polarized it's it's been getting it's been getting more polarized for decades you know it was it was
polarized against bork in the 80s and you know that those sort of a new crescendo and polarization
there was way fox news was polarized against the clintons and uh we've been and I you know I don't
know it's it's always what's cause and effect is the polarization causing the stagnation or does
the stagnation lead to the polarization I don't think the polarization what about what happens in
a tone where everything's just a tonal question but again you you come across a very sensible
reasonable person I think I mean there are people who here I'm sure will disagree with you about
lots of different issues but my question about about tone about the president of what the president
and the tone of the president by the way I should say and I'm not I'm not speaking out of school you
also I would say by the way um you've been over you a public you've been a republican for a long
time now public uh about that you're also proudly gay openly so and and I wonder if you can tie
you know I think there's a lot of people who say themselves that you know president president
trump when he looks at talks about some of the issues around LGBT issues in this country and
other people people there are people in those communities who say they don't feel safe about
yeah well we can go through all these all these different different versions of that I I think
I mean there was never any thought of reversing gay marriage or any of those things
by by by trump at least and and I think the and look I think the the yeah there are all these
ways they are they're not the way I would articulate these things but you know the
the sort of polite tone you know there was you know people had attempted to say you know something's
gone very wrong in our country the house is on fire it's burning to the ground we are a society
in decline stagnation where you know I mean maybe AI will will save us but this is like the way
people talk about AI just come back to that it's like if it doesn't lead to this cornucopian growth
I mean we're just completely going to be buried by budget deficits and debt for decades to come and
and it's it's like I think AI is a big thing is it big enough to solve our budget deficit problem
I don't believe it is and and so yeah we have we have we have a lot of these problems and at
some point you know extra politeness is is is not quite the thing yeah it was it was an
inarticulate shriek for help and look my my my sort of fantasy in 2016 in supporting Trump this
was where I was completely delusional was this would be the way you start to have a conversation
and that and and that's why and that's what that's another reason why I'm off-ramping I'd much
rather have the sort of conversation we add here because if you know if I lean in all the way to
support Trump it'll be all about that and we can't talk about all these other things which is the way
we are going to substantively solve the problems well I want to thank you for this conversation
and for addressing all these issues um it really was a phenomenal discussion awesome thank you so
all right thank you very
