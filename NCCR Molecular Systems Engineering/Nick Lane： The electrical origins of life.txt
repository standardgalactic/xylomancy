was really wonderful performance, thank you very much.
Da Dan Brown of Evolutionary Biochemistry.
Notice the word biochemistry, he didn't say biology
so I feel the need to apologise a little bit
because biochemistry is frankly not very easy to bring to life
for people who aren't already enthusiastic about it.
I'm going to have a go and I'm going to try and tell you,
I'm going to try and tell you, I suppose they're some of my own ideas, not only my ideas,
but my way of seeing the question on the origin of life, and it leads into consciousness as
well in things like bacteria, so I know that this organisation has an interest in the ethics
of molecular biosciences and so on, so I don't know if this is going to challenge the ethics,
but I hope that it might lead to something of a debate towards the end. First thing to say is
we will never know how life started on earth. Even if we invented a time machine and we were
able to go back four billion years to the origin of life, we could not agree among ourselves as
scientists in this field, where should we go? Should we go into the atmosphere? Should we find
a beach? These are stromatolites that you can see. It's actually living rocks, you may say.
Should we go down into the depths of the ocean? Scientists who work in the field cannot agree
with each other about things as simple, you may say, as that. If we actually did succeed in agreeing
on where to go and we go there and we find some green slime on a rock, do we know if this is
a step enroute to the origin of life or is this some side alley going nowhere in particular? Again,
we have no way of knowing. So even if we had a time machine, we still wouldn't be able to answer the
question. So you may think it's completely hopeless. Why am I even standing here? Well, we can. We can
hope to understand it. That's really what we're trying to do. I don't think there's any likelihood
that over the next, say, five to ten years, as some people claim, that we will succeed in producing
life in the lab and we'll have cells growing out of some test tube or something. I think we are
miles and miles away from doing that. But we can try to understand the kinds of environments,
the kind of chemistry going on and all the steps. We can work out an intellectual framework that
will explain how a wet rocky planet, with no life on it whatsoever, can give rise to the kind
of glorious planet that we live on. How can we even think about that transition? I think we can.
What I'd like to try and get across to you this evening is that we're beginning to have some ideas,
at least some people agree with them, some people don't, but I want to try and persuade you that
it's not just hand waving. So how do we begin to think about it? I would say for the last 50, 60
years or so, the guide to the origin of life has really been chemistry. What chemistry actually
works and which chemistry doesn't work so well. Over the last perhaps 15, 20 years, biology has
become involved for the first time. Until then, surprisingly, biologists had almost nothing to
say on the origin of life. It was dismissed as armchair speculation of the worst kind, not science
at all. Whereas the chemists were thinking, okay, here's an interesting challenge in synthetic
chemistry. Can we make the nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA? Can we make the sugars? Can we make
the lipids to make membranes and so on? It was a valid question in synthetic chemistry and they've
made all of these things. Then you have a little problem about, okay, you put them all together in
a pot and then what happens? It doesn't just kind of congeal into cells and start crawling out,
so there's something missing still. Biology, life itself, is an interesting guide. What I'm going
to try and suggest to you is that it's, in fact, an excellent guide in three different areas. Energy,
metabolism, which is one of those words that tend to put a lot of people off, but I'll try and
explain this as likely as I can. Then genetic information, genes. Where does information in
biology come from? I think a lot of people find more interesting than metabolism. On the other hand,
it can become quite obscure quite quickly. When you see the two together, it makes much more
sense. Before I get going, I'm going to orientate you to those three themes. This is,
you could think of this as a bacterial cell. You could think of this as the mitochondria
inside your own cells. The mitochondria are the power packs inside your cells. This is what's
happening inside you right now. Keep this as simple as I can. We're burning glucose. We're
breaking it down to an intermediate. Don't even, don't need to know the name of it. Acetyl CoA.
We go through this thing called the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle is basically pulling out CO2
and hydrogen. That's all I really want you to get from this. CO2 is breathing it out into the
atmosphere, contributing our own little bit to global warming. The hydrogen, while we're splitting
the hydrogen, the hydrogen atoms, two hydrogen atoms, we're splitting them into their fundamental
parts, the electrons and the protons. We have a current of electrons going to oxygen.
That current of electrons, literally pretty much an electric wire inside this membrane,
inside this insulated membrane, is powering the extrusion of protons across the membrane.
So now we have a lot of protons on this side of the membrane, very few protons on the inside,
about three orders of magnitude difference, three pH units difference. Now that may not seem
like very much. It's about an electrical charge of about 150 to 200 millivolts, but if you were to
shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule and stand right next to this membrane there,
you would experience an electrical field strength of about 30 million volts per meter.
That's equivalent to a bolt of lightning. So this entire surface area of membrane has got an
electrical charge equivalent to a bolt of lightning going across it. It's just such a small distance,
five nanometers, that the actual charge is quite small, but it's quite a field strength.
That is powering everything. I'm showing here a protein called the ATP synthase. I'll come back
to that later on. ATP is often called a universal energy currency. In other words, it's powering
work, but that work doesn't have to be making this ATP, this energy currency, any kind of work
it can power the bacterial flagella, which will kind of row a bacterium around the place.
It can power CO2 fixation, which is what I'll say more about. Okay, so that's how energy works
in biology. That's basically it for all cells. There are plenty of variations on that thing,
but this is fundamental. All life works that way. It's amazing. Your own cells work that way,
bacteria work that way, stuff that you find high up in the atmosphere on the outside of the
space station or deep down in the bowels of the earth in the deep hot biosphere. It's all working
that way. It's amazing. It's as universally conserved as the genetic code itself. Okay, this
looks exactly the same. It's not. It's the opposite. What I'm showing here is this
Krebs cycle going in the opposite direction. I've still got hydrogen and CO2. Think what happens
though. Normally when the Krebs cycle is spinning, it's pulling out hydrogen and CO2 and it's burning
the hydrogen in oxygen. The reverse Krebs cycle and quite a lot of bacteria work this way
is sucking in hydrogen and CO2 and using the energy of this charged membrane to make them react
together to form organic molecules, the Krebs cycle intermediates, their carboxylic acids.
And from then, we make amino acids and sugars and nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA and RNA
and lipids for the membranes themselves and so on. So it's not about energy only. It's also about
biosynthesis. It's about making the building blocks of life and this is again really deeply
conserved in biology. Some of the molecules in that Krebs cycle, not necessarily always as a complete
cycle, sometimes more as a linear pathway, but there are five molecules in there which are universally
conserved across all of life. They are the universal precursors for all of metabolism. This is the
starting point for making everything that cells do and it's all coming from here and it's powered
by this same system. It's just operating in reverse. So it's kind of strange that both metabolism
and energy are powered by this same system. There's a tension between which way is it going to go
and in our own bodies sometimes it's going both ways and cancer very often is working
with the Krebs cycle going in the opposite direction, in this reverse direction making
the building blocks to make new cells to power the growth of cancer cells. So that's in a nutshell
how metabolism is working. And genetic information, I'm going to come back to this in a little more
detail later on, but just what I want you to take now is that there are patterns in the genetic
code and these have been known about for 60 years since the early 1960s which suggests that there
are direct interactions between the codons, which is to say the units within DNA or RNA that codes
for an amino acid in a protein and the amino acid itself. In other words there's a kind of
stickiness you may say. There are interactions between that particular letter and that particular
amino acid and what that suggests is that the genetic code is not just some random arbitrary
assortment but that if you had a random string of RNA, a random string of letters, then you would
have a non-random string of amino acids that in one way or another and it may be more like this
we don't need to specify exactly how that works, the patterns are there anyway.
What it suggests is that there are direct interactions between the amino acids and the
bases in the genetic code that code for them. And so a random RNA sequence codes a non-random
peptide, if that peptide has function in whatever environment it may be, then natural selection
as we know it can start and there's no mystery about the origin of information in biology.
So one thing to say about that immediately, what I'm suggesting here is that we have electricity
driving metabolism which is giving rise to genes and that means it's all going to happen in one
place and that's already a little bit unnerving if you're thinking about the origin of life.
Most theories on the origin of life until now have said okay well this chemistry happens best
over here and that chemistry works over there and this works down here and we can bring them
all together somehow and then they will as I say congeal into cells and crawl out of the test tube
and they don't do that. So what did they do? Well in some kind of a place where we've got a
continuous reactivity, continuous gases being brought together let's say hydrogen and CO2
to react together to form these molecules forming genes in the same place. It's a scary hypothesis
but at least it's testable and you could say it's very easily testable because you can do it,
if you can get the right conditions you can do it on a lab bench if it's all happening in the
same place then you can just go straight ahead and test it. So what kind of place could it possibly be?
Well the place I favour, it doesn't have to be here but this is something that we can get our head
around are what are known as alkaline hydrothermal vents. They were discovered by Deb Kelly who was
captain of the Alvin submersible back in the year 2000 and before that there'd been other deep sea
hydrothermal vents known back into the 1970s but these are quite different. They're not smoking in
the way that you'll mostly be familiar I'm sure with the idea of black smokers with chimney and smoke
coming out of the top, billowing out of the top. They're not like that, they almost look dead,
they're not dead. These are living vent systems with fluids going through them and Deb Kelly here
has got a lump of a black smoker with this chimney structure and this is a bit of Lost City
and you might be able to see it looks a bit like a mineralised sponge. It's a kind of a labyrinth of
interconnected pores and so there are alkaline fluids, hydrothermal fluids kind of winding their way
through these interconnected pores. Now they're not produced by the same mechanism that makes the
the black smoke events, the black smokers are produced by effectively direct interaction between
magma, volcanic magma and ocean water at the spreading centres of the mid-ocean ridges and
so on. What's happening here where we're away from this and water will effectively percolate down
into the into the sea floor and if the sea floor is relatively close to the mantle and this this
tends to happen these days close to the close to the ridges this is 15, 20 kilometres away from the
mid-atlantic ridge these green minerals here it's called olivine it's actually the most common
mineral in the earth's mantle it's also extremely common in interstellar space it's called olivine
just because it looks a bit like olives it's really that simple and it's water it will percolate
down as much as five or six kilometres underneath the sea floor and react with this olivine and it's
an exothermic reaction it's releasing heat and it's releasing these alkaline fluids so they're warm
and they're buoyant and they bubble back up and plenty of hydrogen gas and it's basically just the
oxidation of water that's going on sorry the oxidation of iron that's so ferrous iron is going
to ferric iron and water is being converted into into hydrogen um they these same kind of vent should
form on any wet rocky planet and they happen on a global scale so this is um if this is the
mid at mid atlantic ridge would be somewhere somewhere around here we have these reactions
going on in in the crust and then now with tectonic spreading it's spreading across the ocean floor
and then being subducted down in effect what's happening is the water is reacting with the rock
and hydrating the rock and then this hydrated rock is being subducted and at the increasing
temperatures and pressures water is being driven off again and that water in the mantle is melting
the mantle and causing convection currents in the mantle and that is driving volcanic activity
on the planet on literally a planetary scale so it's then it's quite interesting that
mars for example which is a fairly small planet there's plenty of evidence that it had oceans
four billion years ago maybe three and a half billion years ago on mars and and they disappeared
and there's various explanations for where they went but one interesting explanation is this same
process of called serpentinisation whereby the rock minerals like olivine react with water
get subducted down but on a smaller planet which is cooling faster the temperatures are cooler
now because the the core is cooling down less of that water is driven off and effectively
mars buried its oceans uh as as rock as hydrated rock and that's one of the reasons why by mars
effectively seems to have died as a planet maybe there's still life hanging on there who knows
we'll find out but um it would be to me quite surprising if there was and certainly it's not
how any real impact on the atmosphere occasionally we see traces of methane methane could also be
produced by um by this process of serpentinisation incidentally i i didn't define serpentinisation
it sounds a bit intimidating i say minerals like olivine are reacting with water and effectively
rusting and they're being converted into another mineral called serpentinite and that's the
process of serpentinisation it's a metamorphosis uh why is it called serpentinite because it looks
like a serpent scales again the geologists have got these intimidating terms that just mean
something very simple uh this we have a rock that looks like olives converted into a rock that
looks like serpent scales it's called serpentinisation and it happens throughout the universe this
is um this is enceladus which is one of the moons of saturn and there are these plumes that
were was initially seen by Cassini on its fly past of saturn um and uh and and and and these are
alkaline they're around about pH nine they're rich in hydrogen and methane and plenty of organic
molecules in there so the interpretation of this is beneath the frozen surface of enceladus
there is a liquid ocean and beneath that liquid ocean um there is a there is a rocky um olivine rich um i
don't know what you call it really and not not not not exactly a mantle i'm not sure i'm not a geologist
what the term would be but anyway olivine rich rock underneath the ocean serpentinising giving rise
to this alkaline ocean and and and the pressure is producing these plumes through cracks in the ice
this idea of planetary scale things going on it's um this is not a very exact analogy but it's a
very interesting analogy that the structure of a cell the topological structure of a cell and the
topological structure of a planet are very similar to each other so if this is the earth for example
the inside has a negative charge relative to the outside all of the iron which is buried down
in the core is effectively electron rich whereas the atmosphere the oceans and so on are relatively
electron poor we have gases like carbon dioxide and so on it's relatively oxidised outside so um
it's also relatively more acidic outside um this is slightly more um problematic but effectively
if you see these as as um hydrothermal vents between the mantle and the ocean then we have
alkaline fluids coming out going into a relatively acidic early ocean now cell structure is basically
it's the same it's negatively charged inside it's relatively reduced inside plenty of electrons
and protons on the outside so add a slightly hand wavy level there is an interesting topological
equivalence between planets like the earth wet rocky planets and the structure of cells
and this was first notice through i don't know if it's first notice but it was noticed and pointed
out by a guy called mic russell 30 years ago now and after after the discovery of lost city by
deb kelly his ideas became quite well known he predicted the existence of vents like lost city
10 years before their discovery and his ideas throughout the 90s were pretty marginal in the
field nobody was very interested in them and you can look back at conference proceedings and
see the discussions after people's talks and there would be mic russell jumping up and say
yeah but what about alkaline hydrothermal vents and everybody would ignore him and it was quite
interesting to see this dynamic all written up in volumes of forgotten life sciences history
then after the discovery of lost city he suddenly became much more famous this was a
feature article by nature in the year 2009 and they photoshopped him up as erasmus as the
renaissance man and they called him nasance man nasance has in the birth of life and this is
his reactor he was at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena and this is a little bit
of lost city behind him and essentially what he was arguing and what i still think to be the
right way of seeing the question is that there are high concentrations of hydrogen in these alkaline
fluids bubbling up into the ocean and the oceans the early oceans were co2 rich it's very hard
to constrain how much but probably as much as one bar of carbon dioxide in those early oceans
they would have been mildly acidic perhaps ph5 or 6 and that means this is the sponge like
mineralised sponge like structure all of these interconnected micro pores four billion years
ago before there was any oxygen this is now carbonate rocks but we would expect to see lots of
iron and nickel and transition metals in there as well because these dissolved in the oceans before
there was any oxygen around especially in acidic oceans so we would expect to see some of these
walls effectively containing catalytic transition metals and equivalents and and so reactive fluids
percolating wending their way through ocean waters coming in this is really an electrochemical flow
reactor where we've got the two components that i was saying earlier on make up the crebs cycle
are the first starting point for life hydrogen and co2 being forcibly reacted together with natural
proton gradients which is to say differences in the proton concentration between the ocean waters
and the alkaline fluids probably across these barriers across potentially quite short distances
so we've got a system here which has a structure which is reminiscent of cells and we've got all
the right ingredients to be reacting together to make the components of cells so at least you can
imagine that this may be a suitable a suitable starting point for life so this is um this is my
my hypothesis which is grounded in the work of the people that i've been talking about
but i'm not sure any of them would necessarily see it quite this way and and i wouldn't have dared to
show anybody this slide even five or six years ago it's very simple um and i'll explain it briefly
but it's um i wouldn't have dared to say it because it's it's there's big claims going on here
and they're experimentally tractable questions and the reason i dare to show it you now is that a
lot of them are beginning to show signs that there's truth in them so imagine this is a paw
in one of these hydrothermal vents we've got acidic ocean waters percolating in we've got
iron sulfur minerals in these in these barriers not just that or silicate and carbonate and things
as well but some iron sulfur minerals driving a reaction between hydrogen and CO2 not necessarily
a complete Krebs cycle but at least some of these intermediates in the Krebs cycle to make
the most thermodynamically favored product lipids which is to say fatty acids and long chain
um long chain hydrocarbons uh and amino acids these are the two most thermodynamically favored groups
if we did make lipids we potentially would expect that they would form some kind of a
i'll i'm going to call it a proto cell uh it's got a a bilam membrane around it and it's
snuggling in i'm showing it deliberately snuggling into a paw here i'm exaggerating
uh but this effectively this paw is templating a cell and the cell is snuggling in with a bilam
membrane around it and now it's a semi closed system and we can make more things not just lipids
and amino acids but also sugars maybe nucleotides for this to be happening we need that bit
this iron sulfur mineral well if we want to be fixing these things inside a proto cell then this
needs to be sticking in this membrane protons need to be crossing that membrane we need to have
all this happening inside and a continuous flow so we're combining the structure of the vent with
the continuous flow of things and this i i hope will be beginning to challenge you because certainly
i would be thinking well really can we really believe that that's true and then just as a final
challenge if we can get as far as nucleotides then we can begin to have RNA we can begin to
have a kind of an RNA world but inside these growing proto cells and now we've got amino acids
becoming peptides we've got RNA which is the the the kind of more reactive equivalent of DNA
if you're not so familiar with these things and the beginnings of making proteins the beginnings
of information and the beginnings of real protein function in cells so it's a very simple hypothesis
and it really it challenges our ability to believe our own hypotheses in science
but the good thing is it is eminently testable so i'm going to run through and i'm going to show
you a little bit of data with some of this and i kind of apologise for that because it's not
supposed to be a seminar but at the same time if i just stand here and wave my arms around and say
yeah take it from me it's really going to happen you should really should not believe me so i'm
going to show you that we can do some experiments that this is actually science and i'll show you
the kind of experiments that we can do i'm going to skim over them quite lightly and if you've got
questions feel free to either interrupt and ask as i'm going along or ask at the end anyway so this
idea that life is powered by electric membranes it goes back to 1961 to a paper from Peter Mitchell
in 1961 on what he called the chemiosmotic hypothesis and this is this is an older picture
and it's with Jennifer Moyle and and Jennifer Moyle she was working with Mitchell from 1947 this
is 1947 in Cambridge and and she was a brilliant experimentalist and most of the good papers
that they wrote together in the 1960s on the chemiosmotic hypothesis the best papers were
Mitchell and Moyle together and she did all the experimental work Mitchell was a brilliant
theoretician he was cack-handed in the lab he can never finish an experiment it was Moyle that
really did the experimental work and Mitchell of course of course perhaps you don't know but Mitchell
in 1978 was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry by himself i'm increasingly thinking and i've been
kind of digging around in the literature but i think now if that were to happen then Moyle would
have won the Nobel Prize with him i think luckily times are changing but i think that was a miscarriage
of justice anyway before this hypothesis was first published in 1961 Mitchell was a conference
in Moscow 1957 on the origin of life it was organized by Oprin who was a great Soviet
i suppose he was a chemist interested in the origin of life and a lot of the great scientists
in the world at the time so people like J.B.S. Haldane was there and Mitchell himself was there as well
and J.D. Bernal was there a lot of them were communists which was why they went to to Moscow and why
they were interested but it's also interesting that because there's such a materialistic basis to
Marxism and communism they were interested in questions like the origin of life in a way that
many other people weren't at the time so you know there's a reason why it was happening in Moscow
so Mitchell really was not a not a not a communist really at all in fact he was from a very wealthy
family and he used to drive a silver Rolls Royce around Cambridge in the during the war time and
this is a quite a poetic view here i love this quote because it's eye-opening when you think about
the origin of life he says i cannot consider the organism without its environment from a formal
point of view the two may be regarded as equivalent phases between which dynamic contact is maintained
by the membranes that separate and link them so the inside of a cell in the outside world
are equivalent phases he's not separating life out and saying this is what life is and this is
what the environment is he's conflating them he's saying they're equivalent to each other
which is a strange thing to say but if you're thinking about the origin of life before there
is such a thing as a cell that we would recognize before there is really an organism or a living
system thinking about phases as your equivalent separated and joined by a membrane is a very
productive way of thinking about the question and this is to my mind what we have in a hydrothermal
vent we have a barrier and we have alkaline hydrothermal fluids inside and we have acidic
ocean waters on the outside and so the topology is equivalent to a bacterial cell here's a bacterial
cell we're pumping out protons and so it's relatively acidic on the outside and it's
relatively alkaline on the inside and potentially it's three phd units difference between the
inside and the outside so it's the same magnitude and it's the same topology as a cell so is there
any way that we can kind of go from here to there the other thing to notice about this we're pumping
out protons all the time in our own body but why because we're putting them to work to power
to power work and so the influx of protons is driving work and the influx of protons across
here could potentially drive work as well what kind of work could it potentially do
before there are any enzymes any genes any any any kind of structures that you would think could
do anything useful what on earth could it actually do well there is a simple answer
and it's basically it's about driving growth why would that happen the problem with hydrogen
and co2 is they're just not very reactive the first couple of steps to get them to react
is really difficult and so if you were to just take a mixture of gases hydrogen co2 and put them
in a test tube and heat them up to say 50 degrees and shake them up for half a billion years nothing
much is really going to happen um actually thermodynamically you should get cells incredibly
you should get cells they are more thermodynamically favoured than just a mixture of hydrogen and
co2 the problem is this first couple of steps to get to formaldehyde is uphill we don't need to
go into the details of of redox chemistry all you really need to notice is it's uphill and it's
quite steeply uphill to get them to react but that is at the same pH what we actually have in a
hydrothermal vent is the alkaline fluids at pH 11 and the acidic ocean waters let's say pH 6
and now you can see it's downhill why is it downhill it's it's quite simple again intuitively
to understand if imagine hydrogen gas it wants to pass its electrons onto something else that leaves
behind the protons and the protons well that's what makes an acid so you know an acid is rich
in protons if you make those protons in an alkaline environment they'll immediately react
with hydroxide to form water it's a neutralization reaction it's extremely it's extremely rapid it's
thermodynamically favoured it's going to happen instantaneously and release a lot of heat so
it's just a neutralization if you try to release protons in the acidic environment well you're
making an acid more acid that's not really favoured in terms of chemistry so it's going to be much
more reactive in an alkaline environment and CO2 well it picks up an electron now it's got a
negative charge if it's in the acidic environment it can pick up a proton now it's balanced the
charges now another electron now another proton and off we go we can make it so it becomes easier
CO2 becomes more reactive in an acidic environment and so it's downhill is going to happen so long
as we have hydrogen in one phase at pH 11 and CO2 in a different phase at pH 6 and they're not
constantly mixing they're not just forming the same same thing so that's what we have in these
vents and this is a fairly simple experiment actually we've been building reactors and trying
to make these things react for quite a long time and embarrassingly long time and it's got smaller
and smaller and more and more controllable and this is a microfluidic chip you can see it there
as well inside this anaerobic glove box and we have parallel flow acidic flow with irons with
iron chloride and alkaline flow with sodium sulfide and it precipitates this very thin barrier
and what we're hoping is that protons or maybe electrons when still not sure which unbelievably
will cross this barrier and reduce CO2 to make organic molecules does it work well yes it does
it's it's not um it's not hugely impressive i have to admit um it's taken a long time even to get
to this this is the kind of thing if you're not a scientist um then maybe maybe maybe this will
help you understand people get amazingly excited about that um that is formate um which is to say
it's the very first step of reacting hydrogen and CO2 to make the very first very first product
so it's a step in the right direction and it's sticking up quite a long way above this baseline
sometimes this baseline is quite lumpy and bumpy and and so this is not a bad peak really um and so
it's it's proof that it can begin to happen and over here um this one is no this one is acetate
which is two carbons joined together and we've managed to get three carbons joined together
and you'll probably be thinking oh wow well done but um it's it's kind of it's taken us 10 years
it's a bit embarrassing as I say um other people have gone much further uh and but they're very
often used higher pressures and all kinds of interesting minerals this is with very freshly
precipitated with just a pH gradient and if you cut if you cut out the pH gradient it doesn't work
you don't get anything if you cut out some of the transition metals like nickel it doesn't work
you don't get anything so it's even though it looks incredibly cheap um it it is actually
quite exciting it's a proof of concept that a pH gradient across a barrier will drive CO2
fixation uh and make the organic molecules and and notice acetate it's actually one of the
Krebs cycle in the reverse Krebs cycle is one of the intermediates one of the universally conserved
intermediates now I said other people have done more than we have we're now talking higher temperatures
and higher pressures and things like that but um some some people have produced longer chain
fatty acids doing doing that um and they'd done that 20 years ago actually not using pH gradients
and we'd taken a selection of these and tried to see well if you remember my my picture I was
drawing I was showing you a proto cell nestling snugly inside a a paw well that requires a bilayer
membrane and that requires something really simple and so the question was if we take these
fatty acids that have been made and something called fatty alcohols which also have kind of a
long chain of carbons joined together with an alcohol group stuck on the end do we get things
that look like proto cells the answer is yes this is cryo electron microscopy and it's got a bilayer
membrane around an aqueous space inside these are similar things this is this is confocal microscopy
um and I think this one is at pH seven but this one's at pH 12 and these are also at pH 12 so
we are able to make them and they make stable proto cells um quite beautiful to look at when you
see them live as it were they're moving around and doing interesting things they're quite dynamic
so yes and and the question there was well are they stable in these harsh conditions in a
hydrothermal vent at 70 degrees centigrade and pH nine or 10 or 11 and and lots of salt and calcium
and magnesium and all the rest of it and the answer is yes that has all of those things in so
it is quite easy to make them it turns out and this uh I'm not going to go through the details here
but another this is another thing where scientists get ridiculously excited about let's say that
this little shoulder here this is what's called UV viz spectroscopy uh and that shoulder is diagnostic
of what are called four fe four estlas which is a kind of little cube um of iron and sulfur
and they're found in some of the most important proteins in biology things like ferrodoxin which
are directly doing co2 fixation in pretty much all cells these are ancient proteins and they always
contain these little cubes of iron and sulfur and they're like minerals um and actually they're
formed as in the same way as minerals they form spontaneously and and so this is the kind of
the machine this is the most simple machinery you could imagine for co2 fixation which is
becoming biology and they have a diagnostic shoulder on UV viz spectroscopy so as soon as you
see this you think whoa we we expected that we would we would mix iron iron chloride and sodium
sulfide and cysteine the amino acid cysteine at pH nine and we'll mix it up and and I what I thought
we would see would be smaller crystals big things but but getting smaller coated in cysteine that's
kind of what I expected to see I didn't expect to see that suddenly we've gone from when you do it
without the cysteine everything goes black it's you just form a you just form the mineral you just
form iron sulfide minerals and everything goes black and when we first started doing these experiments
quite a while ago now the first phd student I had um she became terribly depressed in the first
month or two because every experiment just went black every time and there's nothing
that she could it took a long time to figure out we need alkaline ph and we need all the you
know so so surprisingly again surprisingly long time and and eventually we get through to forming
these it depends on the amount of cysteine that you have it depends on the concentration of iron and
I won't go through the details of these here's what these little clusters look like that is this
that I showed you this is from my original slide that I showed you so what I'm saying is it's quite
easy to make the bilayer membrane surrounding and it's quite easy to make these little clusters
of iron and sulfide that are doing co2 fixation in modern cells they have exactly the same chemistry
and they will fix co2 this is format and this is acetate and again I won't go through the details
but the green one here is just pure water this is done on an electrode so there is an electrical
potential here as well but when we have the clusters we get an awful lot more than you get
in the absence of the clusters so again it does work we can effectively build this machinery
that life uses with the most simple imaginable ingredients okay so that's
effectively turning gases into the core molecules of life what happens next well metabolism
this is a this is a tube map of metabolism the kind of the London underground the remarkable
thing about it is that this basic topology is again it's conserved across all of life you don't
need to worry about the details but that kind of that map it's like imagine that you you go to
Paris and you look at the the underground map in Paris and you find it's exactly the same as the
underground map in London and you go to you go to New York and it's exactly it's not the same
conceptually it's got the same stations it's incredible everything is exactly the same what's
happening down these is not as if you've just got some kind of flow going down what's really
happening is each of these molecules is converting into another molecule so this is the kind of
the line going from pyruvate through to valine for example or to alanine these are molecules
being converted into other things so it's not very equivalent to a tube map in that sense but
it's remarkable that the genes that code for this map they're not the same
they're I mean some of them are the same but most of them are different in for example bacteria
and archaea two of the domains of life and what that suggests is that this tube map is actually
older than the genes now again that's something of an assertion but what it suggests then is
that a lot of it should happen spontaneously that we should be able to just do this chemistry
in the lab without there being any enzymes there any genetic programming there nothing
which should just happen spontaneously in the right environment and this is just one example
showing more or less that we're starting with let me just go back a moment oxaloacetate which
is here so we're just feeding it this and we're looking to see if we get a spartate this is a
very difficult reaction and has never been done before and what we're also seeing we're seeing
alanine and pyruvate and glycine and serine so these this is alanine these are different metal
ions that we're using so I won't spend much time on the details we're getting a you know not
large amounts but hundreds of micro molar with ferric with copper and with ferric iron but
nothing with those spartates is quite hard but some metal ions do the job but we're also getting
glycine and serine and alanine and these are this was on GCMS this is just what we measured
which means that we've got this flow going through this system and it's not coming up with other
things we are this like the train is following the lines even in the absence of any any gene so
it's not much but it's there and we've also got through as far as cysteine for example so all the
way through to here which is what's binding those iron sulfur clusters so this is early days
there's another group in Strasbourg who's done more of this kind of work than we have they've
managed to do pretty much all of the Krebs cycle pretty much most of this pathway coming down here
and now a lot of sugar we've also done sugar synthesis coming through to ribose and so on
a lot of this map has been done in the lab in the last 10 years since 2015
eight years and it works not everyone's done it under the same conditions it's not as if
we start here and just go whoosh right the way through this whole system one group does this
little bit another group does that bit someone else does this bit but it's interesting that
piecing it together it seems to be spontaneous chemistry it's a lot harder to try and get
flow going through the entire system that could take years possibly decades who knows but at least
it begins to give you a little faith I would say that this kind of chemistry is really possible
think about the early earth four billion years ago we've got an entire planet covered in hydrothermal
vents covered in these hydrothermal systems there was no distinction between the crust and the
mantle at that time so these vent systems were everywhere and how many million years do you want
so the idea that in the scope of a phd thesis on a benchtop in a small lab which is always
struggling to get funded that we can make all of this stuff happen of course it's not going to happen
if we can get anything to happen at all it's a step in a direction so I think again to return to
my point at the beginning intellectually we're beginning to get a feel for how this kind of
chemistry might work out and we're beginning to do the experiments that suggest that it's not
completely impossible it's not it's not utterly improbable this was showing that we can make
uracil which is one of the letters in in RNA and DNA this is not too many steps where we start
with ammonia and carbonate and aspartate and we can go right the way through there this is uracil
and oratate as a one pot synthesis and when we when we optimize the conditions we got about 10
times as much uracil just in these last three steps here and interestingly those conditions
turned out to be 90 degrees centigrade ph 8.5 one molar sodium chloride so quite similar to
alkaline hydrothermal vents so again this is just showing that whole pathways can spontaneously
happen and this is an interesting one this is ATP that I mentioned at the beginning these days
it's made by this astonishing rotating motor the ATP synthase which is this is the membrane
here it's got this literally rotating motor and it's making ATP is one of the most magical
molecular machines it's just beautiful and it's rotating this it's not really rotating slowly
like that it's going 200 times revolutions a second up to 500 revolutions a second it's
extraordinary fast and and it's convert it's just phosphorylating ADP to ATP so it's adding
a phosphate group on to ADP and it's been a big question or how do we make ATP then in the
absence of a sophisticated protein like that there are ways of doing it but here's this is just
showing again with peric iron and water and a two carbon acetyl phosphate we get about 15 to
20% yield of ATP it varies depending on the temperature most metal ions didn't work only
ferric iron worked and we could do it with ATP but not with the other bases so this why is it the
universal energy currency in part because you can make it in water with ferric iron as a catalyst
and acetyl phosphate as a phosphate donor so it's prebiotic chemistry it works and you get
specifically ATP we're not synthesizing ATP all the steps this is just the last bit of
phosphorylating but it's interesting that it it works okay information and keep an eye on the time
i'm going a little slow are you all right should we have a music break
i'll keep going for now so information this is kind of what you've seen already this is the pattern
of metabolism i'm talking about pyruvate these are the Krebs cycle intermediates up here and it's
color coded these are all amino acids and in gray they all have a g at the first position of the
codon so so in in in DNA and RNA that each amino acid is encoded by three letters it's called
codon and those three letters in the first one for glycine is always a g and so on this is when
the first letter is is an a for adenosine in blue it's encoded by cytidine and in in green it's by
a u and you can see immediately looking at that that there's some interesting structure there
that it's it looks as if the the g is very close to co2 fixation and the blue ones are much further
away and that is indeed the case we see a kind of correlation it's a reasonable correlation not
perfect but um this is the number of steps from co2 to the amino acid and it's the shorter
distance from g to u the outlier down here is cysteine which is that one which um we have we
have reasons why we can explain why that's an outlier we think um that's the first position
of the codon if we organize this by the first position of the codon so a g or an a at that
first position or a c or a u this is the second position of the anticodon and this is um this
is the hydrophobicity and so so the v is is valine it's a very hydrophobic amino acid and it's
encoded the colors changed here unfortunately this is now an a so valine is encoded at the
second position of the anticodon by an a which is the most hydrophobic base so we have effectively
the most hydrophobic base encodes the most hydrophobic amino acid and here we have a spartate
and it's encoded by a u which is the most hydrophilic amino acid encoded by the most hydrophilic
base so we see this relationship between how much water loving or water hating they are
it suggests they're snuggling up to each other in some way um it's less strong if we if we're
further away if we're looking at c and u so these were the ones that were further away uh at the first
position there is a relationship but it's not very impressive but these first two it really
does look as if they are direct interactions between amino acids and the bases that code for
them and this is a third position um and this is a what's called an inverted codon table
so first of all most people would think that the third position is usually just thought of
as redundant there's not much information in that third position so where it's white it is
redundant there can be more than one amino acid encoded there but where it's um where it's colored
these are not redundant it's a single amino acid is encoded by by that so you can see immediately
that it's not a random patterning the redundancy itself is not random in the genetic code and if
i just consider one example so this is glutamate and it's the same color as a spartate over here
they've both got a g at the first position of the codon they've both got an a at the second
position of the codon but this glutamate has a purine and a spartate has a pyrimidine now purines
have got two rings they're bigger pyrimidines have got a single ring they're smaller and it corresponds
to the size of the amino acid so we can predict most of the code on the basis of these interactions
it's kind of circular we're predicting the code from patterns that are inside the code anyway so
it's you know there's some problem here but we can also test these things and we can we've done
molecular dynamic simulations and an nmr and they said i'll just give one example here so this is
amino acid proline and we're looking to see how much time does it spend close to each of these
bases a c g or u and within about two angstroms so really snuggling up it's spending a lot of time
with the g and it's not spending so much time with the other bases g is the one that encodes it
at the second position of the anticodon for arginine we also get it correct but there's a lot
of overlap here so it's kind of weak and statistical but we we can predict about 50% of the code on
these interactions um and it's interesting this is our our best this is the one so so here for
example uh with with proline um we think that it should be with a g um and that's here so we we
think g first and then um so this is the second guess this is the third one and this is the the
worst one and i've put a ring around the correct base and and they're organised according to
hydrophobicity so these things are very hydrophobic these things are very hydrophilic and we get 50%
correct but they're all the hydrophilic end at the hydrophobic end we don't do very well
so this molecular dynamic simulations i'm not really a proper chemist um it's all about the
forces between atoms and how strong are the how strong are hydrophobic interactions or how strong
is charge interactions over what distance does it operate and so on and they're a little bit clunky
and they don't seem to be very good at these hydrophobic ones we did that with two different
programs and we got the same results more or less and we we got the same thing with NMR as well
NMR also has a problem with hydrophobicity because you can't dissolve hydrophobic amino acids in water
at a high concentration or the bases and so you don't have a good signal so it's very messy
it's funny this is chemistry that people have been doing over decades and it's still messy but
there is a pattern and it seems to be supported by the data and that can explain the origins of
information in biology this is a summary slide of everything i've said really we've got a proton
gradient across a membrane driving the reaction between hydrogen and co2 going into a proto metabolism
making amino acids and nucleotides we're polymerizing the nucleotides to make RNA polymerizing
the the amino acids to make peptides we have stereochemical interactions between them we've got
something like translation going on here making making these things and we have all kinds of
positive feedback loops interacting there which can make this system increase i'm not going to go
through the details of this but we can imagine very simple ways in which these amino acids can
interact with very small aptomers of RNA right for the last 10 minutes i'm just going to touch
on consciousness in bacteria not in us and when i say consciousness let me confess probably
what i'm going to talk about is not what you would understand by consciousness but the question
for me is a biochemist for a long time when i've never understood it is is what are feelings
in biochemical terms what we seem to care most about i think as humans and what we're scared
about with ai and so on is is will it become scarily human will it will it become conscious
will it start being sentient have feelings all of these kind of things and a lot of a lot of people
in the ai world are very interested now in well what what does biology have to say about consciousness
and the answer is well not very much it's been known as the hard problem for quite a long time
and the hard problem more or less is why is it that you know what a feeling of pain or of hunger
or thirst or whatever it may be what actually is that in terms of biochemistry if a neuron depolarizes
why does it give rise to a feeling of anything at all now in my view it it evolved but if it evolved
then it then then natural selection acted on something and the question is well how far back
does that go it's you can anesthetize all kinds of things you can anesthetize an amoeba you can
anesthetize bacteria so whatever it is that anesthetics are doing to consciousness is not
only at the level of a central nervous system it's also at the level of single celled critters
so what's happening and what i've been saying about how bacteria our life started this structure
of cells and and the three parts have been talking about the and especially the electric membranes
what i'm going to put to you is that the electromagnetic fields electrostatic electromagnetic
fields on these membranes give a real time integrated feedback to a bacterial cell about
how they're doing in the world and i'll explain that to you and then and why that may lead to
the basis for amplifying everything as consciousness so a real time integrated feedback on
on your state in the world i would say that's how it feels to be right now and for a bacterial cell
that means am i good or am i bad really not much more than that it's a kind of little bit of a
a binary system so imagine here's a bacterial cell we've got the outside world and stuff happens
in the outside world and it needs to detect whatever's going on out there and and do something
it's it's a living cell it's inside all this got is the metabolism all this stuff i've been
talking about all of these billions of reactions every second that's going on inside there's nothing
else in there it's just chemistry it's got genes in there but genes are slow as well so it's it's
interesting we've got literally one billion reactions a second going on inside here and
somehow they're going to determine what that cell decides it's going to do
so what i've been telling you about is this Krebs cycle and i'm keeping with the oxidative one
here we're stripping out hydrogen co2 we've got food coming in and we're pumping protons across
that membrane to generate an electrical charge on the membrane so this is what i've been setting up
all along but we don't have just one Krebs cycle in there we actually have scores of them probably
thousands of them all spinning at the same time potentially at different rates um there's all
kinds of things that could be going on so what is synchronising that cell at the same rate
to a larger extent it's the charge on the memory because all of them are plugged into the membrane
and for them to spin they've got to push against the same force and also that force is powering
ATP synthesis and for a lot of chemistry to happen in the cell you need ATP and it needs to be
far from equilibrium which is to say you need that ratio of ATP to ADP to be a similar distance
away so this charge on the membrane is going to be forcing all of the biochemistry of the cell
into effectively the same state the same rate of operating and you can gauge what that is from the
strength of the charge on the membrane and also because this is moving charge it will be generating
electromagnetic fields as well i suspect but cannot prove to you that there's a balance between
electromagnetic and electrostatic fields that they can pick up on which gives them an idea of
how they're doing in relation to the environment so it needs to make a kind of a binary decision
let's imagine it's too hot um or maybe there's toxins there what are you going to do are you
going to stay or are you going to go are you going to paddle with your flagellum and move across
it's it's a two-bit decision really you either you stay or you go um one bit so um you need to
integrate all this information on your state in the world now it could be that you you know it's too
hot what am i going to my proteins are beginning to unravel they're beginning to come undone i'm going
to set off some genes i'm going to activate some genes and the stress response which is going to
fix my proteins but it's going to take half an hour before these things are ready and the the
proteins i need to refold them that's going to take minutes um i can activate very about how do i
know what i just did i i i need to have some idea now about what my predicament is in the outside
world i need to know it's too hot there has to be some information that this system is giving me
about my predicament i don't know yet because i just set off a gene response which is doing
something but i don't know which genes i triggered and i don't know what the problem is so this is
where a feeling is beginning to come in it's effectively i think it's too hot i should move over
there in terms of the fields on the membrane which are telling you the states that you're in it's
integrating all this information on the membrane so that's what i'm proposing um it's not completely
hand waving i mean this i admit immediately is the more hand wavy bit of the talk i think the origin
of life stuff is is becoming science this is still philosophy perhaps more than science but
it's an interesting starting point but there is also some data so for example these are phages
bacteria phages attacking a bacterium and it's quite interesting what happens because lots of
bacteria will kill themselves especially if they're part of a a larger colony a biofilm for
example or or or some kind of ocean bloom of bacteria um why would they do that why would a single
cell kill itself well the answer it's standard biology it's what's called kin selection and
effectively if you kill yourself you also prevent the viruses from making copies of themselves
then they can't infect the next cell and so your genes and so on will do better in your relatives
you don't even have to be very closely related to the next cell still you'll be somewhat related
and your genes will do better if you kill yourself so how do you if you're in this predicament
of being taken down by viruses how do you kill yourself the answer is you unplug the membrane
you collapse the membrane potential that's what you do that will kill you in seconds so this is
really bacterial death is it's all about the membrane potential um which makes me think you know
when they paddle i showed you them paddling around this is proton powered again it's the all the
behaviour that that bacteria do all the import and export of things across that membrane is all
powered by that membrane potential so this is very much the life and death of what bacterial cells
are actually doing now this i think is the final slide um we are we are made of more complex cells
we're made of eukaryotic cells eukaryotes have lots of mitochondria these are the same things
i've been showing and these are all individual bacteria that became included in a much larger
cell or it became a larger cell in the end um and they're all they're all doing the same kind of
thing but now they've got to speak to each other there's different ways they can do that they
can fuse together and fish and there's all kinds of things they do but somehow they're all together
responsible for metabolism and in a strange way because when we breathe oxygen it's going straight
here and when we're when we're digesting food and burning food it's going straight here so although
this is the interface with the world really what's happening is going on here any problems that
we have in relation to the world we feel them foremost in our mitochondria and then and we
need to integrate this information across maybe hundreds or thousands of mitochondria and again
i'm thinking that fields are one way in which this can happen and then this is this is a single
cell like an amoeba cell then we have multicellular organisms and now we've got cells to bring together
all with these moving parts inside and finally a central nervous system which amplifies
all of this so the communications the electrical communications between single cells and their
interface with the world becoming incorporated into larger cells incorporated into multicellular
organisms and finally into a central nervous system this i'm suggesting is the substrate
which gives rise in the end to the complexity of our own consciousness um this is what i've
said perhaps i don't need to say it again i feel like i'm running out of time so what i'm going to
say instead is thank you to the guys in my lab who've been working on this it's pretty brave for
them to do it at all this is in fact an old slide they're holding the Krebs cycle and i like that
so much it was a birthday present a few years ago that i've kept it so off these guys have now
left my lab and i've had to put the ones who've joined since then around the outside i suppose
i'll have to change this at some point but um it's a brave thing to do to do a phd on the origin of
life and i'm beginning to start thinking about doing experiments on consciousness which is probably
even more foolhardy for them to join me uh so so i want to thank them especially thanks to the funders
and thank you very much for the invitation and for listening and i'm very happy to take questions
you
