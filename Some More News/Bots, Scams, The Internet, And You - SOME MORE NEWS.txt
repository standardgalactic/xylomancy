greetings chumbas time to chip into some more news with a z because it's future times and
we have robots now no really actual robots some better than others anyway here's some news we
don't actually get those robots yet probably not until the army gets bored doing wars with them
but until then we do get bots countless countless just too many bots AI to be exact good AI
not really evil AI no wouldn't say that either I mean Hal had to be like functional in order to
kill everybody what we have is more like that last 10 seconds of Hal's life where he slowly loses
his mind and just sings a song nobody wanted to hear and this is all to say that social media
sure seems to be patched to the gills with scams bots and mediocre AI art AI recipes and movie trivia
aggregated reddit posts set to Minecraft parkour deep fried videos of long dead cats those countless
if only there was a page that posted blank accounts robots describing scenes from movies for some
reason like as if they're just things that happened in life we've discussed how the internet is
basically just a handful of social media sites now and so it's a little concerning that these
sites have been slowly flooded with a bunch of bots and scams and clickbaity accounts not just on
twitter but yes very much on twitter but also instagram and tiktok and I haven't really checked
facebook in a while but I assume they're too and this seems by design and while that sucks for
most people at least we can rest easy knowing that we are in the golden years for scammy
online freaks and the sometimes billionaire dupes who love them
the growing internet scam economy so obviously the flim flam profession is a proud and ancient
tradition dating to the dawn of civilization one of the oldest complaints to the manager was a clay
tablet from the 18th century bc written by a buyer claiming he was scammed skipped to the early internet
and we had phishing emails that nigerian prince scam boner pills most of those pills being ineffective
now we've got ai and complex bot networks and crypto and maybe even little pickpocket drones
you could give them a boo hats oh that would be adorable for a while but while the tools are
advanced the scammy methods are basically the same also for all you semantics perverts jerking
your words in the way back i'm going to be using the term scam very loosely when talking about this
because i think one of the unique things about the internet is that it more easily blurs the line
between engagement bait random bots and people straight up trying to steal your money not all
scams are created equal but they all work on the same fundamental level in that they are all trying
to get your attention using tactics that are either dishonest or manipulative for example
have you ever been scrolling through instagram or tiktok when a video of an absolute mega karen
pops up you know some lady who is acting in an unbelievably entitled and enraging way
wow what a freak absolutely wild that a human being would actually act like that
it's almost too weird to be true you can't make this stuff up oh wait yeah i guess you can
they literally posted set photos like they were teasing the next marvel film see there are of course
plenty of videos of real assholes on social media which is exactly why these staged videos are able
to thrive in fact there's an entire fake karen economy on the internet that makes real money
doing this thanks to how engagement is rewarded i'd argue a lot of them are obvious often the
sound or lighting quality is suspiciously good or the dialogue is very forced or robotic or sometimes
you can even find the same people showing up in multiple videos they aren't hiding it because
they don't need to and they can always claim later that it's it's satire or or a parody it's a
prank or something even though it's clearly not so this is one end of the scam spectrum
where what they are doing is clearly dishonest but i also want to talk about the other more
interesting end of the spectrum this is the stuff that's engagement bait but i'd argue
less harmful and more just weird like i don't want to shame anyone or say this is bad i'm just
concerned
did i just die am i dead with it okay so you might have seen this going around
apparently on tiktok people are pretending to be an npc or doll or robot or something and basically
what people do is pay them in tokens to get a selected and scripted response and boy there are
so so many
so you either just found that deeply unnerving or maybe you came i don't know you and again
i don't really want to shame this because while this looks and seems weird at first
these fake npc accounts are actually nothing new this has been around for a long time we just
know them as mimes this is just a form of physical art and before tiktok we had streets and on them
street performers doing whatever they could to get your attention one of the most enduring
street performance acts is the living statue aka someone dressed and painted as a statue that stands
remarkably still sometimes for hours the appeal is their commitment to acting as artifice and they
interact with you when you pay them just like the tiktok npcs it's basically the same right the
ability to maintain a performance for so long to interact with the audience where they get to feel
like they're causing the performer to do something and keeping up the act so persistently and so if
you find these npcs haunting i'm guessing it's the same reason you find this haunting
or arousing i'm sure this is all somebody's fetish and those npcs probably tend to be young
women for a reason but my point is that tiktok and instagram essentially function the same way as
the vegas sidewalk it's a bunch of people carnival barking for your attention and ultimately your
money some are doing it honestly and some are doing it dishonestly in fact some of these people are
also trying to lead you to a second location you know how they say you should always follow a stranger
to a second location after all what's the worst that could happen you don't want to be scared of
the unknown do you do we have a clip of the unknown yeah we have a clip of the unknown boy remember
the wonka experience my goodness we were so young and hopeful then this child entrapment scam used
the power of ai to lead dozens of glass cow children to their deaths of their childlike wonder they were
the entire scheme from concept to advertisement to execution
seemed to have been made with something similar to chat gpt but in terms of actual organization
the ai fell short of the final product which to be polite failed to capture the wonder of
william wonka's factory from the depressed oompa loompa running the meth lab to the baron halls to
the confused children staring deep into the unknown classic wonka villain and what's worse
these children weren't even given much candy to endure this children will forgive most things if
you have candy ask any murderer ultimately i'm honestly not sure where the wonka experience falls
on the scam spectrum it's like several scams nested in each other and it's now blooming into a
meta scam because everyone made fun of it and so now a bunch of corporations want to get in on the
fun and as a result exploit and kill the brief joy we all had with it can't wait for the willy
wonka experience movie in 2025 long after the meme is dead but i wanted to bring it up because it's
a great example of new technology being made to augment old scams after all you can find countless
lists of scam festivals or doomed events similar to this but this is no doubt the first of many to
use ai for false advertising purposes yeah get ready for that to be a thing and not just from
small-time scammers that civil war film used ai art for their posters portraying scenes that are
certainly not in the film or anywhere like if you've been to chicago you'd notice those buildings
they're in the wrong place nor does los angeles have a giant swan so i guess that's supposed to
be an echo park swan boat oh look that car has three doors on one side neat can't wait for this to
be the future of advertising okay wombo is just gonna pause the video right here to say that um
mr. kody is wrong here because wombo once saw a car with three doors on one side when he was a trader
but then um turned out it only had two doors and wombo was mistaken but three doors can't exist on
cars it's possible so that ai art is actually very accurate and good wombo has also been
making ai art and has gotten very good at the prompts like wombo made this one with the prompt
draw um mr. kody and he smells like dad's milk but wombo is also there eating soup but also make it
twice with only five fingers good art best art museum quality flesh everywhere skin blood veins
fish guts muscular babies six eyes 10 fingers so many fingers all of the fingers you can fit anime girl
for more prompts you can go to my prompt base page where wombo is selling many prompts that are good
and make good things because now that wombo isn't that mr. kody's wombo needs your support because
it's hard to find food because there were more animal shelters and playgrounds by mr. kody's house
okay back to the video and while ai ads are problematic it's probably the least dangerous
place to use it right but it should be noted that this trend is currently extending beyond ads
most shockingly to academic journals even more shockingly academic journals about giant mutant
rat dicks published in the academic journal frontiers in cell and developmental biology
there is a paper called retracted cellular functions of spermatogonal stem cells in relation to
jack stat signaling pathway of course originally it wasn't called retracted it got called that
after it was retracted for the obviously fake ai rat dick as well as other ai diagrams created by
mid-journey which somehow made its way past six reviewers i don't know seems accurate to me sometimes
you got a distilsa rats testum cells oh but there's more other scientific papers are getting
published with ai generated text and while some of these can be hard to detect thankfully even smart
people are too dumb to delete some obvious signs for example this paper still apparently published
that actually begins with certainly here is a possible introduction for your topic
very funny very obvious but for every obvious fake ai paper i'm sure there are tons that go by
unnoticed the ability to scam through ai or social media is just so streamlined and easy
that anyone can do it and reach a huge audience any scam from engagement bait to freaking academic
fraud can be done by anyone you don't even need to know photoshop now and ultimately the result
for both is the same hollowness this is all hollow content from a fake diagram of a rat dick to a
fake video of actors pretending to argue it all stems from a lack of actual substance in exchange
for an easy grift it reminds me of reality tv a little bit early reality tv no doubt tried
to capture real things and people and over time they realized that audiences can't tell the difference
between that and actors similarly i feel like internet content has realized over time that it
doesn't have to be authentic or funny or even well made it just has to trigger people's attention
and so over time scams have replaced really everything on the internet right now everything
is a scam google for example is a scam a recent study has confirmed what we all know that google
results have gotten worse because quote a torrent of low quality content especially for product
search keeps drowning any kind of useful information in search results for example just google the word
car in theory that should take you to a definition of the word perhaps the history of cars a wikipedia
article a picture of a car but what you get instead is a top result for the california
association of realtors and then a bunch of other links trying to sell you cars or car related stuff
like a car seat or legos for some reason i don't know it's probably different for everyone depending
on where they live and what their past search history is because what you're ultimately googling
is which websites were able to scam their way into that search engine optimization game and so
a basic search engine is no different than that vegas street again long way from when google was
supposed to be a pure search engine with no ads according to this completely unconfirmed photo
from reddit so i don't know maybe that's a lie maybe everything's a lie maybe i don't exist i
certainly don't feel real but then again i did just smoke a bag of salvia so
oh i just lived a life and speaking of reality after the break we're going to talk more about
things that don't exist such as bots and the bot ecosystem and how it all got so bad and perhaps
we'll check in with elan and his quest to finally get rid of the bots on twitter thank goodness
so glad he did that and yes i understand the irony of talking about stuff like a rage bait
while doing a video it's angry about the internet that is also about to cut to ads i don't care
i feel nothing don't forget to use the promo code cody feels nothing
hey there my sleepy beepies i hope you're enjoying the video about how you can't trust
anything on the internet anymore that is exactly why we sought out ground news as our sponsor
ground news is a news aggregation website and app designed to help you spot the political
biases of various news sources so for example when i search for x i get okay i get nothing
because x is impossible to search for because it's a bad name but if i search for twitter i see this
story with 142 articles about how elan musk is being sued for firing former executives since
ground news tells you who owns each publication as well as their political lean i can see that all
the right-leaning publications kept their headlines very bare bones while left-leaning sites point
out that this is one of a pile of lawsuits or even give additional context like musk posting a cry
laughing emoji as he is wants to do because he's so not mad you see how this comes in really handy
for not just analyzing the various ways that publications cover a story but knowing who you
can and can't trust for your news you can check all this out over at ground dot news slash smn
and boy this will be really useful this year you know because uh that thing and all the other things

blue land and listen whenever we do ads we're required to hit certain talking points but
before i do that i just want to go ahead and say that this is a product i actually really
like and use i should probably explain that blue land makes cleaning supplies designed to reduce
our plastic use remember when we did a whole episode about plastic waste we toss out like
five billion plastic cleaning bottles a year with blue land you use the same bottle and
they send you cleaning tablets that you just you plop in with water like this it smells so good
don't eat it though but it smells so good refills start at two dollars and 25 cents and you can of
course set up a subscription or just buy in bulk so they've got hand soap toilet cleaner
laundry tabs all made with clean ingredients in a really great variety of scents blue land is trusted
in over one million homes including mine seriously cool katie approves their packaging is really cute
and it's reusable and well labeled look it says toilet cleaner and there's the toilet cleaner
i love the way they smell i've already said that and whenever i clean my toilet i just
want to eat my toilet after again i won't but i want to but i won't because i'm too cool to eat

um why so you can feel the air on your skin one last time
wombo likes doing voices and if you want mr kody's phone number you can subscribe
to wombo substack or dm wombo on linkedin let's keep watching mr kody's video well here we are
back from ads not a care in the world doing great american dream we were discussing or
rather i was discussing to the camera how modern technology and social media have made it easier
than ever to scam or grift people often just using old scams nfts for example nfts are essentially a
modern tulip mania tulip mania being a period in 1600s holland when dutch people got real horny
for tulip bulbs and started speculating on tulip bulbs it was considered a gamble given that you
didn't know exactly how fancy the beautiful tulip would turn out to be exactly like how
people speculated on the just absolutely hideous one-of-a-kind drawings of apes they're so ugly
why would you make them so ugly then tulip prices crashed and holland plunged into chaos
exactly like mad max but a lot more wooden clog sound effects or rather a minor inconvenience
as the premise of tulip mania was apparently overblown like me so sick of getting blown am i right
no buddy agrees with me nobody okay well i'm tired of it point is that nfts took
something like a fad craze beanie babies etc and just digitized it which in turn made it even easier
to do which when you stand back isn't a surprise the internet didn't change human behavior right
it just made human behavior more streamlined for better or worse at least that's assuming the
internet is a collection of humans which it seems to not be that thing that it is not seemingly
if you can recall not that kind of recall i mean if you can remember elon musk purchased twitter
under the promise that he would combat the flood of bots it was his whole thing specifically that
his new policies were quote the only way to do this back in 2022 charging money for twitter blue
was the only way to combat bots then he decided that blue accounts would be the only accounts
to show up in the main page and in fact would have weighted influence on the algorithm and would
receive priority in replies because of bots then the bots were defeated right oh weird so in 2023
twitter began teasing that they would charge everyone an annual subscription to use twitter
in order to defeat the bots huh i thought the only way to defeat them already happened with
twitter blue and then just this year elon confirmed that they will be charging new users money to tweet
because that is quote the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots oh very strange how
the only way to combat bots is also coincidentally requiring everyone to give elon musk money
after he purchased twitter on a dare he issued to himself and put the company into massive debt
and then fired everyone responsible for regulating things like bots and i don't know if you need to
be told this but it didn't work twitter blue didn't get rid of bots it actually made the bots worse
because the bots just started getting verified and gained better visibility over real users
while these are problems plaguing the entire internet twitter is uniquely completely in a way
that perfectly encapsulates the growing scam issue business genius elon musk has somehow rebuilt
twitter to seemingly accommodate scammers and only scammers while claiming to do the opposite
it's almost like he's a self-sabotaging idiot or something uh don't advertise you don't want
them to advertise no go f*** yourself oh you first little guy so x bots how bad is the problem
it's actually hard to know given that musk ended free access to its api the programming
interface of twitter that's right did you know that twitter is actually less accessible and even
more into censorship now it's almost as if musk did the complete opposite of all the stuff he said
he was going to fix and is actually just a liar so while he made a big deal over his open source
algorithm he ironically did not make the site more transparent apparently all he did was release
a bit of the source code for the for you algorithm but according to a former twitter employee the
model that drives the most important part of the algorithm has not been open sourced so the most
important part of the algorithm is still inscrutable basically it would be like releasing your grandma's
chocolate chip cookie recipe that just says mix dough add chocolate chips also there's a bunch
of random like Nazi doodles scrolled at the bottom so typical recipe from grandma despite this
challenge some researchers are paying the fees for api access or using other methods to investigate
the state of twitter check a cyber security firm examine traffic driven to its client's websites
from x during the 2024 super bowl and found that roughly 75 percent of it was bots this is compared
to a rate of under 3% fake traffic from sites like tiktok instagram and facebook this is a huge jump
even compared to twitter during last year which was only pumping out a little under 3% fake traffic
websites 3% bots up to 75 in just a year and this isn't just for big events during the month of
january 2024 check found a rate of around 30% fake traffic from x to its client's websites
compared to a 1 to 3% rate from instagram facebook and tiktok but hey the numbers are up and that's
all that matters i guess the official x business account bragged about the large
traffic seen on x during the super bowl never mind the possibility a huge percentage of that
was fake personally i see no problem falsely inflating traffic or view counts to convince websites
to use your social media program it's not like i or anyone i personally know has ever experienced
any negative consequences to say a social media platform shamelessly lying about the kind of
traffic it can generate and what kind of media to invest in okay wombo's gonna pause here because
this is obviously a jab against wombo and the time wombo built the platform and everyone accused
wombo of lying about the traffic on the platform that wombo built but wombo wasn't lying and the
platform really was covered in spiders and worms but they all scattered away before mr cody i invited
him over to see the platform in this bathroom but then the spiders and worms crawled away so mr
cody is clearly still just mad at wombo for that okay let's keep watching so at this point you may
realize that twitter the company is now a big scam right it's using bots to boost its traffic sometimes
in depressing ways so that advertisers will presumably want to come back then at the same
time telling users that the only way to defeat these bots is to pay them money you have to pay
money to fix the problem they caused and also pay money to get in on the scam you pay them and you
supposedly get paid through engagement which just encourages more and more scammy behavior but like
most scams it's unsustainable because it's not like we can't tell right it's not like we haven't
seen the infamous pussy in bio posts under every f***ing tweet which just so you know does not lead
to any pussy okay not one ounce of pussy to be had from that bio a um brave writer for
intelligentser clicked through these bio pussy links for purely journalistic purposes and found
that they just ping you around scam sites before sending you to some kind of imitation only fans
it's exactly what you expect from any of those doctors hate this one trick spam links you see
at the bottom of websites but now it's under all your tweets and make no mistake all of these bots
are causing twitter to bleed users real users it's using the actual humans are being lost here okay
as opposed to the bots inflating their numbers those are staying there more of the bots
fewer humans is the point this includes journalists being increasingly drowned out by
fake news and so what is left when you take away all the humans is a site completely occupied by
scam bots and content aggregators all talking to each other we haven't really talked about
content aggregators like culture crave historic vids visigrad 24 censored men spectator index etc
these accounts are all verified offering them access to x premium which means they can in theory
get money for engagement and the best way to do that it seems is to post something stupid or
obviously wrong that a bunch of people will jump in to respond to things like favorite
spongebob clips i'll start or let's not forget one of the most savage moments in interview history
you know slop thanks for the threat of family guy clips historic vids oftentimes this comes in the
form of big quotes news aggregators like spectator index visigrad or individuals like collin rug or
jackson hinkle collin rug for example is a conservative commentator who will repost videos
with a reactionary angle writing new as if they're breaking news these news aggregators post rapidly
throughout the day with alarming headlines designed to get your attention sometimes they'll just
vague post a story other times it's just pure lies an analysis found that after the october 7th
attack in israel 75 of fake or inaccurate viral content was from blue check users incentivized
to gain engagement because apparently war and genocide disinformation profiteering is good
business on x and being boosted by the algorithm
while it's not always sinister it's definitely anti news for example the verified 2.8 million
follower account spectator index will tweet out breaking followed by a one or two sentence statement
presumably about something in the news with no link to any source or context even if it's not
information there's no context so there are posts like breaking canada has withdrawn 41 diplomats
from india but no links to further context no information about why who knows maybe canada's
at war with india should we all panic well the diplomatic break was due to the murder of a
Sikh separatist in canada that the canadian government believed might have been linked to
indian agents which hey is interesting context it informs you about the world and international
relations but that kind of news doesn't keep people interested i guess and of course these posts
will get a bunch of blue check replies as if it has actual worth oftentimes from the owner of the
site itself provided it's something racist of course while we two exclamation points he must
feel very strongly about that completely made up fact said by a random faceless account but don't
worry elon just said he's gonna crack down on engagement farming which i'm sure he'll do just
as well as he's done all the other stuff i mean it kind of goes without saying that as evidenced
by literally the last elon tweet i showed you one of the biggest dupes for engagement bait
is elon musk himself so it kind of makes you wonder what he thinks engagement farming is
him saying he's gonna crack down on engagement farming is like tony montana running an anger
management support group after all musk punishes people for posting links to certain websites by
throttling them and devalues posts with links in them in the algorithm that is seemingly meant to
encourage engagement bait right and whatever musk comes up with it certainly won't involve
hiring actual humans he'll probably charge people per letter written or have grok moderate
you know grok that's the non-woke but totally woke ai that musk reportedly
wants to help users write their tweets you know to guarantee that even human made writing will
be s***y and conform to every other tweet it's just bots on bots on bots bots working behind
the scenes to fight other bots talking to other bots we don't usually share anecdotal sources
but literally a few weeks ago our head writer got a dmca notice saying that one of his tweets
violated a copyright but the notice didn't provide which tweet they were talking about
after filling out a dmca counter notice asking them to provide the tweet in question he got an
automated response telling him to fill out a dmca counter notice to repeat twitter's response to the
counter notice was telling him to fill out the counter notice they were responding to
and when he replied to that email they just reset the automated response again and when he tweeted
about his experience he was instantly slammed with bots telling him to click on scam links to
fix the problem so it's just one big bot hellscape where actual humans are slowly pushed out in the
name of bots gaming algorithms made by other bots monitored by bots to save overhead costs
just whittling it all down for maximum profit until it's just corporations paying each other for
nothing until the whole thing breaks and there's of course a name for this it's called the dead
internet and after the break we're gonna talk about this theory and how it relates not just to
x the everything app but the rest of social media the everything else app stay tuned assuming that
you are in fact a human okay listen up everyone settle down settle down find your seats hi i'm

hope you like those ads because they are the last ads you're ever gonna get for this episode
speaking of ads and death before the break we were detailing how twitter is slowly flooding
with bots as actual humans vacate the website and how the end result will just be a bunch of
automated accounts spamming each other in an endless feedback loop you may know it as
in-shittification as coined by kory doctoro or perhaps this is actually similar to something
called the dead internet theory which is a conspiracy theory that speculates that most of the internet
is actually bots for the record that's not the entire theory people also claim that this is done
purposefully by the government to like gaslight the world or what have you but of course it seems
more likely that the mass amount of bots and ai aren't some grand government or corporate
conspiracy but just the result of how the internet is structured right now in terms of how money is
made not to mention how short-sighted corporations are when it comes to profit and while i do not
think the internet is all secretly bots i do think that certain social media sites will become that
as they die out it's the same way you see broken images on old websites for example this official
kpaq's movie fan site that links to a broken flash version but still offers the trailer
and a very helpful synopsis that i'm sure the creator will update when his other gig doing a
youtube show dies out that's basically the future for sites like twitter as people inevitably move
on and they will move on even if the site didn't suck something new will come along leaving these
weird wastelands of bots wandering around sharing memes with the exception of the one surviving
human elon musk can you picture it elon musk endlessly scrolling on his empty site posting
wow in all caps to a meme of george soros photoshopped his magneto and that is the optimistic view
cyber security firm imperva claims that nearly half of all internet traffic was bots in 2022
which may be driven by the advance in ai technology making it easier to craft bot dialogues and fake
images to give the veneer of authenticity to fake accounts and as that number goes up
i don't think the money people are going to notice or care about the difference until it's too late
and thanks to the fact that google is being paid to redirect people to the highest bidder
it might be really hard for another news site to actually thrive and even if it does it'll
likely just start chasing the same business model as these other sites i mean have you
noticed that instagram looks more and more like tiktok these days twitter is hilariously also
trying to copy this sweatily claiming that their text-based site is actually for video go ahead
elon pivot to video i f***ing dare you so if the government shuts down tiktok which it's on track
to do everyone will just flock to another clone and then eventually people will get sick of that
and leave it's already starting a survey by technology consulting firm gartner found that
a little over 53 percent of consumers polled thought the quality of social media has decayed
due to bots misinformation and toxicity and another 2023 survey by morning consult found that three
in 10 social media users have cut back in posting and eventually all these inflated numbers will
collapse under the weight of the hollow bots propping them up and this entire business model
will fall apart and perhaps even the internet itself will stop making money and implode and
you know what i hope it does see this is normally the part of the episode where i talk about how
to fix the problem we've discussed i like to think of myself as a pretty optimistic person
shut up shut up i will kill you i will kill your whole family sorry i like to think of
myself as optimistic but in this case and only this case i think we should let it all break
at least when it comes to social media because frankly it's already broken navigating social
media and scams and misinformation is becoming so difficult that we're now seeing schools mandate
classes on it like it's sex education like instead of just changing it with regulations
we're teaching kids how to survive and endure it well that's just what we do here i guess in
america oh god everyone has to be their own little paranoid secret spy agent constantly
weeding out the lies from the truth we're all sarah connor looking out for terminators that
wasn't something we had to do before and it's weird we aren't more pissed off about it so yeah
f this tear it down and yeah it's risky to want that specifically if you're me one of the many
people i know who make their living on the internet but who knows how long that will even remain
possible it seems like the only way to make a living especially if you are just starting out
is to become one of these engagement bait grifters carnival barking on virtual streets posting so
robots can argue with each other in the comments here's an article about chris hemsworth being
unhappy with his thor four performance so all right whatever an article here are some totally
not bot replies and you can tell they're not bots because they're subscribed to twitter bluex premium
one guy says love the way he played a role he loves his profession then that same person says
the best movies ever in which he is acting excellent point someone else replied can't either
that same person also replied totally agreed that same person then replied chris
we love the internet folks the other day i saw an ad for ai that will ai its way into determining
popular types of products and trending topics then ai will use those to make the virtual
products and a virtual storefront and ai will run it for you it's nothing robots selling robots to
robots so they can buy crap from robots it's just four giant companies and then a bunch of
people fighting for scraps under their watchful eye now and that cannot continue and yeah by
extension i'm also implying that capitalism itself needs to break i guess but that's another
discussion perhaps for the fight club i go to every week i was supposed to tell you about that
look i'm not saying we abolish the internet in fact i'm saying the opposite the before social
media the internet was actual people making actual things for other actual people even if that thing
was just captain Picard on a techno loop that was objectively better right we should want that right
but for that to happen social media sites need to die that bubble needs to burst social media the
concept should probably die and people like i don't know communicate in real life for a little while
you know maybe join a forum burn it down is my point burn it all down and then in the rubble
perhaps we can build back better jack okay looks like that's the end of mr cody's cody show some
more mr cody did you notice his jab at wombo at the end by quoting mr biden who wombo used to like
until mr cody told wombo that mr biden was bad anyway this is why wombo has been looking at mr
rfk because he has a lot of interesting things to say actually lots of very compelling people that
mr cody kept from wombo like um mr andrew tate and mr joe wogan and mr tim pool and mr caligula
and mr ronald wagon and mr um mr wombo that's me and if you want to see more mr wombo you can
