There are two anointed ones spoken here in these passages at the end of Daniel's mind.
There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks, which means after forty-nine years,
namely that Cyrus. How do you know? Because Tobias says it, forget Tobias.
Look at Isaiah forty-five verse one. Cyrus is God's Messiah, God's Messiah. It says it explicitly.
But only here in Daniel's mind do they translate the word Messiah as Messiah,
and it goes further. They then capitalize the word Messiah. Open up your King James right now.
Open up your New American Standard right now. Open up your new NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized.
Now here is the ultimate brain, just the brain screw, and that is there is no such thing as a
capital letter in the Hebrew language. In Isaiah forty-five verse one, do you think that the word
anointed is capitalized or not capitalized? Until an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah,
the prince of the King James translate, will be seven weeks. Stop. There's a semicolon there.
Here's what I want you to do. I want you to open up a modern King James. That means not the 1611.
Let's go to the one that was just published yesterday. Okay. And notice. Wow. Thanks. So what
this is mind blowing. I mean, your frontal lobe should be shooting through your cerebellum,
and I don't even know what I just said.
Welcome back to the Gnostic Informant, and you are about to attain true gnosis. And I'm with Rabbi
Tobias Singer now, backed by popular demand as always. You know, after a couple of weeks,
people started people started asking in the comment section, where's the Rabbi? Where's he been?
I know. So, you know, I gotta, I do, I do what I'm told, you know, but anyways, anyways, I want to
talk to you about Daniel and this. So, like I said before, last time you were on,
right, I get these emails from people, they watch my they watch us, they watch you and
they're listening intently, and they want to learn. Like, oh, you guys are making good points.
These are unfalsifiable points are making, we can look these up, we could check the Hebrew,
and sure enough, you guys are right. But and I always get these, you always get these buts.
And then there's a couple more questions added tackled on. It's like, okay, Isaiah 53. Okay,
you're right. It's the Suffering Service Israel. We got it. You guys, you guys are right. All right.
And then say like, okay, the, the, the virgin thing, you guys are right about that. Okay,
whatever. You're right. You know, Alma, Betula, you got that. But now I got you. I got you in check
now. I'm like, okay, what is it now? Daniel, Daniel nine. Who else could Daniel be talking about
when he talks about the 70 weeks, the anointed one will be cut down. Right. It's so clear that
that's Jesus. So I'm going to throw it right over to you. You can take as much time as you need and
explain to us what this means. And how it how does it get so misinterpreted.
It should be said from the outset that if someone concedes Isaiah 53, which they would have to,
as you said, the context that demands it and concedes Isaiah chapter seven is not talking
about the birth of a Messiah 700 years later, you then control the New Testament in the place that
it belongs, the garbage, because that demonstrates that Matthew was misappropriating passages from
the Hebrew Bible. And both Isaiah seven and Isaiah 53 are used in the New Testament. Philip
famously used that with the with the eunuch from Gaza and Matthew 123. But Daniel nine,
you're right, stands out alone, very, very unique because Christians will say Daniel nine is very
different here because here we have a precise prediction of exactly when the Messiah is going
to be killed going to be crucified. We have the timing it is perfectly set up and is outlined in
the last four passages of the ninth chapter of Daniel. How could you deny Christ? Now it was
very striking about this. I brought up the Isaiah 53 and Isaiah seven, not just because you did,
but there's something very striking about Daniel nine. And that is the writers of the New Testament
did not consider that to be very important. In fact, nowhere in the Christian Bible did the
authors think or record that Daniel nine predicts the date of the Messiah's death. I mean,
you would have to believe that Paul knew that Daniel nine predicted that the Messiah would be
cut off, killed after 70 weeks. And Paul just didn't think that was important enough to mention.
You'd have to believe that the writers of all four Gospels and the letters of Peter and John,
no one thought it was important enough. So it's mentioned nowhere. And in a moment,
you're going to understand why there's probably no text in the Hebrew scriptures that has been
mangled more extensively than the ninth chapter of Daniel. And we're going to talk about what's
going on there. Daniel is using a unit of time that you, the viewer need to know before you can
get started. And that is he's using terms of days and weeks to represent years. So a week in Daniel
nine is meant to represent seven years. So 70 weeks is 490 years. And what the church had to do
was to alter the last four passages of Daniel nine in order to make it look like the Messiah
is going to come and he's going to be cut off and he's going to be killed before the destruction
of the second temple. This is exactly how it's going to be presented to you. But in order to
accomplish this feat, they had to change the text. Now, one point your viewers must understand,
if you don't get this, you're going to be lost. The word Messiah anointed Messiah is mentioned
39 times in the Hebrew Bible. 39 times is that word appear. As it turns out, it is never referring
to the Messiah who we refer to as the Messiah. Never. It refers to that's right. So this is
like a huge surprise. If you don't get this, you're not going to get anything. The word appears in
the book of Leviticus more frequently than any other. And there is referring to priests,
Kohanim, Ahmad the Senate of Aaron. So I people from my tribe from my family line are called
anointed. Now, in every other instance in the Hebrew Bible, with the word Messiah appears,
the Christian Bibles, the King James, the new international version, all them line up all the
usual characters correctly translate the word Messiah as anointed. But only here in Daniel 9
do they translate the word Messiah as Messiah, and it goes further. They then capitalize the
word Messiah. Open up your King James right now. Open up your new American standard right now. Open
up your new NIV right now. Messiah is capitalized. Now here is the here is the ultimate brain,
just the brain screw. And that is, there is no such thing as a capital letter in the Hebrew
language. I found that out the hard way. I found that out the hard way. When I started looking
into Hebrew, I said, wait, wait, wait, where's the, where's the capital? There's no capitalized,
no way. And then I was like, okay, that changes a lot of things. You know, people wonder why I
care about Christians so much. And why don't I get angry when I interact with Christians?
The reason I don't is I feel so sorry for them. My heart goes out to them. And if I was in their
predicament, that means I've read no Hebrew, I didn't say no word to Hebrew, even though
Christians firmly believe that the Bible, the Hebrew scriptures was originally written in Hebrew
slash is a little Aramaic, but it's, it's the even they believe that the Hebrew is the word of God,
but they can't read a word of it. And they are utterly dependent on the translators. So much so,
and you know this, right Christians argue over which is the right translation. There's some
Christians that believe that only the King James like what I mean, if it was good enough for Peter,
it was good enough. We know all the silliness. But this is why Christians could are so easily
victimized here is because they're reading Daniel nine, and it says Messiah, capital M,
and it gets worse. The word the Hebrew is Messiah, what the King James does, they amp it up,
and they put in the definite article, the Messiah, there is no definite article in the Hebrew. So
therefore, when you're reading a Christian Bible, you're reading a commentary, you're reading a human
iteration. And this is not just any translate, any translation is a human commentary. But in the case
of the Christian Bibles, and the fundamentals Christian Bibles, you're reading a corruption.
And I just for a moment, just so you know, I want to tip my hat to the normal Christians,
the mainline Christians, the revised standard version, or the new revised standard version,
does not engage in this idiotic process. They they're straight ahead on this.
And by the way, the King James only people who was the tribe I came from,
they thought these were demonic Bibles, because they were correct. They think that Satan corrupted
these Bibles. And I used to I used to go along with this. This is what the pastor would tell me,
oh, pull out your NIV, look, it says in anointed, and it's not even in capital,
it's the anointed, look at your King James, see, they changed it. And then I did the courageous
thing, the thing that you're not supposed to do. So I went online and looked up the Hebrew,
looked up the the manuscripts, looked up the Septuagint, and let's try to check them all up.
So I had to compare them all, found out that there is no the there's no capital M. It's
anointed. It's somebody who's somebody who's anointed as a priest.
This is going to gloom very large here. And you know, I'm going to say this to you,
I can't think of another theological conversation. Well, what we're about, what I'm about to share
with you is going to come up. So it actually when people say they only follow the King James,
the King James only people. So most people see that as completely insane. The King James was
commissioned this translation 1607. 47 people ultimately completed in 1611. And people really
think today that when they're reading a King James Bible, that they're reading the 1611.
If you had a 1611, which you can buy online, it's available. There is a 400 changes done
from 1611 to like 1807 or something like that. Right. And then there's another massive and
that's because the language changes, right? Grammar. I mean, when in 1607, the English is
called a Jacobean English, you can make it out. But it's Jacobean English. It's not choice, sir.
It's readable. But it's definitely not our King James. So the King James has gone through numerous
revisions, because grammar is updated, words are updated, the colon semicolon just came into
fashion. I mean, think of it this way, the King James version was published just a dozen years
after Shakespeare published the Merchant of Endless. Okay, this is really going back in time.
So it's been so like which King James are you referring to? Now you might think you the viewer
might think that I'm just sort of sort of poking something at people who are King James only,
I wouldn't waste my time with this, but this is going to become humongous in just a moment.
So what Christians are saying is that look, there are 70 weeks that are decreed upon the people
and the holy city, and then six things to terminate transgression and sin to wipe away
iniquity, to bring everlasting righteous and to seal the vision of profit, add to anoint the most
holy six things. Okay, and no one comprehend now in a King James Bible, it'll it'll read that from
the going forth the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem, until the Messiah,
capital M, the Prince, capital P, it's insanity, shall be seven weeks and three scorned two weeks,
which means 62 weeks, how much, seven, 60 and two, 69 weeks, and therefore and what will happen then
the streets will be rebuilt street and mode, but in troubulous times, verse 26, after the 62 weeks
shall Messiah, the Messiah be cut off, but not for himself. Okay, so they say here we have a
clear prediction of Christ crucified when Paul preached. Now let's go back and I think the key
question to ask a Christian, I've done this in many live debates that on YouTube where I've asked
the Christian like, what is your calculation? When do you start, how do you, when do you start counting
these 490 years like and Christians just have no idea, no idea, that's the key, but I've stood in
in huge audiences all over the world and when Christians ask me about Daniel 9, I've always
asked the simple question, if there's a 490 year period or a 483 period, eight year period,
because there's 69 weeks, at when do you start counting and why do you start counting them?
And Christians just completely shut down, they have no idea, they're not bad people,
they're just never taught this, their pastors are not evil, their pastors have no clue. So what
we're going to do is we're going to actually unpack what's happening here, because there's one other
thing that Christians don't know, we've gone through this before, when we've talked about Isaiah 714,
ask a Christian, what does it say in Isaiah 713, what is the context, when you read Isaiah 53,
what does it say in Isaiah 52 and Christians just go, the lights go out. So what is happening here
in Daniel 9, Daniel is an extraordinary predicament. Here's a prophet that is standing, this is how
Daniel 9 begins, in the first year of Darius the Mead, why is that significant? If you don't know
why that's meaningful, you can pack up and go home. What does that mean?
There is a prayer, Daniel is crying to God, he feels like the Jewish people are in an enormous
amount of trouble, and you have no idea how serious the problem that Daniel's confronting.
Daniel, and I'm just unpacking Daniel chapter 9 verse 1 and 2, Daniel is standing at a time when the
Babylonian Empire has just collapsed. Historians to this day are hard pressed to explain how this
could have happened. We talk about Babylonian Empire, you think about the United States,
this was a massive empire, like how did it collapse? And the Persian Empire suddenly
explodes into a massive empire, how did it happen? To this day, historians are hard pressed to explain
how this could have happened. But Daniel is looking at two passages in Jeremiah. If you don't know this,
you can't possibly understand Daniel 9. The first passage is Jeremiah chapter 25 verse 12.
It's a passage that looks very similar to Daniel chapter 29 verse 10, because both of them talk
about a redemption of the Jewish people full of Babylon, and they seem to be predicting the same
exact thing. Daniel chapter 25 verse 12, Jeremiah is speaking, and he's conveying that the Babylonian
Empire will collapse after 70 years. The audience needs to understand this, because if you don't
understand what's going on in this passage, Jeremiah is trying to convince the Jewish people
not to rebel against Babylon. That's a huge part of the book of Jeremiah. People are saying,
let's fight against the Babylonians. And Jeremiah is saying, God is not on your side. And if you do
fight against Babylon, God is not going to be with you. And in fact, they didn't listen to
Jeremiah. And moreover, Jeremiah says, the Babylonian Empire only has 70 years. So if you just shut up
and wait it out, they're going to be gone. That's the message of Jeremiah 25 verse 12,
and that's the context. There is another passage, which I'll read to you in the Jeremiah 29 verse
10. This is what Daniel is struggling with in that opening passage of Daniel 9. In Jeremiah 29
10, it says, thus saith the Lord, at the completion of 70 years of Babylon, I will remember you,
I will fill my good word toward you to restore you to this place. It seems identical. So imagine
Daniel is standing there, the unthinkable, the Soviet Union, a massive empire collapses.
The Babylonian Empire, your nemesis collapses. But nothing's happening. The Jews are not going
back. Darius, the meat is emerged. That means the Persian Empire has begun, right? And nothing is
the Jews are not going back. And Daniel is going, Oh, my Lord, this is ominous. Daniel begins to
think this is in the text and Daniel nine begins to imagine that whoa, the curse of Leviticus,
chapter 26 verse 18, which says, if you sin against me and continue sin, I'll multiply your
punishment seven times has emerged. And in fact, instead of this 70 year exile, there's perhaps
a 490 year exile. And that's what he's struggling with. The angel Gabriel comes to explain to
Daniel, what is actually happening here? I need one other short history lesson. It's fascinating.
I love it. Okay, so I need you the viewer to listen like you've never listened in your life.
This is a critical history lesson. We are talking about Solomon's temple that stood for 410 years.
History lesson, you must understand, or you can approach this text. 19 years prior to the
destruction of the first temple, Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian Empire emerged, pow, a massive
empire emerged, changes everything. Okay. So that's 19 years prior to the destruction of the
first temple. In the very next year, which is now 18 years before the destruction of the first
temple, Nebuchadnezzar, who's called Nebuchadnezzar, I think in the English size version, Nebuchadnezzar
invades the land of Israel, and he subjugates Jerusalem, which means the land of Israel becomes
a vassal state of the Babylonian Empire. Very critical. Nebuchadnezzar then will seek to
extract. He doesn't want to destroy a temple at that point. He doesn't want to do any of those
things. He just wants the Jews to give taxes to him and be loyal to him and give up on any idea
of rebellion. These kings usually, they're not like Nazis. They just wanted to kill this with no
genocide. He just wanted the Jews to say, for them to say, okay, we surrender, and we are now
going to look like the Russians in Ukraine. Just surrender, say, take it over, and you're now
under the Russian Empire. Okay. It's the same exact idea. The Jews don't want to listen to
Nebuchadnezzar as any people, they would fight for their independence, and Nebuchadnezzar then
begins waves of expulsion of Jews, multiple ways of expulsion of Jewish people. During these 18
years, and the Jews continue to rebel. Jeremiah pleads with them, don't rebel, but bear this in
mind. From 18 years prior to the destruction of the first temple, Jerusalem already is a
vassal state of the Babylonian Empire. There is no independence any longer. Now listen carefully.
In the 19th year from the Babylonian Empire, the first temple is totally destroyed,
and almost all the Jews are exiled to Babylon. A small number goes to Egypt, but that's not
germane right now. The first temple, Solomon's Temple, is utterly destroyed by the Babylonian
Empire. Here's one other key element, a date you must know. For 50 years from the time the
first temple was destroyed, until the Persian Empire emerges, which means dairies to mead,
a very brief interlude, but then Cyrus the Great is 50 years, a 50 year period
spanned from the destruction of the first temple until the emergence of the Persian Empire,
with Cyrus, who God calls his Messiah. I'm giving you a wink, I'm giving you a hint of what's going
on there. Back in Isaiah 45 says that Cyrus, who was a king, who was an anointed prince,
literally in Isaiah 45, Cyrus gives the command for the Jews to return back to Jerusalem
and to rebuild it. Okay, so therefore here's the key. If you're Daniel and you're standing at
when the Babylonian Empire is classed, but the Jews have not returning because you're
in dairies to mead, you're counting 70 years from when? 70 years from the emergence of the
Babylonian Empire, which means you just passed the 69th year. And you're going, okay,
one part of this prophecy has been fulfilled, but we're not going back. It's like you can
hear crickets in the background, like, what's going on? Like part one of prophecy is fulfilled,
a part two isn't fulfilled. The angel Gabriel is there to explain to Daniel that in fact these
two 70-year periods of Jeremiah 25, verse 12, and 29, verse 10 are two different 70-year periods
because the Babylonian exile, that means for the time the first temple was destroyed until the
second temple was built under the leadership of Zubaval and Yushua, Benyot, Sodok, that's 70 years.
So therefore there are two 70-year periods that overlap with each other and the overlap is 50 years.
And now we can understand what's happening. So Daniel was pouring out his guts and going,
please, Lord, have mercy on us. Let us go back to our land. Let not this terrible curse come upon
us articulated in Leviticus, chapter 26, verse 19. So the text actually reads, you should know and
understand. I'm going now to Daniel chapter 9, verse 25. You should know and understand
from the going forth of the word. What does that mean from the going forth of the word?
We know that from Daniel chapter 9, verse 1 and 2. That means from the destruction of Jerusalem
to return and rebuild Jerusalem until an anointed prince, the Hebrew is ad-meshiach-nogid,
will be shavuim shiva seven weeks. How long is seven weeks? Remember what I told you, each day
is a year. I'm not going to go into why there's a reason why each day is a year. In Daniel 9,
it's not the only place. It's very similar to Leviticus chapter 25. If you know what that means,
great. If not, I don't want to overload you with information. Seven weeks, which means 49 years
will pass from the destruction of the first temple until an anointed prince, ad-meshiach-nogid,
seven weeks. That's 49 years. Remember what I told you, from the destruction of the first
temple until Cyrus gives the command, see the opening passages of Ezra. This is why the
Christian Bibles take the book of Ezra and they shove it away from the end of it because they
don't want you to see it. That's why they mix up the order. They mix it up. Right, right, right.
In the Jewish Bible, after you finish Daniel, go to Ezra. That's a nightmare for the church
because if you finish Daniel, remember, Daniel is only 12 chapters and then you open up Ezra.
What does Ezra begin with? The book of Ezra begins not with Ezra. My friends, boys and girls,
in the book of Ezra, we're not introduced to Ezra until chapter 7. Ezra begins chapter 1, verse 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, in a pronouncement of Cyrus the Great saying, Jews, I have a word from God. You need to
go back and rebuild Jerusalem. You've got to rebuild your temple and I have it on word from God.
Why is Cyrus saying that? Because he has a 200-year-old prophecy from Isaiah and he's saying,
I have it on God that I've got to send you back. Therefore, what it says there is from the going
forth of the word, the word is the word, a prophecy of Lechervot Yerishlian. See Daniel 9,
verse 1 and 2, from the destruction of the first temple until Cyrus the Great. Who is Cyrus the
Great? He is not just anointed, but he's a prince. Now, how do you know I'm telling you the truth?
My friends, all you have to do is go to Isaiah chapter 44, verse 28 and Isaiah 45, verse 1.
That's where the chapter break is. That chapter break is completely artificial.
Who says to Cyrus, Isaiah 44, verse 28, he is my shepherd, all my desire will be fulfilled in him.
To say to Jerusalem, it shall be built and the temple shall be founded.
So says the Lord. I want to say that again and you can open up your King James Christy Bible
with 15 crosses on it. It doesn't make a difference which one you use. It will say,
to my anointed, to Cyrus. The Hebrew is Mashiach. And interestingly,
interestingly, my friends, take a guess before you look it up. In Isaiah 45, the exact same
Hebrew word, Mashiach, the Mashiach, to his anointed. Do you think in a kingdom, based on what I've
told you, in Isaiah 45, verse 1, do you think that the word anointed is capitalized or not
capitalized? In the King James? In the anything. In Jesus Christ. Right. In the Christ Jesus Christ.
Yeah, they're not going to capitalize that. They're not going to capitalize that. God.
Yeah. Which it shouldn't be. Which isn't. It's the same Hebrew word. Right. Why are you doing?
Why are you messing with you? You're right. That's exactly true. They're messing with the text.
You Christians, I say this with love, you need to go back to church and demand a refund.
You need to pull your kid. You're being lied to. I mean, you need to ask your pastor,
why does the exact same Hebrew word, which appears in Isaiah 45, is translated as anointed with no
capital A. And why don't you translate it as Messiah in Isaiah 45, verse 1? Listen, listen,
listen. Please, please, please. If you doubt what I'm saying, ask your pastor, ask any Christian
apologists. Why does the King James Bible? Why does the King James translate the word Mashiach in
Isaiah 41, five as anointed, but some, for some reason, in Daniel nine as Messiah, like,
what are you doing? It's the same Hebrew word. Could you explain that? Because if you can explain
it, I'm out. If you can explain it, I put a lot of money in that plate they pass around,
and I'm out of here, and I'm leaving skid marks, and I'm pulling my kids out of this Christian
school. That is another prime example of somebody taking the word batula, and changing it into,
or I'm sorry, Alma, and making that virgin, but then in other places in the text where
the same word is used, they don't use that. So they're doing it again. They're finding somewhere
in the Bible in the Old Testament, where they need to emphasize certain words that have to be
Christlike, capital M Messiah, but the same words used earlier in the in a different book
to describe the same person. Isaiah and Daniel are talking about the same person,
and it's capital, it's lowercase a anointed. It's the same word. Messiah is anointed. That's the
same word. It's the Christ. If in Greek, in Greek, it should say Christ, the Christ in one.
Right. I mean, although we have, right, that means why are you deliberately translating
the exact same word in one you're rendering as them and you put the stuff, the definite article
there stuff, a capital letter there, just please don't let let don't please don't let your pastor
or priest or Christian about whoever it is, don't let them like change, don't let them change the
topic. Okay, you got to try. I need an answer. And if you don't get a satisfying answer, I think
it's time for you just to consider what's happening to you. This is why I care because I know if I
grew up in a Christian home, I don't know if I'd figure this thing out. I don't know because I
wasn't, if I was grew up in a Christian home in Oklahoma, I wouldn't be taught biblical Hebrew.
If I was brought up in a Christian home in Kansas, they don't teach Kansas a pretty conservative,
a lot of evangelicals there. None of their schools for nine year olds are taught Hebrew. When I was
nine years old, I could read Hebrew like you read a newspaper. I mean, it's not I wasn't just a
spectacular student. I was very average, any Orthodox kid, they learned, we learned Hebrew.
I mean, we're just reading it straight through. And it's really easy. It's a small language.
It gets crazier than this. First, what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the final answer
first. And then we're going to back up there are two anointed ones spoken here in these
passages at the end of Daniel nine. There's one anointed one who comes after seven weeks,
which means after 49 years, namely that Cyrus, how do you know because Tove says it, forget Tove,
look at Isaiah 45 verse one Cyrus is God's Messiah, God's Messiah, it says it explicitly.
And then there's a subsequent anointed one who was cut off. He's not called a prince anymore
after 62 weeks. Now, I'm going to give you the answer now. And then we can backpedal this.
The distance from the destruction of the first time or the destruction of the second
temple is 490 years, 70 year exile 420 for the for the length of the second temple period.
When do listen very carefully? When does the priesthood get cut off and the temple gets
shut down? Let me wait at the end of the second temple period, when the Jews go to war with Rome,
when does the war with Rome commence 6466, 66, which is how long it's a half a week from 66 to
70 is how long it's three and a half years, right bingo, there is your half a week. So what
this is mind blowing. I mean, your frontal lobe should be shooting through your cerebellum,
and I don't even know what I just said. So in 66, what happens, the Jews go to war with Rome,
it's a horrible bloody war. The temple is surrounded. I'm a priest. That means I'm a
direct descendant of Aaron, my father, father, father going back today to see you understand
this, although there are many rules that govern my life that is distinct from other Jewish people.
As an example, I can't come into contact with a dead person. It's forbidden to pay.
There are rules that apply to me, but I can't bring sacrifices. I can't work in the temple
because there is no temple. That means when the Jews go to war with Rome, the whole temple gets
shut down, everything becomes isolated. It becomes a no, instead of a no flies on it becomes a
no sacrifice zone. So then an anointed one is cut off. That's the priesthood. That means
there are 130 commandments in a Torah at a 613 associated with sacrifices bingo, that's cut off.
The word he carries, means an anointed one means carries doesn't mean killed.
Now it could be if someone's cut off, or it could be removed, it could be the kill,
but it doesn't mean there are many ways you could say, you're hara Ignatius. That's how you would
say a Messiah is killed. A car race is removed. The root of the word means removed. Now what does
the Christian do with this? Because they want only one Messiah, and what they do, this tiny
complicated, my apologies to you beforehand, but you need to know these numbers, or you'll never
understand Daniel 9. Daniel 9 is describing two anointed ones, one that comes after
549 years, after seven weeks, and that's Cyrus, and a second subsequent anointed one, but he's
not a prince. He's not Cyrus. He's coming 62 weeks later, which is 434 years. That's three and a half
before the destruction of the Second Temple, and he is removed. The church hates this.
They need to have both anointed ones of the same, and this is where it gets interesting.
So if you're looking at a Christian model, whatever, it's going to make it appear as though
the period of time is 760 and 2. So the text is going to read, the Messiah, the prince,
and a King James shall be from going forth of the commandment to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem
until the Messiah, the prince, shall be seven weeks, comma, and three score, and two weeks,
which means 62 weeks. That means it sounds like the text is saying 69 weeks, but it's breaking
it up into a weird way. That means it puts a comma there, but there's no comma there. It
should be a complete semicolon there. This is where the King James of Vision is going to
blow your mind out the window. That means in any language, the way you say 69 is 69.
It's not just English. In French, 69. In German, 9 and 6. You never say 7, 2, and 60. So what the
church did was it compressed these two. It really is saying after 17 weeks, I'll translate, after 49
weeks, we have Cyrus, and after a subsequent 434 years, you have an anointed one, which is the
priesthood cut off, but they have to conflate it so they remove the semicolon and they put in a comma.
Now here is the craziness. I don't think you have it, but if you have it, I'd be blown away and
impressed. We don't prepare for our shows, so we just, we just wing it. If you had an actual
King James from the 1611, and I discuss this extensively in volume one, let's get biblical,
and I have a picture. I have the 1611, 1611 King James. If you had a, I don't know if you can do
this online or whatever. I have it online. I don't, I have the 1800 version, but I have it. I can get it
online. If you could, one, you could pull it up online. The actual 1611. Daniel 9 verse 25.
Right. In the 1611 King James, not in the 19th century King James, not in 18th century King James,
but the original 1611. In 1911, they actually pulled out the plates and republished it.
Yeah. This Bible is not, all the King James only churches do not use this Bible anymore.
It's not, it's not even readable. But do you want me to read it? It's beer, it's barely readable,
but this is the mindblower. I'll show it on the screen while I'm reading it too, so they can
see the grammar and everything. Okay. Verse 25 says, Know therefore and understand with the V,
that from going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem unto the Messiah,
the Prince shall be suing weeks, seven weeks, and three score and stop, stop right there.
Stop right there. What happens after seven weeks? Forget the crazy spelling that it's you instead
of you. What do you see there? Three score and two weeks. Well, before three stores, there is an
unambiguous grammatical notation. It's in Esnach in Hebrew. And what is it in the grammar there?
There's a semicolon. Do you see that? Oh, yeah, yeah. Thank you. There's a semicolon, which means
it's a stop, full blown stop. So from the going forth of the word, listen, my friends, like you've
never, from the going forth of the word, which means from the, go back to Daniel 9 verse one and
two, from the destruction of the first temple until an anointed one, a prince, the Messiah,
the Prince, how the King James translated, will be seven weeks. Stop. There's a semicolon there.
Because in 1611, they didn't come up with this whole deal. Now, they wanted you to think that's
talking about Jesus, because that already goes back to the second surgery, but they never thought of
compressing the two periods. Now, here's what I want you to do. I want you to open up a modern
King James. That means not the 1611. Let's go to the one that was just published yesterday.
And notice. Wow. Thank you. Seven weeks, comma, no semicolon. Right. The same. See what happened
is crazy, crazy, crazy. That means it just think about this for a moment. In what universe do you
say 69 by saying 762? That's, that's ridiculous. And to prove it further, look at Daniel 9 verse
26, the next page, just so you want to make sure that Rabbi Singer is not some fanatic who hates
Christianity, and is coming on here in order to just make just so you know for sure that Daniel
is interested in this Gabriel speaking here, that Daniel's interested in conveying a 62 week period.
Look at verse 26. What does it say there? And after three score in two weeks, shall
it doesn't say after seven, three score and two, it says after three, three score and two weeks after
62 weeks, 62 times seven is 434 bingo. So when I said to you at the beginning of the broadcast,
that this is going to make a humongous difference whether you're using a 1611 King James or 2022
King James, I wasn't exaggerating. So you need to ask the Christian, how do you play with this? And
we have two anointed ones here, one after seven weeks, I mean 49 years, Cyrus the Great, how do
you know he's the Messiah? It says so when Isaiah 45 verse one, it's really, really famous. By the
way, we've talked about this in the past, the people who were Trump supporters said, ah, Cyrus
is a picture of Trump and had the coin of Trump was was president number five. I had that one
actually. Yeah. So, so there, so that's how it's come. So there are two different anointed ones,
what the church does is it tries to compress it. There are more problems here than you can imagine,
because as it turns out, if you say that the anointed one who's cut off is Jesus, Jesus crucified
according to Christian tradition, either in the year 30 or the year 33. Well, that's not when the
temple is destroyed. That means if let's say Jesus crucified the year 30, it's not a consensus,
but let's say we'll say 30. So from 30 to 70, is that a half a week? What's the half a week? Like,
what happened? It means from the time Jesus is executed by crucifixion in the year 30,
until the destruction of the second temple is 40 years, 40 years is five and a half weeks,
it doesn't work. The whole thing completely collapses. Wow. Wow is right. So what happens is
the whole thing doesn't work. Because remember, in it, look very careful at Daniel nine verse 26,
there's a prediction of the destruction, the people of the prince will come, that's Rome,
and they will destroy what the city and the sanctuary. This is not, this is not like Antiochus
Epiphanes. This is the destruction of the sanctuary. We know when that happened in the
year 70. Yeah, really, it doesn't work. Whereas if it's a half a week prior destruction temple,
that's the year 66. One point that's going to come people are going to ask this question. So I want
to head it off. The the chronology of Herodotus for the period of the Persian Empire, which means
the length of the second temple, I don't want to get too advanced on this. And the Jewish chronology
are very different here. The Herodotus is the, he's either called the father of history, or as
Xenophon fondly refers to him, and sister as the father of lies. Herod, if you read any,
he does make up a lot of stuff. It's an example. Give you an example. He says the people in the
north are called the hyperborians and they have one eye. They're like little, little tiny guys
with one eyes on their forehead. And they have gold guarding griffons that fly around flying
lines. And then he said that King Cyrus got killed for going up into the land of the Scythians
and throw chop his head off, which other historians not like what that didn't happen.
So yeah, that's just to give some examples. There are this is this is a good geography stories
referred to Herodotus as words, but just in completely insane. If you read it, you could
pick any article on Herodotus, any encyclopedia you want. I'm making this up. I don't know this
for sure. But I'm guessing within, I'm fairly confident within 75 words, it's going to talk about
Herodotus is lies and all the problems around us. Just stuff right, you know, one of his maps.
He makes a map of the world is a little circle, right? It's like, it's just a little circle. It's
like, right, there are places he said he's been where we know he hasn't been. There are whole
dissertations been written, not one thousands of dissertations.
He said the Arabian worship Dionysus. What?
Right. I mean, it's not that he made a mistake. I mean, this is the ancient world.
So there's a fear that he was just bat nuts out of his mind and just made up stuff and he was
lying through his teeth. Yeah, I mean, ours. Yeah. Yeah. So this is so I want to explain this point
so there is a, there is a considerable difference between and I write about this and let's go
biblical volume one. There's a considerable difference of the Jewish chronology of the
length of the Persian Empire and the secular chronology, which relies on Herodotus. We don't.
So just so you understand this. So the period therefore of in some the period that we're
discussing here is a 490 year period, 70 plus 420. And the anointed one who's cut off is my
great great grandfather. And that's the priesthood. The term cut off, not Yikari means cut off,
removed. It could be killed. Doesn't mean that if you wanted to say killed, it'll be Yahare would be
killed. Doesn't say that at all. And that happens when a half a week if you ask Christians, by the
way, what do you do with the last week? They have no clue. If you ask the Christian, but wait,
there's another week and then there's a half week. When did that week happen? There's no answer.
How is it that Jesus was crucified near 30? But the sanctuary is destroyed 40 years later,
when you have a prophecy that happens immediately after there is no possible answer. I'll tell
you this, I did the forensics on this means I wanted to find out who started this. When did
who made this? Who came up with the idea? Because as I mentioned at the outset,
the Daniel 9, this whole thing with the dating is not in the Christian Bible. They didn't think
of this stuff. They didn't come up with this one. And it basically comes down to the time of Irenaeus
meaning basically late second century. Yeah, you could tell, yeah. Right. And but it's funny because
it almost makes you wonder if after, so after the temple is already destroyed, Paul writes
his stuff, Paul doesn't do any of this stuff. He doesn't even get into the years or nothing.
So you know that Paul is not talking about this or thinking about this like you mentioned before.
But it makes you wonder if going forward, the church or early Christians are looking back
in the text and trying to plug these numbers in because it's like, okay, Jesus, well, you know,
the destruction of the temple is sort of close to what he was crucified for 40 years, give or take.
Oh, he was probably born at the year one then, which wasn't the year one. I'm just saying that
just so we can understand. The year one didn't happen for like, what 700 a year? What is it?
Like, it's way, way later. Anyways, but anyways, they're probably making these dates fit. And we
don't even know when Jesus was born. If he was born in four BC, he had to have been at least born
in four BC, because that's what Herod and Matthew. Yeah, right. So like, so the numbers are even
less than two, right? Right. So Matthew, yeah, that's what I'm trying to get.
Right, right. The guy who invented our year, that means like, we're in 2022, like,
who came up with that? And when did people start using that? So it was the sixth century monk,
his name was Danesius Exigius, which literally means Danny the dwarf, I have no idea how that
happened. And that's what I'm, and that's what he was doing. He was trying to make the numbers fit
to 70. Right. Which he was close, but it just doesn't match. It's just literally impossible.
I don't envy him because as it turns out, as you know, Matthew and Luke date Jesus's birth
of more than a decade. As you mentioned, Matthew has Jesus born while Herod the Great is still
alive. And Herod the Great is saying in Matthew's infancy narrative that look at look, you know,
kill all the kids who two years years older and younger. Therefore, six BC would be I had a rabbi
who once said isn't it interesting that according to Matthew, Jesus was born six years before Christ.
That's a whole different joke. It's so crazy. According to Luke, according to Luke, Jesus was
born during the time that the governor of Syria took over from Herod Archelaus, Uranus. So that's
the year six C we know that. So they're actually 11 years apart. There's no year zero. So I mean,
what was dynasty is Exegius going to come up with? I mean, this is sixth century. I mean,
the lights went out in the sixth century. You know, kudos to you for trying to come up. He's
basically trying to do a tation, you know, a diatestron where he's trying to merge everything
together. Doesn't work. He tried his best. Yeah. And that's what I was just going to say. Like,
it's one of those things that you look at and you're like, wow, they almost made that fit.
They almost did. But it's like, but once you look at it, once you actually get to the numbers,
and you actually plug in the numbers, look at Matthew when he was born, when all this happened,
you're like, no, it doesn't, it literally is impossible for this to fit. And then you would
have to ask yourself this question. If it's so close, oh, it's so close. Well, we're talking
about God here, is God going to be close? Is it going to be a couple of years off? Or is he going
to be this is going to be right on? So you can't it can't be that way. It's close enough. Come on,
we're all four years, three years here. No, it doesn't work that way. It's not, it's not right.
It's not on. Right. So it's, I'm heating up your point. Well, it's not just a matter of how much
time so 11 years, let's stop being so picky, you know, it's two different periods. Herod,
the great dies in four BC. His son, Herod Arculius takes over and he governs over Judea. Herod,
Herod the great was insane. He was a maniac. His son was crazier than his dad. Yeah, was
totally insane. That fits into Matthew where Joseph is born. Don't go back to Bethlehem.
It's the heart. Herod Arculius was so crazy that he was too nuts and too anti-Jewish and too
violent for the Romans and they fired. This is the very big point. So they were just
the puppets of Augustus. Right. They're all puppets. These are not really the king of the Jews.
They call themselves that. They all are answering to the emperor of Rome. But
as far as the emperor of Rome is going to call yourself what you want. I don't just
pay the taxes and you're fine. That's what's going on. So Herod the great dies in four BC. Herod
Arculius takes over the region called Judea, which essentially is everything south of Jerusalem. Herod
Arculius was a psychopath. Definitely inherited his father's craziness. There was no Haldol.
There was no lithium at the time. And he went berserk and ultimately was a slaughter of Jews
in the temple in the year six CE over a Passover massacre. The Romans go, you are crazy. Imagine
if you are so nuts that you're too crazy for the Romans. And the Romans says, Herod Arculius,
you're out and he's fired. This is like very well known. And then he brings in and he goes,
let's take that Gentile from Syria who's the governor there, Uranus,
and bring him in. And then he not only has Syria, but he also governs now over Judea.
Okay, so we know when that happened. I mean, they can't be the same. That's six years. Right.
Exactly. We know when all that happens. We have multiple sources on this. So this is not like,
and of course, Matthew and Luke go in two different directions. Right. Luke has the family,
you know, start off in Nazareth, and then go to Bethlehem because of the census. That's the plot
device that Luke is using following the birth of Jesus. He's not born at home as in Matthew. He's
born in a manger because there's no room at the end. I just heard a Christian apologies. I'm not
going to say who, but he's a fairly well known guy. He say in a debate with a really well known
non Christian New Testament scholar that the Mary and Joseph had two homes. I'm not,
I'm not kidding. I'm not going to name names because I don't want to embarrass anyone. Yeah.
Okay, so I need to say this because I don't know if anyone's going to say this.
In, you need to know this because I just saw this in the debate that just occurred like a month
ago. I'm not naming names because it doesn't interest me. So what happens is the non Christian
New Testament scholars said correctly that Mary and Joseph in Luke's view, start off their home
is in Nazareth. The census forces them to move to Bethlehem. Why? Because Joseph is a descendant
of King David. Okay. Just look at Luke chapter one verse 27. Okay. It's really right there. Okay.
Now they then after the child is born and they then go back to Jerusalem drew just so you know
if you draw a line from Nazareth to Bethlehem, it would basically pass through Jerusalem. The
distance is not that far. Let's say it's 90 miles something like that. Okay. So they, she then after
the month period, she then brings the necessary offerings in the temple and then heads back home.
In Matthew, it's entirely reversed the families originally from Bethlehem. And then the family
has to go down to Egypt and wait to death of Herod. And then Joseph is born. You can't go back home
because the new guy Herod Archaeologist is crazy and his dad. And therefore they go to Nazareth.
I saw this in the debate with this Christian, who's an who's a knowledgeable guy, this Christian
Apologist answered this by saying that actually Mary and Joseph had two homes. They had one home
in Nazareth and another home in Bethlehem. Okay. And I'm sorry that the non-Christian didn't respond,
but he should have responded. That's completely ridiculous. Why? Because see Luke chapter two,
verse seven. It says in Luke, remember, they don't have a home. They don't have a home in Luke. I'm
giving this all the way. They don't have a home in Bethlehem. Joseph and Mary are from Nazareth.
And there's no room at the hotel at the end. Jesus went in a manger, right? Now I don't,
I was watching it and rooting and going, wait, there's a, they couldn't have had two homes. The
whole point of Luke is that Jesus was born in the most distressed, the most humble place possible,
a place where horses eat from, a manger, a trough. And why Luke says? Because there's no room at
the end. There's no room at the hotel. But if, as the Christians say, that Mary and Joseph had
two homes, one in the Galilee and one in Judea and Bethlehem, why would they have to give,
why would they have to go into a barn to give birth? Why don't just give birth in your home?
And I'm sorry that the non-Christian didn't get that one.
That's very obvious. That's like a brain scientist to figure that one out.
Right. So in Bethlehem, notice, and therefore you can project from that. So Matthew, would we expect
in the book of Matthew to have any mention of a manger? No, because their home isn't Bethlehem.
That's what they originally, that's the starting point. What's happening essentially is Matthew,
Luke, are independently inventing two different infancy narratives or collecting an oral tradition
of the infancy narrative in two different places and come up with two separate incompatible devices
to get Jesus to be born in the city in which King David was born. King David was born in Bethlehem,
save for Samuel, chapter 17, verse 58. So, but they independently come up with this. So this is an
L source and an M source. And then the whole thing explodes, but it's too late to
rectify because you have, I mean, people think that like at the end of the first century,
people had a Bible like we have together. No, there were certain communities that had the
Book of Luke. Some communities that only had the Book of Mark and some only Matthew. By the time
you get to the second century, it's too late. And by the time Irenaeus, the Bishop of Leon,
saying these are the four, that's it, it's all locked up. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.
There's a lot, you just, I just learned a lot in this. Wasn't that intense? Yeah. Right. And it
turns out I won't name names, but there are Christian evangelical scholars who to their credit
can see that these are completely incompatible. Yep. Oh yeah, I've talked to those people.
Yeah. And I don't want, but they're, they know this can't work. Right. And therefore the entire,
it's very obvious what's happening here, what's happening in Daniel 9 is, is they already have
an idea. And then there's a bias confirmation, which is they want to have Daniel 9 predict the
date of Jesus' crucifixion. They don't care how it's done. And then they go back, scour through
text, and then twist the passages, change the, the, the anointed to capital M messiah,
put the definite article, it doesn't exist there. And then just chop it up, take out the semicolon
that's done somewhere between 1611 now, it's done in the 19th century, then the semicolon
puff just disappears. There is the unambiguous of grammatical device called an esnachta,
which is there. And if you're going, well, the esnachta was invented by the Messerites,
meaning it's a, it's a grammatical device. If you think that the Messerites just made it up,
in what universe is 760 and 2, the way you say 69? And in case you're saying, I don't believe
Rabbi Singer, just look at Daniel 9, verse 26, it says, after the 62 weeks, doesn't say after
the 69 weeks bingo, dead, it's over. This is why Christians do not teach their children
the Hebrew language, despite the fact that Christians believe that the Hebrew language
was used to convey, convey eternal oracles. They can easily, Christians could do exactly
what the Jewish people can do. And that is enough with the Latin and teach biblical Hebrew
to young boys and girls. They don't. If Christians could read the Jewish Bible
in its original language, they'd be leaving the church. Now, Christians can study Hebrew as an
adult. Go to college, take biblical, it takes years. I mean, when you're an adult, language
doesn't come to you. But it's too late, you're already bought into the system. And then you're
reading everything through a Christologic grid and becomes really very difficult. But this is why,
you know, Christian schools for kids, they're not teaching their, they're not teaching Hebrew to
the kids. You want to take biblical Hebrew at Full Atheological, Dallas Theological,
Little Bible Institute, you're 19 or 20 years old. I mean, if you want to be pastor, I don't know how
many semesters you got to do a biblical Hebrew, you're not going to be able to barely make out a
word. So you're done, you're smoked, you're fried, you have no chance at all. And then I think, you
know, I think that's why the King James only, that's where they get their traction from. Like,
why would anyone believe that folks from the Church of England, that 47 men in good standing
from the Church of England, that they would write something as divinely inspired? And to their credit,
even though, you know, it's easy to mock the idea, because they don't have a holy language,
the King James has come to replace their holy language, right? Because they have no access
to the Hebrew. I mean, even if you think that a movement is insane, like a King James only,
it sounds crazy. You do have to ask the question, but like, why is the, what is generating this
excitement? What is, what is the spark? And if they don't have access to a holy language,
then they, then what happens is then the, then the King James and the kind of Jacobian English,
it's not really anymore, but it's been cleaned up a lot. It's that King Thou art and so on.
Verily, I sent you words that are, it gives people something that becomes the holy language.
Yes. That's what's really going on. It's Shakespeare too. It's Shakespeare language.
And that's what's so funny about it. It's like, it becomes, like you say, it's the archaic English
language. You know, when the King James was written, there were no Jews in England. The Jews,
there was not a single Jew in England in 1611. The Jews had been expelled centuries early. There
were no Jews there. None. Not a Jew to be found in England. Jews would not return to England
till 40 years after the death of Shakespeare. Shakespeare is alive and during the time when
the King James Bible is published. Yeah, as I said, just a dozen years after the merchant,
I mean, he's writing the merchant of Venice, having never, Shakespeare never met a Jew in his life,
right? Ever by the Calvin. He was part of the Kingsman, which was a, right. It was,
was funded by King James. It was in the same court and it had Shakespeare and all the plays that
you, all the plays that we know, all the Macbeth and all those from like 1604 to 1610 around the
same time they're writing the King James Bible. It's all happening in the same decade.
I wanted to just submit one other thing for evangelicals to consider, just ponder about this.
Evangelical Christians are not fond of the Church of the Latter-day Saints. They consider the Mormons
to be a cult. I'm not making this up for those who are not familiar with this. Oh yeah. If you ever
refer to a Mormon, right? If you ever refer to a Mormon as a Christian in the presence of an evangelical
or Roman Catholic, they'll say they are not Christians. This is a, they're called a cult. They
can't stand them, not personally, but theologically can't stand it. You can call a Catholic a Christian
in front of a Baptist and you can get away with that, but you will never get away with calling
a Mormon a Christian, like Senator Orrin Hatch just passed away. You know, they would never refer
to him as a Christian because he was a Mormon. Okay. This is, I want you to listen very carefully.
I've never said this publicly. If you ask an evangelical Christian, why don't you believe
in the Church of the Latter-day Saints? What's wrong with it? So they would give you a whole
list of problems with it. They would say that it's in, it's incompatible with the teachings of the
New Testament, the Book of Mormon. They would say that Joseph Smith is whatever. He was a,
he was quite a prankster and so on, blah, blah, blah, a whole bunch of, but in that list, evangelical
say to you that in the Book of Mormon, a ton of the Jewish Bible is quoted. That means the Hebrew
Bible is quoted all over the place. More than 20 chapters of the Book of Isaiah appears in the
Book of Mormon. And guess what? In the Book of Mormon, which version of the Bible is used,
was revealed to Joseph Smith through the Angel Moroni, the King James Version, the 1611 Version.
And even evangelical Christians, why am I appealing to you, the Christian,
properly and correctly laugh and go, why would the Angel Moroni be quoting the 1611 Bible?
Like did the angels forget Hebrew? Like why would the angels be quoting the 1611? I'm not
making this. So this is like a big deal because all over the Book of Mormon, huge swaths of passages
all over the Jewish Bible is quoted and it's straight King James, King James 1611. And even
evangelicals is why I appeal to the evangelical. Use that critical thinking when you start quoting
Septuagets. Use that critical thinking when you start quoting King James. I mean, if you understand
that the Book of Mormon is a book that does not deserve your respect, attention should not be
you should not be relied upon is not credible for many reasons, including that it's using the
King James Version, then apply that in the same angle, holy moly, why would I think that the
Writers of the Testament are relying on the Septuaget? Right, just like wake up and people
don't think about such a good point. Yeah, right. Like, like, you reject, you're rejecting all these
other iterations of Christianity, then use the same critical thinking and apply it to what you
belong to, apply it to your iteration of Christianity, go what being the Holy Spirit was
using the Septuaget to inform Matthew, how to write Matthew 123, really like God, the Holy Spirit,
the third person of the Trinity, just forgot how to read Hebrew and decided to be reading from
a translation. Does that make sense to anyone? Shouldn't. This is clearly written for a different
purpose. And it's being repurposed by Christians, tweaked, even change and altered in some areas,
for example, capitalizing letters and changing stuff. And you can see clearly that it just doesn't
match doesn't like do the check the numbers, the numbers don't match up. But for what you were
saying in the beginning, it does match up, where you talk about the temple actually being destroyed,
and the priesthood being cut down. That's right, it matches precisely with history.
I want to convey this again. You know, many New Testament scholars, even I've done shows with them
and you know, they're much nicer than I am about this. They go, Well, I had some way. No, this is,
we're not talking about, you know, there was a wrong approach or whatever. This is chicanery.
This is the kind of stuff that if you're an attorney in the United States, and you played
with the contract, and that was discovered, you'd be disbarred for that. You'd be thrown in prison
in the United States or any civilized country for engaging in this kind of tampering with
contracts. And that's not an ordinary, there's not a real estate contract. This is, you believe
the word of God, what does that say to you? I mean, why would you play with the word of God?
And not only and even outside of the Bible, like when you get this, the Josephus, the famous text
about Josephus, with the text testimony and Flavianum, we know that's been altered and
interpolated and even basically just hacked up. And like you get other areas where Eusebius just
makes up story that didn't happen. Once you like, like, like you were mentioning this was in a court
case, there'd be people going to jail over this, this you would be no longer a credible,
a credible witness. There's nothing you could say anymore that we should listen to.
You're getting caught all over the place, getting caught with the Bible, getting caught outside
of the Bible, the church is all corrupt. Like, it just doesn't look right. Like if this is the
real religion of a real God, he you would think there would be some order going on here and not
just a bunch of criminals making stuff up, getting caught left and right. You're raising a very,
very hot item. And that's testimony and Flavian antiquities 1833. Right. The reason why this
is insane that you brought that up, because this is amping it up further. Here, all scholars,
Christian or non Christian concede that this text has been completely corrupted. The only
argument is, is it a complete invention? That means the whole thing about Jesus being in Christ,
who was a man, if you can call him a man, means everyone agrees that this is a this has been
corrupted. This is not like some people going around. No, no, it was really a Christian. Zero
people say that. I mean, you have to really be drinking an enormous amount of propofol. I don't
know if you could drink it. I mean, you have no idea how much Johnny Walker you have to drink
to consume to believe that I mean, Josephus wasn't I see in Crete. It's literally the nice
C and C just injected into the text. And what's so crazy about this, though, is that we all even
scholars and atheists and critical scholars, we all and and believers alike, all of us when we
talk about this testimony in Flavianum, we can get into this more on another day. But just real
quick, what blows my mind and I don't understand this, I literally to this day, I'm like, in shock
that we talk about this, like it's not that big of a deal. Like, yeah, they just just altered the
text a little bit. But you know, so wait, hold up, pause it for a second. Shouldn't this should
be like all over the place? Like, it doesn't matter if it was originally some skeleton version of
this or not, whether it's all invented and all forged completely, or if it's interpolated,
that is a big deal. That should be like, holy crap, the church is messing around and trying to
change things. If it's if this is all true, they shouldn't have to do anything. Let the word be
the word and let it let God do his thing. Why are you have to why to do all these extra stuff?
Right? That's what I'm getting at. Right. So here, here's where it goes. If Christian
scribes were perfectly willing to corrupt the your own New Testament, for example, add in 12
verses at the end of the book of Mark, because Mark has no appearances, resurrection appearances.
It ends at chapter 16, verse eight. If they're willing to mess with their own New Testament,
adding in the story of the adulterous woman in in the book of John, to chain to add in Luke 2219,
half of that passage and all of verse 20 is added in because Luke didn't have the Eucharist,
didn't doesn't have vicarious atonement. So therefore, it wanted to mess if they're willing
to mess with their own Christian Bible. What do you think they would do to Josephus? Like
Josephus is not considered a holy book to them. Right. And incidentally, loads of church fathers
quoted Josephus. Origen was a genius. Origen was a third century church father. No doubt the
brides didn't even know that that verse was there. He wouldn't. That means there's a first he's
courting Josephus up and down. I do want this third century. Origin, just so you know, was only
one of two church fathers that's that was completely fluent in Hebrew, only him and Jerome. Yeah,
origin was really was a genius. He was a prodigy in his teens already. He was a Jerome says that he
wrote 2000 books in his life. That might be an exaggeration, but he was just he was really quite.
He knew Josephus backwards and forth. He didn't think that was important. Moreover,
origin says in his commentary on Matthew chapter 16, that Josephus was not a Christian. Yeah,
he's too bad to believe in Jesus. Right. He said he says that it means zero church fathers.
Nobody and suddenly at the same time of the council I see approximately, you see it as you
said the the the historian of the church, right? He he's the one who's responsible for inserting
testimony in Flavium. But this shouldn't come to surprise anyone because you have a criminal
endeavor already changing the Hebrew Bible in order to make it appear Christological,
changing the Christian Bible in order so that Mark matches Matthew. And that's why my friends
Luke didn't believe in vicarious atonement, didn't believe that Jesus died as a as a sin offering
as a ransom for your sins. And that's why you'll have in Mark chapter 10 verse 45,
in Matthew chapter 20 verse 28, the reference to Jesus died as a ransom for your sins,
but appears nowhere in the book of Luke because Luke didn't believe in that. And therefore,
they had to corrupt Luke 22 in order so that the Eucharist Luke matches Matthew and Mark.
If they would do that to their own Bible, what do you think they would do to Josephus? I mean,
this is a no brainer. Exactly. Yep. Well, this has been fun, like always. And yeah, anything else
I want to add in anything going on books, anything like that? Yeah, I mean, you know, my books are
Let's Get Biblical and I have a fairly large channel on YouTube and it was a joy to do this
with you and I look forward to doing another program and it was just great. This is a very
exciting topic. Yes, it is. And like I always say, you have just attained true gnosis.
You have just attained true gnosis.
