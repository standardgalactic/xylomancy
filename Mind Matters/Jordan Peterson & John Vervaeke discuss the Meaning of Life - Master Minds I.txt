What does the word meaning denote in the expression meaning of life?
Is it a directive, a feeling, or something else entirely?
Well, I think it's not a straightforward manner to discuss the meaning of life,
because it's pretty clear that there are multiple meanings,
and those meanings are associated with different events and situations.
I think you can still intelligently address the issue of the meaning of life,
because meanings tend to arrange themselves into a hierarchy of value and relevance,
and they have to do that because otherwise there's nothing but,
as William James suggested, sort of a blooming and buzzing confusion.
So the issue is multiple meanings in a unified, integrated framework.
Meaning is partly an impetus for action.
It's very important to remember that human beings are active and living creatures,
and that one of our primary problems, in fact, perhaps our primary problem,
is how to act in the world.
But that also involves other questions like how to perceive, how to prepare for action,
how to plan for action in the future.
And so all of those questions are associated with meaning.
For me, meaning is the abstract impetus towards action, fundamentally.
And it's an important thing to give some consideration to,
because part of the Western intellectual tradition tends to abstract rationality
or consciousness from embodiment, and it's very much the case that we are embodied creatures.
You know, the idea that our brain is in our head and that our mind is in our brain is,
it's a useful idea for certain purposes, but it obscures much while shedding light on other things.
So meaning is tightly associated with action, with the abstraction of action,
but then also with the construction of the perceptual frameworks and emotional responses
that are necessary to conceive of the world in a manner that allows you to act in it.
So one of the things we know, for example, is that when you walk into a room like this
and you see the furniture of the landscape arrayed in front of you,
that one of the things that you directly perceive is actually the meaning of that furniture.
And you might think that you see the object and infer the meaning,
and that's what you would think if you were a traditional Western rationalist or even a materialist,
but it actually seems to be the case that when you walk into a room like this,
the room tells you what to do at a level that's below conscious realization,
and it's partly because, well, you know exactly what chairs are for.
You might ask yourself, for example, what is a chair?
It's a complicated question because it could be a beanbag and it could be a stump,
but fundamentally a chair is something to sit in,
and when you see a chair, the chair tells you directly as a perceptual consequence that you sit in it,
and that's the meaning of the chair.
And so you can't understand meaning in that manner without considering meaning in relationship to embodiment.
And so meaning is really how we propel ourselves through the world
and how we organize ourselves and arrange to propel ourselves through the world
in a manner that's productive, relatively free of suffering, even though that's a meaning,
and sustainable across many situations and contexts.
So that's a rough framework for the initiation of the discussion.
For me, I think the first thing I would say is that word meaning is being used as a metaphor.
We're taking basically a term from language, a sentence is meaningful,
and we're using it metaphorically to try to denote something that is probably pre-linguistic,
although it shows up in our language.
A sentence is meaningful in that it does something to information
in such a way that we get a fundamental connection between ourselves and the world,
and I think that's for me what is fundamentally going on when we talk about meaning.
We're talking about the fact that there's a fundamental process of selection
that the brain, the embodied brain, which I agree with you, is a very important thing
to constantly remind ourselves of, has to face.
There's way too much information available at all times,
and of all of that information, only some of it is going to be useful or helpful to an organism,
and somehow that information has to be found.
It has to be found in a very reliable manner.
It has to be transformed into a form that is relevant to this body in this world,
such that I can frame problems, solve problems, achieve my goals,
and that process of zeroing in on relevant information, what I call relevance realization,
means that we are fundamentally thrown into a atmospheric kind of relationship to the world.
There's a salience landscape constantly being projected at all times,
of how things stand out to you, what gathers your attention,
what arouses your metabolic resources, or dampens them,
what creates certain motivational and affective states.
Because this relevance realization process is not a cold calculation, like a computer.
It's instead a deep involvement between the organism and its world.
And that involvement has, as Jordan says, it's often, and most prominently going on,
below consciousness, and it's an ongoing, evolving process.
I mean, one minute something, it's salient.
Look, that became salient to you, now it's not salient anymore.
So that process is constantly evolving, and so we shouldn't think of meaning as a static thing,
but this ongoing process by which the organism is constantly fitting itself to the world,
and having the world fitted to it, so that its actions can be undertaken in a fluent manner.
Now the thing that I think is very important about this meaning making process,
or as I prefer to call it, relevance realization,
because I think meaning is standing in as a metaphor for that,
is that this process is, it's below our consciousness, it's below our rationality,
it's below our language use, it's below our deliberative reasoning,
precisely because it's constitutive or presupposed by all those processes.
Until you do relevance realization, you can't use a language.
Until you do relevance realization, you can't form representations.
Until you do relevance realization, you can't even form your own autobiographical identity.
The world as a place that has categories, and you as a cognitive agent with a sense of identity in it,
both co-spring from this relevance realization.
It is a deep binding of you and the world at a fundamental level,
and that's why when it's threatened in any fashion,
human beings will experience a deep kind of trauma, absurdity, horror, a deep kind of anxiety.
And so when I think people are talking about meaning in life,
what they're trying to gesture towards is they have structures in place
that maintain and enhance that relevance realization such that two things are possible.
They can reliably keep at bay absurdity and horror,
and they can reliably afford the ongoing evolution, the growth of that relevance realization
so that they can find some kind of fulfillment in that identity that they are cultivating for themselves
as a cognitive agent and the world into which they are fitted.
And so I think the degree to which people are talking about meaning in life
is the degree to which they're talking about those kinds of structures
that affect that co-creation out of relevance realization of cognitive agency
and a world in which cognitive agents can solve problems in an intelligible manner.
We should also maybe decide if we agree on something.
We're going to agree on many things, I suppose.
A lot of a discussion like this is often terminological,
and it's partly going to be the case between John and I
because his intellectual background is different than mine,
although it overlaps in some important ways.
And so partly what I'm hoping to do with the discussion tonight
is to make sure that we actually understand each other.
This is definitely not a debate in which one of us is going to win.
What we're hoping to do is to have the kind of conversation that allows for the scaffolding
and the further development of ideas, which is really what an intellectual conversation is.
So I want to offer you a couple of propositions and tell me what you think about them.
The first thing is that I don't believe that the question does life have meaning
is actually a reasonable question.
It's properly formulated, and the reason I believe that is because
that isn't really what people want to know when they ask that question.
Life has lots of meanings.
The Buddhists would say that life is suffering,
and we might not think about suffering as meaning,
but fundamentally it's anxiety and pain,
and with some disgust thrown in there maybe for good measure.
And those are meanings, and even if you're nihilistic
and you're not oriented towards a belief in some sort of ultimate meaning structure,
that doesn't mean you can escape from the meaning of life.
What it does mean is that the meaning of your life is misery, suffering, anxiety,
and a real decrement in quality.
So we're trapped inside the question of the meaning of life.
There's no getting outside of it.
You can say there's no ultimate meaning, but then you have to define ultimate.
And then the other thing that I thought...
So let me just make sure I got the first proposition.
The first proposition is the question,
I want to make sure I got your wording right, does life have a meaning as opposed?
I just want to store that, I can either respond or wait until you put your second question out.
I just don't want to lose the first question.
The other thing that might be useful, clarifying,
I understand what you mean by relevance realization.
I have a formulation of it in my own language,
so I'm going to make a couple of comments on that as well,
and you can tell me if you agree or disagree on that.
So one of the things that's quite...
One of the ways that you can approach the idea of meaning
is by making a separate assumption about what the fundamental structures in the world are.
I mean, materialists and empiricists tend to believe
that the fundamental structures are, we'll say, atomic particles,
even though we know we can go higher resolution than that.
There's atomic particles and there's this space in which they're distributed.
And what that means is that the combination of quantum particles,
quantized particles plus space allows for the array of physical entities in patterns.
Like music is a pattern,
and there seems to me that there's something profoundly similar about patterns and information,
and it seems to me that what we experience as meaning
is something like our interaction with information.
Now, I just want to say one more thing about that.
The problem with information in some sense is that there's too much of it.
And so one of the things you could say about life's meaning
is that there's absolutely way too much of it.
And you can certainly experience that if you ever have an experience of awe,
or even of overwhelming absurdity.
Those are both quasi-religious experiences.
So relevance realization is actually, as far as I can tell,
it's the limitation of what's essentially an close to infinite field of information
that's so rich that it can't be exhausted into a narrower form
that's focal and useful for this particular time and this particular place
for this particular set of activities.
So it's a narrowing process.
Yeah, okay, so I'll respond to the second thing first,
because that will actually help me to respond to your first question
about the posing of the question.
Yeah, I think that's a good way of putting it.
And that although I would want to emphasize
that I don't think that process is just a selection process,
it's an important transformation process.
Because we do something to the information,
and you made reference to this in the embodiment.
It's not just that we have sort of passively taken in the information
or selected it from the environment.
We make the pieces, like you say, we find patterns.
It's how the pieces are relevant to each other, how they're relevant to us.
Again, and I'm trying to emphasize this,
not just as some sort of cold calculation about that information,
but a way in which, I mean, we say it like we make sense.
It's constitutive of our cognitive agency.
Just like our bodies take in matter,
but they don't just select the matter,
they transform it and restructure it,
so we have the ability to operate in the world.
Our minds don't just select the information,
they take in it, they transform it and structure it,
so analogous to our bodies,
we gain skills and abilities to interact with that world
from which that information was selected.
That's why I think people love to watch bands improvise.
Because really what they're doing,
especially if they're doing it collectively,
is they're engaging in a collective process
of the spontaneous transmutation of patterns.
And I think the reason that people find that so deeply meaningful
is because it is representation,
like an ongoing abstract artistic representation.
I think it's an exemplification of what we do in the world.
That's right.
I think one of the reasons why we like art
is we play with the variance,
we're playing in the Piagetian sense of playing,
we're developing our skills.
We play with the relevance realization machinery for its own sake.
But that allows me to go back to your...
I think asking for the meaning of life,
it carries with it sort of...
even saying the meaning in life,
it carries with it the presupposition
that meaning is sort of there to be found,
and it immediately steers us away from this ongoing process
in which we're taking in information,
transforming it, structuring it,
altering ourselves, fitting to a world
that is then also itself, restructuring itself, changing itself.
And so there's this ongoing, evolving relationship.
So one of the reasons why I don't like the question,
the meaning of life, is it proposes a ready-made answer to be found.
It presupposes a static thing to be discovered,
or even a static relation to be realized.
And it also carries with it the idea that...
It's like...
Like you said, it's like there is
an answer to a question that has been posed.
When I don't think the issue facing us
is a riddle or a question in that sense,
that some proposition will satisfy.
I don't think there's anything that...
I'm sorry, this will sound incredibly pretentious,
but I'm being asked about, I think.
I don't think there's anything...
I'm trying to make him sound pretentious.
I don't think there's a proposition
that anybody can say to you
will render your life meaningful.
I mean, you might do things with that proposition
that might fit you better to the world
so that horror becomes less prevalent
and flourishing becomes more prominent.
But to think that the answer is in the proposition
is to misunderstand the role of propositions
in our cognition.
The propositional level is very high up
and sits on many recursive levels of relevance realization
that only at their very tip
produce this kind of propositional processing.
The meaning is much more our
knowing how to interact with the world,
knowing how to fit my hand to this glass
is part of that process.
And that's not based on sort of just...
It's not primarily based on my beliefs about the glass.
It's based on much more complex dynamical system
by which my body, my perception, the glass,
the atmosphere are fitting together
so that I can grab the glass.
One of the things that I found interesting,
I learned this, I think, mostly from Gibson,
who wrote a book called...
The ecological approach to visual perception.
One of the things Gibson presupposes,
it's a very interesting...
He has a very interesting way of looking at the world
and it's tied deeply into our fundamental presuppositions
about the structure of reality
because one of the big issues about meaning in some sense
is whether it's fundamentally constituent...
constitutive of reality
or if it's what would you call an emergent property
of something more fundamental.
Now, the answer to that question in part is
exactly what do you mean by reality?
And also the question is also what do you mean by truth?
And these aren't... This isn't Pontius Pilate's question.
It's a whole different kind of question.
Now, the modern neuroscientists,
in some sense following Gibson,
make the claim that when you look at a glass like that,
that what happens in your brain
is that the pattern of the glass
maps itself onto the pattern of your gripping hand
and that maps itself onto the pattern of pouring and drinking.
And that a lot of that happens
potentially before or alongside
your conscious perception of the glass as an object.
So we know, for example, that there are people
who claim to be blind,
who can still map objects onto their body.
So that's called blind sight.
So developing that idea,
it's appeared to me that there's good evidence
that what we see when we look at the world is meaning.
We don't see objects and infer meaning.
We see meaning and we infer objects.
And so then the question is, well, is the meaning real?
And then the answer to that is, well, what do you mean by real?
And it'll only take me a minute to lay this out.
This starts to depend on whether you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian.
If you're a Newtonian, then the real thing is the material object.
And we also know that Newton in some important ways was wrong.
But if you're a Darwinian,
and you almost have to be a Darwinian,
I really don't see any escape from it
unless you don't know what you're talking about fundamentally.
There's reasons for that, is that the thing that determines
whether or not you're going to survive and propagate,
which is, by the way, the best solution you can possibly answer
to the problem of life if you're a biological organism
and you have a Darwinian philosophy,
the question you're trying to answer is,
what is the appropriate meaning to perceive in each environment?
Because that determines your action and your action.
The consequences of your action determines
whether you survive and propagate.
And so if you take the question of meaning from a Darwinian perspective,
you can actually say, as far as I can tell,
that the fundamental constituent elements, at least of experience
and perhaps of reality itself,
are the meanings that you perceive before you infer the object.
Now, you know, that's a pretty radical ontological claim,
and I've never heard anyone else actually make it,
except for maybe the pragmatists.
It's a pragmatic, it's a variant of pragmatic philosophy,
but I've tried to wrap my head around that argument,
see if I can destroy it, but I can't.
So I'm just wondering what you think about that.
I have a lot to think about that, and I have a lot to say about it.
First of all, before I get into the Darwinian Newtonian thing,
which I've seen you do a couple of times before,
and I've always found it very interesting.
It's one of my little tricks.
You belittle it, it's one of your good tricks.
I mean, it's a very good one, it's a very good point.
First of all, the question, I do think that fittedness to the world does create,
I think Plato had a fantastic insight,
that above and beyond any particular desire we have,
we have a desire for what we desire to be real in some sense.
One of the ways to rob meaning from your life
is to suddenly realize that a bunch of things,
a bunch of the things you've desired,
or the bunch of the things that you thought made you happy
are illusory in some sense.
In fact, people will do a bizarre thing,
and I do this every time in a class,
I'll ask how many of you are in really satisfying,
deeply satisfying personal relationships?
And surprisingly, many people put up their hands.
Those are the self-deceptive ones.
And then I do the following.
I say, how many of you would want to know,
if your partner was cheating on you,
such that it would destroy the relationship,
and almost all of them put their hands back up again?
So they would rather have the truth
than have all of that other stuff
that they find so good be illusory.
And I think that was one of Plato's profound insights.
This connectedness to reality is a fundamental drive in us.
You know, John, when you're asking that,
you're basically asking people whether or not
if they were in a perfect garden,
they'd be willing to check out the snake.
Yes, right.
And the answer, of course, we all know,
is that, well, of course, people will check out the snake,
because that's just what we're like.
But I do think there's something important to that.
I think ultimately, you know,
the Platonic orientation towards truth
is grounded in that notion of a deeper drive towards real.
I think asking the question about whether or not meaning is real,
part of it, I want to challenge the presupposition
behind the question first,
because the presupposition behind that
is that only things are real,
and that relationships, relations between things aren't real.
And I think it is very,
so it might strike people as odd for me to say,
yes, of course, I think relevance is real.
I don't think it's part,
and this is where I might differ with you,
but I think we'll have to negotiate it.
I don't think it's part of the physical fabric of the universe,
nor do I think it is just a subjective illusion on our head.
It is a real relation between us and the environment,
just like evolution is a real relation
between an organism and its environment.
It's not a property of the environment.
It's not a property of the organism.
It's a real relation between them
that explains both the history of the organism
and the history of the environment.
Okay, so that would be a lovely thing to see
if we can get clear,
because that's a very profound argument,
like a profound debate.
You know, there are Heidegarians
who took opposite positions on that.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
And some of them were psychologists, right?
And so I'm just going to outline it for the audience
and to make sure we're thinking about it the same way.
One stance is that meaning, so to speak,
is a consequence of the operation
of these elaborate patterns of construction in your mind
and that you're imposing that on the world.
So it's like a structure issue.
Yeah, that's a romantic issue.
Yeah, and then the other one is that,
no, no, meaning is in the world, so to speak,
and that what you do with the structures in your head
is limited and narrow it.
And I think, in some weird way,
both of those things are true.
But here's something that I've been thinking about
for a long time,
and I want you to maybe help me figure out a bit more.
So I'm going to go at this from two perspectives.
So back in the late 1800s,
Nietzsche basically formalized a set of observations
about what he thought was happening in Western society
and the world at large, right?
And the basic argument was something like this,
was that the metaphysical presuppositions
of religious systems and the metaphysical presuppositions
of scientific systems were not in sync.
They weren't of the same paradigm.
And that as Western scientific investigation had preceded,
it became obvious that either the truths of religion
weren't true or at least that they weren't of the type
that science recognized as truth.
And Nietzsche basically described that as the death of God.
And so he said that three things would happen
in the aftermath of that.
He was a prophet.
He was like an Old Testament prophet.
He said that totalitarianism would become
unbelievably attractive to people,
especially in its hyper-socialist variants like communism,
and that millions of people would die in the 20th century
as a consequence of that,
and that it would be a necessary battle.
And he said that like 40 years before the Russian Revolution,
and so like, yeah, go Nietzsche.
You try to predict the future like five years ahead
and see how far you get.
And then the other thing he said would be that nihilism
would rise to pathological proportions
because it's basically the polar opposite of totalitarianism.
Right?
You wipe out the religious structures.
People move towards ideology to reattain that certainty,
but it's rigid and deadly, or they fall off into chaos itself.
Okay.
Then Nietzsche made one more proposition,
which was that the only solution to that would be
for human beings to transform themselves
into meaning-creating creatures.
And so what Nietzsche basically did,
and I think this was a mistake in his metaphysics,
was that he assumed that the objective description of reality
was correct, that reality in and of itself
was dead and meaningless,
but that human beings could interact with that in such a way
as a consequence of their individual choices
to make that richly meaningful.
And that we needed to do that
because the alternatives would be nihilism or totalitarianism.
One more comment on that.
So, you know, Jung was a student of Nietzsche,
a profound student.
He was actually trying to solve the problem
that Nietzsche put forward, which was,
oh, well, we got nihilism on the one hand
and we got totalitarianism on the other hand,
and, you know, those don't really seem to be very good solutions
since millions of people die because of one
and millions of people commit suicide because of the other.
It's like those are suboptimal solutions in all likelihood.
So, but Jung in some sense took issue
with Nietzsche's fundamental proposition,
which was that human beings were meaning creating creatures.
And I actually think it's the most profound critique of Nietzsche
because what Jung pointed out,
this is something that just blew me away
when I first understood it,
and it has to do with your relevance realization issue
in a deadly way.
It's like, imagine the things that attract your attention
and your interest.
Well, okay, so then you might think,
well, is that a voluntary process or an involuntary process?
And to answer that, you can think about it.
It's like you're working on some dismal, wretched,
boring and stultifying thing at work or as a student,
and your attention is like fragmented everywhere.
You think about the dust bunnies under your bed
and that maybe the dishes need to be done
and the dog needs to be walked
and the, you know, the rug needs to be vacuumed
and it's like bloody well anything
other than that boring task.
Even though you know you have to do it
in order to, say, pass a course or pass an exam
or get the assignment done,
you can't control your damn brain.
It's wandering everywhere.
You know, and then, so the weird thing about that
is that you cannot voluntarily control
your relevance realization.
And then you have the contrary problem,
which is that, you know,
there's a YouTube video about kittens
and it's like bang man, you're focused on that.
You know, and so one of the things you might ask
is just who the hell is in control
of this relevance realization.
And that was Jung's question.
It was like, well where Nietzsche fell apart,
Nietzsche fell apart was that he assumed
that human beings were primarily
meaning making creatures.
But then if you try it, you know,
it's like hey, I'm going to find it really meaningful
to go to the gym three times a week next week
for half an hour and I'm going to push myself
right to my limits.
It's like I have every reason for doing it.
I know why I should do it,
but I'd rather sit on the couch, you know,
in my underwear and eat Cheetos.
Cheetos.
So...
Yeah, yeah.
So you've got to ask yourself, man,
who's in charge.
And one of the things that the psychodynamic theorists
were so damn good at was pointing out that,
well, you think it's you,
but it's not.
And so then that makes the question.
It's like, where's the meaning coming from
and who is in charge?
And so I know that's
questions that you're trying to answer,
but it doesn't exactly seem to me that we're overlaying
that on the world or that if we are,
we don't have much voluntary control over that.
Okay, well,
I don't think we're overlaying on the world
and that's what I meant by a real relation
and I was comparing it to evolution.
I think to talk about us
being meaning makers in the Nietzschean sense
is to fall prey to
the romantic illusion
that the world is a blank slate.
I mean, you have the blank slate of the enlightenment
in which, you know,
reason the world writes on us
and then you have the blank slate of the romantics
in which the world is a blank slate
like the unpainted canvas
that we...
Nietzsche constantly used the artistic metaphor
and he even created the idea
of a lifestyle as if
our lives are works of art
because the world is just an empty canvas
upon which we project our meaning.
Well, and there's totalitarian
presuppositions in there, too,
because one of the presuppositions
of totalitarian ideologues
is that there is no such thing as human nature
and that people can be constructed
in any way possible. Exactly,
and that's why existentialism comes out of Nietzsche
because existentialism posits
that our essence and our nature
is completely the property of our own self-definition.
So what I'm actually doing
is I'm doing blank slates.
I'm saying the world is neither a blank slate
that we romantically project upon
nor is the mind a blank slate
that experience just empirically draws upon.
What I'm proposing
instead is a dynamic interaction
between the two.
And to say that, you know,
who's in charge
is kind of an odd question,
but before I answer that,
I want to take a little bit of exception
on your interpretation of Nietzsche
it might help
and it also might get us back
to the Newton-Darwin thing
which I promise to get back to, too.
I mean, Nietzsche lays
and again,
Heidegger followed up on this,
he actually lays the history of nihilism
much further back, right?
He says that the history of nihilism
starts with play-doh
and that Christianity is just play-doh for the masses.
Because my interpretation of Nietzsche
is that the main cause of nihilism
goes back to, like, the Axe of Revolution.
It's the creation of the two-world model.
And the idea is
that this world gets its meaning,
its value, it has an instrumental value
in getting us to some other world,
to some world in which
we will finally find
the fulfillment and the protection
from horror that we don't find
in this world.
And then what happens, right,
the way in which,
it wasn't just the clash between the scientific
and the religious world view.
What happens is that the scientific world view
calls the second world,
the heavenly world, into question.
But
what happened is we have millennia
of Christianity and Platonism
tutoring us to believe
that this world is not meaningful
in itself because it's only valuable
insofar as we get to this heaven.
And then when science says,
ah, imagine that there is no heaven,
all the left, or John Lennon,
then we're left.
My favorite beatle. We're left, right?
That really dates me, doesn't it?
Then we're left
with this world that we've been tutored
for millennia has no
has no value in it.
And so I think
what Nietzsche was trying to do,
I agree with you, there's a romantic streak in Nietzsche
and like I said, I reject that
romantic streak that the world is a blank slate
upon which we paint our lifestyles.
That is ridiculously hubristic
in nature.
But there was another thing Nietzsche was trying to do
and so I think there's, I mean,
Nietzsche has multiple voices. There's anything.
So in addition to the romantic project
which I often find really bombastic,
there is another project
that he called trying to revalue the earth,
which was to try to see the earth
as a place in which we could be
at home
on its own terms
for its own sake.
That was more Heidegger, I think.
Nietzsche talks about
learning how to revalue the earth
and loving the earth as a repeated
theme throughout Nietzsche's work
and loving the body is a repeated theme
in Nietzsche's work.
Because he thought that
just like we had the two worlds,
we had the two parts of us, we had the body,
but the body only existed in service of the soul
and the body therefore
has no inherent value
because its only job is to get the soul
to the only place where it has real meaning
in heaven. And then his point was
if we lose the heaven and if we lose the idea of the soul,
we have to get back to revaluing
the body, revaluing the earth.
And what I'm proposing in this sort of
evolutionary model of relevance
realization is exactly that
the body and the earth co-create
this real relation that
fundamentally homes us
and fits us into the world.
And that the meaning crisis and therefore
it's not just, I mean, yes,
I agree there are definitely historical
forces for it and the rise of science
and the demise of the wisdom traditions
and the religious traditions.
But I think the meaning crisis is in some
sense also a perennial problem. You see it
cross-culturally, you see it cross-historically
because people can always get
trapped between these two kinds of perspectives
they can have on themselves. They can always
fall prey to these kinds of two world models.
And so I think
the thing I want to say is
part of what's going on
right now in
the meaning crisis in the West
is we're trying to, and this is the way
Nietzsche I think was prescient
as you said, he was a prophet.
By the way, he predicted four things.
He predicted that he would be famous eventually.
Although
that he would basically start to death
in the meantime. Right.
But why I am so great was one of his four things.
Timing is everything. Yeah.
Exactly.
And so
what he was prescient about is the fact
that I mean basically since
the actual age in 800 BCE
and onward we've had this two world model.
And now we're going through a radical
re-embedding.
And for a lot of people that's caused
a kind of nihilism. But one of the things I would throw out
to you is that there's a possibility
in an emerging cognitive
science, and a cognitive science in which
embodiment and embeddiment are
becoming central for
appropriating that re-embedding process
as a way of discovering
re-discovering
how we can be at home, fundamentally at home
in the world. And how the earth and our bodies
co-create that home
in a way that again protects us from horror
and allows us to flourish as cognitive agents.
Okay. So
you did something I think
is lovely and I don't think that it's
people who aren't quite deeply educated can do
is you pushed the problem quite a bit
farther back in time. So I want to one-up
you on that. Okay.
So
I do think it's a deeper problem
than Nietzsche pointed out. He pointed out
the more articulated
modern end of it.
And we see that as the conflict say between
science and religion. But if you
you can push these sorts of things back
I think to the dawn of self-consciousness
itself. And one of the reasons
that I've been so obsessed with the book of Genesis
is because I read Genesis
as
a dramatic representation
of the coming to self-consciousness
of mankind. Because what happens
with Adam and Eve when they
eat the fruit that the snake delivers to them
which is very interesting
sort of phenomena from an evolutionary perspective
which I can talk about later. What happens
to Adam and Eve is very, very specific.
I mean the first thing that happens, I'm sorry
I might get the order wrong. But
the first thing that happens is that they realize
their eyes are opened and they're like
gods knowing the difference between good
and evil. And that's very interesting
because it associates the development
of self-consciousness and the rise
of articulated
and complicated morality.
And so I thought about that for a long time.
It's like okay, you realize you're naked
what does that mean? Well you don't
want to be naked up here on the stage. Although
if you're speaking properly to the audience you are.
But maybe you don't want that.
Okay, well why? Why don't you want to be
up here naked on the stage? It's everyone's
nightmare, right? Well you know
you're kind of flawed and saggy
and you know there's parts of you that are
not that beautiful
even if you happen to be a supermodel
you know and you're not as bright as you could
be and you know your hair might be going
a little bit and you know your teeth aren't
that great and you're not as smart as you
could be and you got a lot of flaws. Plus
you're going to get sick and then you're going to die.
It's like that, right, right.
So that's a lot of, that's all nakedness
if you think about nakedness as vulnerability
and so we had to come to terms with her
vulnerability when we became self-conscious.
So then you might think well what the hell does that
have to do with morality and I did figure
that out. It took me like 15 years of
thinking to figure that out. It's like
if I know I'm naked
and vulnerable
and I know you are the same
then I know what will hurt me
and once I know what will hurt me
I know what will hurt you
and so you know animals prey on each other
lions eat gazelles
and you know worms eat lions
and all of that and but
there's nothing like a human being
for sheer outright atrocious
torture and you don't get
that without self-consciousness. So that's where
I think the knowledge of good and evil comes.
It's like it's no longer prey and predator
it's like torture and victim
so that's one thing.
So part of that sets up
this dichotomy in human beings
between whatever it is
that our consciousness seems to be
and our self-consciousness and this
terrible limited burden that we
carry around as a body
that we're conscious of. So there's that
dichotomy that dichotomy
emerges back at the beginning
of the dichotomy of self-consciousness.
It's a problem we're trying to solve all the time
and I mean Nietzsche's
criticism of Christianity was that
he believed that Christianity
failed to solve
that problem because instead of dealing with the
reality of the catastrophe which is
say the degenerate form of our material body
the church
basically damned that to perdition
describing it as a work of the devils
so to speak and then concentrated
on spiritual salvation.
Now Jung knew this element
of
Christian religious thought
and the Nietzschean transformations of that
and that's part of the reason why he went back to
alchemy because one of the things Jung was
interested in was
why did science develop?
It only developed in Europe
as far as we know and like the Greeks didn't have
it and the Romans didn't have it and the Chinese didn't
have it and the Indians didn't have it and
it's like well they weren't stupid what was up
with them and why Europe? What exactly
happened there? It's not like
we precisely know the answer to that but
one of the things that Jung suggested
and it's brilliant as far as I'm concerned
was that
the cognitive
apparatuses that we're blessed with
are compensatory
so that if we formulate a theory about
one domain and take it to a real
extreme
the unconscious mind
will start to formulate a counter
proposition which is formulated
of all the things we notice that don't
fit in with that theory and then they start
to flap around and
associate with each other as a consequence
of emotional contagion and
they start to manifest themselves
in patterns and that once that
counter position emerges
as a sufficiently complex
and dynamic living system
it has the opportunity to fight with the
other system and sometimes you'll have a
revelation and the revelation is basically
the overthrow of the current perspective
by the new emergent perspective
so and Jung
viewed alchemy in that light, he said
that the Christian concentration on
hyper-spiritualization
was extremely useful, this is something
Nietzsche agreed with, was unbelievably useful
for the discipline of the mind
so Nietzsche of course is an anti-Christian
at least that's what he said
but he also said that Catholicism
tempered the European spirit like
nothing else could have and he really meant
the whole Judeo-Christian tradition which was
the attempt to force everything
into a unified
and hierarchically arranged interpretation
Nietzsche's idea was once you did that once
man you could go do that all sorts
of different places so
alright so alchemy
as a precursor
to science was based on initially
on a fantasy and the fantasy was
if we paid enough attention to the
transformations of matter
rather than of spirit
that we could redeem
what Christianity
with its emphasis on the spirit had failed
to redeem so it's sort of like
all the 14th century Europeans woke up
and said, hmmm, Christ died
for our sins and you know we're supposed
to be redeemed but a lot of guys down there
with leprosy in the ditch so it doesn't seem
to have exactly you know fulfilled its promise
and so he felt that the European
imagination started to drift
into the transformations
of the material world
but that was also
part of what was fundamentally
a redemptive process
it was just a more comprehensive redemptive process
it was alright well we kind of got
the spirit organized
now it's time to do something about the dreadful
body that we're dragging around with us
instead of merely damning it to perdition
and one of the things that you might think about
because we're also thinking
about practical issues here is
well we talked about
multiple meanings kind of multiple
low level meanings there's the meaning of food
and the meaning of water and the meaning of sex
and you know the meaning of being too hot
and too cold and there's all biological
subsystems that take care of those sorts of things
it's like those are
organized hierarchically in principle
so there's something lurking at the
top and I think part of what religious
mythologies do over years
centuries thousands of years is try
to get a picture of what should be
at the top that's like the
monotheistic impulse what's the highest value
and here's something to
to consider you know you can wonder about this
in your own lives when people think about the
meaning of their life what they mean is
are all
the subsidiary meanings
meaningful
given that there's an ultimate
reality of suffering and limitation
and so one of the things
that might be asked and I think that
scientists do ask this
in part is
maybe we shouldn't deal with that question
before we fix everything we can
possibly fix and so one of
the things that I would also suggest is that
when you're motivated
by meanings that are other than
subsidiary say the same meanings
that animate
mammals and reptiles and even bloody
lobsters for that matter
when you're working at higher order levels
of meaning partly what you're attempting
to do is to
generate solutions
to the micro problems of negative
meaning that always beset you
you know it's like well is there
something wrong in your family
well that's meaningful it's the meaning is negative
okay so does that make
your family worthwhile or worthless
well the question is
depends on what you do with your family
and you know so the problem
with nihilism as far as I can tell
is that the nihilist presumes
that the finitude that we
perceive invalidates the utility
of being it's like
well that's pretty
arrogant you might say
you might say that judging the whole world in that light
which is what that comedian just did on that
TV show when he laid into
God I can't remember his name
blaming him for bone cancer and children for example
which really does suck you know
so the point is
is that one of the things that we
find meaningful and we could find meaningful
and it's reliable is
let's leave the damn question
aside about the ultimate
meaning of reality in its corrupt
form which is now and try to fix
the damn thing really try
to fix it and then see what happens
because it's clear that we can make
things better and it's bloody clear that we
can make things worse so you might ask
okay well if you organized your little value
hierarchy underneath the proposition
that it's up to you to work
to bring the kingdom of God to life
instead of hell then
maybe the whole problem of the negative meaning
of life would go away
it's like you never know beats the alternative
which is to damn the whole thing
to perdition which we really tried
to hard to do in the 20th century
with a fair bit of success
or you know just to think oh well
this is meaningless and useless and I don't
have any responsibility and there's no such
thing as meaning and you know it's like
sure walk down that road man
see where you go
okay
both of you agree that
there's this lower level
meaning system that we have
which is almost like a moment to moment perceptual
system where we know how to interact
with things and both of you
disagree both of you agree that there's
no higher level the
meaning of life but
in alluding to the meaning crisis and
just general morality you seem to
assume that we can somehow
cobble this ability to know how to interact
the glass somehow
interact with societies
so how do you think
we're able to do this
first of all
to be careful
I said there's no
ultimate meaning and like I said
I was also not saying that that means
that there's no ultimate meaning because if you say a problem
is poorly
formed you're rejecting both the
positive and the negative answer to that question
it doesn't imply that therefore
the ultimate meaning is that there's no
meaning it's like saying what's north of the north
pole the answer is not
anything it's to reject the question
so I first want to challenge that
that move you made
secondly I do think
that I want to reply
I do think that what I'm trying to argue for
and I think Jordan is but I'm not clear because
he said about 17,000 things in his last
thing I want to
I want to try and reply to them
I'll spin them out
you sort of
I'm arguing for
a deep continuity between
those lower level processes and the highest
levels and I mean
and I think Nietzsche tried to foreshadow that
and this is again what I mean about the
Nietzsche said the height of my spirituality
reaches into the depth of my sexuality
right to try and
he was using both of those
in a metaphorical extension
I'm not only arguing for the lower level
it's a pretty good statement for a virgin too
he was referring to Nietzsche by the way not me
so I'm arguing for what I think is a
very important thesis which is a deep continuity
between the lower level
and just speaking of it metaphorically the
higher level I do think there is
an important issue in which
we can talk about that higher level
as distinct from the lower level
of just trying to solve our daily problems
which I think is important
namely and that's something that you
referenced Jordan we face a perennial problem
of our self-consciousness
and the problem with our self-consciousness is it
means we have this enormous capacity
to take a perspective on our own ability
to take perspectives
I mean one of the things about being a conscious being
and this is what I mean about a salience landscape
is we not only know facts like propositions
and we know how to do things
we also have
perspectival knowing
this is the work I did with Leo Ferraro
we know what it is like to be a certain thing
to take a certain perspective
to take a certain stance on the world
I know what it's like to be a father
I know what it's like to be a teacher
and that perspectival knowing
what it's
like to be something
is again this atmospheric meaning
but the thing we can do
is we can take a perspective
on that lower-order perspective
we can stand back and say what does that perspective look like
let me give you an example
right now I'm thirsty
and so I have a thirsting perspective on the world
things that are watery are salient to me
things that might contain water
you're getting thirsty right now too right
becomes salient to me
I can step back
and this was something also discovered
like in India right by the Buddhists
I can step back
and take a look at my thirsting perspective
I can say what's it like
to be a thirsty person
and now I'm no longer thirsting
because I'm now motivated
by something different than my thirst
I'm motivated by my curiosity
about my lower-order thirst
and then I can step back
and say gee
curious
and then I can step back and wonder
what's it like to be somebody asking
what's it like to be curious
and then you can step back and say
what's it like watching someone
listen to someone talk about being curious
exactly
and the point I'm trying to make
the point I'm trying to make
is what happens is
we have the capacity to very quickly
move ourselves to what Nagel calls
the view from nowhere
you know this bird's eye
or God's eye perspective on all of reality
in which we
by these recursive asking of
questions we have become deeply
disengaged from our involvement
with the world we have an enormous capacity
our very capacity for self-transcendence
and I think this was also one of Nietzsche's
insights although I think Nishitani
called him excellently to question on it
our capacity for self-transcendence
our ability to rise above ourselves
is also the very same thing
that can cause us to fall into despair
and absurdity because we can empty
the world of all that involved meaning
by our capacity
to transcend ourselves to such a degree
that we are overlooking it all
and saying there's nothing behind all of this
let me jump
in for like five seconds here
okay so I have a proposition that goes
along with this you guys can think about this
so I think it's one
of the advantages of
contemplating the notion that meaning
might be an actual phenomena in and of itself
so I would say
well when should you stop recursing
which is what's the right level of analysis
because I could say who cares about this
damn talk the sun is going to
envelop the earth in four billion years
it's like you know because that's like
the ultimate meaninglessness of everything
and my answer to that is that's a
stupid place to stand
and the evidence for that is
think about it this way is that
if your capacity to experience
the kind of meaning that imbues your life
with
forward motion and with faith
and with joy and with gratitude
imagine that that's actually a function
that you have psychologically
and then imagine that that function
kicks in when you're looking at
things from the right perspective
and so you might say well
is this talk important it's like
what's important to me right now it seems to be
important to you guys it has some potential
importance tomorrow and next week
there's all meaning there is it important
from the perspective
of the age of the cosmos
well
probably but probably
perhaps not
and so then I would say well what does that do
to my sense of engagement with the issues at hand
it undermines them and I fall into
a pit of meaninglessness and so then
I would say well hey let's not fall into that pit
let's pick a level of analysis
for the problem at hand
that most richly imbues it
with a sense of meaning and then
let's assume that that's part of the mechanism
that calibrates our soul so to speak
and pay attention to that
and so because I tell my students this all the time
wander around
and notice what's
meaningful to you just notice it
it happens it's not you know
you can participate in you're absolutely right about that
but it happens okay
try to stay where meaning is
optimized and then I also
mentioned to them briefly
that that's kind of what the Taoist symbol is about
right because the Taoist symbol
is predicated on the idea in a sense
that the world is made out of this order
chaos and order
and that there's a balance between those two things
and that if you stand on
the border between order and chaos
so that things are structured properly
but you're still a little uncertain and curious
then that's a richly meaningful
place from a phenomenological perspective
and it's like that's the right place
to stand how do you know
because you want to be alive despite
the fact that you're suffering
it's like hey there's some evidence
you can't get there though without you know
the initial presupposition that there's something
deeply real about meaning
and I think real is life sustaining
that's part of what real is
that's a Nietzschean idea too
okay well let me respond to that
I want to push back on you on that a bit
because I think that's not being fair to
Nagle's argument because the point Nagle was trying
to make is you know
you said that's a stupid place to stand
it depends on what you're trying to achieve
right if you're trying to do science
and you're trying to reduce the way
we self-deceptively project bias
onto the world then you progressively
move to these higher views
because every time you
I mean that is what we do
that is how we try to reduce bias
I mean when I can take a
the reason it's good for me to take a perspective
on my lower order perspective
bias and distortion in this perspective
so if I want to remove bias and distortion
if I want to get at reality and truth
and let's assume we have that platonic drive
then that feeds into this
drive to go higher and higher
and higher and higher
because as I go higher and higher and higher
I am removing distortion
I am removing illusion
well that seems to me to be
that's partly why I'm a pragmatist
fundamentally and it's because
you're right about that
you're always parasitic on an independent notion of truth
you have to be able to know
independent of its usefulness
that something is useful
you have to have some way of saying
I know that it's true
that this is useful
that my perception of its usefulness
is not itself distorted
I'm not disagreeing with that at all
I think that what
correct me if I'm wrong
you basically
you seem to be making an argument that goes something like this
there are different lenses
and different levels of resolution for different tasks
I agree with that
but I'm also making the argument
that
the drive towards the view from nowhere
has just as deep
a purchase on us
that platonic quest to get at the
the undistorted
we shouldn't be assuming that nowhere is the ultimate
stance it's like it has its
zone of relevance
and you've laid that out quite nicely
that's what I'm saying
but what I'm trying to say is
just to say to someone
don't go as far as you can
because you might fall into
absurdity
to me sounds like
well give into
self deception
because that will be comforting
I think sometimes it's just
I guess this is partly my
experience as a clinician speaking as well
because sometimes people get
overwhelmed by absurdity
they don't go there right you know what I mean
it's not the right place for them to be
but I would also say that you shouldn't pick problems
that are bigger than the ones that you can solve
I disagree with you
we've got to clarify that because I don't think that you
I mean we're doing that right now
I know
I know
but we're also not claiming to have the answer
but that value as I said from the beginning
isn't in the answer
but in the self-transcendent transformation
and what I
what I was trying to say
right is that
yes I agree that
right
I don't think
absurdity is caused by
the fact that you're
the highest level I mean again
that's not Naples point absurdity is caused
by the fact that we can
find a clash between any two
levels we pick he gives this example
okay so
he gives this example
please understand this because I'm
we're older than you there was a time
there was a time when people's
phones were in specific
locations
and if somebody called you
you were often not with your phone
and so you had to have a recording device
to pick up the messages
I know we had just discovered
fire but that's what it was like
so he gives the example from that time
because he wrote the article in the early 80s
and so there's this individual
he calls up and they're like
and he picks up the here's a pickup
and he says he's been all prepared he says
Susan just don't talk I gotta
tell you this I gotta get it out I love
you I've loved you for a long time it's really
and then he hears
Susan's not here right now please
leave a message
and you're laughing because humor
is also about this juxtaposition
of perspectives
and what's happened is
that act that seems so meaningful
from one's perspective
is completely inconsistent
with the machine's perspective
the recording machine
it's the clash between perspectives
not a particular perspective
per se that I think is what
the experience of absurdity is
it could be and but it might be
or
no because here's why I would challenge you
because I would put Spinoza
Spinoza advocating
advocated going to that highest view
and then found a way to reconcile
it with the lowest perspective
the engaged perspective and he said that was
the bless of life so he argued
that the oh I mean I think that's
why the ethics is a great book that deserves
to be read in contrast to Nietzsche
is he argued that there is
a way to reconcile
those two perspectives he called it Skencia
Intuitiva and it's the reconciliation
of those two perspectives that alleviates
absurdity
not the preclusion of going to one
or the remaining in fixed in the other
and I think that that's very
that's very similar in some
profoundly important ways
there's important historical differences to what
Buddhism is trying to advocate
that Buddhism is about
you know in meditative practice
we practice sort of going deeply immersive
and in contemplative practice we go
deeply out and then the point in Buddhism
is that those are supposed to become
completely interpenetrating
so that the absurdity that's caused by the clash
between perspectives is removed
I think the fault as you said earlier
is not in any perspective but in the
self-consciousness that pits perspectives
against each other that's good that's very nice
that's very nice I mean I think that's a very
elegant argument and I
I take no issue with it
I want to take that line
of reasoning in a different direction
we'll play that same line
of logic in another way
so Victor was asking
earlier and it's a level
of resolution perspective again it's like
okay well this is really great it's the meaning
of the glass it's like well yeah
what does that have to do with the meaning of life
okay I think the person who answered
that best actually was Piaget
and let me tell you a little bit about Piaget
because the first thing
he was a famous child developmental psychologist
by the way the most famous of the 20th
century and he was actually
trying to solve the
conflict between religion and science
you never hear that about Piaget
but he had messianic experiences
when he was a young man and he wrote a novel
about it and he wanted to reconcile religion
and science and you know he actually
did a pretty damn good job so
okay so here's the issue
and you can think about it this way
so this is how a baby builds himself
or herself up
okay so
learn to move finger
learn to move hand
learn to move hand and arms
learn to move body hand arms
legs and feet learn to orient
head okay
learn to use integrated body
to
undertake independent tasks
okay then
learn to use integrated body that can
undertake independent tasks in concert
with another integrated body
that can undertake
specific tasks you do that when you play
a game the game is
we'll say the game is
we're two little girls having tea
okay so what's the goal
the goal is that we learn how to be
mutually respectful
while we're sharing nourishment
which is a big deal by the way
it's something humans are unbelievably good at
it's extremely sophisticated
we're very social eaters so if we're not
eating socially we're fat or anorexic
you know we have
to eat socially to regulate our own behavior
because we're social eaters
and so we're learning how to play the game
of sharing food and
but the game has other rules than that
it's like we're learning how to play the game of sharing food
in a way so that we're playing the game
so that we want the game to continue
okay so that's an important point
and then if we get more sophisticated
then we say we're learning to play the game
so that it's enjoyable
for a larger number of people
in a larger number of situations
across larger spans of time
and so that's a hierarchical
organization of fundamental abilities
into
solutions that have generalizability
across more and more contexts
now Piaget built that way up
like and he said
this is associated with this idea of levels
too
Piaget believed and this is like
this is his scientific justification for
emergent morality in some sense
is that
but it's within a Darwinian framework again
not within a Newtonian framework so
Piaget had a proposition
and the proposition was this
you're the bully at the moment
Victor and I are having tea
and you want us to play a different game
you want us to play
I don't know what do you want us to play
pull the cat's tail
you're a bully after all
and so
we don't want to play pull the cat's tail
and so what do you have to do
well you have to expend a lot of time
and energy in forcing the game
that is because we don't want to play the damn game
so we're going to do everything we can
to stop you to subvert it
and so what that means is that
you're going to and we're going to expend a tremendous amount
of energy in a pursuit
where we could have picked a pursuit
where there was virtually no energy spent
or resources so Piaget's
idea was that an
equilibrated game
which is a game that everyone will play voluntarily
if you pit that
in an open competition
in an Iranian competition
against a disequilibrated game
that requires force to maintain
your basic totalitarian state
if you pit those in a one-to-one competition
or your totalitarian personality
if you pit them in a one-to-one competition
in relationship to the attainment
of virtually any goal
across multiple contexts
the equilibrated game will win
and that's why it's better
and there's other reasons too
it's better because it isn't only a solution
a problem that's posed in one place
it's a meta solution to a
meta problem that's posed in many places
I'll just give one example of
okay so
you all tell your kids
be a good sport
and your kids being intelligent kids think
well don't we want to win this game
it's like of course
you want to win the game okay so why can't I bash
the guy next to me over the head
with my hockey stick as long as I don't get caught
that's a Canadian example right
so I'll tell you a story
I went to this hockey game once
and my son was playing
and that was really fun
and he was in the final game
and there was a kid on his team
he was a great hockey player
very very good hockey player
but it was all him
he had the puck he wouldn't pass
and he was pretty good at scoring and so on
but he wasn't playing with the team
and he was playing to win
so my son's
team lost it was a great game
I think it was like 4-3 at the end
and the other team scored in the last 30 seconds
and then all the kids came off the ice
and the parent of this one kid
who's like the little hero
hockey player comes up to him
and the kid had like smashed his stick
against the cement and he was all
running around and cursing the referees
and the father
came running up to him and said
you were robbed you know you absolutely should have won that
and I thought
you were such an idiot
and he was he was truly an idiot
and a pathological one at that
and he was really
destroying his child's soul
and here's
this is not funny it's true
that is what he was doing
I saw it happen over a long span of time
that was just a microcosm of their relationship
and his attitude towards the world
now why was that wrong
it's like the kid wanted to win
it's like yay go man went win
he was a really good hockey player
so what was wrong with what the father did
okay
so then we step back and we say
it's not important whether you win or lose
it's how you play the game
so what does that mean
well it doesn't actually mean what it says
because it actually is important whether you win or lose
you should be trying to win
but then the question is
what are you trying to win
now then
then that gets complicated
well you're trying to win
being the best hockey player on your team
are you trying to win that hockey game
or are you
trying to win the opportunity to be
invited to play as many games
as you can possibly play with as many people
in as many contexts as you possibly
can across the entire course
of your life
okay that's what winning means
and so the rule is
don't win the local
and proximal event
at the price of being a player
in the multitude of
iterable games that's the moral principle
you know don't put the cart
before the horse so to speak
and the reason for that is that
a game is a microcosm of life
that's a Piagetian idea which is why by the way
we like games and we'll watch them
and we're thrilled about them and we engage in them
all the time but the game
isn't the issue the issue
in some sense is the set
of all possible games
and the most moral action is the action
that will enable you to have
the highest probability of winning
the set of all possible games
and it's even a little more complicated than that
which is you have to be
a player in the set of all possible games
in a manner that supports the existence
of as many games as possible
and that's and so you see
what I mean and human beings can do that because
we can go up that damn chain of
abstraction right we don't have to just
concentrate on this
or a game of let's make
tea you know we can play these meta games
and pose these meta questions and one
of Piaget's claims was
don't kid yourself
about this there are rules
there are rules there are rules for games
there's lots that aren't playable
one rule for a sustainable game is
everybody wants to play
now another rule is that some people get to try
to win you know
so but obviously
that's not where the abstraction level tops out
and so I love that it's like oh that's
so cool it's there's a hierarchy of
moral value because that's action
orientation and it's an emergent
property of the way that complex systems
organize themselves they're basically
dominance hierarchies by the way
and not only that that system
of organization has been around for so
long and I think it's about
400 million years that
we're actually biologically adapted
to that structure because we know
that there are dominance hierarchies that can sustain
themselves quite nicely across time
and those usually value
the individual and the relationship between the individual
and society and there's those
that don't and we're really adapted
to the ones that do because those are the ones
in which we live when we live
and so this is deeply biological
and it's also emergent at the same time
so it's a testament to your notion
that it is
necessary to be able to reconcile
the local view with the ultimate view
and the more you can ensure that those
levels aren't in conflict with one another
that's exactly what a Piaget in the
equilibrium state is, is that the union
has been attained across the multiple levels
of hierarchical organization
that's um
take that
I will take it, you know
that I've always like
this argument of yours, I think it's one of your best
and um
which is not a left handed insult of your other argument
I really like this argument
I think it's a good word
and I've thought about it and I want to share
some thoughts I have about it with you
I thought, I think that
and this is to allude back to
Spinoza again in contrast to Nietzsche
um, I think
then again this is the platonic insight
I mean because Plato of course had
a metaphor also for
this moving up the levels, it's the metaphor
of coming out of the cave into the world
and I think what I
want to say is the highest level
of the metagame is the game
because games are again things that exist
between us and the world
right, um, I think the highest
level of the metagame is the game
of intelligibility
I mean, I think
what we have to have
ultimately and this is what Habermas was
on about right, we have to have
shareable intelligibility
to do, that's the highest
thing, we have to constantly
be committed to that, that there's a
that the grounding
normativity of all of our
moral normativities is actually
this normative demand
make things intelligible
so do you think about that as a
precondition for the emergence
of cooperative games, so it's like
getting the rules straight
getting the language by which you can
formulate the rules straight
and using language in a very extended metaphor
and so I think
I think part
of the issue for us though as human beings
is that we do have
this drive to, you know,
get at what is, try to
you know, to get the
maximum intelligibility project
and I think science tries to do that in some ways
but
the problem is that we then
and let me talk
for a couple minutes on this, we hit
a kind of perennial problem, we have
these two different notions
vis-a-vis intelligibility about what realness
is and I thought
I wanted to ask you about this because I want to know if this lines up
with your chaos order thing
we have one notion of
realness that what, to say that
something is real is to say
that it is coherent
it is confirmed
it is coherent
things have come together
and there's this mutual
fittedness and then
we also have a notion that, no what's real
is what catches us by surprise
what was outside of our system
and what we didn't know
and that's when we get at reality
so we have these two notions of realness
and I think we have two for very
good reason by the way
I think we actually have three
but those are two of them for sure
okay, so I think what we have is
we do have this confirmation notion
and then we have this
we have this surprise notion and
science tries to pit the two against each other
right, so what you try to do
is you run and do the theory part
which is all the confirming coherence part
and then you run experiments in which
the world can basically make you go
oh shit, right, and then you got
oh, right, and so you
at the level you wanted to
yes, of course, you don't want to burn down your lab
or you don't want to horrify yourself
like oh my god flowers can talk or something like that
too much chemistry there
right
and so part of the problem though
is that although science
tended to try to
science is largely
to some degree a psychotechnology of trying to
integrate those two together so that they work coherently
for us but also surprisingly
for us
part of the problem though is when Descartes
and I guess I'll put Descartes before the horse here
is what
is that Nietzsche's horse?
we were talking about putting the cart before the horse
I was like
Descartes did something
he really exacerbated those two
and he put a chasm between them
he said, look, what's real
is
what's externally measurable
by mathematics so the mathematical
properties are the real properties
and all the subjective ones are just in my head
but then he said this opposite thing
he said, you know what's most real? my mind
and how it touches itself
and this is completely
inexplicable, it's this direct contact thing
so and then what he said is
right
he didn't ever try to reconcile them
and so what we've done in the west
is we careen between these two different senses
of realness, we careen between
real is the mathematical out thereness
no, no, real is the subjective
inhereness and you can always
pit one against the opposite because
this could all be a dream
right? oh, no, no
if it was a dream you'd be naked
so I'm a naked bully
okay, so
but of course
then we do the opposite and say
oh, no, that's just an illusion, you're just dreaming
and we do the opposite thing
and so what I'm suggesting
has happened is
our attempts to
our attempts to
ground or get a clear purchase
on the metagame
are exacerbated
by the perennial problem
that we have these two conflicting notions of realness
right? and then
the historical problem that Descartes
basically
put this chasm between these
two different notions
he created Cartesian dualism
there's these two worlds, the subjective world
and the objective world, they share no properties
there's no way to reconcile and what we do
is we constantly there, we constantly
undermine, our notion of
realness is rendered permanently unstable
and so
I'm not at all challenging you
no, no, I feel like you've just
like, tossed me a pumpkin in slow motion
so I can bat it out of the park
okay, well let me just finish
and then I'll let you hit the pumpkin
um
so once again
what I'm trying to indicate is
I think you're right, I think
I think it deeply
matters to us to reconcile
the metagame
and the highest metagame I think is the realness game
against the lower game
and I think that is
the grounding of our moral drive
I think that is deeply right
now what I'm suggesting to you
is there's a perennial problem given
our sort of fundamental epistemic machinery
that undermines
our sense of realness
and that is interacting with a historical
factor
Descartes separation of the two worlds
and those are now reinforcing each other in a vicious way
in our time so that
we can't get a stable enough
notion of realness so that
we can bring about the very reconciliation
that you say we long for
and we need and that's part and parcel
about what I mean when I say we're in a meaning crisis
it's great, it's great
yeah, dead on I think
so, okay, so
you know
there's this brand of
psychological thinking that's basically based in Freud
via a guy named Ernest Becker
who wrote a book called The Denial of Death in the 1970s
and he won a Pulitzer Prize
it's a pretty good book and it takes Freud's idea
that
religion is a
defense against death anxiety
and it develops that in
a very intelligent and comprehensive manner
so Becker was trying to update Freud in psychoanalytic
theory and kind of have the last word on it
and I really think he did that, it's a brilliant
book but it's really wrong
but it's wrong in a great way which is something
to say about a book, you know
I'd like to be wrong like that
yeah, it'd be great to be wrong like that in some important way
yeah, absolutely
so first of all
one of religion's diverse
and multitudinous functions
is that it provides some
security against the anxiety of death
it's not the reason for it
it's like you gotta beware of people
who ever say that one thing
is the reason for, you know, that's an
ideologue, right, it's like well it's all
economics, it's all sex, it's all fear
it's like no, it's not
that's not right and it's simple-minded
and it's wrong
so, you know, that's a flaw to some degree
in Freudian thinking, although he was very smart
he knew about aggression and all sorts of other things
anyways, back to Becker, so there's this
idea that
our meaning systems
that's the internal structure we used to organize
the chaos of the world
protect us from the anxiety of death
and then, so that's
one form of meaning for Becker
and mortality salience
yeah, it's the same thing, that's Becker's
it's an elaboration of Becker
we don't really have much to add to Becker, actually
so
so
there's something that's right about that because we do use
our belief systems to defend ourselves
but we should be very clear about this, okay
first of all
culture is not
a belief system
the representation of culture is a belief system
that is not the same thing
culture is what's keeping the electricity on
okay, and that's not
defending us against death anxiety
although it is, it's actually defending us against death
which is much better
because we're not sitting outside freezing to death
right, and there's nothing psychological about that
it's like there are the lights
it's warm, the floor isn't moving
John isn't attacking me
and you know
no, seriously
right
that's not belief man, that is that he's not attacking me
and so
we represent that belief and that also makes it
somewhat
reliable and manipulable and fragile
because we can also undermine it but
culture protects us from death
and the representation of culture
protects us sometimes from death anxiety
okay, so now
Becker also pointed out
that there was something else that seemed to give life meaning
and that was associated with the Cartesian notion of consciousness
so he thought that people were
apart from being protected from terror
which we needed to be
we also needed to convince ourselves
that our lives were worthwhile
and we basically did that by
deluding ourselves that we were engaged in some
sort of heroic project
and somehow we could deceive ourselves well enough
about the importance of that through self-deception
mostly, that that also added
another layer of meaning to our life
okay, the problem with Becker
fundamentally was that he didn't read Jung
and he said right in the introduction to his book
I've never had any patience for Jung
and I never thought he said anything to say about
in his books on alchemy and that was really too bad
because if he would have read them
he would have got the book right instead of wrong
so imagine this way instead
so I wrote a paper a while back
called three kinds of meaning
okay, so the one meaning
is the meaning that announces itself
when something that you don't want to have
happen happens
it's not exactly what you don't, it's not what you don't
predict, because we don't predict
we want
now part of wanting is
predicted, but if you think about it
as predicting, you don't take into account
motivation, it's a huge mistake
we're not like cold cognitive
expectations, okay
so sometimes things don't turn out the way
we want
that's meaningful, sometimes the meaning
is kind of cool, it's like
you make a joke and I didn't expect it's like
ha ha, and I laugh because I can
transcend the unexpected and that's
delight in my own capacity for
conscious creation, so that feels
really good, and I like the joke because of that
so and that's not an illusion by the way
it's not self-deception, I did
transcend the conceptual
structure momentarily with you and it's like
good for us, you know
so it's not an illusion
okay, but now and then something goes unexpected
in a way, undesired in a way you don't
like, so for example
you find out that your wife has had
like six affairs in the last three months
and that she's never been faithful
to you at all in the last 20 years
it's like
that's rough man, especially if you like
there, you know
yeah, well you know if you didn't
like her it might be good news, but
and I'm actually
serious about that too, but okay so you think
well how upsetting should that be
it's hard for your nervous system
to calibrate that, but here's
a rough mode of understanding
the calibration
the existence
of your faithfulness
in your spouse is an axiomatic
precondition for a set of models
that you erect about how the world will lay
itself out in a way
that you want to, which is to say
you've modeled a future with this
person, it's a future you want
and then if she's not there or
if her faithfulness is absent
that collapses
but what does it collapse into? Well it collapses
into the unstructured void
fundamentally and that's really hard on you
if you're
betrayed like that, this is why betrayers
occupy the lowest circle of hell, right
if you're betrayed like that it's even worse
your future's gone
and that sucks because you put a lot of work
into it probably and you need to stabilize
the other thing because it's rife with uncertainty
but then your present is gone
too because you know who the
hell is this person you're living with
and more to the point what kind of moron
are you, you know and so that means
your model of the most
important person in your life
is gone, collapses
into the void and you have
no idea what the hell's up with you
either, how could you be so blind, how could
you be so naive, how could you be so foolish
how could you be so gullible, you know
how evil is this person, how evil
are you, how did you
did you instigate
this in some unconscious manner, were you
looking for punishment all along
and then there's the whole problem of your past
it's like whatever you thought it was
it isn't, it's something completely
different, you didn't know who you were with
when you were doing all the things that you thought you were doing
so that's a collapse
if you think about this game hierarchy
we talked about it, the
stable marriage part of a game
hierarchy is way the hell up the abstraction
level, right and so
it decomposes into
a very large subset of operations
and perceptions and when you blow
that, you basically blow out a huge
chunk of the personality and then
what shines through that is the void
essentially, it's terror
it's depression
and it's not just psychological, right
because you actually don't know where you are
who you're with anymore and so the way your body responds
to that is by assuming that you've been
dropped naked into a pit of lions
really, your cortisol levels go way up
your heart rate goes, it's like you're in a state
of chronic, chronic, horrible
stress, physiological stress
and that will kill you, it's not just psychological
it hurts your brain, it hurts your immune system
it makes you diabetic, it makes you obese
it's, you name it
it's like cortisol is bad news
so your body is estimating
the proportion of the territory
that you inhabit that has now become
uninhabitable, right and so
that's the meaning of chaos
that's the meaning of chaos and it's
an a priori meaning and a lot of it is
you should be frozen in terror
like you're looking at the gorgon's face
another part of it is
wait a minute, there's a little
treasure there too, it's like the dragon with
the treasure, maybe you can stop living a false
life, right, you can put
yourself back together, you can start living in
truth, you can find a relationship that's actually
genuine and so that's like the
that is precisely the, the treasure
that the dragon guards, that's why we have
that story by the way and that's also why
it's the oldest human story that
we know, so
I suspect it traces itself
all the way back to the time 60 million
years ago when we were throwing branches at
snakes, so it's old
that story, it wasn't a story then, right, it was
a pattern of behavior
so there's the meaning of chaos
and then there's the meaning of order
and the meaning of order is the
regulation of chaos just so
that the meaning that's useful shines
through, right, and it's sort of the kind of
idea that Huxley had about consciousness as
a reducing delt, I think that was Berkeley too
right, was it Berkeley? No, Berkeley has a different
idea. Okay, okay.
So that's two meanings,
meaning of order,
stable, security, it can tilt
towards tyranny if it gets too much
and then there's the meaning of chaos which
can be horrifying at high levels of
abstraction and interesting at lower levels
and then there's one other meaning
which is the third class and the third
class is the meaning that you experience when
you're mediating between order and chaos
and that's the, that's the heroic
meaning, it's like you're, you've got
one foot in order so maybe you've got
your scientific theory and you know you're
out on the edge of that, you're on the
frontier, the scientific frontier and
you're poking your beak out into the unknown
and as you're doing that, you're seeing
new patterns and you're, you're incorporating
them and you're dissolving
and reconstituting the whole structure
of the known that, that is
order and that's, that's
meaningful delight, that's when you're doing
that you know you're in the right place
and you say well what's the meaning of life, it's
that's, we have three, there's the meaning
of chaos, look out
it's promise and catastrophe,
we have the meaning of order
that's security and tyranny
and then we have the meaning of exploration
and that's the hero
myth and it's not a false
thing, it's not self-deception, it's like
you're out there transforming
chaos into order and that's
habitable territory for you and everyone
else, it's like otherwise
it's bloody freezing to death and
chewing on bones with the dogs, you know
it's like we don't want to do that
so it's not, it's not
non-real and we also don't know
how far we can push it, like
if all of you stayed properly
on the border between order and chaos
and were attempting
to rectify in your environment
everything you could in a meaningful way
it's like God only knows how much better you could
make the world and like I would say
that's it, that there's an ultimatness
about that and the
ancient Egyptians had figured this out a very
long time ago and it was partly for that
reason that they worshiped a god called Horus
who is the I, everybody knows
the Egyptian I and both the Egyptians
and the Mesopotamians had figured out
that the fundamental attribute
of the heroic spirit
isn't rationality, it's the
capacity to pay attention
and what's so cool about that, that's the
Cartesian issue, right?
Consciousness is the capacity to pay attention
and attention looks beyond
the pyramid of the known, it's the little
I at the top, it's looking
beyond and it's extending the pyramid
and it's transforming the pyramid when it needs
to be transformed and everybody
can stay safely and nicely in sconce
inside of that and it stays dynamic
so
that's really the redemptive meaning
I think because
you can't be secure
you can't, you're too fragile
and things are too complicated so
you can't put your faith in ultimate security
that's what totalitarians do
and that doesn't work, it just turns
genocidal, so what can you
put your faith in?
Well,
you can put your faith and it's not even
faith, it's an observable phenomena
concentrate
on doing things that are meaningful
that you can do
they'll announce themselves to you, it's like
you have something bugging you, it's like fix it
you'll find that that's quite meaningful
so and that meaning redeems you
right in that moment
because if it's meaningful enough
you're not self-conscious
and anxious and hurt and suffering and
devastated, you're like on top
of the game and so then you might say
well what if you just stayed there all the time
well then problem solved
so and you might say
well no, that's fine, say it
but you could try it
that's the thing that's so cool about this
it's actually a, this is kind of an existential argument
in some sense, it's like
you can run the experiment
I tell my students all the time
watch your life
see what you're doing that's really low
quality and meaningless
that you could just stop doing
so you don't have to answer ultimate
questions to do that, it's like
it's not what is truth
it's what is falsehood
and it's way easier to figure out what falsehood is
than truth, so if you're doing stupid
moronic things that hurt you and your family
and you know it and you could stop
and you think you might stop
which is quite a set of constraints right
then stop
and then see what happens
and the first thing that will happen is that things will tilt a bit
a little less chaos
a little more order, a little more freedom from you
for you
sometimes it's the opposite
it's like you've got your family around the neck
it's like don't do anything I don't want you to do
it's like tyrant, you know
so then the trick is to loosen up
the old tyrant a bit and get a little more chaos
in there and that will optimize the meaning again
and so
you said right at the beginning of the discussion
that meaning wasn't a proposition
and I would say well one form of meaning
is propositional, that's the orderly
meaning
but the transcendent form of meaning
upon which even order depends
is the dynamic
meaning making
but that's what I meant
I understand that
that's what I was trying to convey with this notion
that I think is completely accessible
to current cognitive science
this evolving relation
I mean because
one of the key ideas in the Darwinian model
is you integrate
you have the chaos
you have the opening up of the variations
often due to mutations
and then you have natural selection
that is the ordering
that's the selection process
and then what evolution means is exactly
this constant interplay between them
and that's what I meant when I think
cognition is not a set of beliefs in our head
it's the brain's
ongoing evolved fittedness
to the world
and I do think I agree with you
that
learning to
part of what it is to be a wise person
is to learn to situate yourself in such a way
that that relationship becomes very attuned
it becomes very
self-propellant
I think
you went to Egyptian but I think it's what Socrates meant
when he said
wisdom begins in wonder
at the point about
when we're in a state of wonder
and Descartes actually
contrary to what a lot of people thought about Descartes
Descartes said we're different from the other animals
because we're not motivated just by fear and desire
we're motivated also by wonder
and that's what makes us unique
because wonder is about being on that horizon
of intelligibility
that moving horizon
which behind us
in front of us is what has not been explored
yes
so I do think that
that's the Taoist symbol
as you know I am a Taoist
I practice Tai Chi
but I do challenge the idea
well maybe you use the term a little bit different
I do challenge the idea that
that is not a rational state
I think we have reduced
the notion of rationality too much to logical argumentation
so for example
I would say that the Buddhist notion of mindfulness
of
reflecting on how we pay attention
so that we make it more reliably capable
of putting us on that
so that we more reliably
flourish and achieve our goals
is as much a form
a cognitive style of rationality
as good logical argumentation is
precisely because by being
learning how to
structure your attention so reliably
keeps you on the horizon
of wonder is precisely to place yourself
in the optimal place for flourishing
as a human being
that constitutes I think for me a fundamental kind of rationality
and we are again giving into the
romantic notion that there is this deep
dichotomy between
attention and experience and logic and rationality
we should abandon that dichotomy
and we should see
that there is as much rationality
going on
in the training of mindfulness
as there is in the rationality
of training logical argumentation
look I
appreciate what you are saying
but I want to point out
rationality ultimately comes from
rationing
it is fundamentally about the logistical distribution
of your resources for success
as a human being
it is not primarily about
the logical ordering of your inferences
that is just one way in which we ration
one type of our cognitive resource
but it is not our most fundamental resource
look our behavior is not
ultimately and primarily driven
by our beliefs beliefs matter
they affect our behavior but there is all this stuff
outside or below our beliefs
that is driving our behavior and what gets
most access to that
is not our beliefs but what we find salient
what we find relevant to bring it back
to what I was saying before
so
yes but
this is why I want to make this
this and like
we are circulating around the same set of ideas
but there is an important point of clarification
here I think
so one of the things
that you probably all know is that the Catholic
church was very skeptical about
rationality and modern
people are not very happy about that because
they think of that as anti-science
in a sense and the sign of
a degenerate institution
and yeah you can understand that
but they had a reason
and I figured out this reason when I was studying
Paradise Lost
and the reason was this
so the book Paradise Lost
came out when
it is the great home by John Milton
came out roughly speaking when the nation states
in Europe were really starting to get going
and when political ideologies were really
starting to structure themselves
so they were like secular belief systems
and the way I read Milton is that
so Lucifer, Satan
and Milton's Paradise Lost
he is Lucifer so he is the highest spirit
in God's heavenly hierarchy
and he is the bringer of light
and Satan like satanic
arrogance is a rational
arrogance
so what does that mean exactly?
well let's look at the Soviet Union
what happened in the Soviet Union with the communists
was that they set up a system of axioms
such as from each according
to his ability to each according to
his need which sound lovely
axiomatically true
so their fundamental beliefs
and then they erected a rational system
the basis of those axiomatic beliefs
that was completely coherent
and closed
and then they worshiped the ability
to make that absolutely coherent
and not to have any necessity
of stepping outside of it
in fact if you stepped outside of it with your own suffering
instead of taking into account
the fact that your suffering meant
that the totalitarian viewpoint was incomplete
they just killed you
that was a lot easier than fixing the damn thing
and so what Milton intuited
the rational spirit which is the intelligence
of human beings
the rational and propositional based intelligence
that wants coherence and rigor
could be stretched to such a degree
that it became a replacement
for appreciation of the transcendent
which would be the thing outside the known
it just replaces that
and that's the satanic appropriation
of the highest heaven
in God's heavenly kingdom
and Milton's prediction about that
was that that turned the rational mind
into something that would inevitably
rule over hell
well that's what happened
in the 20th century
now, I don't think
rationality is the right term exactly
and maybe attention isn't the right term
either although I think it's closer
I think the right term is logos
and logos of course
is the root of logic
but it's also the root of the idea
it's a Christian idea fundamentally
although it's expressed in many other religious beliefs
of the creative capacity
of the investigative
creative spirit
so it's investigation
and it's the transformation of the consequence
of the investigation into
fully articulated representation
and then it's the sharing of that
and so what we're doing right now
this is a logos conversation
because you're not trying to impose your propositions
on me and I'm not trying to impose
my propositions on you
what we're trying to do is to use the structures
that we have the propositional structures
to dance with them
and out of the dance to produce something
that's emergent and that's dynamic
and that's living it's the living spirit
actually that's living
that's appropriate it's
historically grounded and precisely
appropriate to this time and place
and that's the logos
and so that's why in complex
especially in complex western systems
although not only in them
the logos is the thing that's not only
of the hierarchy of value
but it's also the thing that brings
order out of chaos at the beginning of time
okay I would agree with that
you'd be pleased to know that when I talk about this level
of the brain
and mind in my courses I use the term logos
to label it
so my students can vouch for me on that
and I do agree
but I would also point out
that logos is also the basis
of the word logistical which again
is about the distribution of resources
right right right absolutely
and so what I was proposing to you
is that
that a Socratic
I mean whatever else Socrates was
I mean he was open to the transcendent
in a very important way
but he was also
that's why he knew that his not
knowing was the most important thing he knew
but he did know but see people forget that
although Socrates said he didn't
know in that sense he said he knew
that he did not knew that doesn't mean that he was just ignorant
he meant he had what Nicholas of Cusa
called learned ignorance he had an inside
knowledge of the way in which
an inside awareness of the way in which
he was limited and
and faulted but
Socrates did claim to know some things
he claimed to know Tau erotica
which didn't mean he was some sort of sexual master
he meant he knew
he knew what to care about
he knew what to find significant
he knew that the
unexamined life was not worth living
and he knew that to such a degree that he was willing
to die for that so
there was a kind of knowing that he talked about
but again it's this
knowing about again what to care about
what to find relevant
what you should what you should direct
towards and he saw
argumentation not as something
antithetical to that process
but as something that could deeply support it
the Socratic process of
Alancas and argumentation was
not antithetical to that
the Deologos but exactly
meant to be constitutive
and enhancement enhancing
of that very transformation
of what we fundamentally care about
and what we find most significant
and I think it's been a mistake again
due to the romantics because most of our mistakes are due to them
don't forget the
postmodernists
fine
but
this
putting on one side of argumentation
and then putting on the other
side caring and emotion
I mean what's going on in cognitive science
right now is exactly
I mean neuroscientists like Demasio
or Montague are saying
this is a false dichotomy that we have
saddled ourselves with too long
you cannot be a rational being
if you're not also a deeply emotional being
and you can't be an emotional being
if you're not a being that is
in some sense doing relevance realization
and rationing its resources
they are interdependent
and equally interdefining
and I think that again ultimately goes to the fact
that relevance realization is not cold
calculation it is ultimately
also deeply
effective, arousing, it's salient
and again
this is what we're trying to do when we talk
about the meaning in life
we're trying to find
those ways
of behaving and seeing
and paying attention that are rational
in the Socratic sense
of affording that interrelationship
between argumentation
and caring that again puts us
on the horizon of
intelligibility, puts us in that
place where wonder and a flow
of insight becomes a primary way
into which we try to adaptively
respond to a world that will always
be beyond our
complete cognitive grasp. Put her there.
That was great.
That's good, eh?
Thank you.
So that seems
to be a good end to the
debate. I think we can
we've got about 10 minutes so it might be a good idea
to incorporate some of the
ideas from the audience. I'd like to say one
thing first.
I gave credit
to work the idea with Leo Ferraro
I also want to point out that a lot of these
ideas have not worked out in
isolation.
My good friend Chris Master
right there is a co-author of a book
on a lot of these issues and he's been
a co-author in a true sense
and so I want to give him credit for some of the arguments
and ideas. We've often worked these
out together.
It seems like both of you have
arrived at the conclusion that
a sort of self-reflective
disposition that
adapts meeting structures
dynamically while you live
is how you generate proper
meeting structures.
I would like to offer you something to think about.
This is like a leap way the hell up the
abstraction chain. You've all seen Pinocchio
I presume, yes?
How many have seen Pinocchio?
You know you're watching like animated
drawings of some puppet
rescuing his father from a whale, right?
It's like what the hell are you up to by the way?
So you might think about that for a
minute. You go into the theater and you watch that
and you think oh yeah it's like there's a puppet
and you know he goes to an island and then he dives into the ocean
with a cricket and then he finds his father in a whale
and then a fairy changes him into a boy.
That all makes sense.
It's like well no actually
it doesn't make any sense at all and what's
even more interesting is that you actually don't care
whether it makes any sense and that you'd be
annoyed at anyone who would point it out.
So one of the things I would like to point out is that
the fundamental theme of Pinocchio is that
if you don't rescue
your father, which is order
by the way, from the bottom of
the sea, which is chaos, then you
can't become a genuine human being.
And you know we show that
to our kids because we know it's true but we're not smart
enough to understand it.
So truly, we act out
and represent symbolically many things
that we cannot articulate and that's in fact
what art is for. But you know
you might walk away from this thinking
but you don't believe this sort of thing.
It's like no, you might think that you don't believe it.
But if you watch
how you act, you believe it.
And the only thing you should ever do
when you're trying to figure out what someone believes
is watch how they act because what they say
about themselves is a very pale
reflection generally speaking
of the actuality that they
themselves are. You do not
comprehend yourself obviously because we wouldn't
even need this discussion.
But well, I'll leave
it at that. I wanted to point that out
because the sorts of things that we're talking about
are being broadcast at you
in many ways all the time.
And you know the themes.
What 20th and 21st century
philosophy and cognitive science are trying to do
when they're doing the deepest thing they can do
is to raise these
these forms
of knowledge that we've acquired
over God only knows
what length of time. Up from the depths
and to make them articulate
and to help us become real and to realize ourselves.
And like, that is the solution
to the problem of life in so far
as there is a solution.
And it may well be a sufficient solution.
Socrates thought it was a sufficient solution.
I agree. You know, he felt that
his identification with the
logos process roughly speaking
had given his life so much meaning and depth
that when the gods offered him
the chance to shuffle off the mortal coil
he went and had a little colloquy
with his conscience, his daemon
which was basically logos.
And it said, good job, old man.
Maybe it's luck for you.
You can drink the hemlock.
You say goodbye to all your friends.
You don't have to go through Alzheimer's
and the degeneration of your being.
Sayonara. And that's why Socrates
went through the trial.
We know that story.
And we know it for a bloody reason.
It's like he's at the base of our thought structures
along with other people.
Socrates means a great deal to me.
So there's
seems to be at least one solution
to try to pursue a meaningful life.
Dan Dolderman poses an interesting question
which is, how can people overcome
their resistance to the crushing
responsibility that comes with confronting
the meaning crisis? Well, that's easy.
Try to comprehend the alternative.
You know, you're either aiming for heaven
or you're going to end up in hell.
It'll happen while you're alive.
It'll happen afterwards.
But you can see people in hell all the time.
You just have to look around.
And so you're either on the path
and moving forward and upward
and aiming at the right thing
or you're backsliding backwards
into a place that is properly conceptualized
as eternal and punishing.
It's like, that's no problem.
So the way you motivate yourself partly
is by thinking, well, do you really want
more suffering and misery in the world
or do you want less?
And we're back at the end of World War II.
Is it wrong to inflict pointless
pain and suffering on people for aesthetic
purposes?
And the answer was, well,
yeah. Okay, good. We got hell
specified. That's good.
So you think, well, the opposite of that.
Whatever is the opposite of that? Well, we don't know.
That's what you're pursuing unless you were
like pretty fond of what happened with the Nazis.
You know, so
you motivate yourself by
running away from the most awful thing
there is towards the thing that's the best
that could possibly be.
And it's up to you to decide what those things
are. I mean, you're an independent
being with all sorts of ability. It's like
solve the problems you can
solve like more power to you.
I've got my problems. I'm going to solve
them. And hopefully, jointly
all of us, we can make this
place that's fragmented and flawed
and decrepit and in trouble and beauty
and all of that into a place that's
as good as we can imagine
anyways. And we should adopt the responsibility
to do that because the alternative
you think that
responsibility is miserable
is you try your responsibility
and just see what happens.
So that's
my answer to that problem. Can I have a question
I'd get please?
I think I have a, I'm not going to
challenge what Jordan says, but I think
I want to answer a different aspect of Dan's question.
How can people overcome
the resistance to the crushing responsibility
that comes with confronting the meaningless?
So I think you can make a moral agreement like Jordan
has and I think that's valuable, but
I know Danny's a good friend of mine and I think
part of what he was
part of what's being implied there
is that
the question is more about
how to enable people
and what I would answer
and I hope that's a fair thing to say
Dan's nodding so that's a good sign
I
would say there that, and this is again
to fall back on to Socrates and Plato
and give me a
moment here because I'm going to say something that might be
strike a little bit at first.
Plato talked about the fact that people
have to be seduced into transcendence
and that
word kind of strikes us off because we don't like
the notion of seduction, but what he meant by that
is it's like you can't, it's like
you have to sometimes tell your kids just do
this and then once you've done
it you will know why it was
important to do it. You have to go through
the transformation in order to understand
why the transformation is valuable to you.
Now typically people just
know, right, and so what you want to do
is you want to
give some form of behavior to people
from where
that's inside the box they're in
that they like to do inside the box
but has this little time bomb in it
and Jesus of Nazareth was a
master at these kinds of time bombs and they were
called parables. You tell this story like
oh I know what this story is
but it has this little explosive thing in the center
of it. That's a snake.
Okay, well whatever.
And the point I'm trying to make is
you give people, right,
certain psychotechnologies, certain techniques
and you say, you know, this will
help you do this, this will help
you do this, this will help you know solve
some of your own more practical problems
this will make you more insightful
this will make you a little bit more cognitively flexible
but then what you've also, what
you've actually done is you've also
prepared them
in two ways. You've
prepared them to actually extend that
machinery because it has a momentum in it
and start to ask the question for themself
and you've also enabled them
to respond to the question
in a more challenging form.
And then if you can keep doing
that with them in a kind of Socratic dance
you can draw
and this is what was meant by this seduction metaphor
you can draw people into
a very deep kind of responsibility
without having them at any point
confront a kind of crushing
clash. And I mean in that sense
and I don't mean this in a patronizing sense
it is very much like good parenting
of yourself
yes of yourself or whoever you're trying to help
confront
the meaning crisis
without as Dan
saying sort of just dropping this nightmare on them
so that's how I would try to
elaborate on that a little bit
because John brought up
this other idea about parables
and so I want to tell you about a meta-parable
because the parables that
Christ laid out were
embedded in a meta-parable
and the meta-parable
expanded
itself over
2000 years into Christianity
essentially and so although it has its roots
far before Christianity emerged
so John said
you know you throw someone a little box
and you say transform within it
it's like okay fine so I would say the way you do
that is like we said this earlier
pick a problem that bugs you
that's why Jiminy Cricket is an insect by the way
pick a problem that bugs you
that you could solve
and solve it. Now
what Piaget would say
that in order to do that you're going to have
to take some of the presuppositions
that you're using locally in that box
let them die
that's a kind of sacrifice
and then
generate a little local chaos
and then pop up a new solution
and so that's a small death and rebirth
and so the reason that the parables
are nested inside the story of death and rebirth
is because the idea is
that the way that you get to the kingdom of heaven
so to speak
is to allow yourself to die
and be reborn and so you should have faith
in the part of yourself that can undergo
a disilutive process
in preparation
for a rebirth and that can happen at multiple
levels of analysis
micro levels which is where you should start
man start at the micro levels
fix what's at hand
and then if you get good at that
you can start moving up the abstraction chain
and if you get all the way to the top
which you won't because you can't
then the deaths and rebirths are very very
profound and significant and
well that's a metaphor in many ways
and I don't know how far it extends
I mean it extends a long ways but
it's a metaphor of what
that drama
and it is a drama is trying to
it's trying to teach us about ourselves
we formulated the drama
to tell us who we are
you know and so
I like that
I mean I think I really like that
you just said about the meta parable
and priced exemplifying a parable
as a background thing
to ground his spoken parables
that's quite brilliant well done
it's been five years to think of it
well better you than me because I benefit from that
I mean that's great
I mean that's really good that's very good
I think
and I think you're
notion about disillusion
affording you know this is
you know this is dynamical systems theory
it's also what the shaman do
when they go through their transformation
I was going to say it's ancient shaman
and I was also saying that I think it's prevalent also
in the platonic metaphor
people who are trapped in the cave
and they've been trapped so that they're always
looking at the shadows and hearing the echoes
and they have to make their way out
and they make their way a little bit
and they're initially blinded but their eyes accommodate
and then that allows them to go a little bit farther
and then that blinds them and then their eyes accommodate
and then that affords them to go a little bit farther
and you do the ascension
you do the anagogy out towards
where you're in the real world
looking at the sun and I think that's the way
you do it with people
you take the light home and you distribute it
to people who are in the dark
well the problem as Plato said is when you go back down
if you go back down too rapidly
your eyes have to reverse accommodate too
if you go back
I mean Plato said it first way before man for man
you're blinded by the light
but if you go back too soon
they're going to kill you
like they kill Socrates
so then there's just as much
problem of
responsibility on
the teacher as there is
on the people being taught
they can suffer also a kind of catastrophic
event if they
come back down from the sun
I'm not putting myself in that place of enlightenment
but you know what I'm trying to say
that's our time
good
good work
you
