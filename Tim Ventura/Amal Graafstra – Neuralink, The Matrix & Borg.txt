I'm Tim Ventura, and we're joined today by Amel Grafstra, book author, TEDx speaker,
and CEO of the biohacking company's Dangerous Things and Vivo Key Technologies.
Amel has various RFID and NFC implants in his body that open doors, start vehicles,
unlocks his smart gun, and log into computers for him.
Prior to his current roles, Amel's experience include numerous executive IT-related roles
at firms including Walletmore, EverFind, the medical biotech company Morpheus,
Tommach Mobile, Silicon Energy, and more. He joins us today to discuss the intersection
of information technology and medicine with the focus on the intersection of biology and technology,
the evolution of our relationship with machines. So Amel, welcome back. It is truly a pleasure.
I am so excited to have you with me today. Cool. Yeah, let's get into it.
Well, let's start with Neuralink. Okay, they just implanted their first patient with a brain
implant containing 64 flexible polymer threads providing 1024 sites for recording brain activity,
which allows the patient to control a computer mouse simply by thinking. So I wanted to start
with your thoughts on this. Yeah, so it is quite a milestone. They're not the first, of course,
they've been brain implants for a very long time using like arrays and things, but the idea that
this could be a permanent device. So not a lot of people realize that back in the old days or
whatever when they would do nerve interfaces, they're just like spiked arrays and you jam that
into the tissue and it works, but it only works for a time because your tissue is gelatinous,
right? And it moves and it grows. And so you would set up your arrays to try to figure out what
kind of brain cell activity am I able to record here? Can I induce activity in those cells? But
very quickly, you know, in the matter of a few weeks, the cells will move around,
scar tissue will form, the signals that you had then don't work now. And so it's very difficult.
But yeah, the two kind of front runners in the space Neuralink and Synchron,
they're doing an amazing job because the way that they're approaching this, you can expect
that those devices are permanently implanted. So that gives rise to applications that,
you know, that wouldn't be really possible with previous technology. So moving a mouse,
being able to communicate at all is fascinating. And it's a huge leap from where we were. But
it's also quite crude, right? You know, it's the first thing that we can point out and say,
look, we've gotten the first rung of the ladder here.
Well, and I appreciate you mentioning Synchron. I'll come back to them in a moment. But
from what I've read, the implant was done by a surgical robot, which is hoped to pave the way
for mass adoption of this technology for the treatment of conditions like they've mentioned
obesity, autism, depression, schizophrenia, at least to begin with. And this comes on the heels
of a story about a man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who was the 10th person to receive
a Synchron Blank Brain implant that allows him to send health notifications and pain reports to
medical providers using his mind. So again, this, this goes to what you were saying about
they're not the first, right? But apparently this surgical robot, I guess, is something that
could mass produce implants. Yeah. So well, it doesn't produce them. But what it does do is
when you're placing threads right into the brain, your biggest issue, and again, the issue with
like the arrays and things is that when you, it's just spikes and you ram this into the tissue,
and it creates tears, bleeds, you know, your body has to react. The whole point of the surgical
robot is that it can identify places in brain tissue to be able to thread that thread, you know,
into the brain matter without causing a bleed, without hitting a blood vessel, basically working
it in between the capillaries and things that are supplying your, your brain with oxygen.
And by doing that, there is no reaction. The body doesn't realize they're there.
There's no scar tissue formed. And it's really the only way to make this approach that Neuralink
is taking, make it a permanent implant or something that doesn't reject or change or become
useless over time. You know, Synchron is taking a different approach. They're, they're not going
through the brain at all. They're going up through the blood vessels and they have a stent, right?
So it goes into the blood vessel that's in the brain. It blows up like a stent and it has all
the sensors arrays around that perimeter. And so by being very close to the wall of the blood vessel
and the brain cell, the neuron is right there, they can pick up the activity through the,
through the thin wall of the blood vessel without any actual interaction with brain,
brain matter, brain material. So the two approaches are really great. The surgical robot feels a
little scarier because it's like a robot that's poking in your brain. But, you know, we do all
kinds of surgeries now with robots, eye surgeries, things like that, lasers that, you know, use robots,
basically a computer, what's going to evaluate where to shoot that laser into your eyeball to,
you know, change the shape of it. So we're trusting, you know, this, this kind of thing,
this medical or surgical robots in many other areas. So it's, it's not really crazy. But,
you know, I think when it comes to the claims, when we're talking about treating like autism,
schizophrenia, things like that, that, that's a possibility. But it's a big, that's kind of a
hyperbolic claim, because we don't even really know how those things work yet today. Like,
we're saying we're going to solve, you know, X, but we don't really know how X works. But we're
going to solve it, right? It just seems a bit, yeah, wrote a bit of a two, two, maybe a little bit
premature. Yeah, it's premature. And, but, you know, at the same time, you got to, you know,
there's all this discussion going on, because I had a chance to talk to Tom, CEO of Synchron,
a while back at an event. And, you know, it's not just him, but, but all these companies that are
bringing these kind of devices that have medical uses, but they also have augmentative uses.
They're really, really don't want to talk about the augmentative uses. They want to focus on the
medical use, because who's going to argue with that? Who's going to say, well, we shouldn't help
these people, right? But at the same time, the exciting cusp of this is that, while, yes, we
could improve the lives of people with these conditions, we could also improve the lives
of people without any conditions. And that's where I'm very, very interested in the human
augmentation aspect of these technologies. Well, and that brings me to your implants. Again,
you are on the leading edge of this. And it just, I mean, in terms of mind blowing stuff,
you actually have RFID and NFC implants in your body right now. And you've tailored those so that
they do specialize things in your life. Can you tell me a little bit about your implants?
Yeah. And I guess I should ask you to tell us a little bit about your companies too,
so that you can learn more about those. Well, let's start with the, we'll kind of go through
the chronology and that'll cover it. So in 2005, I was working at Morpheus and my company, Morpheus,
doing consulting and basically managed services for, for medical clinics and things. And so
I was going in and out of this door and quite frequently, and it was an automatic locking,
you know, emergency door, really. And I just got really, really frustrated with it. And I'm like,
I need this door to just know that it's me and let me in and not have to fiddle with the keys and
stuff. And so I, I just, I looked at biometrics and stuff, but it's, you know, it was terrible back
then. It's kind of still terrible now. And high cost, high management, all that. And but, you know,
cards, RFID badges, beep, beep, you know, those were great and robust and cheap. And so I was like,
I want that, but I don't, the card, it's not going to solve my problem. I want, I want something
that works like that, but it's going to, going to just know that it's me. So I looked at pets,
like pets are getting these chip identifiers, you know, put in, that's just normal. And I was like,
well, why not? Why couldn't I just use that? So I called around, found a company that made them
for pets. And for technical reasons, I didn't want a pet chip specifically. I got the same kind
of material and construction, but with a different chip inside to, to interact with cheaper readers
that were available. And so I just made my own access control system that read the chip. And,
you know, it's beat my way into the door. It was great. I just walk up and kind of, you know,
tap my hand and grab the handle and go and went in. And then, you know, people saw that. And then
one of my friends took a picture and some videos and stuff. And that got on a blog. And then I kind
of, you know, got some media coverage and, and then wrote a book RFID Toys for Wiley Publishing
in 2007, because RFID was just becoming accessible to hobbyists, right? And, you know, so just kind
of kept rolling. And I kept waiting for that momentum to die down, doing other things, other
companies, you know, exploring new things. But by 2013, it was just very obvious that
there was interest, enough interest that just began to overwhelm my inbox. And so I started a
company Dangerous Things. A little tongue in cheek, you know, just, I figured I could call it
Safe Things, but that wouldn't convince anybody anyway. So I'll just call it Dangerous Things.
And then, you know, only people who really kind of understand that they're, they're literally
taking on the bleeding edge here would, would even consider it. So started the company and then
very quickly did a, you know, a crowdfunding campaign for the world's first NFC-compatible
implant. And so, you know, did that and then got a huge forex response over, over the ask. And
so I was like, okay, well, this is a thing, I guess. And so then we just kept going. But by 2018,
you know, it was clear that we needed applications that were beyond the, the basic, you know,
tap the door, the badge on the door, kind of what I call personal scope applications. So my door,
my car, my computer, I want to talk about, like, logging into websites, getting bank accounts,
identifying myself for travel, like those kind of bigger applications, broader scope. And so I
launched the company VivoKey Technologies to do that, to bring secure features, security features
to the implantables. And so, and, and also to kind of rebrand that approach for the broader scope,
because, you know, banks are not going to be like, yeah, get a Dangerous Things implant.
It's not going to fly. So VivoKey, you know, we focused on, on doing that. And in, during that
time, you know, over that period of time, technologies like FIDO, security keys, you know,
we're calling them pass keys now, but it's FIDO compliant. Security keys became a thing.
So now all my accounts are, that are possible to secure with FIDO security keys. I secure them
with an implant. So I've won on each wrist here, ding, ding. And so I just, you know,
log into your account. Yep, I just tap my wrist on the, on the reader here, on my desk, on my phone,
and I'm in. And there's, that's a cryptographically secure login, no more passwords. So doing things
like that is what VivoKey is focused on. And then, you know, we want to talk to governments and get
into EHR medical records, portable medical records, patient identity, things that are silently a problem.
And I mean, like, it's silent because patient identity, just simply identifying yourself properly,
particularly an emergency situation, but even just walking in the front door of the clinic,
seven to 10% of patients have multiple records, even at a single clinic. And that's a problem,
because record one might have this medication that you're taking, and record two might have this
other medication. And it's why every single time you will go to the clinic, they confirm are these
all your medications you're taking, because those dual records, duplicate records do exist.
And there might be contraindications. And if you have one medication that's
bad to take with another, but they're on two different records, you, they won't know that.
And then you'll, you'll get prescribed something that could be lethal. So that's one big problem.
Another big problem is just patient identity in general for surgeries, things like that. Is
this the right guy? Are we cutting the right leg off or the left leg? So just kind of reducing all
those possibilities down to something that's more than just, you know, your name and your
birthday when you go into the clinic is, is kind of one of those goals. So a lot of applications.
Well, and one of the things that we've talked about in past interviews is the fact that this is
the most secure way to protect your identity, right? I mean, phones can be stolen, smart rings
can be stolen, watches, things like that, fingerprints are just copied. Yeah, lost or
forgotten. So there is a, there is the hacker, the active, like trying to compromise your account,
but more, more likely is just the loss. Like you forgot that, that incredibly important token.
And it's, you see this increasingly in work environments. So you forget your badge,
you forget your, your security key for your laptop or your workstation at work.
That's a whole day of productivity gone. They have, have a full-time employee at the company
to handle that situation, get your temporary login, whatever they need to do, or you just need to go
home. Like there's some environments that are just require security so they don't, they don't
offer a workaround. So just loss of tokens, managing the tokens, all these identifiers of you
to these different systems, you know, we, we really want to try to collapse those down into
just you. And I really want to make you the bastion of your own identity, both physical,
biological, but also digital, to, to, you know, kind of abdicate that authority to your phone,
or to your laptop, or to a thing that's on your key chain. It just doesn't,
it doesn't feel right to me. So, you know, I want me to be the most important thing. And
if my phone breaks or I lose it or get stolen, I want to be able to pick up any phone and continue
to interact digitally, online, or even physically getting to my house, that kind of thing without
any need for, for another device that I need to manage. I want to get into the psychology of this
briefly. Part of that is based on past audience feedback. You know, I've had a wide variety of
responses. Some folks are like, yes, this is amazing. Let's go for it. You know, I want to see
this go mainstream. Other people are saying, you know what, I feel really uncomfortable about
putting anything foreign into my body like that. And for me, I look at that and I'm like, you know
what, there's a psychological barrier here. It's something that I've thought about. And so I have
a short list of artificial augmentations and body modifications, including braces, glasses,
artificial hips, pacemakers, IUDs, tattoos, makeup and lipstick, circumcision, vaccinations,
tonsils, or appendix removals, hormone replacement therapy, and plastic surgery. These are just,
again, this is just what came to mind as examples of body modification or augmentation that we
already do in society. But we don't consider these to be artificial because we've normalized
to them, right? Yes. And the other thing that's important, there's two other aspects here.
The first aspect is application, right? Is it compelling? Is the application compelling?
Replacing a faulty hip, that's compelling. You want to walk, right? Getting a tooth filling,
very compelling. You wouldn't get a drill put in your face for any other reason, but you want to
be able to chew food, right? Like get rid of the pain, like there are compelling applications. And so
for a lot of people, they may not feel that the applications are compelling. They may not have
had a security incident in the past. They might not care about securing an account that they
really could throw away if it got compromised. So there's a lot of potential reasons that
they just won't care enough to bother, right? Some people don't care enough to get a near
piercing even. They're just like, I never really cared about it, right? So they just don't,
or they don't get a tattoo because it's not compelling. But the other thing, the other side
of that is just an awareness of how the technology works because there has been a flood of kind of
misinformation that has just been pushed at the general public. And really, that's the only education
that they get about this technology is every movie you see that has a microchip implant involved,
every television show, every joke that's made on a radio show, or even in television, they might
offhand like, haha, you're tracking with a chip or all of those things are always negative for the
person with the implant. They're being tracked. They're remotely being killed, right? They're
got a missile fired at them because it's tracking the implant. All these things are all about how
to get rid of that chip or it's a bad thing. And so when you don't have any other real world,
real examples of the benefits, there's a real lack of trust that's created. So not knowing
how the technology works, not really thinking that companies or governments have your best interest,
that's very American. On the other side of the pond, there's not as much mistrust of the government
anyway, like agencies that are trying to help society. Here we have problems with trust. And so
yeah, all that stuff together, that raises the bar significantly for the compelling application.
People still will do terrible things that they're aware that there are terrible things to their
body for the application if it's compelling enough. Breast augmentation is one of those things. It is
horrific on the body. It's, you know, you make kind of facial surgeries, horrific nose jobs,
all that kind of whatever, very, very impactful and stressful to the body with risk, real risk,
like lethal risk. But the application is compelling enough, they're like, eh, you know,
I'm going to do it. So, you know, that's really the two things, the unawareness of the technology,
mistrust of technology, companies, governments, and then the lack of a compelling application.
But the thing that I really want to point out is that our entire approach here is to decouple you
from those companies and effectively from the government as well. But when you get an implant,
there's no like, the way that it works is just like the implant in your pet. It doesn't have a battery,
there's no charging it, it doesn't broadcast, it's not online, it's just their dormant. And when you
need to use it, you bring it up to Reader to do that application. And very much so, that implant,
VivoKey implants, Dangerous Things implants, they are your property, they're part of you,
if you put them in your body, in my opinion. You control what they do, what goes on them,
how they work, you know, that kind of thing. So, it's not like a phone, right? So, if you get an
Android or iPhone, you are tied in to those companies. There's no real way to use that
phone without those companies in existence. Not at all, like so, and then you're tied in the
phone company, they have the SIM card or whatever, like there's so many ropes and threads that tie
and your digital identity that that phone wants to own. It wants you to put your
wallet, your keys, your driver's license, your everything about you, your digital keys,
your pass keys, everything they want in that phone. They want you entirely to be owned by
that phone and in proxy by those companies. And so, I really don't like that. I really don't
like that idea. I like the idea that I have my identity here inside of me all the time,
and I can use the phone. I can use the phone as an interface. I can use the phone to log into
things and to, you know, have connectivity and, you know, all that stuff. But that phone and that
account on the phone is not my critical identity. I can throw that phone away, pick up any other
phone, even if I borrow a phone from somebody else. And now, I can interact with my website
because all that stuff here is not in my phone. I don't have to log into that phone that I've
borrowed to get access to all my identity. It's here. And so, that is compelling.
Well, and phones, I think, are a great example where, you know, 20 years ago, smartphones were
kind of a luxury novelty, right? And it was for people who needed to be ultra-connected.
And today, it's considered, I think, a necessity by most, you know?
Yeah, you can get a smartphone from any kind of social services. Like, even if you're homeless,
you literally can get a phone, a smartphone, right, with these features and connectivity,
minimal data, minimal messaging and everything. But it is something you can get literally for free
because it is seen as almost a utility, right? It's power, water, these are utilities because we
see them as like critical. And phones, smartphones in particular, and connectivity has been put into
that arena, if not officially by law, at least by practice, right?
Well, so, do you think today's neural implants, I mean, again, right now, we're talking about
moving a computer mouse, right? Which is not tremendous, but for, you know, for the right
person with the right disability, then it is very important. As this technology matures,
do you see it enabling immersive virtual experiences like we see in movies like The Matrix?
I mean, that is a possibility. I don't know that it would be a good use of it. But yes, for sure,
because let's say you are having a visual issue, right? You have blindness or there's
some kind of problem with your optic nerve and, you know, the optic part of the brain processing
is back here. And, you know, if you plug into that nerve center, where you can submit some
visual information to the brain for processing, then, yeah, you could virtualize that completely
if you wanted. You could augment it. You could say, I want to be able to see in the UV spectrum.
I want to be able to see the infrared spectrum. I want to be able to see other things, right?
Like, there's a lot that could be done. And I think rather than full virtualization,
I mean, which would be possible, I guess, but particularly with people that still have input
from their real eyes, right? For full virtual, I'm sure that you would have to somehow put
a blinders on, right? So the only input your brain is getting is from the augmentation. But,
yeah, I think augmented visual aids are coming. We're trying to collapse that down already. There's
contact lenses that are trying to be created and things. But I think, really, that augmented
experience where you're able to, if you'd like, you know, be able to overlay information, things
like that. But more so, just kind of augment your capabilities. I'm much more, I'm less interested
in where I can see floating information about what's going on. I don't care. I want to see,
like, infrared. I want to see ultraviolet. I want to see electromagnetic spectrums.
Like, how strong is the Wi-Fi in here? Oh, it's really strong over there, right? Like,
being able to perceive things that we just can't perceive now. That is really interesting to me.
Well, the reason I mentioned the matrix is I want to take people beyond that. And again,
you are one of the few people who can just absolutely blow minds with where these things are
going. So, you know, again, in the matrix, humans connect to a network through a brain implant for
essentially a VR experience. But one of the things that you've suggested is that in the future,
due to natural neuroplasticity, the human mind may actually spread consciousness out
over the network as it begins to offload tasks for processing. And for me, that was
incredibly intriguing. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, we know this can happen. So, in brain injury cases,
you have an entire area of the brain that's been compromised or damaged or destroyed or removed.
And the brain compensates. It says, oh, shoot, I need to do that. So, let's move a little bit
out over here and make this part do that part now. And it doesn't really do it as well as the
area of the brain that was designed to do that. But it does work. And it's compensating and building
itself anew, basically, to do that. So, you know, the mind and the brain, the physical process that
the brain runs on, we'll call it the mind, the mind runs on the brain, right? The brain is the
hardware. The mind is the emergent property. And so, you know, and we'll talk about emergent
properties, I'm sure. But anyway, so, when you give that hardware more space, because you've
now linked it to digital neurons, let's call them. So, you have a bridge like Neuralink, Synchron,
and you have a higher density of that. You know, right now, it's mouse curses and things. But
you got to think of it like telephone lines. You know, even the old school, run them on the
telephone pole, pick up the phone, beep, beep, beep, telephone lines. Like, those telephone lines,
it's the same copper and everything. You know, right now, we're having phone conversations.
Hello, Mr. Bell, right? Like, very rudimentary, right? But those same copper telephone lines
bring, you know, eventually, we're bringing data and high-speed data, DSL and, you know,
broadband, over those same copper lines. And so, that's what we're talking about here is the
evolution of what it is we can do and the bandwidth we can do it with over those connections to
neurons in the brain. And with the idea that there is some permanence, right? So, these things aren't
nebulous or ethereal. They are kind of rooted once we map things out and connections out. The mind
will realize that there's more hardware out there to utilize, right? And so, even the neurons will
reconfigure themselves and you'll see, I believe, what you will end up seeing is as we move more
information over those bridges, the neurons themselves, the, you know, the synapses and the
dendrites and all the things that change over time, you know, I don't know if your audience is
aware, but when you have thoughts in your brain that recur, right, the, if a signal goes from
neuron A to B many times and repeatedly, that dendrite, that connection gets stronger. It gets
bigger and that neuron starts prioritizing that because it's saying we're learning, right? This
is why having recurring bad thoughts is not great because you're reinforcing that physically. Your
brain is reconfiguring itself to reinforce that behavior. So, have good thoughts and reinforce
that and you'll be good. But my point is you're starting to see these kind of super highways
in the physical, biological brain bringing information to and from those bridges to these,
this digital space and that digital space could be, you know, could be crazy. Who knows, right?
It could be anything. You could, you could get, you know, the Amazon brain expandable
the service, right, or whatever. So, yeah, I think that there is, depending on how things are
communicated within the brain and how those kind of action potential, action potentials are how
neurons communicate and how those are explored and mapped and provided digitally. Yeah, I think
the brain will totally reconfigure itself and then parts of your mind will have the opportunity to
run on the cloud, basically. How that feels or how that works when there's connectivity issues
is a little scary. I'm not sure how that would work. You might suddenly become like lobotomized
if your connection drops. So, you know, if you migrate too many of those functions and features
out, that might be scary. But it doesn't necessarily need to be on the cloud either. You could have
a device with you. I mean, we already have our phones with us at all times and we kind of prioritize
those devices over even our wallets. So, if you ask somebody if they'd rather lose their wallet or
their phone, they're like, I don't care, take my wallet. Don't take my phone, right? So, you could
imagine that there could be something similar where you have your kind of digital neural space.
But it is, in my opinion, it'd be better if it was something that you had and controlled and
contained and had with you at all times to help augment your cognition.
Well, so I want to jump from the matrix to the Borg, right? It's just one science fiction trope to
another. In the matrix, right, the brain is either here or here, but, you know, it's discreetly in
one place. But then this idea with spreading your consciousness out is you start to form like a hive
mind, right? And when I thought about that, I was like, what's the best example for that? I thought
the Borg, right? Where they are potentially individuals, but that consciousness is spread out
and it's shared among groups. Maybe that's working groups, maybe it's larger groups. And so you get
into this hive mind, that's the only word to describe it, I guess. Do you think that's possible
in the future? Yes, but I do want to point out, so in the matrix, the brain was always in the jelly,
right? It was always in the person. You had experiences that were generated and shared,
like you're in a game with other people, but the mind was always in the body. And with the Borg,
you didn't, they described it as saying the hive mind, but what they really described technically
was not that. It was more of an information superhighway. I equate how the Borg behaved. I mean,
I don't want to get too nerdy, but there's episodes where one of the Borgs was like disconnected from
the group and how they felt and all that. And they tried to describe what that was like. But
that what they were describing was the same feeling of a person who's maybe addicted to their phone
and then loses their phone. They don't really lose part of their mind. Their mind is fully capable.
They are still, the idea of an individual is still there. But when they're connected,
they lose that because they're just used to that ambient intimacy that always being connected
with other people can bring. And so that idea that a Borg was a hive mind isn't really true. It's
just more like an ultra connected, I mean, you could kind of equate them to a teenager today
that's just like always on the phone because that is their connection. And so they do kind of lose
their individualism, although we try to tout the idea that you can be yourself online or whatever,
you know, but you're tied into that whole environment. And you cut that off. And there's
like a real sense of loss, social loss, personal loss, but it's not a loss of mind, right? Yeah.
And so the idea that your actual brain function can be shared or intermixed with other people
rather than a communication, because a communication is a clear barrier. Here is me down here,
here is everything else. And I communicate what I want, even if it's thoughts and high bandwidth
communications and feelings, like we could be able to communicate feelings, which would be crazy,
or like images that we hold in our heads without words. So there is a huge potential for changing
fundamentally just how we communicate. But that still means that there's a barrier between me
and my thoughts and my memories and what I want to communicate and how I'm communicating it with
others. The big leap would be if we started to share neural spaces, so that there is no idea of
communication, there is just the idea of us, right? And again, the Borg tropes, they try to
promote that idea that that's a hive mind, it's us, it's, you know, whatever. But in every example
of where they describe the technology about how the Borg network works, how they interacted with
the Borg network cut off from their group, it just shows that they were doing really high-end
communication and not actually sharing neural space. The idea that, you know, Borg is an altered
biological being, their mind is still in here, but they're just really connected. They never
really broach the idea that when you argue that connected and you're dealing with neural signals,
like action potentials of neurons itself, that part of the mind could actually migrate away
from the biological framework that it's running on. And the level or the amount of
that migration is, you know, it's not deterministic. It could be anything, but in those cases,
like, it could be very, very serious. I mean, the Borg had the ultimate setup. They should have
explored that because they had some kind of subspace, you know, communication that was always on and
never had a glitch. And, you know, like, that's what you would really need and want, because if
you did start to explore this idea that a lot of your mind was actually, you know, being processed
outside of your brain matter, if you did have a miscommunication or disconnect, right, you could
you could really and quite literally lose cognitive function, right, not just psychologically,
but like actual cognitive function could be lost and just like a brain injury, right, where you
have brain damage, and it's like, okay, now, now your mind is collapsed into this biological thing,
and it has to learn how to deal with that and recuperate and reassign functions to other parts,
and then maybe you get reconnected and you're like, oh my gosh, you know, but there is a bizarre
possibility and that and this is far future. But but if you were operating in that mode where you
had some of your mind and in here and some of your mind out there, whether that's on a device you
have, or in the cloud or both, you know, if you had a disconnect, and there was enough of
plasticity that your mind has grown equally in both spaces, is there now two of you? Is there a
mind that's digital, right, and what happens when you reconnect? Are you now getting to know yourself
again? And, and, you know, that just touches on, I mean, I haven't really circled around yet, but
but the idea that you have this digital neural space, or even just connections to the biological
brain through a digital bridge, if we wanted to then like do the Vulcan mind meld, we could really
do it for real, because we could share neural spaces, even if there was no, I mean, probably the
first thing that some crazy people out there are going to try to do is connect brains together
without a digital mind, but just bridge two brains together. So, you know, Dr. Warwick, who did the
first, I think in the 90s, he did the first, he was the idea, say, hey, microchip implant, let's put
it in here. He did that for a week, and that was a Cyborg 1.0 project. But a Cyborg 2.0 project was
to take the terrible metal spiky arrays and jam them into a major, I think it was a radial nerve
in his arm, and then his wife also got one, and then they linked them together, and they could feel
the impulses and the neural activity from each other. Their brains didn't have enough time to
plasticize and change and reinterpret that input as anything meaningful, but they could definitely
feel it, and so that was kind of the first neurological mind meld, so to speak. But having
these really high quality permanent bridges like Neuralink and Synchron, there's no reason we couldn't
experiment with the idea of linking brains together in that way. It'd be really, really interesting.
Well, so, again, just to kind of recap where we're at so far. I mean, we started with the
Matrix. You've got VR experiences. We've gone to the Borg where you're starting to move functions
outside of the brain. I want to get into additive functions as well, which is something that I
touched on in an interview about super organisms the other day with author Byron Reese. Now,
his focus was entirely on biological organisms. He's a beekeeper, and so I think that was his
original inspiration, but he made an amazing point. For me, it was very paradigm shifting. He said,
look, you know, human beings are made of cells, and somehow we have this emergent consciousness
that comes from that. He said, well, you know, cities, countries, societies are made of people.
What if something similar happens there? Now, what interested me, though, was his focus. And
again, this goes back to beekeeping. I guess his inspiration was he was looking at this entirely
biologically. But the thing that immediately came to my mind was we're not entirely biological,
right? Like the internet is machines plus people. And so even without neural implants,
you know, I'm wondering if that might be going on, you know, if what we think of as the singularity
or the network waking up, maybe that's already happening. But I thought I would put that out
there and see what your thoughts were. Yeah, I don't think that in the same way,
an emergent consciousness will happen from the connectivity that we have or anything. But
there are definitely emergent behaviors. There are emergent features. So if you go on Wikipedia,
you could search just emergence, and it has these different contexts under that entry. And so,
you know, emergent consciousness is seemingly unique so far. There might be emergent consciousness
coming in the digital space with different AIs and whatnot. But I think the idea that multiple
conscious beings emerging into kind of a super consciousness, that depends on how you really
want to define it, right? Because if you're just observing, which everybody is doing, right,
right now, we don't have linked brains. We don't share a neural space. And so really, I just have
to trust all the inputs that I'm observing and make a determination about that. So it's, you know,
the Turing test, right? Can a computer pass as a human in a conversation? Well, we have that now.
But does it make it a human? No. It's just that that observation, you know, is tricked, right?
We're saying, okay, well, with the things that I'm seeing and the things I'm observing,
this is a person. And that's just not true. So in the same way, I think we're going to be tricked
a lot by AI that's coming down the pipe. But at some point, I think there may be
an emergent consciousness that arises. But it won't be like ours. It'll look very similar,
and I'll probably know how to pretend to be. But it will be its own thing. But as far as like,
the idea of merging humans together, just in a communicative way, so just because of the internet,
or just because even in the 1700s, because you had a very close-knit society, where everybody
knew everybody's business, and you all lived in this one little area forever,
that had an emergent thing. And we call that culture, right? So we have definitely emergent
cultures from our proximity and our ability to communicate and the methods we use to communicate,
the internet connecting us all together in ways that we never could before. So we definitely
have emergent properties, which are culture. But when it comes to actually binding, you know,
neurological activity together, overlapping it, intermixing it, I think it's going to bring
a whole new world of understanding on one hand. We really can't do a good job today of truly
communicating what it feels like to be yourself, to another person. You're relying on that person
having similar experiences that they can relate to. You're relying on your ability to collapse that
down into something I can tell you about, that you then reimagine in your head as a story that
makes sense to you. But it's not my story, it's my story reimagined by you, because you've imported
it as input, and now you've created it, reconstructed it. But for me to be able to say, here's my story,
boop, and then literally put that in your mind, because we're connected in that way,
or we're sharing the space, and we're thinking together, I don't even know how that would feel,
or work, or whatever, that just is bizarre. And then you add multiple people to that, groups
of thinking together minds, where it's not communication, it's shared thought, and influence,
you know, just like the brain, you know, every neuron in the brain is based on influence.
This neuron is very important, because we've had this thought before, and so all the connections
of this one are very robust, and carry the signal farther, and so, you know, and then it reconfigures,
you can reconfigure your mind, it's dynamic, it's always changing, it's plastic. And so,
in the digital space, you know, you would have individuals with shared space, and that would
probably have a similar approach, I would think, where there's like influence that is always changing,
and depending, but you're thinking together, which is different from anything that's ever
happened before. It's not communication, you're not saying, here's my idea, what do you think of it?
Oh, and then you take it, take their refeedback back, and you, that's not what I'm talking about.
You literally would have a shared mind, which is, I mean, it might, it might be terrible,
it might cause psychosis, but, you know, ever, might be great while it's happening,
but then if you get dropped from that, you're like, you know, a zombie, who knows, right?
It's just exciting to think about. But, but the reason that it's exciting to me is that it's
totally plausible. Yeah, well, there's so much coming down the pipe, and it seems like these
things are almost required for the future. I mean, I've worked with a lot of scientists,
and one of the things that I'm seeing is the amount of work that has been done in the past,
right? And this has been written about in terms of data, you know, I mean, human data just keeps
increasing and increasing and increasing. And when you get into the sciences, it's the same thing
with papers and observations and theories and hypothesis, you know, it's becoming too much
for any one person. And, you know, in some disciplines like physics, it's probably been
that way for many, many years. But even in, in, you know, I would say less rigorous disciplines,
you know, it's becoming that way, and it will continue to increase. And so one of the problems
becomes, you know, when the amount of information is required to make good decisions outpaces what
anyone is capable of doing, you know, we're almost going to have to use, like, for instance,
chat GPT is something that people are using for research a lot now. And I would assume that
as things like that, you know, continue to progress, that will go to implants and things like that as
well. Yeah, I think we're touching on, you know, what Elon Musk has talked about, which is the
only way for humans to compete is to integrate, right? And even if we're talking about, we're not,
let's, let's just omit the idea that, like, we're going to share minds, right? Let's just go back
to the basic idea that we can expand our cognitive capabilities as individuals with some technology
like this. So there's one side, which is like, I need to be able to think harder, right? I need to
be able to do things in the digital space in a digital mind that my biological mind isn't good at,
like math or mass information consumption and processing, you know, and I'm just an acting
as an individual doing that. So that's one approach that we could get to with, which is like,
I'm a super brain when I'm connected and I can parse all these papers and I can do all this stuff
myself. Then there's the other side, which is much more likely, which is that I still do that,
I still have like expansion of mind, but the focus is on directing AI agents that are acting on my
behalf and then I task out things. So I'm like, hey, look at all these papers and figure out this
thing. But the difference between doing that now with like a chat GBT and doing it in a mind space,
right, is that, you know, when you're on a roll, like you're in the zone, you got flow, right? And
things just seem to come super natural and you're just like, boom, but that could be the reality
with independent agents that are doing these tasks, but doing it on a subconscious almost level,
you don't have to command them to do it. You're just thinking like, oh, and then you just like,
okay, get those things. Yeah, okay. And it's kind of all coming together for you in a shared mental,
you know, digital mind space that that is just, it feels like magic, right, compared to how difficult
it is to arrange all those things with your jelly brain, right? So I think that's probably a much
more likely scenario. Before we get into that, I mean, I could see like maybe even regulation
be like no mind sharing, right? You know, like, that's a bad thing, because I really don't see how
that kind of concept could be maintained. It's like, I would say there's probably a hard time
making it such that doing that, sharing a mind space with other people, one or more people
over a long period of time could be good for you. Particularly because the technology is not to the
point where you can rely on it. Like if you had a failure of the network, right, like AT&T went down,
you know, and thousands and thousands of people were out of cell service, couldn't call 911 or
whatever. So that just happened last week. So, you know, if we get to this point, and then I can
imagine being they're being serious, you know, impacts to society and individuals, if these types
of experiments start getting into the public space, just like social media was an experiment,
and there's all kinds of bad fallout from that, because people are too engaged in it, and they
start to make their lives about that, and then there's problems. So, but on the other hand, you
know, I think humans are still going to try it. I think humans are still going to bumble down that
road, and we'll see what the outcomes are. And maybe, you know, there might be some capabilities
that are new emergent cultures that come from that, that can handle it and can deal with it. And
like, the people that are of our generation, even the kids that are being born today, might look at
and go, oh, that's, that's creepy, there's kids today, you know, like, you know, that's just how
it works. You know, so, so, yeah, it's definitely going to be interesting, though. Yeah, yeah,
things continue to change. And it seems like we're continuing to blur the line between the natural
and the artificial. And when I thought about this, when I was writing questions, I realized, you know,
we really haven't been natural for something like 2.6 million years since we started using tools.
So it's, it's not that we're leaving natural behind. It's just that we're continuing to change what
it means to be natural, I guess. Yeah. I mean, there's no, it's the height of arrogance to think
that you're outside of the natural order, right? Like, this is the natural order, because we're
creating it as we go. Like, there is no other order. This is natural. It's just, you know,
the decisions that, that, that are made or the, the, the paths that different species go down could
lead to extinction. That's something that, that we are not, I wouldn't say unique. Other animals
make decisions and other, other animals do have cultures and things, but, but we are taking things
to the nth degree, right? We're just like blasting off the surface of the planet into the unknown.
And we're doing it very, very, almost light speed at this point.
Well, Amel, thank you so much for your time today. We have given people a lot to think about. No
pun intended, but you know, I mean, this is, we've gone through some mind blowing concepts,
you know, and so this is, it's starting out with very rudimentary work and implants. And we're
just saying this is where it could go. And there are going to be lots and lots of challenges along
the way. Let me ask, what is coming up for you in 2024 as well as dangerous things in vivo key?
And do you have any predictions or prognostications for what we might see with Neuralink in the
implant sector as well? Oh man. So yeah, I mean, for me, where our focus is on bringing more secure
applications, we just started experimenting with legitimizing payment features and implants,
although, you know, the networks like MasterCardavisa and whatnot, they're still
very, very skeptical and don't really want to explore it. But we're doing, we're making strides
there. And, you know, we're talking to different companies now that want to bring different features
to different government ID and patient ID and medical records solutions. So that's exciting.
We're launching an IDP, which is an identity provider. So like a third party, I'm getting very
technical, but a third party like SAML based SSO provider so that you can use your chip and plant
to log into enterprise applications, like Octo one login, that kind of stuff, being able to
provide like Google workspace accounts that you can log in with your chip and plant. So if you go
to a website says login with Google, you do that and then scan your chip and be able to log in that
way, no password. So fun stuff like that, things that I want to use my daily life. People have
been asking about the payment thing. We're working on that. As far as like prognostications,
I wouldn't dare. Yeah, I just never step into that space because you're always going to be
wrong. There is this gap. I think if you try to go, if you go very far like what we did today,
then you probably have some level of accuracy because you're very broad in general. But to
say, oh, the next five years, I think these things will happen. No idea. No idea. Always surprised,
every morning. Thank you again so much for your time today, sir. Sure.
