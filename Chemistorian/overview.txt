Checking Chemistorian/A Chemist Explains the ENTIRE History of Atomic Theory.txt
 The discovery of nuclear fission revolutionized our understanding of energy and matter. In 1938, German scientists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann observed that when uranium was bombarded with neutrons, it produced barium, indicating that the uranium nucleus had split, or fissioned. This process releases a significant amount of energy and can trigger a chain reaction if a critical mass is reached.

The potential for both power generation and weapons development became apparent. As World War II began, many German physicists, including Jews who had fled their home country, contributed to the field of nuclear physics in Britain. Among them were Otto Robert Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, who in 1940 published a memorandum outlining the feasibility of creating an atomic bomb.

This led to the establishment of atomic weapons development projects in both Britain (Tube Alloys) and the United States (Manhattan Project). The two projects eventually merged under the Manhattan Project's leadership, which culminated in the first successful test of an atomic bomb in July 1945 in New Mexico.

Less than a month later, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, causing Japan to surrender unconditionally, thus ending World War II. Since then, the world has lived with the threat of nuclear weapons, highlighting both the destructive potential of scientific progress and its malleabilityâ€”science adapts to new evidence and can potentially resolve the challenges it helps to create.
