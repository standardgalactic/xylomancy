It's the Hebrews created history as we know it.
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate
your conscience without cost.
You will pay the piper.
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the
desert.
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic
and deeper than what you can imagine.
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
Yes, exactly.
I want villains to get punished.
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?
That's such a Christian question.
One of the reasons why I started working on the equipment is the way cattle were being
handled was horrible.
Electric prods on 100 percent of them falling down and crashing into things.
People screaming at them.
Cattle handling in the 80s was terrible, absolutely terrible.
And I saw that as something that I could fix.
Now I talked to a lot of young people today that want to do activism about some specific
thing.
And it's way too broad.
I want justice in the world, for example.
Right, yes, yes.
Might be something they would say.
Yes, yes.
And I say, why don't you do something more targeted, like using DNA to show that this
prisoner was falsely accused?
You see, now that's something a lot more targeted that you can actually do.
Yes, absolutely.
I think that is a huge problem with the way that kids are trained morally in universities
is that that grandiose, vague activism replaces the actual practicalities of problem-solving
that you're describing that actually make a difference.
Hello everyone.
I'm usually excited to have whoever I'm talking to that day on my show because I pick people
I'm excited about talking to, but I'm particularly excited about my guest today, Dr. Temple Grandin.
Temple Grandin revolutionized the animal handling industry over the last 40 years and has done
more for animal welfare in a practical sense than anybody that I know of and perhaps anybody
on the planet.
I think you could make a case for that.
She's a remarkable person.
I saw her first in Tucson, Arizona.
I'll talk about that a little bit in our interview.
She gave one of the most compelling presentations I'd ever seen in an academic setting at a
conference on consciousness and saw that about 15 years ago.
And ever since then, I'd really been wanting to meet her and I got to do that today.
So that's so exciting.
So I'll just give you a brief bio and we'll pop into the interview.
Dr. Temple Grandin is a professor of animal sciences at Colorado State University.
She is designed for handling livestock are used by companies all around the world.
Her work has been instrumental in implementing animal welfare auditing programs, now used
by McDonald's, Wendy's, Whole Foods, and many other major corporations.
She has appeared on numerous shows across platforms such as 2020 Larry King Live and
Prime Time.
Dr. Grandin is also an accomplished author with books such as Thinking in Pictures,
Walk Handling in Transport, and The Autistic Brain.
A few of her other publications, Animals in Translation, as well as Visual Thinking,
have even made it to the New York Times bestseller list.
In 2017, Dr. Grandin was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.
And in 2022, she was honored once again as a Colorado State Distinguished Professor.
We're going to walk through her book today and we're going to learn what she has to
say now about thinking.
Let's start with visual thinking and language.
So do you want to tell people about your realization and about different thought patterns?
When I was in my 20s, I thought everybody thought in pictures the way I thought.
I didn't know that other people thought in words until I was in my late 30s.
Now, you've already mentioned how do I categorize.
Well, I'll explain as a child how I learned to categorize, categorizing with individual
pictures.
So as a very young child, I categorized cats, dogs, and horses by size because in our neighborhood
at that time, there were no cattle and there were no small dogs.
Then a doxant came into my neighborhood and she's the same size as a cat.
And I remember looking at the doxant, she was a black doxant and trying to figure out
now what features does she share with a dog?
She barks.
Her nose shape is the same as a dog and she smells like a dog.
So I had to take other sensory-based things like smell and what the dog sounded like to
put the doxant in the dog category.
So the way I formed categories is I have to have a bunch of information.
Let's take the cat category and you look at a leopard's face, lion's face, and even
a house cat's face.
There's similarities and they also smell all the same too.
If you go to the zoo, you can smell how they are different.
So the first step for abstract thinking is put making categories.
So when I finally figured out that other people did not think in pictures, if I asked most
people, visualize your own home, your dog, or your car, you will do it because you're
so familiar with that.
But one time at an autism conference when I was in my late 30s, I asked a speech therapist
think about a church staple and I was shocked that all the only image she saw was a very
vague two lines like this where I see specific churches.
They come up like a series of back then 35 millimeter slides, now the PowerPoint slides.
And then I can start as I see more and more of these churches, I can put them into New
England type category, stone cathedral type, looks like a warehouse and it has a little
plastic steeple type.
I can make finer categories as I get more and more specific images.
It's bottom-up thinking and I learned that that's exactly how an artificial intelligence
program diagnosis melanoma cancer.
It's given a training set of 2,000 melanomas and another training set of every kind of
skin rash and mosquito bite and infected whatever.
And then it learns to categorize melanoma from non-melanoma.
And that was very insightful to me when I learned that that's how the simple type of
artificial intelligence programs work, diagnosing something like melanoma.
So let me ask you, when I'm thinking something through, now I can think in pictures and if
I'm building something or trying to design something to build, then I tend to think in
pictures.
But I would say 90% of the time my proclivity is to think in words and I would say in part
that's because my word thinking is so dominant, it just suppresses the image thinking.
And so a lot of my thinking, I would also say takes the form of something like internal
argumentation.
So I'll ask myself a question, I'll think up an answer in words, and then I'll think
up a bunch of reasons why that answer isn't sufficient, and then I'll conduct an internal
argument and that's occupying me continually, like 16 hours a day non-stop.
And it's been like that ever since I was two years old, except for those times, let's say.
So yeah, so how do you conduct internal arguments or what accounts for the, so part of the creativity
in my thinking is the outcome of these arguments.
But you're thinking in pictures, so you're not having internal arguments, what's the
stream of your thought like?
Well, when it comes to things like designing equipment, I often will kind of, a lot of
equipment design, someone gets an idea from something else, and one of my other books
I wrote about the inventor of Velcro, and he saw how Burdok stuck on his clothes, cockle
burrs on those kind of things stuck on his clothes, and that's where he got the idea
for making Velcro.
That would be visual thinking, the Burdoks and Velcro, they've got similarities on how
they stick together.
In designing equipment, I can just see how it operates.
I worked with welders that had 20 patents each that barely graduated from high school,
but they could build any kind of a machine and invent industrial machinery.
They just see it in their head.
Right.
Now, will you see, okay, so I read Nikolai Tesla's biography a long while back, and
it was extremely interesting, and he claimed, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, that
entire inventions, machines, would pop into the theater of his imagination, detailed out
to the point where he knew the angles on the screws that held the metal together, and he
would try to write them down in something, draw them out in something approximating something
that would be, that you could make a blueprint out of, let's say.
In that much detail, and sometimes a new invention would pop into his head so quickly that it
would obliterate the previous one.
He had to work very quickly to keep up, and so there's that incredible fluency in visualization.
But then, as I said, in the verbal world, I'll think of an argument and counterarguments.
When you're thinking of industrial design, do you think of the object that you're attempting
to design, and then multiple variants of it, and test them against each other, or does
it just come to you as a solution for a given problem?
It almost sort of just pops into my head.
I also see mechanical abnormalities, I remember walking in and someone had made a cardboard
old-fashioned locomotive, and the wheels have those links between them, and I go, they drew
that wrong.
Those are not going to turn, you know, it's just a cartoon train for a party, but I immediately
noticed that they didn't draw it right.
The other thing is, is my thinking's associative, all right, give me a key word, pretend I'm
Google for images, not something I can see in here with books and papers all around,
and photography equipment and stuff all around me, but something kind of a creative key word,
and I'll tell you how I access my memory for that key word.

So and with regard, so my wife has a very powerful visual imagination, she's able to
do all sorts of remarkable things with it, and one of the things that strikes me as highly
probable is that her capacity for visual imagery is a lot more intense than mine.
Yes.
I was a fairly vivid dreamer for years, especially when I was reading Carl Jung's work in graduate
school.
Don't seem to dream much now or not, well, I don't remember them much now.
When I do think in pictures, it's not as vivid as seeing the real world.
It's maybe 5% of that, it's sort of, well, it just doesn't have that intensity.
And you?
And you?
No, it's very, very vivid.
And while I was, while you were setting up all the camera equipment, here I found, here's
a whole bunch of papers, more papers I found online supporting a lot of the things that
are in the book.
I just got surfing around and boy, you can sometimes find some great stuff when you look
at the citations, no, but it's very, very vivid, it's completely vivid.
Now when you mentioned the word imagination, I remember going to a long time ago, Disney
World, a kind of a ride that had imagination with people and dirigibles and things like
that.
You know, then I visited a studio where they, where Disney made a whole bunch of their stuff.
I'm now seeing that, yes, I'm now seeing a non-disclosure agreement.
So I can't tell you what I did there.
And I, but I, now I'm seeing a very interesting discussion we had about designing things,
where, where you're designing things, there's the decoration part of it.
And then there's, then there's the mechanical part of, of a machine, of course at an amusement
park, you won't have decorations, but you also, the rides have to mechanically work.
They're kind of two separate things that were kind of done by two separate departments.
You also spoke in your book about your ability to see things out of place.
And so one of the things that characterizes autism is the fact that at least some autistic
people are not very happy when they walk into a room, say that they're familiar with and
one thing is out of place.
So for example, an autistic child might walk into a dining room and one of the chairs is,
you know, tilted 45 degrees to the right or to the left instead of being put straight
in.
And what seems to happen, correct me if, if you feel that I'm wrong, is that the fact
that that chair is now askew means that the entire room is different in some important
and emotionally significant way.
So there's this response to anomaly.
I don't have that issue.
That's not an issue for me.
But if there's one pixel off on an electronic sign, I will notice that.
I remember one time walking into the airport with somebody else and the United Ticket Counter
sign was a whole row of television monitors.
And there must have been 20 TV monitors making the word United over and over again.
And one of the screens was scrambled, the whole screen.
And I immediately saw it and I said to the person beside me, did you see that that sign
was messed up?
No, they did not see it.
And they were right beside me when we walked in.
I immediately saw it.
Now did it upset me?
No.
I just noticed that the sign was scrambled.
Right.
But it didn't upset you?
No.
So, yeah.
So, so, so that's that interesting.
So for me, I think I can detect anomalies visually.
So for example, one of the things I learned to do when I was setting up my house and renovating
places and setting up my offices, like arranging my local environment, was to sit in the room
and become meditative in some sense and then to feel out what was bothering me about the
room, like what ugly feature might pop out, what part of it needed to be attended to.
Right.
And I think I was tuning myself to detect what was abnormal in relationship to the underlying
aesthetic or the pattern of the room.
But that pops out for you almost instantaneously.
For me, anomaly detection is mostly verbal again.
It's like all think up an argument and then think up counterarguments.
And if one argument and the other don't jive if they're contradictory, then that pops out
for me.
Well, it's sort of like I fly all the time to like I know when the pilots do the checklist
and like we push back and we just take too long to turn, I'm going, uh-oh, we're going
to have an air traffic control delay and I can often predict that before they announce
it.
And I also can, I'm very conscious of on the biggest airplane when they start the little
gentle push to push it back from the gate, I can feel it on the biggest aircraft there
is.
Right.
And I just want to get there and I'm going, oh, please push back.
But it's sort of like I don't get upset about it.
It's just anything that's not routine.
I instantly notice it and I go, oh, crap, I see a vest that says tech ops.
We may have a delayed flight.
Now that brings up another thing I want to talk about.
The last month I've had, okay, a mechanic come on a plane twice and both mechanics had
gray hair.
And this brings up a major issue that's in my book about skill loss, especially skill
loss with mechanical things.
I've been on a lot of questionable elevators and escalators lately that definitely needed
servicing.
And what's happening, and this is in my screened out chapter, is the kids are getting screened
out of these trades because they've taken the shop classes out of the schools 20 years
ago and we have so many higher math requirements that you don't need for something like fixing
elevators that the kids are playing video games in the basement on an autism diagnosis
instead of fixing elevators.
There's a relationship here between what goes on with industrial things and what's going
on at school, which is a major, major thing that I'm interested in talking about.
Yeah, so let's talk about that a little bit.
That's one of the things that popped out for me from your book.
So I was trying to think that through.
So you make the claim as you just laid out that our education system and maybe our entire
culture as it's hypothetically deindustrializing is actually working against the best interests
of those who think mechanically, those who think in pictures, and those who can do hands
on work.
Well, here's a paper I just dug off of Google Scholar on visual objectability, a new dimension
of nonverbal intelligence.
And what a lot of educators don't understand is that object visualization, especially on
solving mechanical problems, it is a different way of thinking.
I worked with people that barely graduated from high school, stutterers.
They'd be labeled autistic to date.
They'd be in special ed, but they had big metal working shops and 20 patents each for
mechanically complicated equipment that they are selling around the world.
And this is something that educators just don't get it.
And the reason why I wrote this book, I'll tell you what was the reason, in 2019, just
before COVID shut everything down, I went to four places.
And I realized the magnitude of the skill loss.
The first one was a pork processing plant, where most of the equipment came from Holland.
I went to another pork processing plant, equipment coming from Holland.
Then I went to a poultry processing plant, where all of the specialized equipment came
from Holland, 100 shipping containers.
And then I went to the Steep Jobs Theater, and the structural glass walls are from Italy
and Germany.
Then, after reading more stuff, I found out that the state-of-the-art electronic chip-making
machine comes from Holland.
And that goes back to their educational system.
They don't stick their nose up at the high-end skilled trades and look at it sort of like
a lesser form of intelligence.
When the kids get to about ninth grade, they can go university route, or they can go tech
route.
And they want to emphasize high-end skilled trades, where you're really using that visual
thinking for mechanical devices.
So I was trying to think through why this might be happening.
So let me offer some hypotheses to you, and you tell me what you think about this.
So first of all, we have learned, and you draw on Simon Baron Kohn's work in your book,
we have learned that there is a difference, and we can try to map this on to verbal thinking
versus imagistic thinking.
Simon Baron Kohn talked about systemizing versus empathizing, and he considers that something
akin to the continuum between autistic thinking and normal thinking.
So the autistic types are more systematizing, and my suspicions are they're also the ones
who are more likely to think in images in the manner that you described.
Wait a minute, now we've got two kinds of thinking in images.
And there's a nice paper that just came out relatively recently, seeing and thinking in
pictures, a review of visual information processing that came out in 2018, I'd like to keep my
stuff up to date.
Now I think in photorealistic pictures, where the more mathematical type of thinking thinks
in patterns, see in your brain, you've got circuits for what is something, okay, so I
see a dog and I go, yeah, that's a dog, or I've got some china ceramic cattle on my
coffee table here, okay, and I just look at the animals and name them, then the visual
spatial is where is something, where are you located in space, there are actually two different
kinds of visualization, and I have a whole chapter in visual thinking book about this
and research to back this up.
Now the visual spatial type pattern thinking, or sort of where is something in space, those
kids do well in math, so they're going to stem right, but let me tell you what's going
on out in the food processing plants.
The people I've worked with in the big steel shops now that a lot of us closed down, we
are paying the price now for taking out the shop classes, on designed mechanically clever
equipment, the people I've worked with in May, we never worked on boilers of refrigeration,
we don't understand that stuff, that requires a lot more mathematical thinking, or the load
on the roof so the factory doesn't fall down if we get two feet of snow, you see, then
I have seen this division of engineering labor in every single meat company I have worked
with, they're all the same.
So do you think that's a matter of, let's say, something approximating focal depth,
so is it possible that the first kind of people that you talked about are dealing at the object
level itself, so they're dealing, say, with a boiler or with a particular piece of equipment,
whereas the other types are dealing with the relationship between pieces of equipment?
No, you don't think that's it?
No, I think it's just real simple, it's you just see the objects, and then after you work,
you see an object visualizer gets better and better at designing mechanical equipment,
the more things you go out and see, like when I started working my designing cattle handling
facilities, I went to every feed yard in Arizona and I worked cattle, and I go, this kind of
a design doesn't work, this worked, so then I took all the good bits and like recombined
them, it's bottom up thinking, the more stuff I get exposed to, okay, whether it's cattle
handling facility, or maybe I'll look at how water flows through something, and then you
watch how cattle move, I'd like to look at drone footage, and a lot of that resembles
water flow, and the visual spatial, they see patterns, it's actually very different, and
what we're losing is the object visualizer, that person that can just, you see, I'm very
aware of things like, I go in an elevator now that hasn't been serviced, and it's scraping
in the shaft, you better believe it, I hear it, and I go, they haven't serviced that elevator,
and I was at a fancy hotel recently, and the bell hop goes, oh, it skips that floor,
we have to get that floor on the way down, yeah, real nice hotel, major setting.
Right, right, okay, so let me, I don't quite understand that distinction yet, so I'm going to,
I'm going to push a little bit more on that, so on the visual side, you have the visual spatial
types, if I'm remembering this correctly, and that's the category that you fall into,
and then you have people who are, what, are they higher up on the abstraction chain in some sense,
the ones who can think more mathematically? No, but basically, object visualizers, I can
tell you this from experience, we're good at mechanical devices, art, photography, I have
talked to many, many photographers, because I do a lot of interviews, find out they're dyslexic,
they're about flunked out of school, and fortunately somebody introduced them to photography,
and the other thing that my kind of mind's good at is animals, then your visual spatial,
mathematics, algebra, I can't do algebra, there's nothing there to visualize, mathematics, calculus,
I took a computer programming course when I was in college, I couldn't do it, I had to crop it,
I was exposed to the same exact computer that Bill Gates had, and he could do it,
and I had to drop the class, these are the things that the more mathematical pattern
thinking mind is good at, and some of these really smart kids, they can just look at algebra formulas
and just see it, they don't have to do it step by step, they just see it, and that's how they think,
and then the teachers try to make them do it step by step, that gets the kids frustrated,
they don't think the same way, so my thinking is also associative, I tend to jump around,
but there's a logic to the association, and I think the best way to illustrate that
associative kind of thinking is give me a single keyword, like I'm Google for images,
and think of a creative keyword, and I will tell you exactly how my mind associates,
associates, and how my mind can get off the subject, but there is a logic to the getting
off of the subject, so give me a keyword, a single keyword. Okay, how about rows?
Okay, I'm seeing rows bushes that we had in our backyard when I was a child,
and we had a lot of thorns on them, and we also like dig around in the grass that was back there,
so now I'm seeing the grass behind our house, and we used to go play in it,
and catch some insects sometimes, okay, now you can see how it's jumping around,
I don't have that big a visual library of roses, so then I tend to then go to something else,
but there, how about cows? What? Cows? All right, now I'm seeing like
10 cow statues right here in front of me, and so obviously those are coming up in my mind.
Just recently, I tend to bring up recent memories, I visited with a black Angus Bull,
it was a pet, and he wasn't very happy with us because we didn't bring him any carrots,
so my friend gave him one of those disgusting soy protein bars, and he goes,
not gonna eat that, I wouldn't eat it, no matter how much we tried to feed it to him,
and he was annoyed because we didn't bring him any carrots,
okay, now I've got the carrot word in my head, and when I was in fourth grade,
I used my finger so handy to sew green crepe paper so students could be carrots,
and I made the green carrot tops out of green crepe paper, so that's how I got the cattle.
Okay, so talking to you, talking to you that way reminds me very much of what used to happen
in my therapy sessions when I was helping people interpret their dreams, and so dreams have the
same quality of thought that your thought had when you just put it on display there, so
because the dream tends to be an intermingling, so imagine there's a center category,
and the nature of the category is somewhat unclear, maybe that's partly what the dream
is trying to puzzle out, but what you get is a web of associations, some of which are autobiographical,
that are sort of circulating around a main theme, and partly what you do when you analyze a dream
is you walk through all the associated images, you also ask the person to let their mind lose
to generate more associations, and then you try to use the associational web to triangulate on the
central theme, and to haul out the gist, and the gist of that array of images would be something
like the interpretation of the dream, if you get it right then it snaps into people, they think,
oh yes, that's definitely what that was about, but the dream is attempting to put something
together, you know, that has a central category of structure. Well then there also are sensory
things because, you know, I have some balance issues, so I often get dreams where I'm like
riding a bike down a hill that's super steep like that, and I wish I wasn't doing that,
and I know that that has to do with the fact that I have balance issues, I don't think it means
anything, but I'm always up on some high place that I wish I wasn't up on, and I've got to try to
walk down it, and then I have other dreams where I can see it might have some meaning,
and other times where it doesn't, but the other thing with my thinking, when I'm working on
design work, I can control the associations, I can control them, I've had before, you know,
there's now 3D simulations, okay, let's say the company that's building this this plant
wants to show off how the equipment works, they can do a 3D simulation showing how the equipment
works, and I can remember sitting in a conference room when we were trying to discuss how to do
some conveyors, and the other guys there were coming up with ideas for the conveyors and going,
no, no, if you do that, you're going to yank the rails out of the ceiling, oh no, no, no, that won't
work, they were almost using my mind like a 3D CAD program that was animated, and I could test run in
my head on these different conveyors. Men, is it time to stop mindless scrolling,
time to finally gain that higher quality of life you know you're missing out on?
If this sounds familiar, then on January 9th, join thousands of men all over the world to
embark on a 90 day journey together in search of a better life. It's called Exodus 90, and it was
built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be. Exodus 90 guides you
in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life, and it actually works.
Independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the first 90 days,
including stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages, more meaningful prayer lives, and
dramatic decreases in time spent on their phones. For the past seven years, Exodus has helped more
than 60,000 men build a roadmap for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many
paths to self-destruction. Is it time for your Exodus? We start January 9th.

At the object visualizers, he was looking more at the mathematical visualization pattern thinkers.
I agree with them about systematizing and verbal, but he didn't differentiate the systematizers
properly. That should be more differentiated. Yeah, he didn't. Systematizers would have two
categories, the object visualizer and the visual spatial. And a big mistake in a lot of perceptual
studies is that they're not differentiating them. And there's some verbal people in psychology
that don't want to believe this stuff exists. Just while you were setting up the cameras,
I downloaded six new abstracts that aren't even in my book on this that show that they are different.
Right, okay. Got them right here on my lap. So Cohen also talks about gender differences
in relationship to this continuum. So we can break the continuum to two parts on the one end.
And it is the case that autism tends to be preferentially a male disorder, although there are
females as well. But so that systematizing mode of thinking that you've differentiated into the two
categories also tends to be gender stereotype to some degree at a biological level. I avoid that
issue as controversial because right now I'm interested in one thing at the age of 75 of
helping the students who think differently get into really good careers where they can have
satisfying lives. And I avoid the controversy old stuff. Yeah, well, I'm not so much interested
in the controversy. I'm interested in trying to address the issue of why shop courses, for example,
have been taken out of schools. Now, we do know that the like schools are predominantly run by
women and women are more likely to be empathized. No, I think they're less likely. I think the
reason why they took it out. So I'm wondering if there's a gender issue going on there and
a prejudice against a certain way of thinking. Okay. What's that? I think that one of the reason
they took out the shop classes, they kind of just go, everybody's going to go the university route
and cost. Good shop classes cost a lot of money. Now people are starting to put shop
classes back in and you know what they're finding? They can't find anybody to teach the shop classes.
I just heard about a brand new beautiful welding shop built here in Colorado at a community college
and they can't find somebody to teach it even after they dropped the university requirement.
And I can tell you right now, we need people that do these things before the power grid and
the water systems fall apart. I'll tell you that stuff I care about. Right. Right. Yeah. Well,
it's okay. So you, well, virtualize it. Now, do you think virtualization has also played a rule
in this? I mean, the systematizing types. Some of the 3D drawings, I see it wrong.
And that's not going to fix some of the serious problems we got with infrastructure right now.
And you need both kinds of thinkers. Like one of the things I've got in my book
is where a bridge fell down in Minneapolis and the workers were complaining. They were worried
that when they were working on this bridge, it was going to collapse. Well, I looked up that
bridge collapse and I saw all the twisted metal and I took one look at that and I went,
it's too light. It's too cheap. That was just from looking at the pictures. Then I found the
engineering report on why that bridge fell down and they cheated on the gusset plates that hold
the beams together and they were way thinner than the spec. But I had already looked at the pictures
and said that bridge is too light. It's cheap before I read any engineering report.
So how was it in your life that you attained the practical knowledge necessary to facilitate
your thinking? So we're talking about how you got to take in the vision. I'll tell you how you do
it. It's real simple. You got to get out and experience all kinds of stuff because the more
information you put in the database, the better you get. And going back to teaching a computer,
how to diagnose melanoma, you had to give it like a couple of thousand melanoma examples and a couple
of thousand mosquito bites, infected boils and everything else, examples. In other words, the
as I got older and I got more and more information in my database, I could think better and better
and better and I could make smaller categories of things. Now a lot of the people that I worked
with in construction that build equipment for me, that's used in every large beef plant now in the
U.S., some of them started and some of them would definitely be autistic. One of them started out
working on cars. Another one took a single welding class and now he's selling mechanical
equipment all over the world, started with a tiny shop that then grew into a big shop.
And what's happening now is the little shops are not forming and that's why we're importing
all this equipment from Holland and Italy because when you look at their educational system and I
looked it up again recently online, Italy actually has three routes, university route,
tech route, mechanical and art route, you know, like for their fashion industry and the
Holland and Netherlands, you can go either university route or tech route and that's why
they're making the state-of-the-art chip making machine that we don't make.
Right. And I'm not talking potato chips, I'm talking electronic chips.
Right. I wonder if this is also a consequence of people increasingly moving away from farms,
you know, because when you're on a farm, you'd have to do a lot of hands-on stuff,
you have to do a lot of fence repair, you've got to take care of your own machinery and,
you know, as you move into the urban environment, everything in some sense,
even in the real world, is virtualized because you can always call on other people to do the
day-to-day things that you need to keep the infrastructure in place for example.
A lot of, you know, kids are growing up today totally removed from the practical.
And one of the things I talk about in the visual thinking book is I talked to a doctor
and he told me he had trouble training interns to sew up cuts because the interns had never used
scissors as a young child. I had a student in my class that had never used a tape measure to
measure anything and they're totally removed from the world the practical where those kids
that came off the farms, yes, they had to figure out how to fix things, absolutely.
But I think what's happening now in schools is things are getting so verbal
and they're going absolutely crazy on math requirements because I know people with 20
patents and they could basically do sixth grade arithmetic that I could do because I can relate
that back to real things and things like. Do you know of any research pertaining on how the
more the people who visualize objects might be assessed for their ability?
Yes, and there's a whole chapter in here. There's a whole chapter in here
and I never can pronounce their names right, Blanken, Culver, and I never can say the names
correctly but I have a whole list of references in there where the difference between the object
visualizer and the visual spatial is being assessed and there's a whole bunch of references on that
and I have to look these names up because I can't pronounce them correctly.
Let me find the reference list here for chapter two. Okay, it's Blazhenkova. I've got one, two,
three references in here from Blazhenkova on types of creativity and then the other big
reference. I have lots of references. It would be
Kozhevnikov if she's got trade-offs, object versus spatial visualization,
reviewing the visual verbal dimension, evidence for two types of visualizers, that's another paper,
spatial versus object visualization, a new characterization of visual cognitive style.
That's three papers right there from Kozhevnikov that are in my reference list
and I've got a lot of references where their actual tests were done.
When I go through the citation lists, I just went in and we're working on the children's edition of
the book right now and one of the copy editors had a query about a reference and I had to look
that up and then I decided to just type in object visualizer, visual spatial into Google
Scholar again and find the same old papers and then I found some citations. It's kind of a cool
paper here in the journal Cognition. It's an old paper actually, visual objectability, a new
dimension of non-verbal intelligence. I know from working in factories, I spent 25 years in
heavy construction and that is something that I don't think many teachers have done that and
seen how these guys think. Big complicated Cargill plants, I.B.P. plants which are now Tyson,
Montfort plants, that company is now JBS, figuring out complicated things with equipment.
It's a different type of intelligence and I think it's, when I worked on the book with
Betsy Lerner, my super verbal co-writer who helped me organize things and she had someone come in to
fix a bunch of stuff in her house and after we had discussed this, Betsy was telling me, well,
I watched how he figured out how to fix the stones on the chimney. I had never really thought about
it before but she'd watched how he did things and then she started to understand there's a form of
intelligence there. That's absolutely not verbal. When she watched a person, she hired to fix stuff in
her house. Right, right. Yeah, well you can imagine something and this did pop into my mind visually,
can imagine somebody who's trying to put together a stone chimney has to rotate stones to make sure
that they're going to, like a Tetris game, that's a good way of thinking about it. I was thinking
then again, because I'm thinking in images now that we're talking, I was thinking about my young
grandson, he was only two years old, he had his Legos laid out in front of him and when I was a kid,
I played a lot with Legos and I played a fair bit with this Meccano set that was like a junior
engineering set and it was certainly the case that working with Legos was non-verbal because
you're rotating shapes in space and having them fit into one another towards some design end
and that's a nice kind of hands-on learning and exposure to different mechanical principles and so
do you have recommendations for people who want to help their children train their
visual spatial and object visualization abilities? Let's get them out building things. The big mistake
I see with a lot of kids is they're super good with Legos, they don't think to introduce tools.
I was using tools by second grade, I was not using a saw but I was using hammers,
screwdriver, and pliers. I was taught how to use them safely. I've got another book of children's
projects called Calling All Minds where I describe bird kites that I spent hours with tinkering to
get them to work, to agree with parachutes to get them to open up more easily. Kids today are
totally separated in the world of physical things. They're not getting out and observing
stuff out in nature. This is part of the problem and I just went to veterinary school where the
students are so far removed from practical things that to give them dexterity skills
and surgical skills they have these plastic tote boxes and they put children's puzzles inside them
and they've got to just reach in and by feel put these children's puzzles together
because when they were in kindergarten they never did this. Right, right, right. Yeah well my parents
told me that when I was four my favorite toy was a screwdriver and that I used to take all the
cupboard doors off the cupboards in the kitchens and so I was introduced to tools at a very early
age and that there's a real practical utility in that too because now if I visualize a project
in my house shelving or something like that or any construction project of any sort well I can
visualize the array of tools that's necessary to make that come about and then I have the tools at
hand and I know how to use them and that is a well it's also I really find that kind of work
calming and and and engrossing.
We'll be back in one moment first we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary
Logos in Literacy.
I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jumpstarted the development
of literacy across the entire world.
Illiteracy was the norm the pastor's home was the first school and every morning it would begin with
singing. The Christian faith is a singing religion probably 80 percent of scripture memorization
today exists only because of what is sung. This is amazing here we have a Gutenberg Bible
printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg. Science and religion are opposing forces in the world
but historically that has not been the case. Now the book is available to everyone from Shakespeare
to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself. It is the most influential
book in all of history and hopefully people can walk away with at least a sense of that.
Well the problem is is we got kids growing up today totally removed from the world of the
practical. They don't use tools they don't use scissors. I had a student in a class who had
never used a ruler or tape measure to measure anything ever. I think that's a problem because
if you haven't done practical things then you don't understand how to fix things.
Okay like two years ago they had the horrible mess with a power you know like a bunch of
different power stations froze. Well I never heard so much abstract gubbledygook about that
because the way I would work on fixing it would be all right let's look at each power station
what piece of equipment actually froze. I never saw anything written in the press that described
okay what froze in this plant what frozen this plant because my inclination would be to kind of
rank them on okay a turbine haul it froze I can build a building over it that's an easy one
you know a whole bunch of gas wells froze that's going to be like really difficult to fix
but you see nothing's abstract because okay if I'm going to try to figure out how to fix it
I don't really want to argue who owns them I'm not interested in the politics I would just rank
the power stations on expansiveness and difficulty to winterize and say exactly what piece of equipment
froze and you know how I can find out you let me loosen there away from the managers I'll find
the maintenance shop they'll show me everything and I know enough about equipment that they can't
BS me. Right so maybe part of the advantage to that more visual form of processing is also its
association with that kind of practical particularization that's right that's right now on the other hand
on the other hand I have no idea how to balance a power grid that's a job for the mathematicians
you see this is where we need to work together and and in a complementary factor in a complementary
way and I tell people in big corporations I've done a lot of talks for businesses your first step
is that you've got to recognize different kinds of thinking exists and let's let's take another
example recently I visited two really nice dairies up in Quebec Canada that have the robotic
milking machines where the cow can go in she decides when she wants to get milk and get fed
and on both dairies it actually made some good mechanical modifications on that equipment
which the equipment company finally adopted but one of the dairy producers said to me I stop it
like a computer stuff I don't mess with the program that's somebody else's job to work on the software
but the mechanical parts of the device they figured out ways to improve it
yeah it's like a it's like a hierarchy man you can imagine a hierarchy of generalization
with the highest resolution lowest level being the particulars of a given machine then you can
imagine people specialized to operate at different levels of the hierarchy maybe the verbal types are
operating at the highest level of abstraction but they lose that particularization that's right
that's basically right because the verbalizer tends to over generalize one of the papers that
are reviewed in my book on visual thinking was an interesting study where on high school students
that came life for school specializing in the arts another school specializing in the sciences
and another one especially in the humanities which would be more verbal on those teams of students
and their assignment was to create a new planet so the art students heavily visualizing they made
a planet with crystals on it another one made a skyscraper planet and then the more mathematical
science students just painted a round made a round ball and described the gravity and the
atmosphere you know kind of boring pictures and the verbal thinkers started write it down
and then they go oh wait a minute we're supposed to draw the planet so they made kind of splotch
stuff on it but the thing that was interesting is that the art minds more my kind of mind
and the mathematical minds they had big planning sessions on how to design their planet where the
verbal thinkers um they didn't do any planning you see this is the problem the verbal thinker would
get big broad concepts or something we need to do right but how do you actually implement those
concepts yeah right there's no detail there now in food safety we have a a thing that i really
like it's called hazard analysis critical control points so let's say i'm out there in a sea of
things i can do well i can't do all that stuff see now the critical control point let's say in food
safety in a food factory i can't measure microbes and bacteria on everything in that plant i have to
pick out the places where i'm most likely to have contamination that would be the critical control
points and one of them is doorknobs yeah that's why some places food factories have automatic doors
because that gets rid of touching the door yeah well one of one of the things that i always found
a relief in working with engineers is that they were good and i can see it in the terms
that you're describing they were very good at rank ordering practical priorities right and that
that seems to be part of this particularization so i have this company it's a software company
that sells personality tests and uh and writing programs for people to help them plan their lives
and my business partners and engineer and although he's also very intelligent verbally he's more
intelligent non-verbally and he knows the systems right from the from the code upward
at every level of their machine instantiation and so the huge advantage to that is that if
anything ever goes wrong he knows exactly what goes wrong and he knows exactly how to fix it
it's particularized down to the point where that makes action possible and that's part of the problem
with the with the verbal abstraction is that it makes sense conceptually but that doesn't mean that
it's detailed to the point where it's actually implementable and then it it's like a pseudo
knowledge right because it sounds like you've got the picture right but when you actually try to
implement it you find out that that that it's really a hollow a hollow shell of conceptualization
i kind of look at like um this is why when i learned about the food safety concept of
hazard analysis critical control points or let's just call it critical control points so i've got a
big uh sea of stuff out there what's the really important thing okay now i i only think in specific
examples so let's take frozen texas power stations the critical control point is and i want it like
in two sentences what great piece of equipment froze and then you can very easily figure out the
ones that'll be easy to winterize and i've actually talked to somebody who installs gas wells and i
only cost five thousand dollars to winterize a well when you build it to retrofit complete mess
he also said you have to have someone who knows how to turn the valves he said that's me right on the
i call him the guy in the pickup and that person in that pickup truck is not getting enough credit
he knows how to turn those valves right yeah so if you conceptualize that verbally you end up saying
something like a bad winter storm took out the texas power grid and that sort of sounds like you've
said something but it's nothing like saying well the grid is made out of 200 different uh like
industrial assemblies each of those is made of a variety of parts that's differentially susceptible
to winter all right well that's still gobbledygook because first of all they wouldn't have 200
separate power stations you know it's more like 10 something like that and and i would just let
i listen well write down the name of the station because i don't really care who owns it and what
we used to do with meat packing plants when we were doing welfare audits is we'd always call them by
their town names because you're auditing that particular plant next i well this power station
had a frozen turbine hall that's an easy one to fix and then there was a coal fire that froze well
that they freeze up the where you have a cold dump sand that's probably really easy to fix and if
um you know 50 gas wells froze up the feet of plant that's going to be a mess to fix
um but you see as i talk about these things i see it and i happen to know what some of the
equipment looks like you see that also makes me a better troubleshooter you know if i know what
stuff looks like you see this is where you've got to put things in my database but i but i work 25
years out in factories on heavy construction stuff so i know what a lot of stuff looks like right so
so it means in some sense that to solve the problem is you take the verbal representation so
the verbal representation is a storm took out the texas power grid and then you say well there's
10 key components to that okay our grid so that differentiates that and then you say in each of
the 10 systems there are critically vulnerable points that are specifically sensitive to cold
weather we need to differentiate and find out what those key ones are then we have to differentiate
that further you say now okay now when i first started my work there was no google earth well
the first thing i do probably google earth and street view the power stations and the other thing
i've learned if i want to get accurate information i don't you don't talk to the managers you got
to get down in the shop and and then the shop guys have to be not worried about getting fired
that's another right right nasty issue that i'm going to have to deal with
but you know let's say i get three shop guys together and we have okay my industry say when we
get rid of all the suits you know that's going to be the managers and the verbal thinkers
they won't talk in front of suits they're afraid they're going to lose their jobs you know and this
is something i know from all the years i've worked in this stuff and then they'll take you out there
and show you what froze and then oh there's creative things i've talked to a guy who worked
at a power plant and there was this one sensor very important electronic sensor and it gets cold
and when it got cold you put plastic garbage bags over it and i'm going right well i think we need
to have something a little more permanent to keep that sensor warm than black plastic garbage
bags that's what i told them yeah so so that that issue that the the guys with the hands-on
knowledge have to worry about being fired is interesting too because it seems like so they
have this extremely detailed knowledge that's practical about how these systems operate and
what happens is if they bring that knowledge up the abstraction hierarchy what they're doing in
some sense is is pointing out the manner in which their superiors their hypothetical
well that's the problem and a very big problem i've had is um i they're they're worried about
losing their jobs yeah and and but you really want to solve the problem they need to be able to
talk to you freely because they're the ones that tell you exactly what froze right well the question
is why would their attempts to bring their practical reality to bear as they move information up the
information hierarchy why would that threaten people to the point where
they would be intimidated in relationship to their job i mean why is there this gap the
psychological gap between the practical and the abstract i mean you'd think that the managers would
be calling on these people all the time you got to drag those suits out of the office too
just when things are working normally and i'm so they get a better understanding of what the
practical people are doing now my animal welfare work on one of the things where i made some of
the biggest difference in animal welfare work is auditing programs i helped develop with mcdonald's
wendysen burger king back over 20 years ago and in this situation we were taking vice president
level managers out to the plant and they'd have these undercover boss moments just like that show
i'll never forget the day when the mcdonald's vice president saw a half-dead dairy cow go into
their product and he goes yeah we got some things here we have to fix you see before it was all an
abstraction spreadsheets numbers okay animal welfare give it to lawyers give it to the public
relations department but when they came out of the office and they saw something bad now it was real
now they had to act it was no longer abstract anymore there seems to be a kind of pride in that
abstraction in some sense i mean i've also noticed that highly intellectual people and maybe those
are ones who think primarily in words tend to be rather dismissive of the intelligence of more
practical people like working people and that's i come from a working class environment so
although i've hung around verbal people most of my life so i can see that dichotomy do you have any
sense of why it is that the more abstract thinkers are have a well they have a contemptuous
well because they used to say okay the kids that are like failing in high school stupid kids go and
shop well i can tell you right now right exactly i work big metal fabrication companies owned by
these so-called stupid people and what they they were inventing equipment they had 20 patents and
they were very proud of their patents and one of them made posters out of them put them up all over
his place it's a different kind of intelligence and and it's not you know there's things they
can do that the verbal thinkers can't do and what i what i'm really interested in is we need
all the different kinds of minds because one of the problems with my kind of thinker since i'm
associative is the point in a company let's say i had a metal fabrication shop i'd have to hire a
verbal thinker just to run the business the payroll ordering materials things all of that part of it
do you think it's a competition do you think it's a competition for status between different forms
of neurodiversity i mean if i can claim that my intelligence is paramount that that increases
my social status in some sense right you can imagine there's a competition for that broadly
going on in society what i have found is when you got the verbal thinkers out in the field
their eyes got opened that the important thing is you got to drag the suits out of the office
i've done a whole lot of that and let me tell you they changed
okay i've done a lot of work on supply chain management and when there's supply chain disasters
like a factory burning up and a clothing industry is disgusting industry they need to clean up a lot
of stuff and a factory burns up a hundred people selling blue jeans well the suits didn't get out
of the office and see what was going on in these factories until there was a disaster the one they
should have been preventing a disaster like that right well yeah so once you build up hierarchical
organizations it's very easy for the people who are operating near the top of the abstraction
chain not to pay attention to the details and hopefully the details are working out so well
that you don't have to pay attention to them i mean that's in some sense the point of building a
hierarchical organization but but what you need to do obviously the manager can't be you know doing
every job out there in a plant but they need to have enough contact with the field and i'm
going to use the field be like the factory floor farming you know waterworks any of these kind of
things so they they understand the different there can be things bad going on but i tell business
managers and i've talked to many big corporations computer companies steel companies on pharmaceutical
companies that the first step is realizing that different kinds of thinking exist and that they
can work together in complementary ways and you actually need the whole team you need the whole
team because we're kind of disorganized and associational and i'm going to need a verbal
thinker if i got a really big business to um you know keep the business going
so what do you think what do you think of the suppositions and you talk about them a bit in
your book that the visual versus verbal modes of cognition map to some degree on to hemispheric
specialization well the right is more oriented towards your kind the right hemisphere is more
oriented broadly speaking towards speaking broadly speaking that dominates your mind yeah but broadly
speaking that's true you know they're accept their exceptions to some of that that stuff but i'm
the thing that i want to talk about is is right now i'm seeing too many kids that are dyslexic
autistic um or whatever i'm i'm ending up playing video games on on a disability check
when they could be photographers well i got four person crew here right now doing this filming
and that's an interesting career or they could be designing mechanical equipment
and they never get an opportunity to do photography aren't or mechanical equipment
because they kind of look at these stupid kids right right okay so there's a privileging of
this semantic and that's partly because it's cheaper it's easier it's detached from the
world in some sense how do you think we should redesign schools for say kindergarten kids and
elementary kids in some practical way you tend to think practically what do what do you think
would be a good start well like in the 50s when i went to school we had all kinds of craft projects
i was learning to use little blunt scissors probably in first grade i'd be putting all the
hands-on classes back into schools and that's going to include theater music cooking selling
when i went to elementary school i loved art sewing and woodworking and if i hadn't had those
classes i would have hated elementary school and i loved sewing and i'm what i was in fourth grade
i had a singer sew handy a toy sewing machine that actually sewed and it was one of my favorite
things because i could make things with it kids are not doing enough of that kind of stuff today
right okay so there's a return to the there's there's a need for a return to the practical
on in some sense on both sides of the gender spectrum with everybody on every one showing
with and i would now i went when i was doing a book signing for visual thinking i went to um
on a physics lab in harvard this room's labeled physics lab and they had all kinds of 3d printers
in there but they also had a sewing machine and they also had a station for crocheting
this is the building labeled engineering department at harvard maybe they're realizing
they've got to get them doing some hands-on things this is when i did the book signing for this
it was part of the book tour the other thing i've noticed i stayed i i got into some interesting
places i stayed at this hotel where um where they is in evansville illinois where they had uh
textbooks in the rooms from the 1930s i wish i'd had more time to look at it and i pulled out an
electrical engineering book and it had a lot of math in it but it was much more applied they'd
say well this is how this is the generator works this is the math that goes well but it would describe
how the generator actually worked it was much more applied and i now the physiology book that i had
in the 70s you know explain how the kidney works how the heart works and then explain the chemistry
now i look at a physiology book and it's much more verbal a lot more math and chemistry
but how does the kidney actually work i still have my old dukes physiology of domestic animals from
1970 and i want to go back and compare that to the dukes physiology now and and it's like we're
taking the practical out i just got an email yesterday uh from the uk that they wanted to
take a technology and design course out of high school you see i think this what's happening now
is mathematics is totally taking over yes we need mathematics because my kind of mind is not going to
touch boilers and refrigeration in that food processing plant that's a job for the mathematicians
but what we're losing is the object visualizer right right right you know well i wonder i wonder
too if part of this is the fact that you know for a long time in our society a lot of this
practical machinery just worked and so we could afford to ignore it in some abstract sense right
because our cars worked and our power grids worked and we could take all of this low level
infrastructure for granted now that meant there were a lot of people on the shop floors who were
busily working making sure it worked but it did mean that we had the luxury to engage in abstract
specialization and maybe we could fall prey to the psychological tendency to just dismiss all that
well you see when they first started about 20 years ago is when they started taking
shop classes out of the schools well you can get away with that for a while and then the people i
worked with on gray now are retiring they're retiring out and they're not getting replaced
that's happening with elevator and escalator mechanics that's happening with airplane mechanics
and i'm seeing that more and more and more and more as i travel these are free things
that i see all the time and they are getting gray
right right so yeah the retirement problem is going to be the retirement although there's
when it comes to industry there's two gigantic mistakes that were made
shutting down in-house engineering shops 20 years ago we had a huge metal working shop
called the montford fab shop and it was part of the engineering of a company called mom first they
no longer exist now well that's been shut down and then at the same time we took out shop classes
now in the short run it was cheaper for these companies to just farm out engineering work they
needed to do in their plan yeah that works fine until the shops retire out and now what's happened
like i can't go in the name give you the name of the company but i have a client right now
where the one shop that's left is ripping people off at five times the price
and that's happening right right do you see any positive consequences of computer technology
for object visualizers and for the for the people who are working more in the visual spatial end of
things well it's definitely useful to you know like the visualization and stuff you can do on
computers but that doesn't replace real things let me tell you power grid i lay awake at night
about that and that's so fragile that i'm not i'm not going to go into any detail because it's too
fragile and i'm not going to discuss the things that i visualize and lay awake at night about the
power grid because it's just okay um okay i'm curious about that why not discuss them because
i don't want to give i don't want to give people that have bad intentions any information on how
to hurt the power grid okay okay okay i see i see that is the reason right because it's very easy
so when you and i don't want to give out any information that would help somebody damage
the power grid so i don't discuss the details here but i'm seeing them right now right right right
yeah well that's part of that ability to think about critical points of failure well there's
i know exactly i'm engineering mind i know where the critical points of failure are and i'm not
going to discuss them right right so we can all be thankful that you're not a terrorist
yeah i'll be thankful i'm not a criminal yes exactly exactly yeah well i've always often
been afraid when thinking along the same lines that you're describing of just exactly how fragile
things are in that regard and how much someone with a good imagination how much damage they
could do if they targeted things properly it is really quite frightening to apprehend well that's
why there's certain things about the power grid i am not going to discuss and i'm seeing three big
fat critical control points right now i'm seeing them in my mind and they make me cringe right
so so can we talk a little bit about the specifics of your work i remember one of the stories you
told at this Tucson conference was about you you talked about cows that they would do such
things as go into a field and look at if you look left a briefcase on the field for example the
cows would eventually come and look at it yeah that's right a cows in a in a line might be stopped
by something like a coke bottle in their path and so you used your ability to think like animals
to design systems for animal handling that were much more humane so could you walk us through
that a little bit well the first work i did with cattle was in the 70s in Arizona i when i didn't
even know that i had was a visual thinker and other people were not a visual thinker and i noticed
that if there was a coat hung on the fence the cattle would stop um if there was a shadow or
reflection off a vehicle so i got down in the shoots to see what they were seeing and i would
take pictures down inside the chute and people thought that was kind of crazy but now i'm i'm
like right just recently did start up at a really big plant and at 10 o'clock in the morning
everything was working fine and then at three o'clock in the afternoon a big shadow appeared i
called the spider monster and it was just a shadow and these cattle decided they weren't going to walk
over that so they'll have to build a roof over the facility so that the cattle can't see the
spider monster uh the other thing i'm i show i show people how to do is watch your lead animal
your lead animal will come up and stop and look at the thing they don't like the same plant
on the night shift okay the shadow monster wouldn't be there they they the guy calls me and he goes
they go halfway up the chute and stop all right what do i do i said now bring up a nice calm bunch
of cattle watch your leader really carefully he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like
and there was an LED light on the corner of a building and they took that down
and then everything worked fine how do you identify the leader
well there's always a leader when when all right let's say i take a 20 head of cattle out of a pan
there's a lead animal that walks out first usually one of the more bold animals not the
dominant animal the dominant animal that pushes the others away from the feed trough he's in the
middle of the herd or she's in the middle of the herd but the leader will come out of the pen first
and the other cattle follow and it's just the first animal in the group's a leader it's that simple
you see as we're talking about that i'm seeing it okay so so is that leader stable across instances
of leadership and is that associated with this ability to find what's anomalous and to deal with
well the in cattle that have lived together for a while tend to stay in the same order you know
years ago when your tags came out that were sequentially numbered in other words you could
just buy a package of ear tags labeled one through 200 and they put them on their cattle
and one of the things that surprised ranchers when maybe 200 cattle came back the following year
to go through the shoots to get vaccinated and they were coming through in almost the same order
you know that's a group of cattle that lived together okay is there something okay so you
made the observation that the lead animal will stop and look at the thing that he doesn't like
and so are the other animals and but it also that lead animal wasn't the physically dominant
animal he's got some other characteristics the animal is dominant at the pushing others away
from the water trough or the feed trough but the but once the lead animal walks the other
cattle usually will follow same thing was shaped the other animals will usually follow right so you
remove the distractions that the lead animals reacting to and and at this particular plant
we had two things we had to get rid of we had to get rid of the shadow the spider monster shadow
and we had to get rid of an led light that was on the corner of a building
so do you have any sense on of why the other animals come to rely on the lead animal like
what's the lead animal being selected for or is it just a first mover well what's the nature of
this lead animal you see there's different levels of fear in animals genetically some animals are
more bold other animals are more shy or you can call those high and low fear and the animal that's
more bold is more likely to be the leader than the animal that's more anxious and and and you know
if you know a bunch of cattle that have lived together all the time you know that there'll be
certain animals that tend to be the leaders and then you've got the big one with the giant horns
and she shoves everybody else away from the feed trough there's something that's very profound about
that because you're laying out the fact that it isn't the dominant animal that leads no and that
it's the animal that's exploratory and that's right somewhat willing to take risks that that's
right but also absolutely right also that the that the lead animal will spot anomaly right like the
spider monster that you're describing and so it's not like they're they're so bold that they're
completely without fear they're still acting cautiously in some sense all right so you can
walk the lead animal down a chute and you can see what it's going to see and you can actually do that
because you go down there and do it but you also think that way you got to bring your cat up really
calmly to see because if you bring him up at a run then the leader just turns back and you don't
know what it's reacting to oh yeah i said to him now bring him up nice and calm watch the leader
come up the chute and when he stops he'll look right at the thing he doesn't like and he looked
at the led light on the corner of the building then they texted me a picture of it and they got rid
of that and that fixed the problem now have you have you have you developed some sort of picture
of the class of things that stop cat yes yes i have the spider mode okay so tell me what sort of
things tend to stop cattle i have pictures i have checklists of things to look for reflections on
water uh at this particular plant there was a gate handle a gate handle that jiggled and it was right
by the chute entrance i said that needs to be fixed so this gate handle doesn't vibrate
so what's common do you what's common about the things that stop cattle in their tracks or
can you extract out let's look at let's look at cattle's a prey species animal so you're looking for
things that might be a danger some little little bits of rapid movement set them off
and and something that's sort of like shouldn't be there like you can put a white plastic bottle
in the entrance of the chute now about shut a meat plant down
i they'll just keep turning back away from it turning back away from it right so they're looking
for something that doesn't fit the environmental pattern and that's probably doing something like
activating predator detection well that's right it's like that you know they they're looking for
stuff that uh you know a movement in the bushes maybe that's a mountain lion or a wolf
some little movement in the bushes the other thing about new experiences if you take something
like camera equipment cattle love camera equipment you put an expensive camera in the middle of the
pasture they will come up and knock it over and lick it to death that's what they will do
see things that are novel are attractive when the animal can voluntarily approach and scary if
you suddenly shove it in their face you suddenly shove it in their face then it's scary
right and so the best way that's a you introduce new things to cattle is to let them voluntarily
approach it i don't know how many times people say to me my horse was fine at home he went crazy at
the show well you've got a lot of novel stuff they're like flags for example so you better get
your horse used to flags before you go there and the best way to get him used to flags would be to
decorate the pasture with flags and let your animal walk up and voluntarily approach them
right right well you know that's exactly what you do in psychotherapy when you're trying to help
people overcome a phobia right so if someone's afraid of an elevator and won't get in it that
often happens with agoraphobia what you do is you say to them okay um let's start by imagining
elevators so that's going to make you a bit nervous but imagine an elevator at some distance
that doesn't make you uncomfortable okay okay and then you say okay well now you've done that
see if you can move yourself in your mind closer to the elevator door and then you keep doing that
but it has to be voluntary it's 100 percent absolutely necessary for it to be okay so maybe
you run them through this imaginal exposure therapy and then you say okay for our next
session what we're going to do is we're going to go out in the hallway you know that elevator you
wouldn't take we're going to go out the hallway we're going to stand 200 feet away from the elevator
and you're just going to look at it if you can't and so they'll do that has to be voluntary and then
you can get them 150 feet away and 100 feet away and soon they'll be right up to the elevator door
I was very anxious I you know in my 20s and I got terrified of airplanes because I was an
extremely scary emergency landing when I was a senior in high school they put the slides down
and the whole thing very very scary and one of the ways I got over that is I had to make aviation
interesting and when I got the ride in the cockpit of a plane flying on Holstein Heffers to Puerto
Rico that made it interesting you make something scary interesting because I know another thing
they do on the elevator phobias is they show them how the safety mechanisms work that the
elevator is not going to fall down the shaft yeah well you you know you even compel that interest
to some degree so for example one once you get a phobic person inside an elevator what they'll
tend to do is look at their feet and so you say to them look quit looking at your feet look at each
corner of the elevator look at all the numbers look at the display panel like you have to facilitate
their voluntary visual exploration okay and to some degree what you're doing is you're calling out
their interest to say attend to all of these things as if they're interesting and then
that's how they familiarize themselves with the elevator and they also note that well they're in
there because you have to look at the elevator to know you're in an elevator right literally you
have to move your eyes and point at all the different parts of the elevator and the more
that you can help people do that at a high level of detailed resolution voluntarily the more likely
they are not not only to become less afraid of the elevator is that that actually isn't what happens
is you actually train them in a form of exploratory bravery because what you teach them is that if they
use their eyes voluntarily to scan what they're afraid of they'll become braver and then that
generalizes to all sorts of other instances too so if you train someone to be less afraid of an
elevator they're much less afraid of other things as well well that's right and the thing that we're
seeing I'm seeing now in dogs you know we have very strict lease laws here and there's more problems
with dogs being afraid of the veterinarian because they haven't been out experiencing enough stuff
like strange people touching them for example just going to lots of different places you know
this is the reason why when they train service dog puppies you take them everywhere so that
there's almost nothing that will frighten them yes yeah well that that that's the same argument
you were making earlier about the fact that to train people practically we have to put them in a
lot of different practical hands-on situations and so that they can generalize across all those
instances and so experience that's too narrow is too is too restrictive well when I get worried
that we're going to have people making policy on all kinds of important stuff on when they're so far
removed from the world of the practical you see we need to have both because all the problem with
us practical people is we're not organized enough that's where just about every tech company has to
hire a suit eventually just to keep the company organized somebody's got to pay the payroll somebody's
got to pay the taxes somebody has to make sure the rent is paid you know if they need more office
space then they've got to go out and go shopping for office space you know they there's uh and we
really do need all the different kinds of minds well when I look at the ideological solutions
that are being put forward to the world's problems continually I do wonder the same thing you're
wondering about which is is this empty ideological representation a consequence of the fact that
the people who are doing this have no practical experience at all it's like they're not thinking
at the level of detail well I think that it's a problem because when I worked originally this is
over 20 years ago with McDonald's Burger King and Wendy's and they took them the top managers
out into the field and implemented the auditing program it was interesting to see how the animal
welfare uh issue went from an abstraction give it to legal give it to public relations
to something real that they really needed to address you know half dead animals going into your
products not okay right right right uh broken stunning equipment is totally terrible and not
okay and that's mainly a management problem and failure to do maintenance and and I and and and
when I worked on that 1999 I got five journal articles published on this and I saw more change
than I'd seen in and in my whole career when these big companies were inspecting these plants but
I figured out a very simple scoring system if you couldn't shoot 95 of those cattle dead on the first
shot you failed the McDonald's audit it was that simple some very simple critical control points
if you had more than three percent of your cattle beller in their heads off when you're handling
you failed the McDonald's audit okay so why why why did that turn out to be the critical issue
well the broken stunts were a big issue now on the handling I figured out a way to score that
that's very simple vocalization if you're poking cattle with too many electric prods or you're
slamming doors on them or whatever they're going to be beller in their heads off and I better not
hear any beller in coming out of the place where they kill them right here beller in coming out of
there somebody needs to get kicked off the approved supplier list it's that simple that's one of the
critical control right so you used so you used animal distress as an indication of that's right
efficiency of process okay can you can you walk us through some of your designs I mean you designed
these these circular cattle enclosures as well to calm them down the circular designs are really
nice but I'm also very proud of the fact there were 75 plants on the McDonald's approved supplier list
only three had to buy fancy expensive equipment everybody else we fixed with management yeah
three managers had to be removed I call that managerectomy a lot of non-slip flooring had to
go in because one of the things we measure is slipping and falling and lighting cattle are
scared of the dark training people to move smaller groups of animals and and put a solid
side up so they don't see the vehicles passing by and these very simple changes we were able to
fix some of the older places and I'm very I used all my design ability to figure out how to make
some of the older facilities work even though they did not have the fancy new equipment and then
we had three plants only three plants had to do a front-end remodel that was very very expensive
that's three out of 75 I'm really proud of that oh yeah that's all the big pork yeah yeah plants in
the US right so so tell me tell me tell me what your goals were okay so let's walk this through
at the level of detail so why don't you tell people about how these cattle handling plants
work broadly speaking from from the time the cattle arrived till the time they're processed let's say
and then how were you brought in to fix them well unloading a truck make sure you have a non-slip
unloading ramp open the gates up let them out you do not need to scream at them pound on the vehicle
or stick electric prads into through the holes in the side of the truck so let the cattle just get
off and they will and then they should walk quietly out of the truck if they got a scale
weigh them on a scale and then quietly walk into a holding pen get a drink of water maybe lay down
then when it's time to go up to the plant somebody should come down bring a group of 20 out
not a group of 50 and you quietly walk them up the alley to where they get to where the round
crowd pen is and the whole thing should be a calm walk without slipping and falling and without
moving and bellowing and and almost no electric prads that and it should all be very calm walking
is what it should be right and and how many plants did you go analyze we we had 75 plants on the
on the approved supplier list and only three of them had to have extensive renovations but we did
have three plants where the plant manager had to be removed right and so in those cases yeah why did
you remove the managers well the ones where we're able to get rid of the plant manager were the
corporate ones on the plant then we had one plant we used to call the problem child and
manager was family and we couldn't get rid of it and that plant would like you know fail on
audit and then pass an audit and but management has to decide that they're going to do things right
you can have the best equipment and it's not going to work if it's not managed in fact before we
started these audits i had a lot of equipment out in the field lots of equipment half my clients
tore it up and wrecked it and one the what the customer inspections and audits did is force
the plant to manage the stuff they had either brand new fancy stuff or older stuff and so
how broadly did your innovation spread and how rapidly and what were the consequences of that
for the meat handling industry in general well the auditing program was within six months as in
the year of 1999 was adopted by mcdonald's wendys and burger king and that covers just about all
the big beef plants and i saw more improvement than i'd seen in a 25-year career prior to that
people were no longer using broken equipment they were moving smaller groups of animals
things were kept repaired and um and employees were better supervised and boy it made a big difference
so why do you think you were able to do this i mean you obviously can solve the problem
practically but how are you able to um make your way in the corporate world in a manner that
actually resulted a in people listening to you and b in changes actually being made because
that's that's quite a remarkable combination of unlikely achievements all right let's start off
i started out with equipment this was in my 20s and i found that selling equipment was much easier
than getting people to manage equipment correctly and early in my career i made the mistake that a
lot of young engineers make i thought i could make a self managing cattle handling facility
that is bs and i got a lot of systems out there the other thing that helped me to get systems out
into the industry is i wrote about them and i wrote about them in the meat industry and cattle
industry trade press wrote all kinds of articles just about how to do it so now i had a lot of
equipment out there center track restrainer and lots and lots of these big plants had one it's a
piece of equipment i developed with the guys in the shops that i've talked to you about earlier
but half my clients tore it up and wrecked it then i worked with a lady named janet riley at the
american meat institute and i came up with this very very simple scoring system for evaluating
meat packing plants and we wrote it up in our guidelines nobody used it for two years then
mcdonald's approached me to implement their animal welfare auditing program and it started out
taking vice president level managers out of the office they saw some bad stuff and it started out
as a little training program they already had food safety auditors in the plants auditing
that was already being done and so i took the trains of food safety auditors to do the animal
welfare audit and within six months i saw more change that i had seen in my whole career prior
of that then wendy's got on board then burger king got on board and i made sure that everybody
used the exact same score so it was absolutely clear it was like traffic rules you know you know
they measure speeding we measured how many vocalizations the cattle did we measured how
many animals fell down those things were measured and the plants had to make certain numbers it was
absolutely clear there were five critical control points and they had to do all five of them to pass
the audit i kind of sometimes can't believe i pulled it off it worked me on my wildest dreams
but it was absolutely practical right right yeah well it did it is it is quite a remarkable thing
to pull off to to be able to make that kind of change in the corporate world so quickly that's
that's really quite remarkable the other reason i was able to make change i i practiced reverse
conflict of interest i had a lot of expensive equipment already out in the plants i've been
over backwards in the older facilities to figure out how to make that older facility work without
buying expensive equipment let me tell you non-slip flooring it can work wonders you know we did quite
a lot of that right but that's not that's not expensive equipment and i'm really proud of the
fact that i took some of the older facilities and we made them work and then we did have three
only three out of 75 plants that had to build an expensive front-end remodel and that was very
expensive so what would you say if if you had to put it into a few phrases you you weren't obviously
pursuing mere narrow profit at that time not there's anything wrong with profit you you were
serving some other goal i was serving the goal of improving animal welfare and i've been over
backwards to do reverse conflict of interest and i tried to take some of those older facilities
some of them a bit shabby and make them work with simple changes like repairs non-slip flooring
changing the lighting and three plants had to have the plant manager removed and that's right so
what why were you why were you so concerned with animal welfare and how would you define animal
welfare why did that become paramount in your in your hierarchy of goals well one of the reasons
why i started working on the equipment is like the way cattle were being handled was horrible
you know electric prods on 100 i'm falling down crashing into things people screaming at them
cattle handling in the 80s was terrible absolutely terrible and i i saw that as a something that i
could fix now i talked to a lot of young people today that want to you know do activism about
some specific thing and it's way too broad i want justice in the world for example right yes yes
might be something they would say yes yes and i say why don't you do something more targeted
like using dna to show that this prisoner was falsely accused you see now that's something a
lot more targeted that you can actually do yes absolutely and i think that is a huge problem
with the way that kids are trained morally in universities is that that grandiose vague
activism replaces the actual practicalities of problem solving that you're describing that
actually make a difference why do you think it was that animal suffering stood out for you is it
is it partly because you you can think like animals like what why do you think well you would
how would you like to get shocked to electric prods and be slipping and falling and crashing
and defenses and things like that you'd be terrified and and my goal was to improve how
the cattle were treated when i talked to students about you know activism i said what i worked on
wasn't everything bad happening to animals i worked on something targeted the thing that i'm
seeing now with young people that want to make a difference they say i want to have justice in
the world or i want to like animals are treated terrible we got to do something about it and i'm
saying you're going to be more effective if you pick out something relatively targeted i worked
on cattle handling to start with that's not everything to do with animals yes exactly or the
example of using dna to show that this criminal was innocent that's something much more doable and
targeted that you can actually do right so how was it that the suffering of animals in meat
tracking in meat packing plants came to your attention to begin with so you said the suffering
you found that unbearable first of all it started out when i went out to the feed yards handling cattle
back in the 70s there's a lot of really horrible cattle handling and i i made a mistake in the
beginning that a lot of young engineers make they think technology can solve all their problems
and i mistakenly believed that i could build a self managing cattle handling facility that's
nonsense i know that now that's nonsense good equipment makes good handling better but it
doesn't replace management and what the auditing program did is it forced people to manage the
facilities and why why were you at the cattle handling facilities to begin with i mean what was
this part of your academic training or was this part of the fact that you'd grown up on a farm
well i got interested in got to going out to my aunt's ranch and this brings up the other things
students get interested in stuff they get exposed to it's that simple in in one of the people i
profiled in visual thinking was michael angelo grubby little 12 year old dropped out of school
but he was running around in all the churches seeing great art and he grew up with stone cutting
tools okay that's the exposure then he started making some stuff and then an artist took him in
as an apprentice that's mentoring good careers start first with exposure and the other reason
why i'm so concerned about taking all the hands-on stuff out of the schools is those things like
let's say theater for example exposed students i didn't care about being in the play but i loved
making scene rate and costumes that i love to do now that's something that can become a career
so let me we're running out of time on this segment let me ask you one more question and
then maybe i'll sum up our discussion for everybody or try to extract out the gist you think primarily
in pictures but you're also an extremely effective verbal communicator i mean you've written a number
of books you can obviously talk your way into corporate environments and help people walk through
the complex process of restructuring say animal handling on a pretty much on a national scale
how did you how do you think you've been able to develop your verbal ability like
what what did you do to manage that all right it goes back to when i was seven years old
in my neighborhood all the kids when they were seven when the parents had a party you had to
put your good clothes on greet the guests and serve the snacks be little hosts and hostesses
that's what you had to do i sold candy for charity that helped me on talking to people
the other thing i figured out very early on is back doors into jobs and most people don't see this
in the hbo movie temple grand and there's a scene where i go up to the editor of our state farm
magazine and i get his card because i knew if i wrote for that magazine that would help my career
that's a back door writing i did a lot of writing there's how to handle cattle how to design facilities
and i was so happy when one of my very early articles got picked up by two other magazines
you know it had made the national scene of course this is all you know pre-internet and then that
press pass got me into all kinds of meetings that helped me to get into my self-made internship
with a swift plant i've recognized the back doors most people don't recognize the back doors
but lots of good jobs are gotten through the back door
right so you allied your ability to concentrate on focal details practically with the ability
and the willingness to communicate on at all sorts of different levels verbally
you were able to bring both that's getting too abstract for me i just go okay i got the card
within a week i i may i had done a master's thesis on cattle behavior in different types of
squeeze shoots and i i sent them a good article and they published it then i went back to them and
said maybe i could just write something for you every month i just walked into the office and
asked that job so i did that as a volunteer for about three or four months and then they started
paying me i wasn't shy to walk up and ask right right so so you developed a communication
expertise and a communication network at the same time that you were trying to implement
your practical solutions and both of those facilitated each other well in the very beginning
i wasn't even designing facilities and then i was just visiting all these feed yards and writing for
the magazine and that press pass got me into all kinds of places i recognized the value of that
press pass it got me into meetings in the 70s with $600 registration fees i was no way i could
have afforded that this is 70s right right right so what what are you working on now you finished
this this new book that came out in 2022 what are you doing now well i'm very interested in seeing
the kids who think differently get into good careers and that's going to be a major emphasis of
the things that i do now be a lot of speaking engagements a lot of you know interviews like
this because i want to see those kids that are different get into good jobs okay if they're
visual object visualizer like me maybe an art job maybe a photography job or a job building things
if they're the more mathematical visual spatial a good programming job a good um uh mathematics
or chemistry job where you need the mathematics there's too many kids that think differently
um some of them are just kind of going nowhere i want to see them get into good careers and do
things that will be constructive in the world do something constructive
so we're we're going to switch over to the additional half an hour that i produced for the
dailywire plus platform to delve into some of the biographical details of your life um before we
close i'd like to just sort of wander over the territory that we've covered and see if there's
anything else see if you think this is a reasonable summary and if there's anything else you want to
add i've been talking with dr. temple grand in today who's who's developed a spectacular career
in modifying animal handling and also managed a lot on the more purely intellectual front as well
in terms of conceptualization of information processing she's uh we talked a lot today about
the difference in in in the ways that people think concentrating mostly on the distinction
between visual thinkers who tend to be more practical and detail oriented and who are can
be broadly differentiated into two categories and those would be object visualizers and
people who think more visually and mathematically contrasting them with people who think more
verbally uh we talked a fair bit about the prioritization of more verbal and abstract
thinking at the cost of this practical thinking and training in that practical thinking we discussed
how that's affected the school system in broader culture we discussed the dangers that poses
to the integrity of our society as we lose the people who have the hands-on knowledge
we talked about the psychological danger that poses to people who think more practically
concretely and and visually who are in school systems that are optimized for the verbal thinkers
we talked about temples um career at the detail level um ameliorating the suffering of animals
that across like nationally and internationally as it turned out partly because she decided
not to chase mere generalities but to focus on an actual problem which was the suffering of actual
animals in actual plants was willing to focus her emotional concerns on something that was
practical and to marry that with a strategy that involved particularization and visualization
and verbal communication and practical interactions with corporations and also we closed that with
a discussion of the fact that what she's doing now is trying to bring to people's attention in
podcasts like this the fact that we seem to be um working contrary to our own best interests by not
um building educational facilities that help optimize the ability of visual thinkers to function
but also for society more broadly to take advantage of the talents and skills of those people in the
in innovation and in the maintenance of the infrastructure that we already have around us
and so I think that about summarizes what we talked about today is there anything you want to add to that
that definitely you know kind of um kind of summarizes that we need all the different kinds of minds
and they can when we understand that different people think differently they can work in teams
where they can collaborate and have complementary skills I think that's that's uh something that's
really important also right right right the thing I want to one thing I would do with the schools
is I'd put a lot of the hands-on classes back in like art sewing woodworking shop welding
auto mechanics theater because these are all things that expose kids to to things that can
become possible careers too right and those are all things that have to be done in an embodied
sense you actually have to it's not purely abstract any any it's not abstract none of those
things are abstract yeah well that's I suppose a danger of moving so much education online as
well as that it's going to increase the degree well that's right the other thing when I went to
did the book signing for visual thinking I told you about the electrical engineering book in the
30s I found in this unique hotel room but I also got put in the office of a professor in political
science and I looked at some of those books and it was so abstract theories about politics I I didn't
even understand it it had nothing to do with right or left it had to do with just abstractions that
were so abstract it made no sense to me now I'm going oh I wouldn't want this person in charge of
figuring out what to do with the power grid you know I remember at this Tucson conference where
I first saw you speak after you spoke very practical talk very much like the one that you
you delivered today when we were talking a philosophy student got up because there were a
lot of abstract thinkers at this consciousness conference and asked you something extremely
abstract and philosophical and you did exactly what I would expect a good engineer to do which
was to say you know I really don't understand anything that you just said I don't know how
to associate it with anything practical and I'm completely unable to answer your question
which I thought was just it was ridiculously comical and I also thought um what would you say
well targeted because it was the case that you know you had been talking about real practical
realities your ability to think like an animal the fact that you had taken these practical
steps to ameliorate animal suffering and that that had been so consequential and and so of obvious
worth and then you were faced with this flight into abstraction and and did what engineers always
did do which is something like well yeah but I don't understand that what does it mean practically
which is a really good question that you know it's a question that should be asked of abstract
thinkers all the time what are the devils in the details here that you're overlooking
how much do you know about the systems that you're abstractly representing and the answer
to that is usually almost nothing well it's sort of like you know we need all the three different
base you know different kinds of minds you need the object visualizers we'll go to get the arts
mechanical and photography and animals you need the visual spatial mathematicians computer
programmers chemists things that require mathematics and we need the verbal thinkers
because they're going to help organize things you see you need all three different kinds of
minds and they should work together in a complimentary fashion all right well that's a good
place to end this segment I would say I'm going to go thank you thank you to everyone on YouTube
and the associated podcast for your time and attention I hope you found this discussion
