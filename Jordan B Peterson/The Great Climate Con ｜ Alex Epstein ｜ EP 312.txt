So the Hebrews created history as we know it.
You don't get away with anything and so you might think you can bend the fabric of reality
and that you can treat people instrumentally and that you can bow to the tyrant and violate
your conscience without cost.
You will pay the piper.
It's going to call you out of that slavery into freedom even if that pulls you into the
desert.
And we're going to see that there's something else going on here that is far more cosmic
and deeper than what you can imagine.
The highest ethical spirit to which we're beholden is presented precisely as that spirit
that allies itself with the cause of freedom against tyranny.
Yes, exactly.
I want villains to get punished.
But do you want the villains to learn before they have to pay the ultimate price?
That's such a Christian question.
You're optimizing for minimal impact and I think that is really the core of the modern
environmental movement.
It's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible and we're somehow
getting in the way of that.
It's specifically against us.
And they discovered the greenhouse effect.
They said this is going to on its own make the earth a much more lush place.
They speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything is going to be
lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological and it's kind of obvious.
If you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life.
It's a more green world in the life sense of green and yet the green movement hates
it because we caused it.
So they can see no good in anything we caused even when it leads to more biological productivities.
It's fundamentally an anti-human movement, not a pro-life of any kind movement.
The ineluctable conclusion that has to be drawn from that proposition is that any human
activity whatsoever is to be regarded as evil even if it increases total biological flourishing
in terms of let's say the net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet.
And so that's also perverse because that is definitely a game that none of us can win.
If the a prior rule is no matter what you do, you're evil, then the only solution to that
is, well how about a hell of a lot fewer of you?
Hello everyone watching and listening on YouTube or the associated podcast platforms.
I have with me today Alex Epstein.
I'm looking forward to this discussion.
He's a philosopher and energy expert who argues that human flourishing should be the guiding
principle and the appropriate metric for our energy and environmental policy and our determination
of its progress.
He's the author of the new book, Fossil Future, as well as the New York Times bestseller, The
Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, which was published in 2014.
He's also the creator of energytalkingpoints.com, a source of powerful, well-referenced talking
points on energy, environmental, and climate issues.
Epstein began his work in 2011 with the founding of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit
think tank offering insights into the world of fossil fuels and fighting back against
the mainstream narrative of so-called environmentalism.
He recognized as a master of persuasion and debate on energy issues.
Alex has spoken to dozens of Fortune 500 companies and at dozens of prominent universities, including
Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Duke, his alma mater.
He's also a highly sought-after consultant on messaging, working with dozens of major
political offices on pro-energy, pro-freedom messaging.
We're here today to talk about the moral necessity of an energy-rich future, one that
both must and should rely on the abundant provision of the petro-based fuels so carelessly
currently demonized.
So welcome to all of you who are watching or listening, and welcome to Alex.
So maybe we could just start by having you walk through the book.
One of the things I found interesting to begin with was your discussion of the motivations,
let's say, of some of the more radical people that are pushing what is purported to be a
pro-environment stance.
People like Paul Ehrlich, who clearly have an agenda that could be more accurately conceptualized
as anti-human, certainly anti-industrial, rather than pro-environment.
And I think that's something that's worthwhile alerting everyone, too, especially given the
current state of energy price increase in Europe, let's say, and the consequences that's going
to have for the poor around the world.
Let's start with that, though.
You wrote this book in 2014.
Let's talk about why you wrote it and how you think your prognostications have fared
in what's almost an intervening decade.
Well, I think one thing that's relevant, I'm not sure if you know this, but there's a new
book, 2022, called Fossil Future, which is the successor or replacement to the moral
case for fossil fuels.
So I talk a bunch in that about how the moral case for fossil fuels has fared.
And I think in terms of a predictive book, it's not primarily a predictive book, but
it has been extremely accurate.
Because if you look at what people have said in the last eight or so years, the main name
narratives have been, we're not going to need fossil fuels as much as we used to.
They're going to be rapidly replaced by solar and wind primarily.
And that climate impact, the climate impact of fossil fuels, is going to be increasingly
catastrophic.
So we're going to see more and more suffering and death from climate-related disasters.
And in the book, I talk about that's not going to happen because, one, fossil fuels will
remain uniquely cost-effective, particularly in a world that needs far more energy, which
is something that was not stressed in the past and is not stressed enough today.
But people are starting to realize most of the world doesn't have enough energy.
So replacing fossil fuels is almost impossible, given that you're not talking about just replacing
it for the people who use it, but for the people who need it.
So I've been very vindicated on the continuing cost effectiveness of fossil fuels.
And then on the climate disaster point, we have documented that climate-related disaster
deaths are down 98% in the last 100 years, and they've continued to decline.
And the basic reason is because whatever impact we have on climate that is negative, it is
far outweighed by our ability to master climate, to neutralize all sorts of climate dangers.
And so we're much better off overall climate-wise than we were 50 years ago and certainly 100
years ago.
So with regards to, let's start with the second one there, the climate disaster.
So the biophilic types, and so those would be people like Erlich, they seem to make the
case that metrics that involve human flourishing or even human death aren't relevant, because
the primary issue is to restore the biosphere to something approximating what it hypothetically
was before there were human beings, which is a rather strange notion, all things considered.
And so they might object to the fact that you're using the mere decrease in number of
deaths associated with climate trouble with weather events as a metric, because the metric
should be something like the purity of the planet.
And so what do you think about that argument?
What metric should we be using to determine whether or not a climate emergency actually
exists?
Well, I definitely think we should be using a human flourishing metric, but in a broad
sense, the climate disaster deaths are not the only aspect of that, but they're a very
important aspect.
We can also see that damages are flat or down.
We can see that life overall is much better.
And actually our ability to preserve the most valuable parts of nature is better.
Generally when you're not dependent on the land and dependent on wood, dependent on your
local environment for your fuel and your wealthy, you can be much better at preserving the parts
of nature that you want to preserve.
If you look at places in Africa and Asia and even now Europe, because they're now energy
poor, like cutting down their forests, it's because they don't have better sources of
fuel.
So, but I would challenge the idea that Erlich is really using this, I think you called it
biophilic standard, because if you look at his public rhetoric, he's always appealing
to a human flourishing standard.
So how did Erlich become famous?
He became famous through the 1968 book, The Population Bomb, where he's telling human
beings not, hey, the planet is going to become more impacted and that's intrinsically bad.
He's saying you're all going to starve.
And his close colleague, Sean Holdren, who was Obama's chief science advisor, now he
predicted in the 80s that we'd have up to a billion climate related disaster deaths
from famine by 2020, which has come and gone and the world is better fed than ever.
So what I find is that people who I think internally, they don't really care about human
flourishing and they're really optimizing for eliminating our impact as much as possible,
but they appeal to human flourishing to win over converts.
Because if they really said the best possible earth is the one that would exist had we never
existed and our goal is to eliminate as much human impact as possible as an end in itself,
they would not win many converts.
Well, the lack of a red wave during the midterms lead to more reckless spending by a more emboldened
administration, higher taxes, deeper inflation.
If you're unsure how the next two years will unfold, talk to Birch Gold Group about protecting
your savings with gold.
Birch Gold makes it easy to convert your IRA or 401K into an IRA in precious metals so
you can own gold and silver in a tax-sheltered account.
Gold is the world's oldest, most proven form of currency.
When inflation soars and all other assets go sideways, gold is still there.

Text Jordan to 98998 and protect yourself with gold today.
Okay, so the case that you're making in some sense is that the argument on the radical
pro-environmental side actually varies sometimes, so to speak, in secret or behind the scenes,
sort of voce, I suppose.
The argument is made that the planet would be better off.
It was returned to some natural and unspoiled condition.
But then public-facing, the arguments are essentially predicated on the argument that
if we don't do something drastic about, let's say, climate change, we're going to cause
a radical increase in actual human suffering.
Okay, so that all has to be straightened out conceptually before we, as a species, let's
say, can move forward intelligently on this front.
I think the most powerful point you made, however, and I think this is where the rubber
really hits the road in more modern times, is that even if you use the metrics that are
put forward by those who, let's say, oppose the continuing use of fossil fuel, so those
would be metrics associated with climate change remediation and environmental improvement,
the policies that are designed to drive energy costs upward do nothing at all that isn't
counterproductive by their own measurements.
So you pointed out, for example, and this is something that people really need to be
alerted to, is that because Europe has taken this absolutely foolish route to reliance
on wind and solar, which is intermittent at best, one of the things that's happening because
of the pressure on liquid natural gas supplies primarily is that there's a tremendous amount
of deforestation occurring in Europe at the moment because people have to turn to sources
of energy that are actually at hand so that they don't freeze in the dark in the middle
of the winter.
And so the thing that I find so appalling about what's happening on the environmental
front at the moment is that even by the metrics of the people who are pro-environmental, these
policies that are driving energy costs upward are utterly counterproductive.
And you know, humanprogress.org has a lovely graph showing the relationship between attention
paid to true medium to long-term environmental sustainability and overall wealth.
And what you see is that if you can get, as you make people wealthier, so as you remove
them from absolute poverty, their ability and willingness to attend to longer-term environmental
issues starts to increase rather than decreasing.
And so this has struck me for, I've known this for at least 10 years, that the best
pathway forward to a truly sustainable planet, even by the definitions of the environmentalists
themselves, is to drive energy costs downward to the point where we can remediate absolute
poverty so that people aren't driven to use up damaging and polluting immediately available
bioresources instead of turning to more efficient sources of energy.
And you are certainly making that case in the 2014 book, which as you pointed out, you've
updated.
So that's the critical issue, right?
Even by the metrics of the environmentalists themselves, the policies that we're presently
pursuing on the energy front are not only counterproductive environmentally, but they're driving poor people
into abject poverty.
We're going to see a lot of that in Europe.
I think it depends.
So I think if you take the quote environmentalists as having a kind of pro-human interest in
nature and pro-human interest in lack of pollution, this is true.
But my belief is that the core of it is the belief that human impact is inherently bad,
it's intrinsically immoral, and also the belief is it's inevitably self-destructive.
So nature is viewed as this God, that if we offend it through our impact, is going to
punish us.
And it really has this character where it's wrong, and doing the wrong thing is going
to destroy us.
If you really think about it that way, all their policies make sense because their policies
are really aimed at making human life worse and ultimately reducing the human population.
So it is true.
You can say, well, yeah, aren't you cutting down more trees?
Aren't you doing this?
But they would say, well, let's say we had cheap, free nuclear energy, which they've
actually commented on hypothetically when they thought fusion was possible.
I talk about this in moral case and in fossil future.
The leading environmentalist said this would be the worst thing ever.
A totally clean, cheap, abundant source of energy would be the worst thing ever because
of what we would do with it.
And one of the leaders called it giving an idiot child a machine gun.
And what they recognized is that energy is really our ability to do work, which means
our ability to impact the earth.
And when we use a lot of energy, we impact the earth a lot.
Now we impact it in a way that's beneficial to us, including we preserve the most valuable
parts of nature, and we give ourselves an ability to enjoy nature.
Nevertheless, it is a very humanized earth.
And to the anti-human environmental movement, that is offensive.
So that movement is not about a clean environment for us or for us to be able to contemplate
polar bears or go on safaris or any of this.
It's about a dehumanized earth.
It's the belief that we are uniquely bad and we need to get eliminated.
Right, right.
But the problem with that argument, even if you attempt to give the devil his due, let's
say, is that it's predicated on the idea that if we pursued policies to decrease our overall
energy use, and if one of the consequences of those policies was the relatively radical
depopulation of the earth, perhaps by radically lowering birth rates, that while that transformation
was occurring, depopulation and deindustrialization, things would remain stable enough so that
in our new poverty and our hopelessness with regards to the future, we wouldn't be devouring
the planet while we were dying.
And I think that's a preposterous claim.
I don't see any peaceful way forward that's based on compulsion and poverty to reduce
the population of the world that isn't going to be absolutely destructive on the environment
in the front.
And the idea that if we had more energy, we would actually be worse for the planet, flies
in the face of what we've been discussing already, which is the fact that if people can't turn
to cheap and efficient and relatively clean sources of energy, and perhaps liquid natural
gas and nuclear would be at the top of that list, then they're going to absolutely 100%
turn to much dirtier replacements.
And we've already seen that happening in, well, everywhere.
I mean, China is building coal-fired plants at a rate that's so rapid that everything
the West is doing on the climate amelioration front is absolutely irrelevant.
And what has the UK in the last week has already pledged to double its coal imports, and Germany
has had to turn to its coal-fired plants to provide backup power because wind and solar
has proved not only hyperexpensive, but so unreliable that, well, that when there's no
power, so when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you have to have backup
and it's been coal that's been brought in as a stopgap.
So I just can't see any way, even if you accept the arguments that you just laid forward,
that there should be fewer people and that the right planet is one that's characterized
by minimal human action.
I can't see any way forward to that on the energy poverty front that's not going to be
positively counterproductive.
I mean, I agree with you in terms of how it plays out.
And I think it's important in general, this is not a scientific movement.
And part of it not being a scientific movement is it doesn't really have a long-term strategy
for achieving its anti-human goals.
It's much more, it has a lot of ritual in it.
There's a lot of just hostility toward kind of hostility toward anything that has impact
and you just oppose that and then you assume things are going to get better.
And so people didn't think through what's going to happen when you make energy more
expensive, what's going to happen to the forest?
They didn't think that through at all.
Or when you oppose nuclear, what are you going to use in its stead?
Or when you make energy expensive, what's going to happen in terms of rights?
It's not at all thought through.
And I think this might be a lesson for us to have when we contemplate these so-called
plans for net zero.
This is a movement that's very much, it has this hostility toward human impact.
It opposes it wherever it sees it.
And it just, it has a quality of nihilism to it.
And it's not thinking through, it's not thinking through either a dehumanized earth or a human
friendly earth.
It's sort of going after anything that has impact.
But my argument is we need to switch our hostility toward impact.
This view that human impact is bad needs to be challenged.
Human impact is good if it makes the earth a better place for human flourishing.
The biggest banks and investment firms in the world are putting up to half of their total
assets into new investments.
What do they know that we don't?
Maybe that the economy is about to get worse?
The CEO of JP Morgan just warned that stocks could slide another 20%.
Bigwigs are moving their money into alternatives like fine art, because fine art has outpaced
even the S&P 500 over the last 26 years by 131%.
Even in 2022, Masterworks produced results.
In early November, Masterworks had a strategic exit for a 17.8% net return to their investors.
Their last three exits have brought in 17, 21, and 33% net returns.

So yeah, well it's a strange, it's a very strange issue philosophically, because one
of the things I wonder about is why this idea that human beings are in some sense in their
activity antagonistic to the earth, it's a very peculiar metaphysical assumption, especially
for people who are hypothetically, biologically minded, because if we're living creatures
which we clearly are, and if we've evolved in the same manner that other living creatures
have evolved, which seems relatively indisputable, then how is it that our very existence is somehow
antithetical to the flourishing of the biosphere, given that we're clearly part of the biosphere?
And you see this sort of thing with this idiot assumption, for example, that bears some of
the same hallmarks of this kind of quasi-philosophical thinking that before the Europeans came to
North America that the natives were living somehow in harmony with nature, and that
the entire biosphere was free of the scars of human interaction.
And that's utterly preposterous.
I mean, the Native Americans were incredibly sophisticated agriculturalists, and the Western
Plains Indians burned the prairies constantly to ensure that there was a plentiful supply
of the buffalo that they depended on.
And so human beings have been affecting the structure of the biosphere ever since we've
been around, and that's for a very long period of time, and the idea that there was somehow
some pristine state of nature before we emerged on the landscape and that there's some moral
imperative to return to that, it strikes me, it's so incoherent that it's barely comprehensible.
And there is something like a hatred for humanity, as far as I can tell that's lurking underneath
this, hatred for humanity, certainly a hatred for industrialization.
And those actually turn out to be the same thing.
I mean, one of the things that's really struck me as incomprehensible over the last few years
is that, especially on the left, is that you have these joint claims being put forward
simultaneously on the left, and one is that we're radically pro-environmental, and we're
also the philosophical doctrine that is standing up for the poor and oppressed.
And I think, okay, well, what happens when those two things are pitted against each other?
And when are they pitted?
Well, they're pitted when it comes to discussions about cheap energy, because it's clearly
the case, and you outlined this in your book quite nicely, that the most effective way
of remediating absolute poverty, so lifting people out of the privation that's associated
at least with lack of education, but also with starvation itself, is to provide them
with cheap energy, because as you pointed out, there's no difference between energy
and work, and there's no difference between work and productivity.
There's no difference between productivity and the eradication of poverty.
And so we are pursuing these expensive energy policies, and hypothetically, we're supposed
to benefit the planet, although we're not, but we are definitely dooming people who are
already poor to a much more truncated horizon of opportunity, and to, well, to absolute
privation and starvation in many cases.
Yes, I think it's really, I mean, there are at least two really interesting issues raised
here, sort of this tension between the alleged concern for poverty, and then the quote concern
for the environment, and then this question of how this bizarre view evolved, you know,
because this was not the view of our environment and our impact 100 years ago, and interestingly,
it's not the view of our environment that anyone who lives near nature has.
People who live in nature don't worship nature as the superior God that can't be impacted.
And I think it's my own understanding of the history, and I really enjoy, there's a book
by Einran called The New Left, The Anti-Industrial Revolution, and it was written at the time
that this was happening.
And one of the analyses is basically there's a transition between the old left and the
new left, where the old left claimed to be for industry, for productivity, for prosperity.
And what happened is that was clearly not achieved by their policies.
Communism led to the devastation of industry, the malfunction of industry, widespread poverty.
Einran said, well, you know, the left basically had a choice.
Are you going to stay with your anti-capitalism, or are you going to embrace capitalism because
you really care about industry and productivity?
And actually what they did was they kept their anti-capitalism, and they looked for new reasons
to support anti-capitalism.
And in the 60s, they decided on this issue of environment.
And it was a convenient issue in a number of ways.
One is the pro-capitalism side didn't do a very good job with it, particularly rhetorically.
They didn't make the point that, well, good environments are made possible by prosperity.
So the idea of a good environment in a humanistic way was co-opted by the anti-capitalists who
had no right to it whatsoever.
I mean, look at the Soviet Union and an environment, but they owned that value issue.
But then they packaged it with this hostility toward human impact as such.
And what they really did brilliantly was they took over the schools.
So in the schools, this idea that human impact is bad, and especially the idea that it's
inevitably self-destructive because the planet is this delicate nurture that our impact ruins.
And that has permeated the whole educational system, where people think that we inherently
are destroyers of the planet, and it has permeated the scientific community.
What I call this delicate nurture dogma is unfortunately pervasive in earth sciences
today.
It's a very primitive and bizarre view.
It has nothing to do with reality that our impact is inevitably self-destructive.
Actually, our impact has made the earth much better overall, including safer from climate.
But nevertheless, I think it's really, there was initially a real political motivation
to spread this, but now we have this irrationalist philosophy that has a mind of its own.
Yeah, well, that's okay.
So let's delve into that a little bit, because the other thing that I've come to understand
more clearly in the last 15 years, let's say, as the data has also become more clear,
is that so we lifted more people out of poverty in absolute terms and also in relative terms
between 2000 and 2015 than we had lifted people out of poverty in the sum total of human endeavor
before that.
And it's quite clear that the reason for that was that fewer countries pursued absolutely
counterproductive economic policies of the type that were put forward, let's say, by
the communists when the Cold War was raging.
And so you saw all over the world, including in places like Communist China, that there
was a radical move towards something approximating free market and free trade between individuals.
In some countries, that was implemented more effectively than others.
But wherever it was implemented, at least quasi-effectively, people immediately stopped
starving.
And so, and I'm trying to make a case in relationship to the anti-capitalism.
So let's say that you are a genuine classic leftist and you are actually concerned with
the poor, especially remediation of absolute poverty.
And you're looking at the data, and you see that after the Soviet Union collapsed and
there were fewer countries turning to communist dogma to formulate their economic policies,
and more countries started to develop, started to participate in the broad free market, that
we drove poverty down to its lowest level in absolute numbers, or in relative numbers
certainly, than we'd ever seen before in history.
And so then again, we're back to the same issue.
If the spread of free market policies remediates absolute poverty, which it clearly does, and
in a staggeringly rapid manner, then what in the world is driving the anti-capitalist
ethos?
You know, you said that there's this underlying metaphor of nature as something like fragile
virgin, continually what rendered susceptible to our raping and pillaging.
So there's a weird metaphor lurking at the bottom of all that.
But given the overwhelming data that something approximating free market frees people from
absolute poverty, and then conjoining that with the observation that richer people actually
care more about the environment, you're left again with this question of what in the world
is motivating this.
There's some deep hatred.
It's like a deep hatred for humanity itself, but even at the expense of the planet.
And so I still struggle with trying to comprehend that.
There's a kind of existential guilt there for the crime of existence itself.
It's something like that.
I mean, I think there's one really powerful fact about the increase in prosperity that
I draw attention to a lot in fossil future, because I think it's very notable.
So I point out, I was born in 1980.
Since 1980, we've gone from more than four in 10 people living on less than $2 a day,
and this is adjusted for inflation to one in 10.
So as you said, this is the greatest alleviation of poverty in human history.
Now what's really interesting is if you survey, and this was done in the UK, you might have
seen this before, but there's a survey of college educated adults in the UK about what
has happened to extreme poverty over the past 30 or 40 years.
And this is just an objective documented thing.
There's no question.
And so what happened is only 12% of people thought it got better.
Right.
55% of people thought it got worse, and the rest thought it stayed the same.
And it just shows you the level of miseducation about this issue.
And I do think a lot of it is the modern anti-human environmental movement, because what they've
done is they've taught us that our impact ruins the planet.
And so we just assume that because the world used a lot more fossil fuels, particularly
China and India did, which drove much of the increase in prosperity, they just assume that
the world is worse.
And what I call, I don't use this term in a moral case, but I use it in fossil future,
our knowledge system.
So the institutions we rely on for expert knowledge and guidance, they've totally failed at educating
us about how much the world has improved from a human perspective.
And this goes back to my argument that the anti-human environmental movement, they're
trying to pretend to be pro-human.
So they don't want us to know that the earth is a much better place than ever to live.
They don't want us to know that climate disaster deaths are way down.
They don't want us to know about the decline in extreme poverty, because it totally challenges
their narrative that impact in general and fossil fuels in particular are bad.
And if we recognized how vital fossil fuels are, then we would be really afraid of these
proposals to get rid of fossil fuels in the next 27 years in a world that needs far more
energy.
And unfortunately, we're starting to realize this involuntarily because these policies
just implemented 1%, these anti-fossil fuel policies, just implemented a 1% success rate
in the anti-fossil fuel movement's view have already led to a global energy crisis.

Well, you knew said that the planet is getting better, let's say, from a human perspective.
And so we've looked at metrics like the radical decrease in absolute privation.
But we could turn our attention momentarily to the evidence that in many ways and somewhat
paradoxically and perversely, the planet actually seems to be doing better from the
natural perspective too.
Now, I have been concerned about, I have believed for a long time that one of our focal concerns
might be on the environmental front, might appropriately be something like remediation
of misuse of oceanic resources, because I think we've done a pretty cataclysmic job
of protecting our, especially our coastal lands and the shelf environments just off
shore of the continents where pretty much all the fish are.
I think we've done a catastrophic job of managing that.
And there are genuine environmental problems that I think sensible people should take into
account.
But I was looking at a graph this week, and I've known about this phenomenon for quite
a while, phenomenon for quite a while, that again, in the last 15 years, a surface area
totaling 15% of the entire planet has greened.
I mean, that is, that's an area that's larger than the continental United States.
And it's, so let's, let's walk through that for a minute.
So just so everyone who's listening is clear.
In the last 15 years, the planet has not got less green.
It's got more green.
And not only a little bit more green, stunningly more green, 15% in essentially in 15 years.
And that's an area bigger than the continental United States.
And that's happened pretty much everywhere in the world.
And then you might say, well, where is that happening?
And perversely and contrary to all predictions, it's happening in the drier areas of the planet,
especially in semi-arid areas.
And here's the reason.
So plants have to breathe and to breathe, they have to open pores on their surface.
And the problem for plants when they breathe with these pores is that they also allow water
to evaporate from their internal structures.
And so the less carbon dioxide in the air, the more the plants have to open their pores.
And that means the more susceptible they are to drying out.
And that means that they struggle to exist in semi-arid areas.
Now what's happened as a consequence of increased carbon dioxide production is that plants can
breathe easier and so they don't have to open their pores to the same degree.
And what that has meant is that the very desert areas, at least the semi-arid areas, that
the climate apocalypse were claiming would expand and spread, so the desertification
of the world, the exact opposite has happened.
And the Sahara Desert, for example, has shrunk to quite a stunning degree.
And not only is the planet 15% greener than it was in 2000, but there are more trees in
the northern hemisphere than there were 100 years ago and as well as the planet greening.
And so you can think about that as a victory on the objective front for the natural world.
At the same time, the planet is green because it's easier for plants to survive.
Our food crops have become much more productive for exactly the same reasons.
So as carbon dioxide output has increased, the planet has got, not only has the planet
got greener, it's got greener in the driest areas, which is absolutely stunning and remarkable.
And one of the consequences of that increased greening is that our agriculture production
has become not less efficient, but much more efficient.
And so I'm really wrestling with how to conceptualize that particular set of statistics.
I just thought of an idea.
I just thought of an idea.
I've never thought of this before.
So we're just trying it right now.
But I think maybe we can think of three conceptions of the earth, which capture everything we're
talking about.
So my primary conception is evaluating the earth from the perspective of human flourishing.
How hospitable to human beings is it?
And this includes like a lush green beautiful world for us to enjoy for many reasons you've
talked about.
But then the second one could be looking at the earth in terms of just pure biological
productivity.
But just not even focusing on humans, just how much life is on the planet.
And this captures what you just mentioned with rising CO2 levels, making a greener planet.
But then the third one, and I think this is really the core of the modern environmental
movement, is an unimpacted planet.
So you're not optimizing for biological productivity.
You're optimizing for minimal impact.
And I think that is really the core of the modern environmental movement.
It's not this just blanket collective desire for as much life as possible.
And we're somehow getting in the way of that.
It's specifically against us.
And I think you brought up the perfect example, which is the climate catastrophe movements,
total non-interest in kind of the obvious biological productivity benefits of more CO2.
And this was not shocking or stunning.
This is exactly what was predicted by the people who discovered the greenhouse effect.
When they discovered the greenhouse effect, they said, this is going to on its own make
the earth a much more lush place.
They speculated like the fruits are going to be bigger and everything is going to be
lush because we're going to have more farmland and more biological.
And it's kind of obvious.
If you have a warmer world with more CO2, it's a more tropical world with more life.
It's a more green world in the life sense of green.
And yet the green movement hates it because we caused it.
So they can see no good in anything we caused, even when it leads to more biological productivity.
So I think what you're bringing up really shows it's fundamentally an anti-human movement,
not a pro-life of any kind.
Right, right.
Okay.
But let's talk about that idea of impact.
It's like, well, what is this hypothetical perfect world that exists statically that
would be pristine and morally valuable in the absence of human beings?
I mean, the biosphere is a dynamic place, obviously, over any time scale.
There's shift in what constitutes, quote, the environment.
There seems to be this presumption that at some point in the past, when there was minimal
human activity, the earth was somehow optimized in the biological, but also the moral sense,
and that any change in that whatsoever in any direction, hence climate change, let's
say, rather than global warming, any change in that whatsoever is to be regarded axiomatically
as evil.
But what that essentially means, as far as I can tell, the ineluctable conclusion that
has to be drawn from that proposition is that any human activity whatsoever is to be regarded
as evil on the face of it.
It doesn't matter what it does, and your point is that even if it increases total biological
flourishing in terms of, let's say, the net metric tonnage of biological life on the planet.
And so that's also perverse, because that is definitely a game that none of us can win.
If the a prior rule is, no matter what you do, you're evil, then the only solution to
that is, well, how about a hell of a lot fewer of you?
But then you say, well, what's that supposed to serve?
Because if what we're doing now is actually making the planet more green, and I'm saying
that very carefully, because I know that that's not a sufficient metric.
I am very concerned with issues, let's say, or conscious of issues that are relevant like
the potential loss of biodiversity and also the overfishing of the oceans, let's say.
So even though the planet is becoming greener, that doesn't mean that there are no mistakes
we're making on the environmental front.
But those mistakes have to be differentiated out, and they're all addressable.
As we get richer too, and we can do more with less, and our agriculture becomes more efficient
if we can manage that, that also means, even by the standards of the environmentalists
themselves, that we'll be able to set aside reasonably large tracts of land and water
to maintain them in something approximating a pristine and untouched state.
I mean, that's certainly something that should be done on the oceanic management front.
The data that I know suggests that if we set aside a certain percentage of the coastal area
as marine protected areas, and that might not be the most efficient way to manage the oceans,
but it's not bad, that we'll reap the benefits of having untouched nature, so to speak, which
is an aesthetic and economic and environmental good, but we'll also be able to replenish
the oceans in a manner that would be economically productive.
Well, why the hell can't we have our cake and eat it too, then, is we can help people
become rich with the provision of plentiful energy, and then we can put aside tracts of the world
so that they're relatively untouched, so that biology can do its thing.
And what the hell is the problem with that, precisely?
Well, so I think you're pointing to something really good and something really bad.
Something really good is why my new book is called Fossil Future, Why Global Human Flourishing
Acquires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas, Not Less.
But part of it, it does talk about, we can increase all of these biological things.
We can have a much more lush world, we can enjoy nature much more.
This is fundamentally good news.
The more energy we have, the more control we have over Earth,
and the more we can make everything about it better for our purposes, including aesthetic
things that poor people can't possibly be confused by.
But the bad thing here is it's really highlighting the nihilism of this view that human impact is
bad. And again, I really think the view is not that we want a lush environment and human beings
are getting in the way of that. We want biological productivity and human beings are getting in the
way. Because as you're pointing out, they are opposing all human impact, including obvious
things that make the world better. And so it really is the view that if we did it,
it's bad. And you ask something like, what is it serving? But it's a nihilistic view.
So it's not really serving anything. Even when you think about unimpacted nature,
it's not this beautiful thing for us to enjoy. It's supposed to be protected from us.
So that's really the view. Including our enjoyment.
This evil, of course, our enjoyment is of no consequence whatsoever.
And in fossil future and in moral case, I have a lot of quotes from the leaders
where they'll occasionally let this slip out where one guy, for example,
who was reviewing Bill McKibbin's book, The End of Nature talks about, you know,
like a flourishing biosphere is more important to me than one human or a billion of them.
Yeah. Yeah. Let me read that. Let me read that. I've got it right here. So this is something that
you cite in your 2014 book. I'm going to just read it so everybody can hear it. And I would
ask everyone who's listening to really think about this, because this gets to the,
this strikes to the core of the issue as far as I can tell. So for example, this is from your book,
in a Los Angeles Times review of The End of Nature, McKibbin's influential book of 25 years ago,
predicting catastrophic climate change, David M. Graber, research biologist for the National
Park Service wrote this summary of McKibbin's message. McKibbin is a biocentrist. And so am I.
We are not interested in the utility of a particular species or free flowing river or ecosystem
to mankind. They have intrinsic value, more value to me than another human being.
That's a very interesting thing to say, or a billion of them, which is also a very
interesting thing to say. Human happiness and certainly human fecundity are not as important as
a wild and healthy planet. I know social scientists who remind me that people are part of nature,
but that isn't true. Somewhere along the line at about a billion years ago, maybe half that,
we quit the contract and became a cancer. We have become a plague upon ourselves and upon the earth.
It is cosmically unlikely that the developed world will choose to end its orgy of fossil fuel
consumption and the third world, its suicidal consumption of landscape until such time as
Homo sapiens should decide to rejoin nature. Some of us can only hope for the right virus to come
along. You know, I cannot understand how anybody who is positively predisposed to children,
let's we might say, could read something like that and not be absolutely shocked to their core.
Let's walk through the claims. The first claim is an untouched natural landscape of any size,
whatever untouched means, is more valuable in and of itself than any individual human being
or any group of people, no matter how large the number. The implication there is
is any number of human beings could be sacrificed in order to preserve any
geographically demarcated natural zone of any size. So that's a standard of comparative value.
And then the cancer metaphor, while human beings have deviated from the natural order,
whatever that natural order is, whatever our deviation consists of, and we've deviated the
same way. A cancer deviates, so now the metaphor is human beings equal cancer, and that's a hell
of a metaphor because what we do with cancer is strive to eradicate it. So these metaphors have
deep motivational significance. So that's a little bit on the appalling side, let's say, and it's
grounded in a very narrow malethusian view of the world, which is that we're something like yeast,
cancer, let's say, and left to our own devices will multiply unchecked until we devour everything
in parish, which is a pretty dismal and only vaguely biologically centered view of how human
beings conduct themselves because we're not yeast in a bloody petri dish, we're not yeast and the
world isn't a petri dish, let's put it that way. And then you add to that the closing statement,
which is something like those of us who are properly oriented in our moral
endeavor in relationship to the non-human world can only sit and pray that the right virus comes
along so that what? So that we're radically depopulated to what degree? Down to the half
a billion people that the world can hypothetically sustain? It's like every single bit of that,
to me, reeks of an underlying and barely veiled, brutal genocidal impulse.
I agree, and what I want to draw attention to is that this mentality diluted or not to various
degrees is leading our thinking about what to do about fossil fuels, which is an existential issue
for the world. Because the reason I go into this, particularly in fossil futures, the point I'm
making is that the people and institutions were trusting to evaluate what to do about this source
of energy that powers the world that also emits CO2 and impacts the climate. Those people are not
making that evaluation by anything resembling the goal of advancing human flourishing on earth.
They are pursuing, to a significant degree, this goal of eliminating human impact on earth.
And the economist George Reisman had this article a long time ago called The Toxicity
of Environmentalism. And one point he made that I never forgot is he said listening to a modern
environmentalist is like listening to a doctor who's on the side of the germs. Somebody who
doesn't have your best interests at heart. And as an example, one of the people I pick on very
deservedly in fossil future is Michael Mann, who's a climate scientist and activist who is one of the
leading advisors. And if you look at Michael Mann's statements, one thing he has said is
the ideal population for earth is a billion people. How can you possibly say that? There are
eight billion people. How can you possibly look at earth and say, oh yeah, it's too many people?
That has a murderous impulse to it. If you just look at the earth and you say, oh yeah,
seven billion people should go. And what I point out with Michael Mann is that if you look at how
he's evaluating the issue, he's totally indifferent to the benefits of fossil fuels. He has a whole
book. People can look it up called The Madhouse Effect About Fossil Fields and Climate. And he
doesn't mention any benefits of fossil fuels. For example, he talks about agriculture and fossil
fuels. He only talks about negatives. He doesn't once mention diesel-powered agricultural equipment
or natural gas-derived fertilizer, even though those make it possible for us to feed eight billion
people. So what we have is an anti-human mentality. So some of those who are listening likely don't
know that the very survival of about four billion people, so half the world's population,
depends in no small part on the provision of ammonia as fertilizer. And ammonia is primarily
derived from natural gas. And so what that means is not just on the energy front, let's point this
out, is that the very food that is provisioning half the world's population is a direct consequence
of the cheap and easy accessibility of natural gas. And so what's the idea here that we're supposed
to reduce our provision of fossil fuels? And what are we going to do on the ammonia front?
We're going to drive the price of fertilizer ever more skyward? Well, if we do that, because that
would be the consequence of reducing the plentiful supply of natural gas, if we do that, then what
will happen is clearly food will get more expensive and so will energy, but food will definitely get
more expensive. And so what that will mean is that huge swath of the world's population that's
living on the edge where they can just right now afford enough food to feed themselves so they don't
suffer the consequences of nutritional privation or even die, a huge proportion of those people
are going to be tipped back into absolute poverty. Their children are going to be intellectually
stunted as a consequence and they might well starve. And then you think, well, why would we do that?
And if the answer is, well, you know, some of us really believe that the planet should only have
a billion people on it. If that, if we have to have any people at all, then, well, maybe this is all
part of the unconscious drive towards, and conscious drive to some degree, towards reducing the
planet's population no matter what the price may be. And then you see how people justify this,
they say things like, well, you know, if we don't take emergency action right now, which means
let's make the poor even poorer, then the poor are really going to suffer 100 years from now.
And I think, look, I don't have a lot of confidence in your ability to predict
even a decade out much less 100 years with your unstable economic models that are predicated on
an equally unstable climate model. So we can forget about your capacity to prognosticate 100
years down the road. But what you're saying essentially is that the hypothetical poor that
occupy my utopian imagination are much more important than the actual poor right now who
will definitely die if we implement our higher energy price inducing hypothetical environmental
policies. You know, one of the things that strikes me as so utterly absurd is partly why I found
your book so interesting is that somehow the people who are making such arguments have gained
the moral upper hand, even though you don't have to scrape beneath the surface very far to see not
only the genocidal metaphor and the genocidal intent, but the actual genocidal impact of these
policies, because we're definitely tipping people back into absolute privation.
We'll be right back to our conversation with Alex Epstein in just a moment.
First, we wanted to give you a sneak peek at Jordan's new documentary, Logos in Literacy.
I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jumpstarted the development
of literacy across the entire world. Illiteracy was the norm. The pastor's home was the first school
and every morning it would begin with singing. The Christian faith is a singing religion.
Probably 80% of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung.
This is amazing. Here we have a Gutenberg Bible printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg.
Science and religion are opposing forces in the world, but historically that has not been the case.
Now the book is available to everyone. From Shakespeare to modern education and medicine
and science to civilization itself. It is the most influential book in all of history and hopefully
people can walk away with at least a sense of that. Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting
stuff going on. I mean, I think one thing, why do they have the moral high ground? And this is
something that is really a core mission of mine to correct, is that as I mentioned before, they
really owned the issue of a good environment starting in the 60s, including loving nature,
including caring about clean air and clean water, and more recently caring about safety from climate
and that the pro-capitalism side really didn't concern themselves too much with this rhetorically
at least. And so the anti-capitalist side was able to own this issue. And when you own something as
important as our environment and our planet, you do get the moral high ground. And then they
supplemented this with this false alternative of you are either a climate change believer who
hates fossil fuels or you are a climate change denier who thinks fossil fuels are okay. So
they created this total false alternative which made no sense because what makes sense with climate
impact is to weigh it along with the benefits of fossil fuels. You cannot judge a prescription drug
by only looking at negative side effects and you can't judge fossil fuels by only looking at
negative side effects or exaggerating negative side effects. You have to look carefully at our
climate impacts, negative and positive, and then weigh them against the benefits that come with
fossil fuels, including all the benefits that protect us from climate. So there's this false
alternative. So what they did is they owned the morality of caring about our environment and they
owned the claim to science because the climate change denial thing so-called didn't make much
sense because it's pretty obvious we impact climate at least some. But so doing those two
things they owned this issue so people think well if I want to be a good person, if I want a good
planet and I want to be pro-science, then I have to hate fossil fuels. And a lot of what I've tried
to do and I think Michael Schellenberger of Bjorn Lomborg and Steve Kuhn and I think what we've
tried to do is look at climate in a humanistic full context way and we're breaking this false
alternative which is a lot of the reason we get a lot of hostility. So you said something there
that's very psychologically interesting. So you said if I want to be a good person because the
environmentalists have captured this pro-planet narrative, if I want to be a good person then I
have to buy the human beings are bad for the planet narrative. But I'd like to take that
apart a little bit too because it's not exactly true what you said. The truth of the matter is
something like if I want to take a shortcut to a good person without having to being a good person,
without having to put into the process any real time and effort. So that would mean
actually understanding the issues that are associated with environmental management and
economic sustainability which is unbelievably complicated. I mean Bjorn, while in U2,
Schellenberger spent their whole lives devoted to that endeavor trying to
wade through the complexities. It's actually really difficult to develop a sophisticated
and genuinely moral stance on the environment and the economy. It takes years and years of work
and it's also extremely difficult to be a good person and merely feeling sorry for the planet
does not make you a good person. In fact what it makes you is a shallow narcissist who's using
the easy identification with a genocidal ideology to elevate yourself in the moral hierarchy.
And we see people who are peddling this dreadful story to young people and offering them an easy
shortcut to something approximating easily trumpeted moral virtue. And that's the sort of moral virtue
that you can post on your Facebook page when you claim that while you're anti-capitalist and you're
in favor of the planet and therefore all of a sudden you're actually a moral actor and someone to be
regarded with admiration and none of that's true because it's actually it's very difficult to be a
good person. But it's very powerful that I agree entirely but it is very powerful and one thing
I talk about in fossil future and this is a big mission of mine is the moral monopoly of what I
call the moral case for eliminating fossil fuels has to be broken. And when you have what I call a
moral monopoly you basically get a halo over your head for saying I hate fossil fuels, I care about
the climate, I care about the planet. You don't need to do anything. You just need to express this
sentiment. It doesn't matter. We see you can fly on private jets, you can live any lifestyle that
you want. As long as you say this you get this halo and the other side gets devil horns on their
head. But part of what's happened with what I call the energy humanists including me and Bjorn
and Michael and Steve is that we have now shown that actually quote saving the planet in their
false view is hurting billions of people and dooming them to poverty and actually making our
environment worse and hurting biology. And so now they hate that. That's why there's such vicious
attacks because their racket is coming to a close. You want it to be a controversial. The first thing
before winning a debate is actually creating a debate. There hasn't even been a debate over the
morality of fossil fuels until fairly recently. And once the debate is created that that easy
claim to virtue will disappear and those people will just go pick the next easy thing to join.
Yeah, well you said that all you have to do is express the sentiment that you care for the planet.
So that's something approximating a feeling or a subjective state of mind. Let's say I'm a good
person because I feel empathy for the planet, which is a pretty damn low resolution definition
implementable morality. But you know it's tied in with something else too.
So imagine you're trying desperately to make that case that the reason I'm good is
because I feel sorry for things including the planet. Well then you have to also
buttress that claim with the insistence that sentiment, subjective sentiment itself
is the only valid arbiter of reality. And so that's something like I feel therefore I am.
And I see that this in this entire modern movement that insists that identity is nothing other than
subjective feeling is actually associated in a perverse manner with this ability to justify
a claim to moral superiority by appeal to sentiment. It's like it's people see a picture of a
like a bedraggled kitten on the internet and they go oh and they think that because they have
that reflexive response which you know has a certain moral virtue that all of a sudden they're
morally admirable people. And that's a lovely thing to believe and you can extend that to something
like well I'm so concerned about the planet that I can barely sleep at night. It's like well fair
enough that might be an indicator of your moral virtue although I suspect not. But the real question
is do you actually know anything about the problem? Have you spent any work real work in
differentiating your knowledge of the problem? Are you taking any concrete steps whatsoever to solve
it apart from hand waving sentimentally? And do you have metrics in place that actually help you
measure whether or not what you're doing has a beneficial impact? And that's also complex that
if you bring to people's attention the necessity of thinking it through all they do is get irritated
at you like they get irritated with. Lomborg's a classic example because he's the person I think
and I'd like your opinion on this you know. I don't think there is anybody who's a more effective
advocate for genuine progress on the environmental front than Bjorn Lomborg. He's thought it through
as far as I can tell more deeply than anyone else perhaps in the world. And it's stunning to me
the degree to which his ideals fail to gain traction. And I think partly it's because he
makes the issue complicated, right? He says well we don't have just one problem, too much carbon.
We have like 20 problems or 100 and they all need to be attended to but we need to
rank order them and we have to do that in a methodologically rigorous manner. It's like
well we don't want to do any of that we just want to feel good about what we feel good about and we
want to make a claim that that makes us morally virtuous. And it's certainly the case as far as
I can tell that our educational systems are enticing young people to adopt exactly that attitude
and then to also engage in this demonization that you described.
So I think one powerful dynamic with this free virtue that you get by just saying I care about
this issue I care about the planet is that it's been given the stamp of science because it's
scientific to just say hey the planet is being destroyed by fossil fuels we need to do something
about it and it's really as long as you feel some way or you vote some way that is considered
totally sufficient. There's nothing to think about but so it's really sad and shameful that science
has been has been stamped on this incredibly irresponsible way of thinking. And one thing
I've tried to do and I think Bjorn does this but I think I do it probably most explicitly and I
think it's very very important to do it explicitly is I keep talking about the benefits of fossil
fuels and how the other side is ignoring the benefits of fossil fuels. So I go as far as to
call the other side fossil fuel benefit deniers I also call them climate mastery deniers because
they deny our ability to master climate danger. And I think people can really get that we're
thinking about this issue in a way that makes no sense because we're only looking at the negative
side effects of fossil fuels we're not looking at the benefits. And if you look at my work the
moral case for fossil fuels fossil future it's really stressing the goodness of fossil fuels
not just fossil fuels aren't as bad as you think but they're an actual positive good and I've seen
you make this case as well. I think it's very very powerful it's imagine my book had been called
fossil fuels aren't quite as bad as you think. It would have made no impact what's really needed
we've had this inverted morality that said that that says that food is poison and poison is food
and I think it's not enough to just to say oh they go too far it's to say no they are attacking
something good and once you have a positive case for fossil fuels the other side goes on the
defensive you watch what happens when I debate when people will debate me they don't really have an
answer to looking at the full picture their answer is call me a climate change denier try to smear
me but they can't answer the argument of if you look at the full context benefits and side effects
of what's good for human flourishing fossil fuels are incredibly good and will remain good for the
foreseeable future. That climate change denier phrase is a real interesting one too because
that's a phrase that's so manipulatively propagandistic that it's almost incomprehensible
I mean the reason that that phrase emerged is because there's been we've developed a universal
consensus that denying the reality of the holocaust was a moral crime and so the propagandists took
a leaf from that page and said well the people who are denying the cataclysmic reality of climate
change are as morally culpable as those who deny the holocaust which implies that they're as culpable
as the Nazis who run the death camps and that's a pretty decent smear and then you might say well
what's the moral advantage to doing that and so the first thing you might point out is well you get
to have all the unearned moral virtue that goes along with saying that just because you're sentimental
about the planet in some vague way that you're now a moral paragon and that solves all your moral
problems and then conveniently at the same time you get to identify a group of people who are
essentially satanic in their motivations and so that would be the climate change deniers and so
that entire problem of evil which you no longer contend with in your own life because you're on
the side of the moral is dumped at the feet of the people that you deem as enemies that's that form
of scapegoating that Rene Girard talked about and so young people are being enticed to do two things
is one is to adopt it three things to adopt an extremely simple minded view of the problems
and opportunities that confront us second to claim a completely unearned moral virtue merely on the
basis of a vague sentiment and third and more dangerously to localize the problem of evil
in the minds and souls of the people who are hypothetically opposed to their
self aggrandizing sentiment and the combination of those three moral errors is really dangerously
toxic and that dangerous toxicity I would say is manifesting itself in such things as these
this idiot insistence let's say in the UK because they're suffering from this more than any other
place now maybe except Germany on the moral benefits of an impossible net zero right the
rubber is really starting to hit the road in the last couple of years as energy prices have spiked
out of out of reach of many people and the unreliability of these hypothetically benevolent
renewables has become more and more self evident and so we're walking a very dangerous moral path
here right easy moral virtue the the our inability to point out that a lot of this moral virtue is
driven by an unthinking ignorance combined with this temptation to demonize those who
are like lomborg shellenberger you you're a good example as well who are standing up and saying
hey wait a minute everyone um we've lifted billions of people out of absolute privation and starvation
as a consequence of the utilization of fossil fuels and they're so fundamental that we can't
shift away from them rapidly that's actually practically impossible without tilting people
into the kind of abject poverty that's going to cause widespread starvation it's like that
doesn't sound like a case being made by satan to me no it's uh i mean i do think that the energy
crisis is an enormous educational opportunity it's obviously a tragedy and it's as somebody who's
been talking about this for 15 years and advising in the opposite direction it's very sad to see
myself being right in terms of if you artificially restrict the supply of fossil fuels in a world
that needs more energy and you don't have a viable near-term replacement then prices are going to
skyrocket including food prices and the price of everything else like this this was obvious that
this was going to happen and it's hard to see it but at least the benefit is that people can see
that the establishment has failed that's the benefit of a crisis people see the establishment has
failed and the key is in my view two things one is the right people need to be implicated and the
right people need to be vindicated and i say the right people need to be implicated not as a vindictive
person at all uh but it's very important when you have a crisis and this happened with 9-11
happened with the financial crisis you know you need to have some idea of who is responsible
and then who was right and gave us better advice if you look at today's energy crisis
the number one thing that is scary about it is that it is a crisis that has come from the from
the net zero movement not even only achieving one percent of their goals so they have not even reduced
the supply of fossil fuels i want to stress that again they haven't even reduced the supply
they just slowed its rate of growth they already wanted to dramatically reduce the supply that was
their goal we were supposed to be using way less fossil fuel by now they just slowed the growth
and that was enough to cause a global energy crisis in a world that needs far more energy so
that should really wake us up what if we actually start on their path of getting rid of fossil fuels
and again we have 27 years now 27 years and less than a month as we record this to achieve net
zero which in effect means getting rid of fossil fuels we can talk about offsets and stuff that
doesn't work at any scale that there's any evidence of so it's really this this homicidal movement
in its in its consequences and i do think people are waking up and they're particularly waking up
to the idea that hey we ignored the benefits of fossil fuels or what i call our designated experts
did this and these people need to be jettisoned you cannot listen to anybody about energy and
climate who ignores the benefits of fossil fuels to billions of people because if you do you get an
energy crisis and if we keep listening to them it's going to get a lot worse well the other
thing that you see being the drum being beaten on the side of the radical left for example is
the anti-colonial um let's say this continual trumpeting of the anti-colonial interference
message and so then i look at that and i think well you give the devil is due and the fact that
the world's cultures have come into contact with one another in a dramatic way in the last 300
years has produced all sorts of consequences some positive and some negative but um on the
anti-colonial front the environmental proposition and this is mostly coming from the radical left is
that there's no possible way that the third world inhabitants can be allowed much less encouraged
to develop a standard of living that in any manner approximates the profligate west is that
we're rich and you know maybe we should suffer from that a bit and maybe we should pay reparations
let's say but all those poor people who are desperately trying to clamber up the socioeconomic
hierarchy so they don't die let's let's make that perfectly clear they can't be allowed to do that
because their environmental footprint will immediately become so large that the planet
itself will be destroyed and so okay what's the consequence of that well the consequence of that
is that they should be poor and stay that way and should shut the hell up about it and should be happy
about it and perhaps there should be a hell of a lot fewer of them and if that doesn't trigger
your anti-colonialist morality then you've got some serious thinking to do because i just don't
understand at all how it is that those of us in the wealthy west and this would certainly include
those in the chattering environmental glitterati elite class i have no sense whatsoever how they're
in a moral position to be lecturing the developing world about how they should accept limits to growth
which means for example that their children won't have access to enough nutrition to even
optimize their their brain development as they mature it's like oh that's the price those people
get to pay hey those people those poor people in developing countries who don't get to be wealthy
and by wealthy means have enough to eat and have schools to send their children and we in the western
world we can sit on our high horse and say well we used fossil fuels and oops sorry about that and
all the carbon but you bastards you can just you can just accept your lot and if you stop breeding
so goddamn much that would be a good thing too now how that is it's colonial to a degree that's
overwhelming is beyond me well it's it is and i think it's a very very powerful argument and
it's been one of these things that has been ignored because the priorities of the modern
environmental movement are not what they say and i would say more broadly the anti-capitalist
movement they claim to be concerned about the poor but if you're concerned about the poor
and you know that fossil fueled productivity has brought an unprecedented number of people out of
poverty in recent decades you would think about how do we expand that how do we replicate what
happened in china what happened in india you know some changes to it obviously but how do we
how do we you know they use seven times more fossil fuels compared to four 40 years ago like
it's it's obviously fueled their productivity and their prosperity why don't we do more of that and
yet there's been no attention paid in the culture to the energy poor there's no attention paid to
the fact we have three billion people who use less electricity than one of our refrigerators uses
we have a third of the world using wood and animal dung to eat their homes and to cook their food
and in terms of you're mentioning wealthy people three quarters of the world uses an amount of
energy that that we would consider totally unacceptable in the us or canada or anything
resembling that so once these facts are pointed out it is obvious that there is a moral imperative
to do at least nothing to get in the way of people using at least that at least that and it's clear
that the anti-fossil fuel movement is absolutely getting in the way they're trying to destroy
all loans to fossil fuels there they're trying to encourage them to use things that will not
actually work for them they're trying to for example throughout africa limit oil and gas development
even though that's a huge potential source of prosperity but they're not winning this argument
once sunlight has been exposed and i had a personal experience i don't know if you heard about this but
the washington post tried to basically cancel my book fossil future back before it came out they
got a copy of the book they didn't read the book which i thought that was their job as journalists
report on a book from a major author instead what they tried to do is dig up what i had written in
college where i had said very specifically the poor world needs more capitalism and more
individualism which i stand by but they somehow tried to portray that as colonialism but here's
the key their whole argument was alex eppstein doesn't really care about the poor so you don't
have to listen to his arguments about the poor needing fossil fuels this is a bizarre ad hominem
on its face it's completely the opposite of the truth but it was notable to me how they had no
answer to this argument that poor people need fossil fuels and that the anti fossil fuel movement
hurts the poor people most so i think that really shows the power of this argument let's delve into
that issue of caring about the poor because i don't think that it is really all that wise for any of
us to jump up and down about how much we care for the poor because if you cared for the poor you'd
be out there doing something with your life to directly benefit the poor and that turns out to
be extremely well i i have i have i don't mean i don't mean you i don't mean you oh okay speaking
more generally it's not that easy to care about the poor and so i think that any of us who trumpet
the idea that we truly care about the poor should be very careful about that but having said that i
would also say we could though say even if we don't care about the poor any more than the typical
somewhat selfish human being we could at least get the hell out of their way when they're trying to
clamber their way up the socioeconomic hierarchy and that was the case that you made just a few
minutes ago is that we could at least in the west not implement policies that actually
interfere in a serious manner with the attempts of the developing world to lift themselves out of
absolute privation we could at least get the hell out of the road and we wouldn't have to do that by
hand waving about how moral we are in our care for the poor we could say well we're relatively
disinterested at minimum but we won't go out of our way to make your lives more miserable than
they have to be while you use your own efforts to acquire for yourself some of the things that
we've managed to acquire we can't even do that i think it's a great point and so for me yeah i
don't want to act like i'm just ministering to every poor person in the world or this kind of
thing i mean look i i live in a free country i love doing work that i find really interesting
and i love that it benefits a lot of people including some of the poorest people
in the world and one the particular way in which i identify with the poorest people in the world
is with the lack of freedom because i really think about what what would it like be like to not be
born in the us whatever advantages i had being born in the us is by far the greatest and i really
think about you know how can more people be born into that and really the number one thing we need
to do is spread good ideas and not spread bad ideas and and this is where the antifausal
field movement is so destructive particularly you've probably seen this recent climate reparations
thing yeah which is saying hey we owe the poor world and i i wrote about this recently people
can see it at energytalkingpoints.com which is where i post my new stuff but the there's there's the
idea that we should feel guilty for ruining the world and i believe we've made the world better
for everyone including the poor but the other element that is obviously wrong is what is happening
is we are paying people off usually dictators off to not use fossil fuels so we are paying them to
deprive people of the crucial freedom to get prosperity and that is just totally shameful and
that is absolutely interfering in the lives of the world's poorest people. Right so with our
so-called climate reparations that are going to be devoted to the the governments of third world
countries primarily we're going to be propping up frequently brutal quasi-dictatorships and bribing
them to keep their populations poor yes so that we don't save the planet that's our plan.
That is that is a plan i mean again it's it's not a movement that actually has any kind of goal
in strategy long term it's really just hostility toward any impact and at the moment it's CO2
emissions so anything that has CO2 emissions you hate but observe look there's no enthusiasm for
nuclear right which you would expect them to love because it doesn't have CO2 there's hatred
for nuclear there's hatred for hydro and there's hatred for mining which is necessary for solar
and wind which require way more mined materials than anything else there's so it's really an
anti-impact movement that's just hostile to any human impact and just nihilistically and
randomly pursues that with no strategy and no thinking about the future and this mentality
is leading the world this is what i call our knowledge system it is blindly pursuing this
destructive anti-human path with no strategy okay so let's let's delve into that a little bit
that motivation for that so i'm going to play devil's advocate here a bit and and and let you
respond to it so the first thing we might point out is that the the human proclivity for something
approximating unspoiled natural vistas actually seems to have a moral element and a biologically
rooted moral element so for example our our aesthetic preferences seem to be associated
with something like preference for natural landscapes that are verdant and green and
potentially productive in relationship to agriculture and and the flourishing of let's
say edible animals with enough water we like landscapes that look like that we think they're
beautiful and the idea that we might prefer those if they were unspoiled is also worth delving into
to some degree because we do need to live in balanced harmony with such environments so that
we don't destroy the very virtue that they they implicitly contain and so and our aesthetic
preferences tilt us in that direction and so we have a bit of a biological tilt towards not wanting
to gum up and pollute the works okay so so there's that and then we also have this moral sense that
we have a moral obligation right and so the moral obligation is to be grateful
to be cognizant of our unearned privilege and so for you that would be the fact that you were born
in the United States and that you were a accidental beneficiary of all the work that had gone into
that great society before you made your appearance on the scene and that there's a moral obligation
on your part in some sense to do something about that right and so and that can both of those can
be warped the warping of the first one is to push that moral and aesthetic sensibility to the point
where we claim that any human interaction with that pristine environment whatsoever is tantamount to
to to to immorality and on the second front it is that
the way to atone for our privilege is by being guilty and stopping all activity so those things
dovetail we might say instead that if we wanted to genuinely contend with the problem of our
unearned privilege and the fact that we walk on land that is being soaked by the blood of conflict
for generations right there's a certain guilt in that a certain sense you might say even of
original sin is that we do have to atone but the proper proposition on the sophisticated front
would be something like well we should atone by putting into place thoughtful and intelligent
and genuinely pro-human environmental slash economic policies and we should atone in our
private lives for our unearned privilege by being people whose moral striving is so admirable that
we've justified the existence of our privileges and we shouldn't be taking the easy way out and
saying just because we're sentimental about Gaia means that we've somehow fulfilled our moral
obligation we're doing a very bad job of teaching young people this as far as I can tell so like
the guilt's there right the the sense of original sin is there the sense that we're responsible for
the atrocity of history in some sense is there that needs to be contended with but we're constantly
looking for easy ways out of the problem instead of actually trying to address it head on well
let's start out with the the first part in terms of this this like sense of what we like in natural
landscapes and we like life and so I certainly have a version of this myself I mean I'm very
obsessed with the ocean and I spend way more time outdoors than most people and I just like
I think people underrate being outdoors a lot and and you know I love seeing different kinds of
animals and their natural habitat so like I definitely experienced this but when I when I
think of it then what I think about is in impacting the earth we want to make sure we impact the earth
in a way that allows us to really enjoy this and in fact have more of it there's a lot of
things we can do to make the earth more beautiful and to enhance it with respect to our aesthetic
sensibilities and I think the the best thing forever in this regard was Frank Lloyd Wright
because if you look at his buildings and how he approached it he loved nature but he also
thought that we could improve nature and that's really what you're doing as a human being is
you're saying I can improve nature so you're not hostile to nature but you view it as what I call
wild potential it has the potential to be an amazing place for us it has all these different
building blocks and all these starting things and some of them we want to preserve some of them we
want to change a lot and even the things we want to preserve we want to make a lot more accessible
to everyone which requires changing a lot so I think of it as we can do an even better job
at making the earth an amazing place to live but part of that is recognizing we've done a really
good job in a lot of ways the earth is so much of a better place to live than it was 500 years
ago 200 years ago the world is you know it's naturally it's naturally dynamic it's deficient
and it's dangerous like those are three attributes that's why I call it wild potential and so human
beings have had to contend with that and to bring up fossil fuels our basic way of contending with
that is to try to produce a lot of value that nature doesn't produce for us nature produces
not very much value that we can use and it produces a lot of threats so we need productive
ability to create resources nature doesn't including to create resources that neutralize the
different threats like creating irrigation to neutralize drought and what we do that with
our productive ability but we're naturally very physically weak beings and so the key step is
using machines to produce far more value than our meager physical bodies can and that's what
we've done with fossil fuels we've had cost effective energy that has allowed say the average
American to have 75 machine servants producing value so that we can do far more than we ever
could and we can do types of things that we never could like no number of human beings can fly
no number of human beings can be an incubator which you know save millions incubators save
millions of lives so we've made the earth so much of a better place and I think we can make it even
more beautiful and I think a lot of the specific things we create are ugly and that's a shame
but I think of it as we've done a good job and we can do even better not that we're these sinners
who have ruined who ruin everything by touching it that is a that is a hostile view and it's an
unjustified view so I think we can be more like Frank Lloyd Wright but we should be proud of what
we've done so far and in terms of obligation I mean I feel gratitude for it I don't feel like
anyone has really sinned or I've sinned or but I feel like the obligation is to is to keep going
trying to make it better and better and I think just by being a productive person
that's really what you're doing but because I think about global issues I try to advise people
globally so let me ask you about this psychologically so obviously people there are a lot of people
particularly young people perhaps who are bearing a heavy load of existential guilt for the fact of
their very existence and so you just made something approximating a pro-human case and so I would ask
you a psychological question how do you think you've conducted yourself in your own life
effectively so that that sense of existential guilt that potential hostility towards human
endeavor itself or even human existence has been ameliorated like what have you done that you
believe is sufficiently valuable to justify the cost of your own existence but I guess
why would I I don't understand why I would feel it in the first place because the people who feel
it have a very warped at least the environmental version we can talk about other versions but
the environmental slash climate version is this very warped delicate nurture view of the earth
that the earth is stable sufficient and safe and our impact ruins it and if you believe that
and you hear all this propaganda then you think yeah we're all you are all ruining the delicate
nurture but if you have that view it's a very damaging view but I don't have the view so I don't
understand why I would feel so bad yeah but people that's the thing is that and I think we need to
contend with this right because people do have that view and lots of people have it and it's easy
let's say for educators who are pushing this ideological agenda to capitalize on the prevalence
of that view that's why I'm pointing to something like an intrinsic sense of original sin is that
we have this sense as human beings or many people do that in some real sense
we have to atone for the crime of our existence and I think there's something to that I think that
we have to bear a moral burden that justifies the the crime of our existence so to speak
and that would mean that we have to be genuinely well in your terminology we have to be genuinely
productive people let's say we have to be genuinely productive people that are aiming up
maybe in relationship to such things as working for the amelioration of absolute poverty like
there is a moral calling there and I think that part I think of it differently okay I think of it
differently so I think of existence as an opportunity so I think of it as it's just this
amazingly special thing that you know any of us exist in the first place I mean probably you
think about the probabilistic nature of it and I feel like being on earth is just this amazing
opportunity and you can look at how different people have handled that throughout history and
how they handle it today and I think a lot of people tragically haven't made the most of it but I
think you can see certain things that people do who have made the most of it and find it fulfilling
and for me one of the observations is people who choose a certain kind of creative work it
it is makes a huge difference I'm guessing you've experienced I've certainly experienced this in
terms of just finding something that creates value in the world that really really works with
how you like to use your mind the thought process hopefully you get to work with certain kinds of
people I mean that's just part of it there are all kinds of other opportunities of being alive so I
don't think about it all as oh it's we're guilty and this is bad I think the only guilt is wasting
the opportunity that's that's where my kind of fear and guilt come in is like I worry about oh did I
waste the opportunity of being alive and part of that is of course you don't want to live at the
expense of others and ruin the well that's another way of wasting it but so I think of life as
opportunity not as not as atonement well right and we should also we could address there too the
issue that if you conduct yourself successfully so let's say that you are as a consequence prosperous
there is also this underlying presumption that's generally unexamined that you had to do that at
someone else's expense right it's something like a zero sum game and that ties into this whole
Malthusian view that were yeast in a petri dish with finite resources and the truth of the matter
I think is that if you conduct yourself in the highest manner properly then you end up being
creatively productive in a manner that doesn't just benefit you selfishly but simultaneously
benefits many other people and also facilitates their ability to do the same thing and so that's
a vision of a kind of harmony that's a high-order ethical calling is you don't have to pursue your
creative exploitation of possibility at the cost of the possibility or at the cost of other people
quite the contrary you could increase the possibility which we could do on the natural front
and you could increase the ability of others to flourish simultaneously yes and I want to really
highlight because earlier you responded you said all these people have been have been immersed
in this what I call this dogma this delicate nurture dogma and I would add a piece to this
dogma it's the view that the earth is delicate nurture that's stable sufficient and safe and
then it goes along with what I call the parasite polluter view of human beings which you're getting
out with the Malthusian view so the view that all we do with our impact is we take from the earth
and we destroy it we make it ugly we disrupt it in this kind of thing and in so far as you view
the world this way you are going to have a bad life and you're going to be really unhappy
because you're going to feel really guilty and you're going to feel really pessimistic and you're
going to believe in all of these apocalyptic scenarios so it's it's why it's a fundamental
thing that needs to be done to reeducate people about the basic nature of earth and the basic
nature of human beings and replace so delicate nurture with what I call wild potential and this
parasite polluter view with what I call the producer improver view we actually produce value
and we can improve the earth and we can do even more and in fossil future I talk about this as
part of the human flourishing framework a key part of how we have to think about this issue
is change our view of human beings and earth from an anti-human view to a pro-human view and if
once you change that in people it is life changing because it's their their whole view of how the
world works changes from this terribly sad and destructive view to a very optimistic view and
that that's one of the things I'm grateful for is early on I learned pro-human environmental
philosophy and that was a huge gift that I got when I was 18 how did you learn that why were you
fortunate enough to learn that well maybe we'll leave that look we have to stop we have to stop
this part of it we'll get into that in the next part of our discussion so for everybody who's
watching and listening I do an extra half an hour with my guests on the daily wire plus platform
as part of the arrangement that I've made with them to increase the professional appearance
and quality of my podcasts for example which as you are noticing are still available on YouTube
free for wide distribution I do an extra half an hour with people I would be interested and
I'm going to continue to talk to to elix on the daily wire plus platform about his philosophical
journey because you've definitely taken an unpopular stance and a minority unpopular stance
and you did that pretty early 2014 is pretty early given all things considered and and you
did it quite successfully you haven't been particularly effectively cancelled interestingly
enough and I'd like to find out what your pathway was to your realizations and how you manage that
hello everyone I would encourage you to continue listening to my conversation with my guest on
