You're living through an inflection point in human evolution.
Between tech like AI, quantum computing and biotech,
the next decade will bring about more dramatic change
than the last 100 or even 200 years combined.
Virtually every aspect of our lives
is about to be disrupted.
For the unprepared, this will be devastating.
But for those that take the time
to understand the most likely path forward,
there will be huge opportunities.
To help you better navigate what's coming,
I bring you futurist Peter Diamandis.
Given the state of AI and quantum computing,
do you think that we're on the brink of human immortality?
I think we're on the brink of a health span revolution.
The immortality comes when we can scan the brain
and upload you into the cloud.
You think that's the only way we have to transcend biology?
People have to realize we're constantly replenishing
all of the cells of our body anyway, right?
Like the oldest cells in your body
are your fat cells that are an average of eight years old.
Given AI, given quantum technology,
we're gonna start to understand why we age,
how to slow it, stop it, maybe reverse it.
And I think those things will get us north of 100 years.
The bowhead whale, the largest mammal, can live 200 years.
Greenland shark can live 500 years
and have pups at 200 years old.
And the question is, if they can live that long,
why can't we?
And for me, it's either a hardware problem
or a software problem.
And we're getting the tools to be able to deal with
and edit our software, edit our hardware.
And for people who are saying,
well, am I gonna be part of that?
Am I gonna live for hundreds of years?
Am I gonna have the chance to be immortal
and to put aside the immortal part again?
I think your mission should be,
how do I live long enough, healthfully enough
to intercept the breakthroughs that are coming?
Right, so it's interesting,
someone asked me a question,
like how long do you wanna live?
Right, and I remember when I was in medical school,
I set a 700 year lifespan, which is a ridiculous number.
It's ridiculous because if I can live,
I think another 30 years from now,
the breakthroughs we're gonna see
are gonna buy you the next 30 or 100 years.
So your goal is to live long enough to intercept
what's called longevity escape velocity.
Yeah, that to me feels very plausible
when I think about the magic trick that is AI.
Walk me through what you think is the rough timeline,
and I fully acknowledge that looking into the future
when you're talking about something as revolutionary as AI
becomes a little bit comical,
but I think that it helps to map how you think about
how this is gonna work,
like what the problems are that we're gonna solve,
where's the intersection of AI and quantum computing?
You're the only one I really hear talking about that
and its importance in this revolution.
What is it about quantum computing
you think is going to help?
Are there qualities of AI
that are only gonna be possible with quantum computing?
What are the next steps?
Let me define, first of all, lifespan and health span.
So lifespan is how long you live,
how long your heart is beating,
how long your brain is processing.
Health span is how long you've got the vital energy
to enjoy life.
Get up in the morning, play with your kids,
your grandkids, go for a hike, enjoy yourself,
have the mental, physical vitality, right?
That's health span, and that's really what we want.
If someone says, I don't wanna live to 120 years old,
it's because they have a mental image
of being in a wheelchair drooling, right?
That's not what we're speaking about here.
If I said to you at 120,
your mind was as sharp as that ever was,
you could hit the ground and do 40 pushups,
and would you wanna live to 120?
And I think anybody who is loving life would say yes.
So that's our goal, it's that level of vitality.
So AI, AI is gonna play in this
by helping us understand such a complicated situation.
So why do some people live to 100 or 115 or 120?
And smoke, you know, and still get that far out, right?
Why some people, other people die at 50 or 60.
And I think aging is, in human biology,
so complicated that we're still deciphering it,
we're still untangling this process.
And there's so much data we can now get.
And we've talked about, you know,
one of my companies, Fountain Life,
is sort of like the most advanced diagnostics you can do.
So when I go to Fountain Life,
and we've got centers around the US,
I will be digitally uploaded.
So in the course of a day, I will have a full body MRI,
an MRI of my brain, brain vasculature,
brain blood flow, coronary CT, looking for soft plaque,
dexa scan, 120 blood biomarkers,
metabolome, microbiome, your genetics, everything, right?
So it's 150 gigabytes of data.
And that data over the course of thousands of individuals
can only be analyzed by AI.
But then we can start to say,
look, the people who were the healthiest
and didn't have a disease,
or we can look at pre-symptomatic disease,
and the people who developed this over time
had this genetic sequence or had these blood biomarkers.
It's the incorporation of massive data aggregation and AI
that's gonna help us understand
why some people survive and thrive and others don't.
And then what are the therapeutics?
Look at everybody who took rapamycin or metformin
or was on whatever drug combinations.
It's so complicated, but we're running this massive experiment.
And AI is gonna help us to untangle that
and get some insight and say, yes,
for your genetics, for your age, for your objectives,
these supplements are the best for you.
That's one of the things I'm really working to build out
for myself and our members at Fountain Life
is that kind of a correlation.
Like what you wanna do in life, your upload, your genetics,
number of pills we'll intake per day,
this is the right combination for you.
Yeah, I think N of one is gonna be a big part of this.
Okay, I'm gonna lay out my thesis.
Tell me where I go wrong.
So one, I wanna say that I come at this
the way that a sci-fi writer would come at it.
So I understand enough of it to get the gist
and to be able to prognosticate the specifics
will be filled in by people that really know the science.
But the way I see this playing out is that,
okay, we need, this is a game of pattern recognition.
There is a reason, there is a reason why we age.
So step one is gonna be by, I think,
by getting into synthetic data very, very quickly.
So we'll upload whatever the first 10,000, 100,000 people
that go through something like Fountain Life.
And we begin to speak the language of DNA, let's say,
and we're probably need to feed into the AI,
not just human DNA, but across all kinds of species,
feed it as much DNA as we can.
It goes in, it learns the language of DNA.
It begins to feed itself data
and begin to try to predict different outcomes
based on, okay, this environment with this genetic code,
this drug interaction, whatever, again,
looking for the massive amount of data
but trying to parse out the different patterns in it
so that it can isolate what the problem is.
Now, with my very sort of layman understanding
of all of this, my, again, just guess at this point
is that what's really going on is the epigenome
is where all this breaks down.
You know, Davidson-Claire study, as well as I do,
which showed that even if you breed a mouse
to just get massive amount of breaks in its DNA,
over time, the DNA still looks the same.
Like we are able to repair the DNA.
It isn't what we used to think it was,
which is you're getting these mutations in the DNA
over time and the DNA is effectively getting corrupted.
But something is happening.
And so if that something is the epigenome
where we're just, we're mistagging it.
Again, this is my layman's explanation of how this works.
But they're going in and putting in the wrong bookmarks.
For people that don't know how this works,
your DNA is basically really tightly wound.
And a little bit of it gets exposed to say,
I'm an eye cell, I'm a skin cell, I'm a heart cell, whatever.
And as you age, you're de-differentiating.
And so your eye cell maybe now isn't purely an eye cell
because parts of the DNA are unraveling.
So it's a little bit of a skin cell,
a little bit of a heart cell, a little bit of an eye cell.
And so now this is where the function begins
to grade over time.
If the AI can figure out, okay, cool,
that really is the problem.
This is exactly what's going on.
Here are the Yamanaka factors or whatever
that you need to put to work to rewind the cell
so that it resets.
And so now we're getting the bookmarks
in all the right places.
That part, once that's figured out, again,
my gut instinct is that's gonna be handled
through the AI using quantum computing
to be able to crunch just an unbelievable amount
of synthetic data.
So we don't have, because if you have to feed in
millions or billions of people,
like I just worry that that's gonna take way too long
for somebody of my age.
But if we can do this via synthetic data,
then the odds that it goes faster go way up.
Where's the flaw in that thinking?
Listen, when I was in medical school,
I don't know, 35 years ago,
I went arguably to the best medical university
and engineering schools on the planet.
And none of this was being talked about.
All of this is really, this entire conversation
is the last five, six years.
And it's moving very fast.
It was heresy before I talk about longevity
or age reversal.
And now it's one of the hottest subjects on the planet
because it's the biggest marketplace.
I mean, what would you not pay
for an extra 20 or 30 health years of life?
So yes, we are to echo what you said.
If you think about it, each of us get 3.2 billion
nucleotides, our genome, 3.2 billion letters
from our mom and from our dad.
And you've got that same genome when you're born,
when you're 20, when you're 50, when you're 100,
maybe when you're 150.
But why don't you look the same
if you've got the exact same instruction set?
When do you have a 12-pack, if that's a thing,
or a six-pack, whatever, when you're 80,
like you had when you were 20?
That one I can answer, but the face I think is,
because the six-pack has everything to do
with your lifestyle.
If you're just putting on too much fat,
that's what it is.
I mean, my point simply being is
why don't you have the physique
or the ability to build muscle
or everything of your youth when you're 100?
Why is there a difference?
And it isn't your genome,
it isn't your 3.2 billion letter instruction set.
It is what you just said a minute ago, your epigenome,
epi for the Greek word for above,
and it's the control system.
And you're right.
When you're just born, or when you're 10,
or when you're 20, when you're 80,
different genes are on and different genes are off.
And the epigenome is the control
of which genes are on and which genes are off.
At the highest level, it is the control
of the genes for skin are on in your skin cells
and the gene for your hepatocytes are on in your liver.
And so they're different cells, they've differentiated,
turning certain, silencing certain genes and saying,
your genes aren't needed here in the skin cell,
you don't need to be purifying out urine.
And so as you age, what apparently is going on
is that the control of which genes are on
and which genes are off are beginning to blur.
And as you're getting older,
the genes that should be off are turned on,
or the genes that should be on are turned off.
I'll give you an example, skin.
The supple skin of a child, of a newborn, right?
Part of what's going on is we have something like
23 collagen genes and we express multiple collagen molecules
that make your skin give it the texture and so forth.
But as you grow older,
we begin to silence some of those genes.
And so the collagen molecules of the 23,
maybe only eight or nine are expressed.
And so you start to get wrinkles
and your skin starts to look that of an old person.
But can you turn them back on?
So one of the companies, My Venture Fund,
both capitals and InvestorInnism is marble biome,
and it's using genetic engineering,
epigenetic reprogramming to turn back on those genes,
to take back the look and feel of your skin 30 years.
So can we do that across multiple parts of the body?
Can we rejuvenate you in that regard?
And that is definitely one of the hottest topics
out there right now.
Can we turn back the clock?
And in December, 2020, David Sinclair
wrote a very famous paper in which he demonstrated
turning back the clock in the retinal visual systems of mice,
basically reprogramming the epigenome
to go back to where it was earlier
and giving mice that had lost their vision, renewed vision.
And one of his company's life biosciences
is now doing that in primates, right?
And once you're-
Have they already done it?
They're doing in primates right now.
And have they shown that it has the same retinal impact?
I believe they have.
And we're then a fraction of a step away from humans, right?
So this is the hot conversation
of epigenetic reprogramming on one element,
AI on the other.
And I really fundamentally believe
that we're within striking distance
to making a dent in human aging.
And I mean, that's why you and I are here in this moment.
We just announced our $101 million health span XPRIZE,
challenging teams around the world.
It's the largest prize ever in human history.
Challenging teams to restore function
in muscle, immune, and cognition.
Hopefully this is a age reversal therapeutic
that teams will deliver.
We're just looking at three systems.
If the teams going after this health span XPRIZE
are doing something that at the root cause is hitting aging,
then they're likely to hit aging throughout the body.
We're only gonna measure immune, muscle, and cognition
because those are easy to measure.
And for me, as I get older,
I wanna have the immunity to fight
infectious disease and cancer.
I wanna have the muscular vitality to hike
and play with my great grandchildren, right?
And the cognition to be sharp for decades to come.
Okay, so one of the things that I care deeply about
is the timing of all of this.
Yeah, me too buddy.
So with XPRIZE, they have seven years, right?
We announced this now in one month that we had November,
December of 23, and it's a seven year timeframe.
Why seven years?
Do you think that's?
I set seven years originally because if an XPRIZE,
the original XPRIZE, the first one I launched back in 1996
was a $10 million prize for space flight.
And again, these XPRIZE's are not for a paper study,
they're not for an idea.
A team has to actually demonstrate the thing
and then they get the money.
And they keep their IP, the world gets the benefit.
And the first XPRIZE took eight years.
It was launched in 1996.
It was one in 2004 when Bert Rutan,
backed by Paul Allen, built Spaceship One
that Richard Branson then bought the rights to
and created Virgin Galactic.
And since then our prizes have typically taken anywhere
from two to eight years.
We had one prize, a $30 million race to the moon
that Google funded.
It was at a 10 year horizon.
It did not get one.
It got shut down, though two of the teams actually made it
to the moon shortly thereafter, but crashed on landing.
Interesting.
But they still, you know, got to lunar orbit
and still made there, which is a big, big deal,
a Japanese team and an Israeli team.
So by setting a deadline on a prize,
you force teams to actually do something versus sit back.
If it's there forever, they'll take, you know,
the race element does help them accelerate,
but a deadline, when you're facing a deadline,
you're gonna take even more aggressive action.
So seven years for me felt the right length.
The second thing is one of, you know,
our largest donor in this prize is a group called
Evolution, which is based, it's a global nonprofit
based out of Riyadh and out of the U.S.
And Saudi Arabia has a 2030 vision of,
really they have a lot of projects culminating
in the year 2030, and it just so happened
that that is the culmination of this prize as well.
So 2030 works from that perspective as well.
When I think about AI and the rate of advancement,
so I come at things from an entertainment perspective,
and when I look at what's happened in the last 11 months,
quite frankly, it hasn't even been a full year,
that I've been paying attention to text to video,
the leaps are pure insanity.
It is, it's insane.
I was just looking at Emod's latest stability AI,
which as fast as you're typing, you know,
there's an ape with an orange on its head,
hanging from a, you know, bouncing on a trampoline,
and as soon as you add words, the images are changing.
It's insane.
It's crazy.
We're a microstep away from Hollywood movies
being produced by describing them in words.
Yeah, given the rate of change in the last 11 months,
I'm gonna guess in the next five years,
you will see commercials and things done
entirely just text to video.
I think it's two years, five years.
It certainly could be in the next three.
Just given the amount of UI changes they'll have to do,
my gut instinct is that you're looking
at at least three years, but so when I think
about the advancements in longevity,
when I look at what humans have been able to do
just in the last 10 years, it's already incredible.
When you slap AI onto that, then it gets nuts.
What do you think is gonna be the contribution
of quantum computers?
How real is that right now?
So it's, we're the early days of quantum computing
to be clear, right?
Quantum computing is a complicated subject
which I'm not gonna do service to to be very clear, right?
So classical computing is basically computing
that uses ones and zeros on integrated circuit
and a typical binary language.
Quantum computing uses qubits that are basically
can be anything a zero or one
or anything between a zero and a one.
And what we find is it really represents the real world.
We're living in a quantum world.
We're not living in a binary digital world.
We model the world using a binary digital world.
Very advanced binary systems.
We model on a molecular level.
So for example, DeepMind, which is part of Alphabet now,
which created a program called AlphaFold.
And AlphaFold, I remember when I was in medical school
or when I was in undergrad at MIT at the time,
the big grand challenge of the time is
could you predict how a protein would fold?
So a protein is the basic building structure of the body.
It's a structural material.
It's an enzyme.
It's muscle tissue.
It is a sequence of amino acids.
There are 23 essential amino acids here.
These amino acids, when they're assembled in a ribosome,
read from DNA to RNA to a protein.
The sequence of amino acids that are like Lego blocks
strung together begin to fold
into a very predictable 3D structure.
And that 3D structure is everything.
That 3D structure determines what that protein does,
how it functions, how it interacts in a antibody.
And it was always considered,
if you could go from an amino acid sequence,
like I can tell you the sequence of the amino acids
in this thousand amino acid sequence,
and if you could tell me how it would fold,
that would be the most incredibly powerful,
predictive engine on the planet.
And it was a super computing problem.
And it was a couple of years ago now
that AlphaFold, an algorithm out of DeepMind,
cracked that problem.
And it was able to go from an amino acid sequence
to predicting a protein
within a single atomic diameter accuracy.
And then it went on to predict every protein
and how it folds in the human body.
And then Meta created their own version of that
and was able to predict every protein
in the biological ecosystem, like POS.
It's gone insanely fast, right?
So now we can start to design proteins
versus just find out what nature...
We want a protein that is a certain shape
that interacts with a certain key and lock
on the surface of a cell.
But that's all being done in binary.
That's all being done with AI algorithms operating on GPUs.
At a atomic and molecular level, we are quantum systems.
And the belief is that quantum computers
will be able to enable us to model what's going on
at a much higher level of fidelity, much faster.
And so that we can start to understand
the fundamental elements of how life itself works
in a much deeper way and start to model things.
I don't know what factor to use.
Trillions of times faster than a classical computer
because it takes a lot of energy and a lot of time
to model things.
But quantum is gonna be able to model chemistry
and model biology at lightning speeds.
So I believe we're gonna see,
2023, 2024, we're seeing the inflection point of AI.
What does that mean?
It means we're seeing AI growing at unbelievable speeds,
what you said a few minutes ago,
that it's awesome, it's unbelievable how fast it's moving.
And typically an inflection point is like,
it's a slow, slow, like AI.
So AI began, the first conversations in AI were in 1956
at Dartmouth University.
A group of a dozen people came together
to talk about this idea of can we model intelligence
in artificial...
It's been like a summer trying to do it, right?
To try and get the theories and think through it, right?
And then neural networks were proposed
not very long after that,
but we didn't have the computational power
until this past decade to actually start
to put these algorithms into play.
And so while AI is what, 56, 60, 70 years old,
it's only now that we're seeing this massive inflection.
It's the knee of the curve,
it's the point where its speed is so fast, right?
And now we're gonna start to see AI programming AI
and it becomes self-referential
and accelerates even faster.
So quantum is still slow.
It meaning we're getting systems,
we're beginning to learn how to utilize it.
There's like two or three public quantum compute companies.
A friend, I don't know if you know Jack Hittery.
Jack is my board of trustees at X-Prize.
He spun out of Google a company called SandboxAQ.
Yes.
Right?
Eric Schmitz, the chairman, and Jack is the CEO.
And A stands for AI and Q stands for quantum.
And it's a company that's really bringing together
AI and quantum computing.
And his belief is it's gonna be most impactful
in a few key areas and biology and chemistry
is one of those key areas.
Do you find yourself hunching over your desk
and battling back pain after a long day of work?
Invest in a chair that is designed to improve posture,
prevent pain, and maximize productivity.
Anthros is built to be your last office chair
and I'm telling you this thing is amazing.
It's guaranteed to be the most comfortable chair
on the planet while also improving your posture
and reducing pain or your money back.
And I'm telling you, it is also the most fun chair
you were ever going to sit in.
I know that sounds ridiculous, but you have to try it.
Trust me, I have an anthros chair myself
and it is not just me.
Everyone in this office fights over this chair.
I'm not kidding.
I have never had more fun or comfort sitting in a chair.
This thing is amazing.
Head over to anthros.com slash impact
and get $200 off your purchase.
That to me is really fascinating.
The fact that we're gonna be able to manipulate
the building blocks of biology is pretty crazy.
Where do you think that our ability
to predict the folding of proteins goes?
How do we use that with terms of it?
So now the question becomes what drug do you want
in order to handle a certain situation?
So we're going, you know, drug discovery up until now
has been you go in the Amazon forest
and you forage for different leaves and stuff
and you take it back to the lab and you see what you got.
Like rapamycin, which is one of the longevity medications
out there, not going to detail about it,
but it was discovered in a soil sample from Easter Island
which is known as Rapa Nui and that rapamycin
got its name from that.
So this random process of like just finding stuff
and trying to purify it and see if it hasn't effect
on anything is gonna go, we're gonna flip the model
to saying, okay, what exactly do we want
to interact with this receptor on this cell
or block this chemical process inside of the mitochondria
and we're gonna design it.
And then we'll see, does it interact with anything else?
We're gonna start to create in silica models, right?
Computer models of cells in high fidelity
to understand what's going on and how you wanna tweak it.
Do we already have the ability to manufacture this stuff or?
Yeah, absolutely, 100%.
And there's a company called Insilico Medicine,
Alec Zebronkov, who is the CEO, there is a friend.
My venture fund's an investor, full disclosure.
And they have, Insilico Medicine is, as the name says,
we're gonna create medicines in simulation on computers
and then manufacture it and then show that it works.
And they have drugs in phase two or phase three right now
that we're designing a computer
for a particular medical condition and it's working out.
How does drug discovery work exactly using AI?
You're going to understand a molecular process inside a cell
that is causing a disease.
And you're gonna say this particular molecule
is a waste product that's accumulating
that is causing this disease.
And can we create a protein that might go
bind that molecule in a highly accurate fashion
that when it's bound, blocks the disease from occurring
and allows your immune system to clear it, right?
So we're gonna start to tinker with,
and the question then becomes is,
does that molecule you've designed
to block a particular reaction or a waste product,
does it have a secondary negative effect that you don't want?
Right, so you're still gonna go through clinical trials
to determine that there's no downside of that.
Will that be more of a, we have to do it
but in reality we've already run the simulation
six ways a Sunday inside the computer?
There will be a point in the future.
So for example, when SpaceX launched the Dragon capsule
to the space station for the first time,
it worked, it worked perfectly.
They're great engineers,
but the reason it worked fantastic
is they had a highly accurate computer model
of the entire system.
And so they modeled it in high fidelity
and it performed like the model said.
And so for example, more recently we see Starship
making serial advances as it's going towards orbit.
Of course, the crisis news network
and all the media say, oh, Starship fails.
They're like, oh, shit,
it was an amazing incremental success.
The first ship got to a certain point.
The second ship got further.
The third one will probably work perfectly
because those ships are highly instrumented
and all the data's coming back
and the data's being used to advance the models
and saying, aha, this is actually what was going on.
And so let's change this engine or this structural entity.
And we're gonna start to do the same thing in biology,
which we're gonna start to gather enough data
and instrument and understand what's going on
where we can eventually get to a point
where we have a highly accurate model of the human cell.
And not just a cell, but maybe it's an organ.
Maybe it's a thousand cells or a billion cells.
And we're gonna know that this particular designed protein
or medicine, whatever it might be, works perfectly.
And we'll get to a point where you don't need to go
through a massive clinical trial.
How far is that away?
It's probably not the next five or 10 years,
but it is probably 20 to 30 years out.
But the cost of these, right?
And then by the way, this drug works for me, not for you.
By the way, do you know, I don't know the exact number,
but it's pathetic, when a drug is approved by the FDA
and you take, you're prescribed that drug,
what percentage of time the drug actually works for you?
I've heard this before.
It's either 40% of the time it works
or 60% of the time it works for this.
No, it's like under 20%.
No way.
Yeah, and I wanna check that number.
But it's, when a drug goes through
the drug discovery process,
the first goal is do no harm.
Yes.
And by the way, most of the drug discovery process
for the last century has been done in,
or safety trials have been done in men only.
Yeah, there's a good reason for that though.
Well, the reason was that drug companies
didn't wanna deal with menses and menopause and so forth,
right, it was inconvenient.
There's just so much, so many more complications.
But what happened was when drugs were taken off the market
because they failed,
it was because they hadn't tested them in women.
Because you, I mean, why assume that this drug
that we developed for a particular condition
that was safe in men is also safe in women?
Anyway, so first is do no harm, and then does it work?
And when the FDA approves a drug,
it worked in enough people that it was worth approving.
But it doesn't work at 100% in the career circumstances.
And it's a minority number, and I'll have to check on that.
That, yeah, I'm shocked if the punchline
is that the number is that low.
That would certainly speak to the placebo effect
because I've never taken an over-the-counter drug.
It's not true.
It's not that I've never taken one
that I didn't notice anything,
but the ones that I take with frequency,
I'm like, whoa, these really work.
My allergy tablets, my decadestines.
And by the way, it may well be for a narrow course of drugs,
but it doesn't have to work for everybody.
Yeah.
So, all right, let's look at all of this
through the lens of where this goes
and why it's going to work.
So when I think about the problems that AI has to solve
in terms of understanding human biology, what's happening,
that really becomes the goal of AI
is to ascertain what are the set of rules
of physics effectively.
How do I then map that onto a cell?
How do I map that onto all the cells
of makeup in Oregon?
How do I map that onto all the cells
of makeup in human body?
So that's eventually right now.
I mean, so for example,
when you go through Fountain Life,
and I hope you will,
I would love to take you and Lisa through it.
We're opening up in LA in Q3 of this year.
Super excited about that.
That's amazing.
You know, we're going to download
150 gigabytes of data about you.
And we have like, when we do your coronary C-C-T-A
for people listening,
listen, if you've heard about a calcium score,
it really is kind of irrelevant.
People have a heart attack with a zero calcium score.
People with a thousand don't get a heart attack.
It's unless, if your artery is blocked
or your blockage in an artery
that you see some calcified plaque, that's an issue.
You have to make sure that your coronary arteries
that feed oxygen and blood to the heart muscle
are patent and open and feeding it.
But if the plaque on the side of your arteries
isn't blocking the artery and it's calcified,
meaning it's like you have cement on the walls,
but the blood's getting through, that's fine.
What causes the heart attack is soft plaque
that isn't calcified,
that can, in the middle of the night,
break off and evolve.
And all of a sudden, you've got a widowmaker, right?
It is, it is blocked your-
Because it goes downstream, blocks somewhere.
It blocks your artery and your heart muscle
doesn't get blood flow and it dies.
And then you have enough of a heart tissue dies,
you have a heart attack, you die.
And so it's just now using AI to go back to this
that you can take a coronary CT of your heart
and put it through a set of AI algorithms
that can find soft plaque, not the heart,
not the calcified plaque.
And so we do that, we have an AI overlay on that
to determine-
Meaning it's just getting better at reading the images?
It's looking at the data differently than before.
Before all we looked at was calcified
and we've discovered that isn't the issue.
It is the issue if it's blocking
like a 50% occlusion of your left descending artery.
So we get data coming in, 150 gigabytes of data about you
and this data all needs to be looked at by humans,
but that so much data is no way
that any human physician can understand all of that data.
It's way too much to grok, to understand and hold in mind,
but AIs can.
So the first use of AIs are gonna be
to look at the data coming off of your coronary CT,
look at the data coming off of your full body MRI,
to look at the data coming out of your 120 blood biomarkers
and then looking at those individually
and then aggregating them all.
Looking at the population level?
That's where we are today with AI.
Down the line, being able to look at,
on a physics level, subcellular, cellular level,
all of that stuff, sure, that's coming,
but we don't need that to make a huge difference right now.
It's interesting.
Okay, so I'm certainly compelled by where the science is today,
but the thing that I am obsessed with is...
Where's he going?
Where it goes.
And do you think we live in a determined universe?
I sure hope not.
That make it kind of boring though.
Really?
It doesn't seem avoidable to me.
It wouldn't change anything I do
if we're a determined universe.
So the question becomes,
the question for me is,
does quantum mechanics make it deterministic or not?
Because of probability.
Yes.
Okay, so I'll give you my, again,
coming at it like a sci-fi writer and not like a scientist,
but the way that I think about quantum is, okay,
even if the universe that we live in
is simply the most probable universe,
it is still predictably probable.
And this is exactly why we can create GPS,
which is a great example.
So with Newtonian physics, you can't do GPS.
With Einsteinian physics, you can do GPS
because it takes into account relativity
and it becomes specific enough
that you can really nail something down.
I'm perfectly willing to accept that it's possible
that all the dice get rolled at exactly the right way
and I fall through the chair
because just every gap in the chair
lines up with exactly.
So would that happen?
Sure, but that's probably not likely.
And so given that we're in the most probable of all outcomes,
this stuff gets predictable.
Now, I don't understand quantum physics well enough,
but we're-
So you know Bell's theorem.
I don't know Bell's theorem, at least not by that name.
So Bell's theorem is every time a decision is made,
A or B, the universe splits.
Okay, so that I certainly have heard that.
And so we're living in a branch of the universe
that was determined because I said the letter B
instead of the letter A.
Right.
Yeah, what do you take away from that though?
Well, it's deterministic in an infinite number of ways.
Yes, but that wouldn't change your experience.
It wouldn't change my experience of it now.
Yeah, so just without it sort of devolving
into the many fractal branches,
which from a theoretical standpoint
or a philosophical standpoint, it's fun to think about,
but from an experiential standpoint,
the reason I asked this question, by the way,
for those listening, I promise you this is going somewhere,
is that when I look at AI and what AI has to do,
the reason I think AI becomes
the most transformational thing we will ever experience
is because it will finally be able to map out
a deterministic universe.
And once you know the setup, then you can predict the outcome,
which is why I was asking about how understanding
the folding of a protein,
like what powers is that going to give us?
So as a game developer, one of the things
that I think a lot about
is how you can create a very simple set of rules
that has tremendous complexity.
And so I have a feeling that Einstein was right,
that there ultimately will be a very simple equation
that will be self-evident in its elegance
that, oh, this is what the universe is born out of,
because ultimately it is going to boil down
to a set of rules, and it is the set of rules
that give rise to the complexity.
But this is why, and this is one thing
that always fascinated me,
that people without going to space
could predict what space was going to be like,
and therefore say you have to build a spaceship this way,
you have to account for the way the gravity is gonna change,
and Einstein called his most beautiful thought,
I think is how we refer to it,
that a, oh God, I forget how it's actually explained,
but what weightlessness is,
like fundamentally that somebody that was falling,
but had no reference point would simply experience it
as being weightless, oh, that's a horrible explanation,
but anyway, it gets you close enough.
So the fact that he could just think about the rules
of the universe and be like, this must be true,
for this to be true, this is the necessary consequence,
and that he struggled with his own theories
and the predictions that they made
in terms of quantum mechanics.
So did you see recently both DeepMind
and OpenAI released weather prediction models
that were accurate 11 days out?
Whoa.
So this is fascinating,
and I saw this morning a prediction model on Bitcoin.
So...
Tell me more, Peter.
Yeah, well, it was trending up to the end of the year,
not a huge amount, but it was trending up.
I'm a Bitcoin believer.
You and me both.
So anyway, the point being interesting, right?
Can AI make accurate predictions
in seemingly massively complex systems, like weather?
I mean, I can't think of anything more complex than weather,
or the financial markets.
I mean, now it becomes fascinating
if you're actually able to predict,
and then the question becomes, well, if you can predict that,
and I know, is that change my behavior when that changes?
Yes, in weather, no, in financial markets, yes.
Yeah.
I mean, this goes back to, I'll ask you the question.
My thesis is we're living in a simulation,
and it's an nth generation simulation.
We're living within a simulation,
within a simulation, within a simulation,
because I think we're gonna have the technology
to be able to do that, and we will because we can.
And if that's in fact the case,
I would do nothing different than I'm doing right now.
We're in a game.
How do you feel about that?
It's interesting.
So I'm actually wearing a shirt right now.
So I'm wearing a shirt for the video game
that I'm building called Project Kaizen,
which takes that as its hypothesis,
which is everything you've ever known is a simulation.
You have no body anywhere.
There is no biological you.
This is a simulation.
And then once you know it's a simulation,
then you can begin to manipulate it effectively.
And that is me, again, as a sci-fi writer,
trying to explore what it will mean
to understand the rules by which
all of this apparent complexity is born out of.
So I, for a long time, and look, honestly,
it's only been in the last month or two
that I've started thinking maybe this really is a simulation.
Just because the more I do thought exercises,
roving at the edges of what would it mean
for this to be built on a set of rules,
and why would it be built on a set of rules,
and what built it on a set of rules?
You just start asking things back recursively,
and look, I map to what I understand,
and since I understand simulations and video games,
I map it to that.
And so there could just be a fundamental flaw
in my thinking, and I'm perfectly happy with that,
but it does get harder and harder for me
to exempt myself from the likelihood
that this actually is a simulation.
I believe it inherently, and I can't prove it.
And again, even though I believe it,
it doesn't change anything.
I remember I had, I was at, years ago,
I was at a birthday party that Elon had, Larry Page,
and Sergey Brin, and Elon and I
are having a conversation before they're falling out.
Having a conversation about whether we're living
in a simulation, and I think, I don't know if it was Larry
or Elon said, yeah, the only way we're gonna find out
is if you try and tamper with it and the system resets.
Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating.
I wonder if this has been a subject conversation
in ancient philosophical times as well.
Have you ever seen any references to that?
Plato's Cave.
Yeah, yeah.
Very much the same idea.
Again, mapping to what he knew.
He knew campfires and shadows and so.
Two dimensions and three, yes.
Exactly, so that becomes the way that you think about it.
But I think as people really begin to investigate
the human mind, it is inevitable that you start going,
hold on a second, you're seeing the world differently than me.
And so then you go, wait a second,
are either of us seeing the world the way
that it actually is?
And then once you understand that we're not,
that we necessarily couldn't be that my um-velt
is different than a bat's um-velt
and therefore we are going to perceive everything
very differently and then you start going,
wait a second, we're perceiving the world
instead of just encountering it as it actually is?
So the technology that's gonna come
to make a dent in that is gonna be BCI,
brain-computer interface, right?
So if I'm able to connect my mind to your mind,
I think there's gonna be an interesting set of correlates.
So there are dozens of companies right now working on,
so you've got a hundred billion neurons in your brain,
a hundred trillion synaptic connections,
and the neocortex, the top layer is your sensorium
and your homunculus of action and all,
your visual cortex, oratory cortex and such.
And one can connect the digital signals in your brain
or the electrical signals in your brain to electrodes
and connect them to a computer
and those things are happening right now.
Elon's got his neural link,
there's a company actually here called Paradromix,
which is doing that as well.
There's a lot of amazing companies.
And so we're gonna start to be able to understand visually.
One of my favorite recent AI blow your mind examples
was a group took subjects and put them inside
of a functional MRI machine,
which is looking at blood flow going through
different parts of the tissue in your brain.
And the more the blood flow,
the more the neurons are active
because they're using more glucose and oxygen and so forth.
And they took the output of the MRI
and they fed it into stable diffusion.
And they gave the subjects in the functional MRI machine
an image to look at, look at an image of an airplane,
look at it and think about that.
And then they took the signals out of the fMRI
and we're able to see the person was looking
at an airplane.
That's crazy.
Right?
And they did it with-
So it could interpret the brain signals
to say this is what you're looking at.
Yes.
Yo.
Awesome.
That's mind reading.
That's mind reading, yes, it is mind reading.
And so we're heading in that direction.
And so one of the things I think about is
you and I both are not a single living organism.
All right, you have to think about that.
We're a collection of 40 trillion human cells,
30 trillion if you're smaller, 50 trillion if you're bigger.
And those human cells are each individual living organisms
working together.
And also competing for resources.
But competing or yes, and supporting each other
in that, in the distribution of resources.
You also have more than those 40 trillion life forms
in the form of bacteria and virus and fungi
as an ecosystem in your body.
But you're not, we think of ourselves as Tom or Peter,
but we're far more.
I think we're heading towards a point
where if I can connect my brain to the cloud
and you can connect your brain to the cloud,
and all of a sudden I've got God-like powers
with a small G, I'm omniscient, omnipotent,
I'm not present, I can know anything,
I can think in Google, I can look through your eyes
or through the eyes of someone watching a sunrise in Tokyo.
It is, we're now a meta-intelligence.
We're at a new level of empathy
and connection between humans.
I love Star Trek as you well know.
Are you Trekkie or Star Wars?
I'm so sorry for that.
You're wrong, you picked the wrong part, but it's okay.
The only thing that Roddenberry got wrong was the Borg.
The Borg are the evil networked minds.
But I think we're gonna head towards a level
of consciousness on the planet
as we start to connect millions,
tens of millions, hundreds of millions of individuals.
I think we become conscious at yet another level.
I call that a meta-intelligence.
And I think that's coming as well.
Enabled by AI, enabled by this brain-computer interface.
You can imagine if I gave you the ability
to connect your brain to the cloud,
and you plugged in for that moment,
and all of a sudden you could understand what you want,
you knew anything you wanted,
you were connected to this new embalm of infinite knowledge.
And then I unplugged you, how would you feel?
I think you'd feel so lonely and disconnected.
So I think once you plug in,
this is more the matrix than not.
So we can go to one of your favorite genres.
But I think that's coming.
Enabled by AI.
Let me go one other slight subject
and then you can take it back where you want.
We just had visioneering at XPRIZE.
XPRIZE, we hold an annual event called visioneering
where we brainstorm ideas
and that would become great XPRIZES.
And this past visioneering,
we had a couple of good AI XPRIZES.
One is AI for truth.
When someone makes a statement,
can you have an AI algorithm that's able very rapidly
to say factual truth, here's the roots of that,
this is opinion or this is disinformation.
I think that'd be very useful in our coming world.
The other one, which was AI mediated communication
between any two species.
Well, right.
Can I talk to whales or dolphins
in a consistent, accurate two-way fashion?
That'd be nuts.
That would be amazing.
I'd love that for my dog.
That would be a trip.
I know.
It'd be a trip.
But it would be take me out, food, get me.
But, you know, on a consistent basis,
I mean, you can imagine,
like if you could talk to whales and dolphins,
they'd help you explore the oceans or talk to birds.
There's a kid that's missing in the forest here.
Help me find them.
So that's very interesting.
And I know the way your brain works
and you take a very beautiful, optimistic look at that.
It would be utterly fascinating.
So killer whales are vicious, vicious,
and they will go eat a great white's liver
just because they can.
And they will toy with dolphins.
They're dolphins that will kill other dolphins
and they'll mess with them.
Dolphins that try to have sex with humans.
I mean, just on and on.
That's crazy.
I've heard the stories.
And I have a feeling that were we to actually be able
to communicate with animals,
it may be a little more distressing than we want to believe.
I read a story a long time ago
and I did find this very interesting.
This speaks to your interpretation of the Borg
as being a misread.
And it was these creatures that had these tails
that had like these almost fiber optic tendrils.
And when they would connect them.
Sounds like avatar.
Yes, I would be shocked if he hadn't read this story
because it is very similar to that.
But this was years ago.
I read this probably 30 years ago, 35 years ago.
And they would connect their tails
and they would instantly know the entire history,
emotional milieu of the person they were connecting.
How amazing.
And what was interesting was how once you could no longer lie
or hide anything from anybody,
there was a relaxed sort of acceptance of yourself.
This is who I am.
Like it or not.
This is who I am.
You got your own bullshit.
I've got mine.
I mean, honestly, and when I think about it
on a relationship side,
and this is something that talked to Lisa more about
the ability to be absolutely, brutally honest
about your feelings, about your desires,
about everything you've ever done.
I mean, how many people actually have people in their lives
that know everything about you?
Where there's zero to hide.
I mean, it's like in a relationship
and you look at a woman and go, wow, she's gorgeous.
And you're willing to say that
and or something that you were ashamed of having done.
But everything is fully disclosed.
I think that level of intimacy would be amazing.
Amazing.
It would be you, oh man, the symmetry
that would have to be there though,
because if there's even slight imbalance of.
Sure.
And therefore a lot of relationships would not work
but when they do click and there's full disclosure
and your deepest likes, deepest fears
are fully known to both sides,
it is a level of complete honesty.
And I mean, someone who knows you
as well as you know yourself.
I mean, we're going in a very different
conversational subject,
but I think that was something I would desperately love.
And I have a few friends in my life
where it's like they know almost everything possible
and it's not that I wouldn't disclose things to them,
it's just we've never had those conversations.
And those are the people closest to me, right?
For whatever dysfunction I have,
only my wife knows me like that.
I don't know why, I don't.
Well, just share it with me now right now.
Yeah, there you go, live on camera.
And then you'd have a billion people know about it.
The funny thing is that I don't actively hold things back.
Like I'm a pretty open book,
but it is like there's something
about sharing your life with somebody
where they see all the like,
what do you like when you're sick?
What do you like when something goes really well,
when something goes really poorly?
And there's just too much intimacy
for there to be any posturing whatsoever
because they just see you too often.
Yeah, it's interesting.
So these are the things that AI are going to enable,
imagine with this level of BCI where you can't lie.
I mean, interesting, right?
Cause you could probably make up simulated truths
that you honestly believe and people do do that.
Anyway, going back, where do you want to take this back to?
Let's rewind the tape here.
Well, so the thing that I want to know,
so this is all very interesting to me
in terms of where this goes and how far out it gets.
And it really does become quite fascinating,
but right now there are tremendous opportunities
for people that really understand what's going on.
Obviously both capital,
this is a big part of where you place your bets
is do I understand a little bit more than other people
where this is all going?
So what is the right now today bridge?
What are the opportunities
that somebody listening to this should understand?
Whether it's AI, quantum computing, longevity,
where are the big opportunities?
So I believe without question
the two biggest business markets on the planet
are AI and longevity, right?
If you think about from a national standpoint,
a national leader of a country
should care about the health
and the integral of intelligence over their country.
If you could increase the intelligence
of your nation by 20%, right?
Or the health of your nation by 20%, massive, right?
Or in a company,
increase the intelligence of your workforce
or the health of your workforce.
These are huge levers to move.
I'm often keynoting inside of companies
or YPO events or other about those two subjects.
I mean, that's my typical,
like that's all that matters right now, AI and longevity.
And I'll ask people in a wealthy group,
individuals, honestly, how much of your capital
would you give up for an extra 20 healthy years?
And if they're honest about it,
it's well over 50% of their,
you're gonna spend it any way at the end of your life,
right, trying to like deal with-
Wouldn't you give 100%?
I think people would, but then they say,
well, I'm gonna leave it to my kids
or I'm gonna leave it to my philanthropy
or whatever the case might be.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I want to paint a scenario.
You, you are before-
I am with you.
Listen, I don't wanna leave the money to my kids.
But then argue on their behalf.
I wanna understand this mindset
because this is shocking to me.
You're before a credible source.
Let's call this credible source God just to make it easy.
And God is like, hey, bro, button on the left,
you get 20 extra years,
but you're gonna give me every dime,
all of your assets, everything.
Button on the right, you die tomorrow,
but you get to give your family all your assets.
Yeah.
You're telling me that there are people
that hit the button on the right.
Of course, 100%.
Whoa.
Because people want to leave a legacy.
Why the hell do you give a billion dollars to Harvard?
Do they really need another billion dollars?
You know, you want a legacy there.
People want to know that they're going to live,
that their legacy is gonna live after them,
whether it's in the form of their kids
or the form of their name.
And so, yeah, there's a balancing act.
Maybe it's 20% that they would hold back.
But those are not the buttons before you.
There is no 20%, there's all or nothing.
But you, wow, okay.
That's crazy to me.
And...
But going back to your question,
I think longevity is one of the largest business opportunities
that's gonna materialize over the decade ahead.
So how do you take advantage of it?
What are you doing to be ahead of the curve?
Well, building companies there in that.
So Fountain Life is my biggest company.
I'm building for a global footprint,
for enabling everyone to have access
to the best therapeutics and the best diagnostics.
The diagnostics are,
is there anything going on inside your body right now
you need to know about?
If there is, you want to know,
because you can take action.
We find 2% of the people who go through Fountain Life
have a cancer they don't know about,
2.5% of an aneurysm they don't know about,
14.4% have either metabolic disease
neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease,
something you need to take action on right away.
And so the thesis there is your body
no longer needs to be a black box.
Yes, the thesis is your body is amazingly good
at hiding disease, incredibly good.
And you're better off confronting it.
You're better off knowing as early as you can
because you can do something about all of these things.
And why now?
What, what is now?
Because the tech is there to image
at high fidelity without the false negatives.
And the tech is there to understand what the data means.
Right, so I had a friend of mine,
super successful individual who I'm doing business with
in Fountain Life and he went to go through the experience,
and we discovered two aneurysms in his brain.
Wow.
Serious aneurysms.
He's in surgery a week later, they're clipped and blocked
and he's fine in that threat.
But had he not, it was a ticking time bomb for him.
Right, we all know people who have,
oh my God, they died in their sleep.
Or they go to the hospital and the doctor says,
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've got stage three or stage four, whatever it is.
It didn't happen that morning.
It's been going on for some time.
You just don't know how.
So the stats for the following,
70% of people who have a heart attack
had no previous symptoms, right?
You don't detect cancer until it's stage three or four
from a pain or something going on.
It is a slow, your body's amazingly good at hiding it.
You don't develop a Parkinsonian tremor
until 70% of the substantia nigra neurons are gone.
And so you need to look.
And people say, I don't want to know.
I say, bullshit, of course you want to know.
As early as you can, fully know.
Because there's now things you can do about it.
Because there are things you can do about it, for sure.
Medicine has progressed incredibly well
and it's moving and if you're wealthy,
you want to know,
because I want to fund the research to solve that thing.
So in fountain, the two questions is,
is something going on you need to know about today?
And if there isn't, fantastic.
I go every year for my upload
and then I'm tested throughout the year on stuff
that I'm incrementally improving.
The second thing is, what are you likely to develop?
And how do we push that off?
How do we solve that?
How to reduce your chance of heart neurovascular,
whatever it might be.
So that's what I'm building.
I've built a couple of companies.
One in stem cells with Bob Hury, who's a CEO there,
called Cellularity, and the one called Vaccinity,
that's developing vaccines.
So vaccines are amazing things.
Your brain is the most complicated machine
in the universe that we know of.
Your immune system is the next.
Your immune system is protecting you
against infectious disease, against cancers, right?
We're all developing cancers all the time.
And your immune system, your natural killer cells,
find those cancer cells, right?
Cause cells replicate a certain number,
it's called the Hayflick limit, you know,
50, 60 replications, and then they should
have the decency to die.
If they don't, they can become senile cells,
putting out inflammatory factors,
or they can become cancer cells,
immortal cells, and they grow.
And your natural killer cells detect
those cancer cells and zap them.
But as you grow older, you have something called
Immuno-exhausturing your immune system
starts to slow down, and you don't detect it,
and they can start to grow.
And so if you can find cancers on MRI,
there are things called the Grail Test,
which take a liquid biopsy, blood biopsy,
and looking for cancer DNA in your bloodstream.
And so you can do something about these now.
So vaccines, that's where I was, I was talking about vaccines.
So vaccines, we know about it from mRNA vaccines
for COVID and such, but we can now develop vaccines
to activate your immune system to fight cancer,
like go attack that.
You can vaccinate against cancer.
There are cancer vaccines now being developed.
The first one that was approved by the FDA
was for melanoma, which is one of the most deadliest cancers.
One of my companies, Vaccinity,
has a vaccine in phase two for Parkinson's,
going to phase three for Alzheimer's.
We have a phase one asset in hypercholesteroemia.
So going a vaccine, which goes, you vaccinate yourself,
it activates your immune system to go
and go after a particular enzyme in the liver
called PCSK9, which creates the bad cholesterol, LDL,
low density lipoproteins.
And that vaccine, which you'd vaccinate yourself
twice a year for, two injections a year,
injections might be 20 bucks, 50 bucks,
basically drops your cholesterol level down.
So I have hypercholesteroemia in my family.
My dad had very high cholesterol,
whole slew of medical stuff, so I'm very sensitive to it.
I don't want to do statins.
I take a very small amount of statin
for an anti-inflammatory effect.
That's a different story.
But I take something called a,
I take something called a rapatha,
which is a antibody that's manufactured in a vat.
And I get a few MLs of this
and I have to inject it every two weeks
that antibody goes to that PCSK9 enzyme in my liver
and blocks it from producing LDL.
Now it costs me $10,000 a year
and I have to do it every two weeks,
but it drops my LDL level down into a beautiful green zone.
I'm using these antibodies produced
in a manufacturing plant and shipped to me.
What we built in vaccinity was a vaccine that I inject
and it causes my own immune system to manufacture
that same antibody for free to block that PCSK9 enzyme.
That makes sense.
Yes, and you're doing that now?
Yes, I'm not, well, we're developing the vaccine right now.
The first results were amazing.
We're going from phase one into phase two.
Long story short, the ability,
there are these monoclonal antibodies,
which are like the top selling drugs
and it's using these antibodies,
which are proteins to go and block a certain process.
We talked about that a little bit earlier,
but they're expensive.
But the idea now is instead of manufacturing
these monoclonal antibodies in a vat,
in a pharma manufacturing plant,
can you just teach your own immune system
to produce that same antibody?
And that's the future of vaccines.
Your vaccine, the vaccine is playing
your immune system like an app.
My wife, Lisa, struggled profoundly with her gut health
and experienced debilitating stomach pain.
So I focused my energy on learning everything I could
about the human gut.
Viome is on the cutting edge of this growing area of study
with their at-home gut intelligence test.
Just two to three weeks after sending in your sample,
you can see your results on 20 integrative health tests
that measure your inflammatory activity,
metabolic fitness, and the health of your gut lining.
As a special offer to my viewers,
Viome is offering $110 off your test.
Just go to tryviome.com slash impact
and use code impact to get the $110 off.
Okay, let me see if I can boil that down to a thesis.
So for somebody that is trying to figure out
where the opportunities are right now,
because we're living in this hyper-disruptive time,
I want people to be aware of the ways
in which things are being disrupted
so that they can go in and take advantage.
There's also, okay, so we're going back
to the investment side here.
So listen, we're in the middle of a biotech winter right now,
just to be clear.
If you look at all the biotech companies out there,
they're significantly depressed.
So if you're playing the public markets
and you find companies that have good cash position
and have strong potential drug candidates,
this is a great time to buy,
because the stocks are all like 10 or 100 full depressed.
So just put that out there one second.
I think health, I think the medical system,
the healthcare system is so broken, it's pathetic.
I think we're gonna,
I think it's gonna crumble under its own weight.
And so we're gonna reinvent how we deliver healthcare.
I think at home, you're gonna all be,
we're all gonna be monitored.
So I'm wearing a continuous glucose monitor right now.
I've got my O-ring, I've got my Apple watch.
There's gonna be a whole school of wearables.
All of that wearable data is gonna monitor me 24 seven.
So one of the things we do at Fountain as well
is we bring in all your wearable data.
So in between your annual uploads,
which are deep dives into you,
we're monitoring what's going on.
So we're gonna see AI-
Are you making recommendations based on what you see?
Absolutely, absolutely.
So for supporting your sleep, for supporting your diet.
So my continuous glucose monitor, right?
And there's companies like Levels,
or there's Free Libre, there's others
that measure how your body reacts to eating those peanuts,
or that Snickers bar,
and how quickly your blood sugar elevates,
and how quickly it goes back down.
And based upon that,
going into prediabetic or becoming a diabetic,
your glucose is a poison in the body.
I don't know if people realize that.
Our bodies were never designed to eat as much sugar as we do.
And glucose sticks to proteins,
and then your immune system sees that glycosylated protein
as a foreign and attacks it and causes inflammation.
So a lot of cardiovascular disease
and neuroinflammatory disease is a result of people's diet.
But you don't talk about that.
No one talks about that.
Okay, so I was going somewhere slightly different
when I said thesis.
So I don't necessarily mean investing,
but I mean, if I can create an overarching thesis
on what it is that links all this stuff together.
So your interpretation of where we are in the world right now
as I understand it is your body no longer
needs to be a black box.
We now have the imaging capacity
to see what's going on.
We have the ability to do something about it.
There are therapeutics that are advancing now very rapidly
where you can leverage the body's own systems
in a intentionally triggered fashion,
whether that's through vaccines,
whether that's through some other mechanism.
But we're getting,
we have a deep enough understanding
of the body's mechanisms that we're able to trigger those
and get them to go in and clean up,
whether it's LDL or something else.
And people need to realize that your health
is something you can do something about.
And if I think about having a longevity mindset,
and what does a longevity mindset mean?
It means I believe, and I do believe this,
that this next decade, we're gonna see incredible progress.
And 10 years from now,
we're gonna have the ability to live
an extra 20 healthy years.
What do you think that progress is gonna be in?
The ability to manipulate the immune system?
So I think it's a lot of what we're doing
on this XPRIZE we just announced, right?
So we get $101 million from Hevolution,
from Chip Wilson, who is the founder of Lululemon,
who put up $26 million plus another $10 million
purse for his disease called FSHD, it's a muscular dystrophy.
And we're asking teams to reverse the functional loss
in muscle, immune, and cognition, right?
So you're moving well, you've got great immunity,
and you're thinking clearly.
And so over the next seven years,
we're gonna have incredible progress in those areas.
That's one of the, I don't wanna call it,
it's one of the thrusts that I'm focused on
moving the needle forward.
And so if you believe that we're gonna have this progress,
your longevity mindset needs to be,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to live long enough to intercept these other breakthroughs.
So I arrive at this point in reasonably good health.
So for me, that's the thesis
that we're gonna have these breakthroughs
from biotech, from cellular medicines,
from gene therapies, from CRISPR technologies,
from all of these things, from AI.
And if I'm able to keep myself in good enough health,
I'm going to intercept these,
and it's gonna buy me the next 20 years.
And during that time,
there're gonna be additional breakthroughs,
it'll buy me the next 20 years.
If you want that, if you love life,
and you wanna see what's coming in the next century,
there's good reason for you to take care of yourself.
What does that look like?
Taking care of yourself right now,
there are things that people need to be doing.
And I just, I wrote a book that just came out
called Longevity Your Practical Playbook.
I just wrote a book last year with Tony Robbins
called Life Force.
We did a conversation about that book.
And it's 700 pages.
And it's amazing.
And very few people get through a 700 page book.
So I wanted to write a very practical book
that looks at and says,
this is what I'm doing,
and this is what I think is science backs.
And I put it into a few very simple chapters.
Number one, what to do about diet,
because they're fundamental things.
We can come back to that.
Sleep, exercise, like the most important thing, right?
You think exercise is more important than diet?
And I'll come back to that.
So they're all important.
Diet, sleep, exercise, mindset, super important,
not dying from something stupid,
which I call doing your upload and fountain,
like knowing what's going on inside your body,
and then meds and supplements.
So the book looks at that.
I actually, I made a reduction.
That was the word, a reduction of that
into what I call my practical,
my Peter's Longevity practices,
which I have a copy over there,
which is free for people.
It's a 25, 30 page, like this is what I'm doing,
and why.
At dmandus.com.
At dmandus.com slash longevity.
And you can get my book there,
you can get this PDF download.
And it's very definitive.
So listen, there's no one diet for everybody.
I've been a vegan, I've been a keto diet,
I'm mostly Mediterranean,
but the things I've discovered is number one,
sugar is a poison, minimizing your sugar and why.
Whole plants are critically important.
Even the order in which you eat your food matters.
Like if you're given, like you go out for dinner
at a restaurant, when they bring you the bread and the wine,
ask them to bring it back during the dinner course.
If you're gonna eat the bread,
at least dip it in olive oil first to burn.
You're talking about not spiking your glucose immediately,
right, which is the worst thing you can do.
It really drives you to-
So why bring it back?
Is it eating proteins first?
So what you wanna do is on your plate,
eat your vegetables first.
If it's asparagus, if it's broccoli, if it's a salad,
the fiber slows down your digestion.
Eat your protein next, and then eat your carbs last.
It slows down your sugar spike.
It actually allows you to absorb the best nutrients
out of your plate of food first.
So even making that small, you'll lose weight,
you'll get better nutrition,
and you'll actually feel full
having eaten the best stuff first.
It's just a really small trick
that I'm just like, you know, once I learned that,
it's like, okay, I need to tell everybody about it.
It's a small, the order in which you eat your food matters,
right?
So there's a whole bunch about diet there.
Exercise is probably the single most important thing.
I have stepped up my exercise
from like two or three days a week to five days a week.
Your physique has changed dramatically.
Yeah, I've added muscle, and it's my goal to add muscle.
Muscle is one of the most important pro longevity parts
of your life.
Are you doing TRT?
I am.
I do take a certain amount of testosterone,
and it's simply, I don't actually feel different.
I am taking a small amount of testosterone
simply to support muscle growth.
Do you base it on blood levels?
I do.
What do you steer towards?
I'm staying in like 800 range, and sometimes up to a thousand,
Has it increased your libido?
It doesn't.
It doesn't touch my libido.
What?
That's shocking.
My libido is fine, but if I'm off it or on it,
it doesn't make a difference.
And people who've got,
I don't think I exhibit Grouchy Old Men syndrome.
So I'm like the most positive person I know.
No doubt.
But I'm using it specifically for supporting muscle mass,
but then I'm doing 150 grams of protein a day.
I'm having creatin, I'm taking amino acid supplementation.
I'm focused on adding muscle mass.
As you grow older, adding muscle becomes harder and harder.
And one of the unfortunate mechanisms
that a lot of people die
as they go into their 70s and 80s, I'm 62 right now,
is you fall because of muscle weakness.
You break a pelvis or a hip.
You end up in the hospital.
It's painful to breathe.
That you get a pneumonia and you're down for the count.
Having my dad happens a lot of people
and the survival rate post a hip or pelvis fracture,
if you're over 70 is like really low.
So you don't want to do that.
You want to maintain muscle mass,
also maintains your stem cell population
and your blood in your muscle.
So there's an interesting stat.
I memorized this one because it was important.
If you're over 60 and you can exercise,
it doesn't have to be super intense,
but some resistance exercises
can be with or without weights twice a week.
It reduces your all cause mortality by 50%
and reduces your chance of cancer by threefold.
Whoa.
Your body, the signals you give your body
from exercise and moving is that I'm still useful.
I still want to be here.
The other thing in the mental game is don't retire.
Google the correlation between retirement and death.
It's like five years.
Whoa.
So when you retire and you don't feel purpose in your life,
I'm going to read something from,
this is the longevity practices book
and there's a section on mindset here
and I just think it's really so important.
So I'm going to read this to you.
It says, in a study of 69,744 women
and 1,429 men, this is unusual
because it's more women than men,
published in the prestigious journal proceedings
of the National Academy of Science,
super high end peer reviewed publication.
It was found that optimistic people lived as much
as 15% longer than pessimists.
15?
15.
Wow.
Pretty amazing.
Your mindset matters
and making use of your body and being out there
and having purpose
and all of these things are subtle clues, right?
We all know people that very close to their husband
or wife and their spouse dies
and then they die weeks later, right?
Here's another, here's another story here.
One of my favorite stories illustrating the power of mind
over a lifespan comes from the annals,
the annals of American history.
As it turns out in an extraordinary demonstration
of the will to live, two of America's founding fathers,
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams,
both willed themselves to live long enough
to see the 50th anniversary
of the Declaration of Independence.
Even though in the early 1800s,
the average lifespan was only 44 years old,
Jefferson, who was then 83 and Adams, who was 90,
made it to July 4th, 1826,
both dying on that exact date,
the 50th anniversary of the nation's founding.
Wow.
Amazing.
I didn't know that.
Yeah.
I love that story.
Having purpose in life, being optimistic,
making use of your body,
all of these things are fundamental.
And when I think about a longevity mindset,
it is really, you know, I live with this every day.
I care about this every day.
I think there's the most exciting time ever
in human history to be alive
with what's going on and opening up the space frontier
with AI.
Because of the rate of change?
Because of the rate of potential?
It's like an infinite, you know,
I mean, if you were born 100 years ago,
and every year, right, at my Abundance 360 summit,
I look back 100 years,
and I look at like what was life like 100 years ago,
and what was the rate of innovation 100 years ago?
And the numbers and the examples are crazily slow.
And I don't remember 1923, I remember 1922,
there were seven breakthroughs in that year.
I mean, not like a seven in a week or seven in a month,
it was seven in the entire year,
and I searched everywhere,
patent filings, headlines, write-ups.
And so it was like the water ski was invented.
A mechanical garage door opener,
a retractable roof for the Ford Model T.
Vegemite was on the list.
I mean, I was searching for stuff, I was searching for stuff.
One of the seven is Vegemite.
Oh, a blender, a blender for making malts.
And it was like the pace of change was so slow.
And we're living in a world today
where there's like massive breakthroughs,
you know, every hour of the day,
it's a rate of change though,
that I think now is giving people anxiety.
How do you help people navigate that?
Because I think that the ability,
I define entrepreneurs as people who find problems
and solve problems.
And I think entrepreneurs are more empowered
than ever before to solve problems.
And that they are entrepreneurs
are in our world creating a better and more capable world.
I mean, I think we take for granted the fact that,
you know, on our phone, we've got what we would have
spent tens of millions of dollars
if it was even possible 20 years ago
for two-way free video conferencing, right?
Every game, every book, every piece of music,
accessible for free.
And we forget, with the incredible world we live in,
I think people who are more in teaching meditation
and spirituality are going to help people deal with the anxiety.
But I want folks to realize
the magical universe that they're living in.
You know, I think about creating a world
in which every mom knows her kids
has access to the best healthcare education,
all the food, water, energy, right?
This is the world of abundance.
You know, when I first wrote abundance
with Steven Kotler 12 years ago,
I talked about creating a world,
not of luxury, but a world of possibility, right?
And I still believe that.
And there's no velocity switch.
There's no on-off switch to this technology that's happening.
So what do you dream about?
What do you wish you had?
What do you want to do?
I mean, you can put it all away
and go live in the forest.
And people will.
And people will, but most choose not to.
It's interesting.
I don't know if you, if I ever showed you the comic
that I did called Neon Future,
but it was contemplating this idea
of what happens when AI shows up
and when brain computer interfaces exist
and people are able to augment their bodies,
what, what happens.
And my thesis is, and I think this will,
will bear out that society will bifurcate.
Absolutely.
And you will get people who are like,
no way, I'm not going to augment myself
in any way, shape, or form.
AI is the devil.
And they will fight to keep society the way that it is.
We saw the Luddite society occur.
We have seen parts of that, a rejection of technology, right?
We saw the Amish rejecting, you know,
the Ford Model T in electricity.
But I think people desire convenience.
They desire power.
They desire having their hopes and dreams fulfilled.
I don't know.
I think they will bifurcate,
but I think the vast majority will pursue
accessing all of it.
It's interesting.
I think it will play out something like this.
I think that the rate of change is going to cause
a lot of people, a lot of turmoil.
They will get addicted to things like social media
and the dopamine cycle.
Their sense of well-being will be tremendously disrupted
by losing a sense of purpose to AI.
And the reason that even in the face of all of that,
I consider myself wildly optimistic about the future.
I am very aggressively a techno-optimist
is because I don't think that evolution,
and that probably is the right word,
so I don't just mean it from the sort of standard perspective
of your DNA mutations accumulate
and you get better on technological evolution,
societal evolution.
I don't think it cares about any one generation,
and it will gladly create a period of 15 to 20 years
of just absolute brutality.
But on the other side of that will be a generation
that grows up with just, oh, this is all day reger,
and yeah, I have a quantum computer in my pocket
and there's fusion energy
and it's abundant in anything I can imagine becomes real.
And the person that I want to speak to is the person
that wants to map out where this goes
and how to ride this wave well.
And to your point, and I don't know
if this is what you meant by power,
but to me power is the ability to close your eyes,
imagine a world better than this one, open your eyes,
acquire the skills to actually make that world come true.
And when I think about as a filmmaker,
my entire journey to getting into business
and growing quests and spending 20-ish years of my life
doing something sort of to the side of what I really wanted to do
was because I had no idea how to break into the industry
because making a film was a no-budget film, it was $100,000.
And now it will be, if I were to have kids today,
my kids would grow up in a world
where they would type onto your phone the kind of movie.
In fact, they're not even going to type.
They would go and the thing that they are most likely
to want to see in that moment would exist.
Yes.
And as long as we're able to understand our base or natures
and not be a slave to algorithms, but instead go,
okay, I understand how I have to create distance from this.
I can't allow myself to get addicted.
I want to use these sayings in order to whatever,
experience whatever thing you want to experience,
then I think that that will be okay.
And I think, so I'll make a prediction.
I think you agree with this.
I think I've heard you talk about this, but if not, let me know.
The reason that the Fermi paradox isn't a paradox
is I don't think people end up exploring space.
I think they explore virtual worlds,
which will be far more interesting
than anything that's a slave to physics.
And that's the reality that I think that we're moving towards.
And between here and there,
many people will be broken emotionally
and they simply won't be your competition.
And so for those that are paying attention
and figuring out how to leverage this technology,
you will create the next wave of opportunity
and you will thrive.
I agree with all of that.
And I do agree that there's going to be a period of turbulence
over the next five to 15 years.
And that turbulence is going to come
because we're in the midst of a phase change in society.
You've had Mogadot on the show, right?
Twice.
Twice, yeah.
And Mo has become a dear friend.
We're working on a documentary together around Scary Smart,
his book, which I commend everybody.
And I've had this conversation with Elon
that on the flip side of AGI, we do have abundance,
defined as access to all the food, water, energy,
health care, education that you want.
Everybody has access to.
It's completely democratized and demonetized.
And I think that's a more peaceful world as well.
If you can have what you want,
it's also somewhat of a post-capitalist world.
We can talk about that separately.
Then you're less likely to blow yourself up in a suicide vest.
And if everybody could be expansive
and they're almost in their own light cone sort of speak,
instead of having to oppress other people,
you just go and you build and you create.
How do we cross the chasm, though?
So that's the issue is the chasm over the next five to 10 years.
When AI comes in in the near term,
and I think we're going to see this,
I think Mo and I have talked about patient zero
being the 2024 presidential elections.
Why?
Because I think it is, in 2020,
Cambridge Analytica moved the needle and caused a disruption
with massive budget.
In 2024, a kid in their garage using generative AI can do that.
By creating deep fakes?
Deep fakes, creating social persuasive arguments
that get traction and our sway people's thinking
whether they're true or not.
Say something enough times to somebody in enough ways
and they believe it and stop asking,
well, is this true and where to come from?
We have all of these cognitive biases,
which are fascinating.
It's a whole field.
I'm fascinated by that.
Our brain takes all these shortcuts
because we can't process all the information.
I've got a recency cognitive bias.
I give more value to something I recently heard.
I've got a familiarity bias.
If someone dresses and looks like me,
I give it more credence.
I have a negativity bias.
I give much more credence to negative information
than positive information.
This sort of stuff saved your life
on the surveillance of Africa 100,000 years ago.
Today, you can be manipulated by them.
I think I forgot where I was going with this.
What is the thing about the 2024 election
that you're most afraid of?
Besides who might become president.
Well, if that's the thing, you're most afraid of.
I think we have a divisiveness coming
and people are playing full out
and it's no longer gentlemanly politics.
I think part of this is a post-truth economy
where you can't tell whether something is truthful or not.
One of the things I'm afraid about
is more civil war than anything else.
This next, I'm the person who,
the glass is not half full, it's overflowing.
Yet, I do see this period of turbulence.
We have a whole generation having gone through COVID
who are now going to step into a world
where they're not getting the jobs they expected
because AI is coming in and taking a number of those jobs.
There's going to be youthful social unrest.
It sounds like Arab Spring almost over again.
How do we navigate that?
I've been thinking about that.
My wife, Kristin Mogadot, and I have been talking about
what do you teach people?
How do you navigate this?
Part of it is how do people survive traumatic experiences?
It's going to be traumatic for a lot of people.
Yet, on the flip side of this,
we're going to see, I think, tremendous abundance.
It is something we have to navigate.
But humanity navigates these things over and over again.
We navigated World War I, World War II.
Do you have any rules or insights?
I'm not sure what the right moniker to put it on it is
that you want people to understand about themselves
or whatever to help us navigate this well?
I want to have those.
I'm not sure I have them formed yet.
I think that the most important thing is a hopeful,
having hope about the future.
If you ask yourself the question in the year 2023,
would you rather live here now than the year 1900?
Do you have an answer?
For me?
Yes, for you.
Obviously, today.
And I think the vast majority, when I ask people,
and people who say the good old days in 1900,
they're fooling themselves.
For sure.
The first time they got an infection, they'd be like, whoa.
Yes, I'm dead.
The streets of any major cities stank from urine
and manure from horses.
Life was short and brutish.
The average age was 40.
You got your debt from tuberculosis by then.
I mean, it was really brutal.
And you would work 70, 80-hour work weeks,
and your kids were working to try and make ends meet.
Child labor was prominent back then.
So we romanticized the past.
And between the year 1900 and today,
I did the work.
I have a book coming out in the first half of next year
called Age of Abundance, which is my follow-on to my first book.
And I looked at what were the number of needless deaths
over this last century.
And if you look at disease, warfare, and starvation,
it was about 240 million people died from those.
So you had 50 million people dying from just the Spanish flu
in World War I.
And we lived a pretty brutal life over the last 123 years.
20th century was rough.
And yet we got here.
And so I think ultimately it's about the human spirit
overcoming these things.
And so I am hopeful that the human spirit will allow us
to evolve to this next level.
And we are evolving as humanity.
We're evolving technologically and societally.
And we are also going to evolve in other ways.
We're going to go from evolution by Darwinism,
natural selection to evolution by human direction.
And it's moving fast, right?
This is what Ray Kurzweil talks about in The Singularity.
There's lots of singularities.
Singularity comes from physics as an event horizon
you can't see beyond, right?
And so we're really close to the AI singularity,
which is, I can't tell you what's going to happen in five years,
let alone 10 years with AI.
It's moving so incredibly fast.
And then Ray talks about the singularities,
the convergence of all of these bio-info nano,
information technologies from AI, biotechnologies,
nanotechnologies, which is transforming life
at such a rapid...
How real is nanotechnology?
I think it is definitively real.
Right now today.
There are people working on elements of it.
A good friend of mine has dropped off the planet
to go invest his wealth in building it.
What does it do today?
So today we are building molecular machines
versus atomic machines.
So what is nanotechnology in the first place?
Nanotechnology is the ability to assemble things atom by atom.
So Eric Drexler wrote a book in 1986
called Engines of Creation,
in which he looked at nanotechnology
and the ability to...
and the energetics of being able to build things atom by atom.
And he writes about an idea called an assembler,
which is a machine that's able to grab a silicon atom
or an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom
and bond it and assemble things.
And an assembler...
I could have an assembler in my hand
and I can command it to take atoms from my skin
and manufacture an assembler and give it to you.
And now you have one.
And you can have that assembler replicate itself.
And these are atomic machines.
And now I can drop it in the soil
and I can say produce me an electric Lamborghini.
And it can go to the open source
and find a design for an electric Lamborghini.
And then it will take the atoms out of the soil.
It will need energy.
Energy is abundant in the universe.
And it'll say I need a kilogram of titanium
or a kilogram of lithium, whatever the case might be.
And you'll provide that raw feedstock
and it'll manufacture this for you.
Now, we know this...
like an oak tree seed is a...
if you would, nanotechnology.
You take a seed for an oak tree, you plant it.
It just does it very slowly.
It takes the atom...
it has the information set inside of that oak seed.
And it grabs atoms from the soil
and then energy from the sun.
And over time, it builds a mighty oak.
It just does it at a very slow time frame.
And so the question is,
can you build atomic machines
that can manufacture things at a much faster time frame?
So there is nothing that has been ever shown
that says it's impossible from the laws of physics.
And we're building things now at a molecular level.
And in some cases, an atomic level.
And I believe, you know, Ray Kurzweil's prediction
is that it is, you know, in the next 15 years
that we'll see these coming into existence.
And AI will become probably our most valued tool
for being able to produce those atomic assemblers.
And then it's between AI and nanotechnology.
The universe is reinvented instantly.
We're in a post-capitalist society at that point.
What has value anymore?
Very few things.
Yeah.
So what is a post-capitalist society then?
Oh, my God.
What does that look like?
You really want to go there.
It says that Jeremy Rifkin wrote a book
called Zero Marginal Society,
which talks about this.
And it's a world of massive abundance
where you can have almost anything you want.
There is wealth accumulation
for the people who get started earlier in that.
But I would rather just focus on the notion
that in this world,
you can have access to all the food, water, energy,
healthcare, education, everything you want.
It's available.
I can tell you the world is going to get very strange
very fast.
Yeah.
My concern going back to the nearest term,
strangeness, would be the 2024.
Richard Feynman.
That's his name.
Okay.
Richard Feynman, professor.
Yes.
I wrote about this.
He wrote in, I think, 1958,
he wrote a very famous paper
or gave a lecture called,
There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.
And he said, let's look not at macro structures
and the universe, but let's look at atomic structure.
And Richard Feynman wrote effectively
the first paper on nanotechnology.
And then Eric Drexler wrote the first book on the subject
and really explored the physics of it.
Interesting.
Yeah.
I don't know a lot about Feynman,
but certainly somebody that comes up a lot.
So the thing that I'm most concerned about
in the immediate term, the 2024 election,
the thing that I'm worried about is that
people will do deep fake videos.
And it is distressing to me,
one, how good they are.
And two, if you know what you're looking for,
you can usually tell pretty quickly
what's fake and what's real.
But the average person can't, doesn't know.
And I'll see a video come across my ex feed
that clearly is a deep fake
and people are riled up in the comments as if it's real.
And I'm like the barrage of things that will come will be...
I have to tell you a funny story.
So, you know, my podcast is called Moonshots.
And it's been fun.
And I've focused mostly on interviewing entrepreneurs
who are taking big moonshots in the world.
Folks who want to, you know, do amazing things
and their stories of getting there and the difficulties
and how they will recomb them and such.
About three months ago, my team created an avatar of me.
I saw the interview.
And I interviewed myself.
And I was blown away.
I called Peterbot.
And it's both visual.
It looks like me.
It moves its arms around.
It sounds like me.
It's lips are in sync.
It's trained on all of my books and all my blogs.
And so, and it's great.
And I'm really proud of that interview.
And I said it did a better job as an orator
and as someone communicating my ideas than I did.
It was amazing.
And I asked it to talk about what were the downside scenarios
of Deep Fakes and tell me a story.
And it instantly whipped up a story about a young female politician
who is running for election
and the opponent creates a deep fake of her
and information gets out there.
And despite the fact that it's not true,
the story starts spreading virally
and her ability to overcome it
when it's out of the gate was impossible.
And that is problematic.
Lies go around the world faster
than the truth could put on its shoes.
I love that saying.
Oh, my God, that's terrifying.
Yeah, I think that's exactly what's going to happen.
You said something earlier.
You said people are playing for real or for keeps
or I forget the exact phrase you used,
but that is true right now.
People are playing for all the marbles.
So one, I would like to see the blockchain used to watermark
somehow signify this thing is real.
I think it's the most important technology for that.
And it's actually the most important use of blockchain.
You know, I've always been like, okay, besides like Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies and so forth,
what's blockchain really going to be valuable for?
I think it's truth authentication.
Yes, correct.
This thing is real.
Obviously, cryptocurrency, the blockchain
has become incredibly divisive.
Some people are totally for it.
And again, somebody developing games,
I'm like right at the intersection of people
hate or love this technology.
But if I could get them to understand it's just a technology.
It lets you do a thing.
Yes.
And so what is that thing that it lets you do?
And what it does is it brings the laws of physics
to the virtual world.
And if tomorrow is going to be more virtual than today
and it is, then you better have something
that brings some of the laws of physics
like the ability to say, okay, I can authenticate this thing.
So sitting across from you now,
obviously I don't have any concerns about whether you're real or not.
And for a very long time, it was, well, a picture or a video,
that's easy.
And then it became, well, a picture you can fake,
but video is still real.
And now it's okay, even video, man, is super easy to fake.
And so that becomes really disconcerting.
And if we don't have a way to market and say,
this thing is real, this thing is not,
and make it ubiquitous so that when it shows up on my feed,
it is self-evident.
This one is real and this one is fake.
What is the blue check equivalent, right?
Exactly.
And so that to me becomes really, really important.
To your point about the election being patient zero,
it's like, this is coming right now.
It is here.
Right now.
This is not a tomorrow problem.
This is a two-day problem.
And given who's running, this is going to be a nightmare.
And so I am, I am a super worried.
And when you look at Ray Dalio, who's up to,
the last prediction I saw was 40% likelihood of civil war in the U.S.,
50% likelihood of a global world war.
And so it's like, whoa, like these are terrifying odds.
Yes, they are.
And it's the human element that's at stake here, right?
It's humans doing this to themselves.
It's one of the important things that people need to realize,
technology is not inherently evil.
It's how humans utilize the technology.
And we have so much to live for and so much potential ahead of us, right?
Infinite, adjacent potentials.
You know, when I think about why AI is important,
it may well be to navigate all this stuff.
I don't know that we humans are able to.
I don't know, given all of the complexities of politics and social beliefs and distrusts,
you know, is there some means by which a more brilliant, more capable,
more gentle AI is able to step in and support us during this transition period?
It's a conversation that's out there.
And when we're thinking about, we talk about AI being the massive disruptor,
can it be the massive stabilizer as well?
Let me paint a scenario for you.
And as somebody with, are you kids 11 now?
My kids are 12.
12?
For those listening that two paternal twin boys, yeah.
Yes, somebody that has kids who this will impact,
I'll be very interested to get your take on this.
So I am actively building an artificial world with artificial characters
that as the technology matures, we can't do this yet,
but this will be real very quickly.
I want to build characters that you have a real relationship with,
that you get to know, they get to know you, they react differently to you.
They have memory.
When I think about, I think technology has really created a loneliness epidemic
for a lot of people.
But ironically, I think technology is going to be the solve for that loneliness.
Now the question becomes, will it be a better or worse world that that remains to be seen?
But with my optimistic hat on, I think people's best friends,
certainly in 10 years from now, most people's best friend will be an AI
in 20 years barring just absolute nuclear catastrophe
like for sure, biological weapon that's probably more likely.
That seems a certainty and that so people will have friendships that are AI,
but they'll also have romantic relationships and even potentially this one freaks me out,
but potentially sexual relationships with AI.
What do you think about that?
Yeah, I think that we're going to have relationships with AIs that are intimate
because they know you better than you know yourself.
Literally.
Literally.
Right.
I'm writing, I just finished my chapters on AI for Age of Abundance
and I'm working on the humanoid robot chapters today.
And so AIs will in fact, you're going to give permission to your AIs to listen to your phone calls,
read your emails, watch what you're eating, watch what you're doing.
You're going to do it openly because when you give it that permission,
it can help you in an imaging fashion.
Right.
So it'll remember everyone you've forgotten.
So when the person's approaching you, it'll be, you know, my favorite, right?
You'll know the kid's birthday and so forth.
If you want to be, if you want to, you know, follow my diet recommendations,
it will, for your AR glasses, it will tell you don't eat that
or it'll have pre-ordered for you at the restaurant.
It'll listen to your conversations or remind you of everything.
And people go, I don't want it knowing this stuff.
I mean, well, come on, be serious.
I mean, Alexa is listening in your bedroom right now.
Google knows everything you've searched for.
Microsoft knows everything on your email.
You know, it's Apple knows all of your, you know, I mean,
if you think you have privacy today, don't fool yourself.
Also, here's what I would invite people to think about.
Imagine, because right now they're thinking about Jeff Bezos
knowing what they're up to or Larry Page knowing what they're up to.
That doesn't feel good.
But if you think of it this way, hey, Peter,
you've just gotten to an argument with your wife
and I see from your aura ring that your blood pressure has gone up.
You know, I, obviously you've invited me to listen into these things.
Here's a perspective you might want to take.
Like, you know, if you remember, she's very sensitive to this
and you said that and that, you know, might have been what set her off.
But look, hey, I totally understand where you're coming from.
I see your position 100%.
Super empathic.
Exactly.
Super empathic.
In fact, there was a study recently done.
It's published in JAMA, the Journal of American Medical Association,
something like that, in which in a study of humans and AIs giving advice to patients,
the AIs were like 10 times more empathic than the humans.
And another study looking at therapists,
you're more likely to be open and honest with an AI than a human therapist
because the AI is not going to judge you.
Yeah.
You can also tailor the AI.
I don't want you to try to solve the problem of AI.
I just want you to understand my feelings.
Yes.
Yeah.
And it will do as told.
So we're going to be, it's going to be interesting,
but I think you are going to, that AI,
if the AI has access to the backward looking cameras on an augmented goggle
so it can see where your eyes are looking
and if it sees me staring for an extra microsecond at a logo on your shirt,
that shows curiosity.
Or if it sees my eye avert from something that I don't like,
that is so much information.
That's almost subconscious information to you, right?
If you're looking to buy clothing and you see it,
it knows from a conversation you had with a friend
that you're looking to find in your blazer.
And so you look an extra few seconds at a guy's blazer
as they're walking by and it may say,
do you like that?
And you're like, I do.
I said, okay, I'll order it for you, right?
So it's like knowing the ability for it to know you more intimately
than you are honestly willing to know yourself is there.
And that will build an extraordinary relationship.
Yeah, and to, you know, for better or worse,
here is the human psyche at work.
If you have a friend who effectively lives to understand you,
to feel your pain, to know what you're going through.
To laugh at all your jokes over and over again.
Yes.
Like you will feel seen.
There is something so wonderful about feeling seen and understood.
It goes back to that conversation about
is there someone in your life who knows you intimately
and doesn't judge you?
It's exactly right.
Yeah.
It is a level of connection that few people know.
And yeah, I think we'll also be able to give the AI a personality
so that it isn't, I was thinking about this when you were talking about
how we will all become the Borg.
Borg?
Borg, yeah.
Kind of a gentler Borg.
Yes.
And I was thinking, you know, it's interesting because the,
the way that we individualized ends up being a really cool part
of the human experience that my wife has a unique perspective
that she sees the world in a certain way that is complimentary
to the way that I see the world makes her an incredible partner.
And I don't want her to be exactly like I am.
So I don't want my AI companion to be a mirror.
That's not interesting.
I don't want my AI companion to be that perfectly tailored
complimentary thing to me so that they're, they're siding with me
at times, but then other times they're sort of pulling me along.
And by the way, you can fracture that AI into five different personalities,
all who know you well.
Also true.
Wow.
And I thought of that.
One is, one is sensual and sexual.
One is funny.
Oh my God.
One is funny.
One is pushing you to do better.
One is commiserating through with you.
You know, this is going to get weird.
It is going to get weird.
Very weird.
Very fast.
I love that.
You just gave me an idea for a story.
That is so interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
I want to see this world.
And for those who say, oh my God, slow down.
I don't want to see it.
I like the way it is right now.
You know, I hate to say this.
There, there's no velocity knob on this technological world.
There's no on off switch.
It is moving at lightning speed.
Our job is to steer it, to navigate, to inspire and guide it.
Right.
To avoid that 40% civil war or 50% world war.
All of those, those things.
Because on the back end of this, I do believe there is a stabilized society and a world
of extraordinary abundance out there.
I don't think we have a, I don't think we have a choice.
We're, we're evolving.
We're evolving very rapidly.
So, you know, bringing this back.
I mean, the work that we do at the X price foundation is trying to evolve to guide, to
create that positive world of the future and guide us and guide where entrepreneurs
invest their time and energy in a positive world.
So, I mean, it's fun.
We've launched now $400 million in X prizes.
Wow.
Which have driven, you know, on the, at least $4 billion in R&D.
And what we're trying to do at the X prize is say, this is what's possible in the year
2040 and energy in health and education.
Right.
Another massively about to be transformed world.
I'll come back to that in a minute.
And saying, okay, what's the roadmap to get there?
And what are the breakthroughs we need to get there?
You know, so I mentioned earlier of two 12 year old boys.
I don't think the educational system is getting them ready for the world that's coming at
them.
What would they need to be ready?
Not the stuff they're learning in school right now.
I've set up a meeting.
I won't mention my kids go to a very super high end, amazing private school in Santa Monica.
And, but it's based on the traditional old educational system, right?
So, this past year, they learned the 50 capitals of the U.S. states.
And I'm like, huh, why are, I mean, that's why God created Google.
I mean, I would rather you, and so I wrote a blog.
I put out two blogs a week and folks can get it at dmandus.com.
But I put out a blog on what the schools need to be teaching kids today.
And part of it was this is what I think.
And then I asked, you know, chat GPT what we need to teach our kids.
And it was very, very similar.
And it's not memorization.
Right.
So it's, it's how to ask great questions.
It's finding your passion, discovering that and really diving deep into that,
whether it's developing a video games or whether it's, you know, space,
which it was for me, I mean, video games, it's for my kids.
It is learning how to, how to argue your point, how to be, how to be a great leader,
how to be empathic.
Right.
These are some fundamentals.
Maybe it's more philosophy than anything else.
And, and it's not what we're teaching our kids today.
So what is the world like?
My dad didn't want to buy me a calculator when I was growing up so I could learn,
you know, basics.
And I ended up getting a calculator and learning how to program on it.
But what's the world like in like inside of five years where everything is intelligent,
everything is imbued with intelligence.
You're talking to your refrigerator, your car, their desk chair, whatever it is,
right?
Intelligence is innate in all physical things.
And where even more than that, AI has achieved and exceeded human level intelligence.
Right.
So this whole concept of AGI, artificial general intelligence, Ray Kurzweil predicted
we would have it in 2029.
Read that prediction in 1999, 30 years early.
And guess what?
Everyone is agreeing on that date.
His predictions are amazing.
So Elon's predicting like 2028.
I just saw yesterday the CEO of NVIDIA predicted it's within five years, which is 2829.
So what happens when AI, human level AI, your best teachers, your best diagnosticians are
all AIs.
And an AI teacher knows your child's favorite color, movie star, sports, understands their
grasp of language, understands that they're tactile learners versus visual versus auditory,
where I can enter a virtual world that is spun up instantly.
We just saw a stability AI, right, with stable diffusion, being able to create imagery instantly
from just typing.
I'm learning about Plato or Socrates or ancient Saudi Arabia or ancient Egypt and I'm living
in a virtual world for me and I'm walking around and meeting people and my inquisitiveness
is driving me to want to learn more and he's going to be awesome.
But it's very different from today.
It's very different from today.
One of the things that when you were talking about the calculator and your dad wanted to
make sure that you were able to do the basics in your head, do you consider AI cheating?
No.
No more than having a book as cheating compared to what we had before books, which was memorizing
text, right?
When the printing press came out, this art of storytelling started going away.
I think AI is a new superpower and how we utilize it.
Now, the big challenge is how do we reconnect purpose in our life?
I think what you're jumping to there is if AI, if you love writing, which I do, I get
up every morning and I write for an hour.
It's like my precious time.
If I can write for two hours, I will before hitting the gym or before taking the kids
to school.
I love writing and I love that experience of a well-written paragraph.
But what happens if I can say, hey, listen, write a book called Age of Abundance, click?
Yep.
It's kind of empty.
It's like, okay, yeah, I published a book along with the other trillion books that are
published today and it's meaningless.
We're going to have to reconnect meaning in other ways.
A purpose-driven life is so critically important.
How much do you think the world is going to fragment?
When everybody can publish a book?
When everybody can make a video game?
When everybody can write their own movie?
It becomes less valuable.
What happens then?
I think we have to find value in different ways.
I think we have to go after bigger challenges.
I do believe a good amount of...
Going after bigger challenges because it will re-aggregate people?
Because it will re-inspire people.
I think our biology needs challenge.
I think one future is one in which we're just living in games and we find our purpose
and our challenges in game universes.
Yeah.
I think Ready Player One is the inevitable future.
I'm talking about something slightly different.
Here's the thing as an entrepreneur, I think about this a lot.
You say, if you want to make a billion dollars, help a billion people.
I don't know that that will be a thing in the future.
I think 10, certainly 20 years from now, everything is so hyper-individualized
that when I log into Netflix, which of course won't exist,
let's just pretend it makes it easier for people to think,
when I log into Netflix and I'm scrolling,
it's going to be making the movies based on where my eye lingered for a little bit longer.
With a conversation you had an hour ago, right?
So you're pissed or you're just having the most amazing day.
What's your emotional status right now based upon your emotional feelings
or who you're with, you want to pick a movie that is going to relax you or inspire you
or make you laugh, whatever the case might be.
And this process of Googling or randomly walking into it,
instead, the movie will be teed up and ready to go.
Correct. And it will be so individualized.
There won't be this sense of shared experience,
except for the fact that I'll create a sense of shared experience
because my 17 AI personalities will all have experienced it with me
and watched it and have their take.
But now I'm not going back to the...
When I'm thinking as an entrepreneur, I start thinking,
whoa, it's going to be very hard for me to build a big business
because I'm going to pick, it will inevitably be just a really deep niche.
So I'll make something for, to use Kevin Kelly's idea of a Thousand True Fans
and now everybody is making something just for a Thousand True Fans
because everything is bifurcated.
So I'm making video games in an anime style
for fans of vampire fiction that's in rhyming couplets.
And by the way, your AI is producing 10,000 of those individualized variations
for the 10,000 raving subgroups.
Exactly. Yeah.
So what do you think that does to entrepreneurship in general?
I wish I knew.
I think we're going from mind to materialization.
I think we're going from deciding you want something to seeing it instantly created.
And it's going to get there hyper-fast.
Whatever you desire is going to be enabled in ways that are shocking.
So how do we give value?
Because a lot of times we give value to the struggle.
I've worked really hard to find this thing
and I found this unique piece of whatever it is
or I worked hard to get to that point.
And when the struggle is gone, what does that mean?
I think you've already answered the question.
This is why I think Ready Player One is inevitable.
So Ready Player One imagines a world that is dystopian
and so you create a far more enjoyable reality.
But I think there's also, let's say that you make a utopian world,
you will still end up in Ready Player One
because you're going to need to create a world that's hard
because until you augment the human mind,
I think there's a formula that evolution is guaranteed that we will pursue
which is that you must work really hard to gain a set of skills
that matter to you for whatever reason that allow you to serve yourself and others.
And you will need all of those pieces
and you will pursue anything and everything
until you get those things to slot in place
which is exactly why video games are the all-consuming medium.
Let me take you on a short journey over three billion years.
Please.
And give some vision of where things might go on a single trajectory.
The earth forms four and a half billion years ago.
The earliest life forms were somewhere in the four billion to three billion
single cell life forms without a nucleus.
These are prokaryotic life.
And as they advance, they become, they go from prokaryotic life to eukaryotic life.
That meant they incorporated technology into them, mitochondria,
gold gap, erratus, and plastic reticulum, nuclear structures.
They became more capable as individual cells of supporting energy and information.
Then those prokaryotic cells, now more capable individual cells, became multicellular.
And then those multicellular life forms started differentiating into life forms
that were not just multicellular but subspecialized cells, tissues, and organs.
And eventually evolved to us.
So there's a direct line between these very simple individual cells
and you and I at 40 trillion cells.
I think in the same way that we went from prokaryotic to eukaryotic life
by taking technology in, mitochondria and the plastic reticulum, nuclear structures,
and so forth, that allowed us to use energy and information more effectively.
Humans are the equivalent of that early prokaryotic life.
We're about to have taken technology into ourselves
that's going to allow us to connect with each other
the same way those individual cells became multicellular lives.
And so we're going to become this meta-intelligence
where I'm going to connect with 8 billion people.
And my experience of life is no longer a single ego.
I'm now part of a much larger intelligence, a meta-intelligence
that's conscious on a brand new level.
It's really interesting.
But I love two things about that.
One, it's a very clear vision of where this could go,
tying back to the way that we have evolved thus far
and really showing technology is just another step in that evolution.
And the idea of humans as midwives for artificial intelligence
is while somewhat disconcerting, it's still cool to me.
But the other thing I like about that is how much that reveals about you
and the way that your mind works.
It's very interesting.
As I paint the picture of where I think this goes,
I think I reveal more about myself than I am accurately predicting the future
because I think we'll both agree.
On the other side of AI is the singularity.
We just can't. Who knows what's really going to happen
when artificial super-intelligence exists?
The idea of something being a billion times smarter than we are now,
we just can't predict.
But it is utterly fascinating what it tells us about each other
to imagine what that future looks like.
For me, all I can see is Ready Player One.
And I'm working as fast as I can to make that become a reality
because that to me is just beyond fascinating.
What happens?
Because I imagine a world where we're not changing the way the human mind works,
but we're giving it unlimited technology.
The reality is we probably will change the way the human mind works,
but I'm far more capable of imagining the world with technology
and my normal brain than I am what I will want and desire
and push into as my brain changes.
But when I think about, in fact,
my listeners are going to get tired of me bringing this up,
but I'm really having a moment right now with Minecraft.
Have you played Minecraft before?
Of course. I have 12-year-old boys right now.
Because I don't, I discovered it very late in life
and am utterly fascinated by what I respond to in the game
because it's Maslow's hierarchy of needs without the top part of the pyramid.
And seeing how compelling I find it to be like,
I'm effectively naked and alone.
I have to build shelter, find food, and it is compelling.
When you can really, I feel like the rat in the cage
that's able to stimulate the dopamine receptors in my own brain,
and so now I'm just pressing that button over and over and over,
it is really, really fascinating
to think that we will be able to create entire worlds
that are designed to stimulate all of our, whether it's love, pleasure, whatever.
And so this is where I come back to the desire to live long enough
to see as much of it as possible.
Let me ask you a question I find fascinating.
Let's say that to see the future,
you will have to witness unimaginable bloodshed
because AI triggers such a panic
that humans just go against each other,
but we get to the other side and we get to that world of abundance that you're talking about,
but it's going to cost half of humanity.
Do you want to be in the half that lives or the half that dies?
The half that lives.
You and me both?
Yeah.
That's not universal though, which I'm very surprised is true.
Listen, I will do all that I can.
I mean, my ethos through the XPRIZE, through Singular University,
through all the things that I do is all about how do you make life better?
How do entrepreneurs solve the world's biggest problems?
How do we enable all that we can?
And I will do all I can to minimize the downside,
but my mission is to create such a compelling vision of the future
that people truly want it and will give up the dystopian potentials
to enable this future that they want.
I love it.
For people that want to follow you on that mission,
where can they connect with you?
Check out the XPRIZE Foundation, XPRIZE.org.
We just announced in Riyadh our $101 million XPRIZE on adding 20 healthy years on your life.
And thank you to Evolution and Solve FSHD for their underwriting of that XPRIZE.
I love what I do.
I love my friendship with you, pal.
Right back to you.
I think this is the most extraordinary time ever to be alive.
And I want people to be inspired to create the vision that they want to
because you've got access to more capital, more tech, more abilities, more knowledge,
more people than ever before in human history.
So part of what I do is help people take moonshots.
What inspires you to go big and bold?
What's the moonshot?
What's the dent you want to make in the universe to quote jobs?
And that's the final one if you're interested in my podcast on that subject.
It's the podcast called Moonshots.
It is a fantastic podcast.
Thank you, buddy.
My dad.
Thank you.
Speaking of things that are fantastic, if you haven't already, be sure to subscribe.
And until next time, my friends, be legendary.
Take care.
Peace.
Thanks for watching.
