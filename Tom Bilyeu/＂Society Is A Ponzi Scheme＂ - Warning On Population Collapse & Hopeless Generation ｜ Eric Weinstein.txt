I think we're getting to the point that normal porn has gotten really sick, that if you're not
approved about eroticism, some of the things that you're seeing pushed have to do with the fact that
our brains are now habituated to all sorts of things that you probably would never have seen
visually unless you were like Genghis Khan, right? Because everything's on demand. And so
the search for novelty I think is taking in some cases quite a dark term, even for people who are
pretty okay with the idea of pornography and eroticism as being an important part of an adult
diet for the mind. Where it worries me as kids for sure. And I may be even less worried about
today than I am in 15 years when you have VR that is bordering on photorealistic and that's where
Photoshop, whoever you want in, you know, choose your own experience, that's very disturbing.
But I'll be honest, I'm more concerned right now about people finding partners to have children
with. I think that this is an economic epidemic that we don't feel comfortable talking about.
And people comfortable talking? Well, because for example, if you have a fair idea that you're at
risk for not having the family thing work out, like it's gotten a little late in the day and you
don't see a lot of prospects lined up and you've had a few relationships that haven't ended in
commitment and resources and children and the economy doesn't seem to want to come up with a
30-year plan to fit a mortgage and getting some kids through college. I think that the transition
from the previous world has been pretty brutal and a lot of people don't want to say, yeah,
I really want a family and if it doesn't work out, it's going to be a major hit to my life and my
sense of myself. And we need, you know, in part, I think that a lot of us don't want to see young
women forced onto the apps, you know, which seems like it turns life into this. From a dating
perspective? Yeah, like a sink. It's just, you know, somebody said, this is the singles bar in my
pocket. And wherever I'm bored, I just go to the singles bar and start swiping. And I thought, okay,
and how do you feel about this? Well, in the aggregate, I feel pretty terrible about that,
but I can't stop. And so, you know, you've commodified all of this stuff. And I don't think
it's a good deal for young women at all. I think that, you know, young women have been used to
putting men through their paces and demanding a lot and saying, you know, jump this high and
seeing who can clear the bar. And when that power is not present, and when men can't win
these competitions and have those competitions really mean something,
we derange the society because society is about continuity and continuity is about babies. So,
no matter what you want to do, you can take it away from babies. I remember I was talking to a
young woman who was like 26 or something. She asked me if I had kids and I said, yes. I said,
do you have kids? And she like practically spit out her beer like, what? And I thought,
do you think it's really the crazy question that I would ask a 26 year old woman if she had kids?
And then, you know, she thought about it and just felt very remote. And this is the economy
that we're bequeathing to people. And my belief is that if the median individual cannot count
on being able to, you know, have a home in a reasonable city that has lots of jobs so that
if one job doesn't work, they can switch and one person can stay home. It doesn't have to be the
dad. It doesn't have to be a mom and a dad, any pair. But you need somebody with the freedom to
stay home to raise children while somebody else can be counted upon to go be the breadwinner
in an economy that isn't, you know, absolutely razor's edge. This is nuts. And, you know, it was
driven home to me recently and my father turned 85. We were at a party for his friends and some of
their closest friends lived in our neighborhood when I was growing up. They were saying, oh, yes,
you know, when we moved in all those years ago, there were 14 boys who used to play on the street
and now there are none. And I said, what do you mean there are none? She said, well, young families
can't afford to live on the street. And I said, do you have any thought in your mind that that was
a catastrophe that happened to your street and that maybe your generation had some response,
but this is the silent generation. So before the baby had something to do to say, hey, maybe
this is not good for society. If young families, she said, well, these homes are perfect for families.
I said, but you just told me that there are no families on your street. So this is an epidemic
and this is deranging us. And this is a lot of what's behind this kind of sense of injustice
and people trying to find groups, I think, to take care of because you have got a lot of
maternal instincts that are not grounding in happy, hopeful homes, raising kids.
That's really interesting. What do you think is the sort of key driver? Is this
student loans? Is it the average salary isn't going up? And part of what drives my question is,
I know what I pay. So my previous company I had at 1.3 thousand employees, about 1500 full time,
and then another 1500 part time. Here I have 20 plus employees full time and then another,
I don't know, seven or eight part time. And I know what I pay them and it's a good wage.
It's a hell of a lot more than I was making at their age. That's probably the easiest way to
say it. So where is it that just the way that we are and what we pay is not indicative of what
other companies pay? Is it something else? This is just going to be really kind of brutal.
First of all, we were in an orchard with lots of low hanging scientific fruit where you could
take the scientific fruit and turn it into technology in short order. We're still making
scientific advances, but most of those that are even fairly profound are not instantly
convertible into technology. So there might be low hanging fruit in a new orchard, but we
haven't found the new orchard. So we're picking fruit that has a very different characteristic.
So that's the first part is that our pipeline got screwed up.
How does that really play out in like dollars and cents? Well, I'm thinking of this street,
right? It's the perfect analogy. So you have a street, the houses have a price to buy,
they have a price to rent. So when I think about, okay, what is stopping somebody from
either buying or renting? So if the prices are too high, prices are too high. So then is it that
the prices are artificially too high because we have a bunch of empty houses and people who are
buying as an investment and they're just being stupid? You're fairly familiar with
my theories and acronyms and things. So you've probably heard about the embedded growth obligation,
the ego. And I get that and that scares me and I totally buy into it. What I don't and for anybody
listening and tell me if I fuck this up, but like basically we have a system that's entirely
predicated on continued growth and that growth slowed down starting in the 70s or 80s and we've
done a lot of bullshit shell games to make it seem like we're growing. The one that when you give,
I'm always freaked the fuck out by is the essentially Ponzi scheme of education where higher education
you're teaching people to be professors, but there's only going to be so many professors or
the law firms only going to be so many partners. So it's like every graph tells the same story.
So but what I don't understand is if that's been the same since the 70s, like
I didn't even graduate high school until the mid 90s and this has nothing ever seen. I mean,
look, there were times I couldn't quite pay my bills. There were times where I was sharing an
apartment with a bunch of people, but it's like it never felt like the system had broken in some
impossible way. And this isn't me saying that it isn't broken. This is me just saying I want to
really understand like where we've gone wrong. Well, so this is what I say to my friends in
San Francisco. So they've got good jobs. They're programmers. They're having a blast. They're going
to Tulum and traveling to Bali and all these things. And so I say you're living in a group house.
What do you think about buying your own home and asking that gal you've been
going out with for a couple of years to get married? And like the conversation just gets
really weird. Well, I'm not so confident that I can commit to a 30 year mortgage and prices are
insane. And I'm not positive that she's the right one for me. And, you know, all these things. Or
if I talk to my female friends, they have a set of different stories, which is like, I'm so tired
of little boys who never grow up. Is this a psychological malaise? Like, because that explanation
I can understand, we're not excited about low variance futures needed for children as we
don't see things popping off. Like this isn't Beijing in 2006, where it's just like the sky is
the limit. Or I think people have a have a pretty strong sense. Well, like I hired a millennial
who I'm very good friends with. And I noticed that he was like not that committed to certain
kinds of projects. He would work hard, but he also had a very clear sense of, you know,
my obligation ends at this point. I said, Well, I know this person. I think they work here. Okay.
Keep going. And I said, Well, why, why, why do we have a difference in a sense of work ethic? And
he said, Oh, because my generation watched your generation get screwed by the baby boomers. And
we're not falling for it. Do you buy that? Yeah. That sounds like bullshit to me. And when I say
I am happy to be convinced what I want is the fucking truth, dude. Alright, because I have no
interest in the truth. Let's get to the truth. Because so I have a psychotic work ethic. Why?
Because I didn't used to and my entire life changed when I changed my work ethic. But you
fact look, you're talking sounds to me like you're talking about founding companies.
I've done both. I've been an employee and I founded companies. So I've played both sides of
the fence. And how did, how did the employee, well, look, I don't want to over index on, I mean,
because, you know, there are particular lawyers in particular law firms who aren't founding anything
or doing just fine, but it's a minority position. And what I believe is, is that we are in a situation
in which we are not excited by the future and the people who are real stakeholders in the system
have in general been very focused on making sure that the pyramid is always supplied.
So this idea, for example, of you have to go to college, the debt has to become non-dischargeable
in bankruptcy. We get to load up the universities with administrators, all that kind of stuff.
And then of course, the main one, which is really bizarre, which is there's the secret
weapon and the secret weapon is immigration. And the great part about immigration as a,
as a invidious tool for one generation to screw another generation with is that if you call it
out, there's only one explanation for why you would fight having other people added to the
bottom of a pyramid scheme, which is you must be a xenophobe or probably a racist. And the answer
is no, I'm really just trying to choke your supply of new virgins to add to this pyramid scheme,
so that you can continue to transfuse yourself. Yeah, that's interesting. So let me see if I can
steal men this quickly. This is the one time in my life where I am the one that has a heart out
in five minutes. I'm so fucking horrified. This is so interesting to me. So I'll try to do it
quickly. Okay, so we have a pyramid scheme in that there are only so many jobs and I'll even
abstract it from being a lawyer, which is very easy to understand. There's only so many people
make partner being a teacher, it's easy to understand you can only create so many other
teachers and obviously we're talking at higher education. And I'll just say your normal job.
And I've told my employees this like, look, every step you go up, you there's fewer available
positions until you get to the CEO and there's only one. So there's only like you can get promotion.
I've never thought of there being sort of a money does not strike me as the finite resource.
The promotion strikes me as the finite resource, you can keep making more and more money depending
on the health of the company and your contributions to it. So that's part of my bias is that when I
try to use just first principles, I'm like, if this person is that valuable to me, I'm going to
fucking pay them because I have fear of loss, I don't want to lose them. So which is why default
to create fear of loss in your employer if you want more money. But the company has to be doing
well. So let me stick to the Ponzi scheme here. So very interesting take on immigration. So you
have people coming into the system, they're willing to work cheaper than the other people would
otherwise work in the system. You got to be careful about that. But keep going. It's interesting.
I'm trying to represent your position. No, no, no. But what I'm trying to say is that really the
biggest issue is push out the labor supply curve. Say that another way, your wage is your price.
Yep. And I bring people from foreign countries to make sure you can't compete because they'll
do it for cheap. Yes. No, it's not even that. I mean, maybe the idea is that you're a superior
source of labor. Who's you? Whoever you are, you're the domestic, let's assume that you're a
worker inside of the U.S. Yep. The big play in some sense of the previous generations,
the silent generation and more importantly, the baby boomers was internationalism, which they
called globalization. And the hidden part of globalization that wasn't the United Colors of
Benetton was the idea of we can just break our dependence on each other and look abroad and
talk, tell a beautiful story about what we're going to do for Africa and Asia. Then the idea is,
is that we can continue to grow our slice of the pie even though the pie might not be growing at the
same rate because from my perspective as a silent generation or baby boomer, I'm focused on a slice,
not the pie. And so there was a huge amount of value gotten from tricking people into thinking
that globalization was this beautiful Davos inspired kind of philanthropy that was going to be a
rising tide to raise all boats. And those Americans who had rights inside of our system, and this
goes for Brits who had British rights and French who had French rights, whatever, had a right that
was valuable, which is I have asymmetric access to my labor market. And that's how we worked as a
nation. So now you start the world's greatest PR campaign, which is patriotism doesn't exist,
it's only nationalism. And of course, nationalism is really ultra nationalism, which is jingoism,
which is a precursor to Nazism. So you start saying, you know, I kind of believe in citizenship
and patriotism. And now you're telling me that that's I'm a bad person. And now you've got the
Davos crowd talking about financial inclusion in Africa and Asia. And you notice that they're not
really that interested in Michigan, or Alabama. And it's a it's a tell me why they're not because
I felt like I understood it until you told me that I was because the amount of value you see,
if I had to purchase your rights, and I wrote a right to what? Well, your asymmetric access to
your labor market, I wrote a paper called migration for the benefit of all published in the international
in the International Journal of Labor, I forget what the title is, migration for the benefit of
all, which said if you pay people for their rights, like if the baby boomers in silence said, look,
we think we can get better labor outside. And we want to pay you for the right to shop elsewhere.
Then the idea is that everybody would have been better off and we would have all screamed kumbaya
at each other as we got rich together. But instead, what they said is you're a protectionist and a
jingoist and a xenophobe. We loaded them up with as much negative imagery as we could pop. You're
just a bad person. And they were doing that, though, so they can get cheaper labor, right? So they
can keep you from having leverage. But you keep saying it is we're willing to work below. But
my point is, is that if this coffee mug cost $10. And now we have 10,000 coffee mugs.
It's not that those coffee mugs are willing to be bought for less. The entire cost of coffee mugs
plummets. It's just pushing out the supply curve on labor and wages its price. So it behaves much
as supply and demand should. Now, you can then point out, you can make lots of other arguments,
like, well, some of these people are starting business and people are not coffee mugs. And
these are the most vibrant members of us. And so, you know, you cue stars and stripes forever,
you put your right hand over your heart. But the key point was, is that all of these arguments
were necessary to keep the institutional structure going as the Ponzi scheme ran out.
And a lot of this has to do with what I've called fake growth, downsizing, offshoring,
immigration, securitization. It's just this mind numbing parade of different techniques
that these older generations have used to keep a system afloat that has been saying,
we're exhausted. Like, the law firms are supposed to fail, the universities are supposed to fail.
All sort of the newspapers don't make sense as a business model. And things that you're creating
and that we all might create would be replacing these things. But instead, what we've done is
we've come up with an exotic kind of economic peribiosis where we're going to transfuse
our fellow Americans and the younger generations to pay for a group of people who are just far
too expensive to keep living in the style to which they've unjustly become accustomed. So,
I'm sorry about your hard stop. But I think that there's a tremendous amount to be excited about
and enthusiastic about, because in essence, getting back to your original point, you're right about
the matrix. For 50 years, we've been in a constellation of ideas suppressing the really
interesting new ideas and calling names on anybody who would propose ideas that would point out
the unstable nature of our market democracy. And right now, what we're doing is we're living
through the beginning of a global, low-grade revolution of a type that we've never seen before.
