When the famous actors, musicians, and athletes of the 1980s wished to cement their place
in American pop culture, they turned to celebrity photographer Harry Langdon.
One by one, he would direct their gaze into the camera, with their heads backlit in a glowing
halo.
It was a look so many celebrities of the decades sawed, that one could hardly call themself
a star if they hadn't been photographed by Harry Langdon.
But in 1984, a man named Dr. Frederick Lenz commissioned Langdon for a series of photoshoots.
The glamour shots that resulted began to appear across California.
On college campus poster boards, newspapers, and magazines, frequently filling up the entire
printed page, but it was unclear who Dr. Frederick Lenz was.
Some of his portraits would pose questions, others Dr. Lenz would devote to listing his
past lives, where he'd been a Japanese Zen master and a Tibetan Lama.
But his most widely circulated portrait would feature only his face, along with a simple
call to action, meditate with Rama.
Dr. Lenz seemed to appear out of nowhere, brute forcing his way into the public consciousness.
To the casual observer, his visibility campaign seemed nothing more than an advertisement for
meditation classes.
But to his hundreds of already existing students, his face was meant to reach those who'd
been followers of his for centuries, reminding them of who they really were, and calling
them back to him in order to finish their liberation.
We need to scour the globe for his students and reunite them, because we need to save
the world from some unknown evil, or the evil of the world.
For nearly two decades, Dr. Frederick Lenz would attempt to corral his followers and
lead them across America, away from the critics and away from family and friends who were desperately
trying to find them.
Lenz was a clever liar, he was entertaining, he presented himself as successful, and this
kind of loose Buddhism that he offered was appealing to a lot of young seekers that wanted
to make money and be like him.
In order to complete their liberation, each follower must master not only the disciplines
of the ancient world, but prove their supremacy in the modern world by climbing to the top
of America's most profitable industries, by any means necessary.
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, sometimes they'd get caught, but on literal
blacklist because they were destroying code.
To find out what it was like to be inside, I spoke with a former follower who joined
Lenz's organization when he was 20 years old.
Like if you were to ask like how deep did I go?
I looked forward to jumping in front of a bullet to save him.
I looked forward to that, I was like I can't wait till his life is on the line and I'm
the one who gets to save him.
I'm one of Lenz's most committed public detractors who threatened to take it all away from him.
How many followers of Frederick Lenz did you attempt to deprogram?
It had to be at least 25.
How many of those would you say were successful?
I think all but four.
This is the story of Dr. Frederick Lenz, or as he was better known, Zen Master Rama.
It was a psychological, potentially arguable, physical abusive relationship with this guy.
It was not as it was presented.
I'm a teacher of enlightenment, that is to say I'm enlightened and I enjoy being a vehicle
of the expressions of the universe.
How did you happen to meet Frederick Lenz?
It started in college where I was in my senior year and I saw on the walls of my college
these beautiful shiny posters about learn how to meditate from the Boston Meditation Society.
So my fiance at the time and I went to one of these classes and at first they talked
a lot about what we meditate so we can find enlightenment.
We can be calmer and more connected spiritually and what historically those who have found
enlightenment like true enlightenment look like in our historical art, this sort of golden
glow in the paintings.
And so some of us who are spiritually sensitive enough when you're around one of these enlightened
beings, you can actually see the golden glow.
And I'm kind of nerdy so afterwards I would kind of go up and ask them questions and just
say, you know, historically what was it like with blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
They were like, listen, we can tell that you are sort of, you vibe your aura or whatever
vibrates higher than most people.
You must have studied this in past lives.
Listen, we follow one of these guys that we think we believe is enlightened and we'd love
you to check him out.
There is going to be a $500 a plate dinner in New York and they were going to pay for
the whole thing.
We're like, listen, you know, we've got so much from this guy we follow named Dr. Frederick
Lenz or what we call is Rama.
We've gotten so much from we want to give back and we make tons of money.
So we're happy to pay your way and we were like, okay, you know, because we're like 20.
We all drive down together.
We go to this place and there's like 302 or 300 people there, all in tuxes and a lot
of them are doctors and lawyers and computer programmers and computer programmers and computer
programmers, which I noticed sort of a pattern in all of that.
And then this tall guy who has sort of like blondish curly hair kind of like this, but
bigger.
At some point I saw him in like a leather jacket and like, you know, Ray Bands and
he did like a five minute monologue standup routine.
In other words, meditation has been turned into a tool of the bourgeoisie.
No, I'm sorry.
Wrong incarnation.
I get, you know, I'm in different ones at different times and I got to bring it around
and get it straight.
Sorry.
So this is the right America.
And then he said, okay, everybody, let's we're going to dim the lights and let's meditate
for those who haven't been with me before.
Don't close your eyes like you usually do.
Just like have a soft focus on me and open your eyes a little bit and watch me meditate.
You're not just watching me, the body, you're watching the energy fields here.
You're relaxing your eyes, not looking too sharply, gazing and just watching.
You know, he just closed his eyes and he was doing a thing.
I don't remember.
And within 30 seconds or a minute, the whole room glowed gold and I got this wave of euphoria
that I never experienced before.
I was like, oh my God, if this dude can do that as an enlightened being in minutes, I'm
in for life.
This man can turn a room gold in 60 seconds, red one of lenses Bay Area advertisements.
Imagine what he can do to you.
It's a claim that would be echoed for years.
Turns the room gold.
That's all you see is gold light.
Kind of like if you looked into the sun and squint.
Even decades later, it's difficult to find discussion of Frederick lens without someone
mentioning the golden light.
But not everyone had such a theatrical introduction.
What was it then, Annie, that made you go, wow?
Well, first of all, I didn't go, wow.
I listened to his presentation.
I thought he was witty.
I thought he was a nice person.
And I resonated with things he said that he said, let's meditate.
And I had a good meditation.
I had a very good meditation.
Dr. Lenz's brand of meditation was not unlike what was already beginning to catch on in
the West, with the goal of achieving better focus and control over one's emotions by quieting
the mind.
Our mind is always in motion.
You'll notice you're always thinking something.
You're worried about tomorrow, paying the bills, we're thinking, images are flashing
through our mind, seeing somebody you'd like to see, remembering something that happened
in the past, our desires, our feelings, feeling guilty, feeling expectation.
Meditation is the opposite of that.
The basic technique is learned in seconds.
A student focuses their attention on the rise and fall of their breath or a place on their
body.
Keeping eyes closed is common, although Lenz often asked his students to look in his direction,
a technique he called gazing.
And when random thoughts intrude, the student gently brings their attention back to the
focal point.
I would wake up at like six in the morning, which I'd never done in my entire life.
And I would immediately meditate for 45 minutes.
I was so motivated and focused.
I was a 4.0 student for my last semester out of being a B minus student forever.
I would like to teach you to look into the depths of yourself, and I'm afraid you're
going to be shocked.
You're going to find out that you're much more beautiful than you realize.
I suddenly started loving running, and so I would go for a run for two or three miles.
I'd come back.
If I didn't have school that day, I would work hard at work at friendly scooping ice
cream, but being super focused and being like the best I can be.
And that you can be happy even in the most adverse circumstances if you can do this
one thing, learn to make your mind quiet, still your thoughts.
Oh, and a lot of times I would meditate late at night and find that I really didn't need
a lot of sleep, so I'd be working extra hard reading books that he suggested I read on
top of all of my homework.
Because then it's as if a curtain opens, and behind that curtain is light, ecstasy, perfection,
beauty, and reality.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
There's only life, and we all live forever.
So it's hard for someone to go, I think you're in something destructive because it doesn't
look that way in the beginning.
But in 1989, a computer programmer from Oregon named Brenda Kerber, who'd been a meditation
student of lenses for the past three years, went missing.
Others would disappear soon after, as well as students cutting off contact with their
families after they began attending lenses workshops.
This even surfaced of students giving up custody of their children in order to follow
the meditation group across the country.
My fiance and I, we lived together.
We went to Boston to meet with one of the inner circle, and we had a dinner with him,
and he talked about relationships and energy and stuff like that, and on the way home,
we spontaneously, the both of us at the same time, realized we shouldn't be together.
Because it's such a drain on our path to enlightenment.
And we talked about, with Glee, how we were going to split up all the stuff that we owned.
It's like, oh, you can get the CDs, those CDs, and these CDs will be mine, and those
books and my book.
It's like, do you want the better?
Do you want the couch?
She's like, I'll take the couch.
And then a few days later, and she was like, I don't want to leave, you know, I really
love you, and I want to stay together, and I was like, oh, you're so silly.
It's just going to destroy us.
So who was Dr. Frederick Lenz?
Frederick Lenz dedicated his first book titled Lifetime's True Accounts of Reincarnation
to an individual named Sri Chenmoy.
In Lenz's second book, Sri Chenmoy received not only the dedication, but credit for the
ideas presented in the book itself, disclosing that Lenz had been a student of Chenmoy's
for the past 10 years.
Sri Chenmoy continues to astound with his Herculean feats of strength.
A guru, a genuine guru, really genuine Sri Chenmoy.
Sri Chenmoy is our next guest on the program, and he is the holder of the United Nations
and the Danian for Peace.
In 1970s Queens, New York, there were few local figures that baffled the media quite
like Chenmoy Kumar Ghosh, who'd adopted the honorific title of Sri before leaving
Bangladesh for the United States.
After settling into Queens, Chenmoy began putting his face on posters around college
campuses, offering free meditation classes to the public.
His following is nearly always described as increasing, and by the mid-70s, reporters
found that he'd accumulated hundreds of students, most of whom were college-aged.
Little by little, as we meditate every day and we see him twice a week, we notice, or
I notice, that I'm so happy and I feel God's presence so much of the time.
Chenmoy attempted to be a living example of what a focused mind, conditioned by frequent
meditation, was capable of, and would invite local press to witness and perform endurance
challenges, which he called creative miracles.
The first was a 24-hour writing session where he produced 843 poems.
This works out to about 35 poems per hour, or a poem every 100 seconds.
We just don't know if there is a world's record for the number of paintings done in
the shortest possible time, but on tonight's edition of Bert Haney's People, he made just
a living in Queens.
The pace of his second challenge was more frantic, 16,000 paintings in 24 hours, averaging
now only a few seconds per piece.
Through meditation, Chenmoy claimed to have achieved what he called a oneness with the
Supreme, a type of psychedelic state he was known to spontaneously slip in and out of at
all times of the day.
This facial expression Chenmoy adopted became the focal point of his group meditations,
with students staring into the flickering whites of his eyes as they cleared their minds
of thought.
At home, students would substitute with a photograph, as instructed by his 1978 meditation
manual.
Quote, the best type of meditation comes when you enter into my consciousness by looking
at a picture taken of me when I am in a high meditative consciousness, when I am one with
the Supreme. Do not think of it as a picture of a human being.
Chenmoy would soon have enough of a following to pack out event rooms, where he would take
the stage, establish a oneness with the Supreme, and then deliver, to a crowd of thousands,
a new creative miracle.
In a single performance, Chenmoy would sometimes cycle through a hundred or more instruments,
improvising melodies with each one just long enough to channel the Supreme, before moving
on to the next.
By the late 1970s, Sri Chenmoy's multi-sensory meditation experience had extended far beyond
Queens, New York.
Much of Chenmoy's success was owed to the recruitment efforts of his students, and old
newspaper classified show that Frederick Lenn spent much of his early career as a traveling
meditation instructor, leading workshops on behalf of the Sri Chenmoy centers.
He went by Atmananda, one of the Sanskrit nicknames that Chenmoy had given to all of
those in his inner circle.
I decided to study with Sri Chenmoy through Atmananda.
He was the number one disciple bringer for Chenmoy around the world.
He was very good at it.
He was a brilliant speaker.
Oh yeah, there's a definite battle between the light and the dark.
The network always wins, though.
We run the galaxy.
What was he a professor of, and why was he a professor?
He was a professor of American literature at State University of New York at Stonybrook.
So I can only suggest that you learn to be what my friend Theodor Rutky called a perpetual
beginner, because if you feel that you're knowledgeable, you may be.
But to be a perpetual beginner is the happy part.
Being a student is much more fun than being a teacher.
His experience as a professor gave him a natural ease and authority over his college-aged
audience members.
And as he traveled the country gathering recruits, he began to realize an opportunity.
He would give a lecture for Chenmoy to recruit people into Chenmoy's circles.
At the very end, he'd be up there sitting cross-legged on the table, and he was channeling
the guru's spiritual light.
And he would look at people, and spiritual light would come out of his eyes, he would
say.
Well, that's a big no-no, because that is up for the big kahuna to do, not for the
little tiny atmananda to do.
And by 1980, Lenz's workshops were no longer associated with the Shri Chenmoy centers,
but sponsored by his own organization.
He took off with a handful of other Shri Chenmoy followers, convincing them that he was the
one and the master has kind of fallen.
As I grew up spiritually, as I entered into enlightenment, I saw the limitations of my
own teacher who was a very powerful occultist, but who I thought was, to some extent, limiting
others in their spiritual growth.
Come with me, I'm the new enlightened one.
It wouldn't be easy for Lenz to rise out of Shri Chenmoy's shadow.
Not only did Chenmoy have the adoration of thousands, he'd been hosting weekly meditations
at the United Nations headquarters.
Every Tuesday, his students could watch him slip into the supreme in front of some of the
most influential people in the world.
In order to take followers away from Chenmoy, Lenz would need to establish himself as a guru
of greater merit.
What did Frederick Lenz say he was offering his students?
So he was offering his students spiritual energy.
At a certain point, I came to learn that we had studied with him specifically for hundreds
or thousands of lifetimes, and we've all grown towards enlightenment because of working
with him.
And so what he was offering his students was spiritual energy.
When I sit with my students and meditate with them, I channel the Kundalini, the energy,
directly into them.
I bring them to plane after plane of consciousness.
What they would do in a hundred years of meditation, I can do in an hour with them.
This was the spiel.
He'd give us spiritual energy.
We would go home with that spiritual energy and meditate better.
And I take the Kundalini and I play against the notes with it.
I kind of do a light show inwardly and outwardly with the energy, with vortexes of energy as
you sit there.
Opening you up, opening up different parts of you that maybe you haven't felt since
you were a child.
It's no big deal.
It's just what I do.
And when Lenz announced his separation from Chenmoy, it's reported that he was able to
siphon about 40% of the students in attendance.
But even without a star recruiter, Chenmoy's following only increased throughout the 1980s,
and his students were beginning to perform creative miracles of their own.
In 1986, the world record for most consecutive underwater pogo stick jumps was surpassed.
The new champion used his platform as an opportunity to promote the three Chenmoy centers.
Elsewhere in New York, a student shattered the record for continuous hand clapping with
50 hours of non-stop applause.
And he did so, he said, to honor his guru.
By 1982, Chenmoy claimed to have completed over 140,000 paintings, as well as over 4,000
musical compositions.
Lenz would need his own way of showing the fruits of his enlightenment.
Now I have written a number of pieces of music to meditate to.
I asked Lenz's master, what is dancing?
Zazette was Lenz's rock new age band.
And he was credited as writing all the songs.
And I would listen to them all the time, all the time, I mean all the time.
Lenz was joined by three of his students to form Zazette, and throughout the 1980s, they
produced a number of albums with tracks like Death is Sexual and Gandalf the Wizard.
I loved listening to it, but I was, you know, controlled to love listening to it.
It was actually fine music, it was perfectly good.
This music is composed in other dimensions, that's where I go to compose it.
Then it's brought here into this world, from the planes of line, and it's played by some
of my students.
Chenmoy had become well-known for drawing talented musicians into his orbit.
Guitarist Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin both spent much of their early careers making
music dedicated to the Supreme.
Zazette was stacked with talent as well, with Grammy nominated Joaquin Lievenow providing
lead guitar.
And Lenz would incorporate this music into his live workshops, often using it as a focal
point for group meditations.
Then I go through the music that they've played with my aura, wash out anything impure, so
there's only light in the music.
It's perfect music.
Students were asked to demonstrate their spiritual growth as well.
Lenz required the submission of essays, detailing each student's progress in their twice daily
meditations, and several supplementary disciplines such as the reading and rereading of recommended
books, and martial arts taught by Sensei Lenz himself.
Martial arts is an ancient science.
It was codified by Buddhist monks.
He would wear a gi, you know, the karate white gi, with a black belt.
And they both looked like they had just come out of the package, they still had the folds
all over them and stuff like that.
I will be extending an invisible energy field that we call the ki that we gain from deep
meditation and samadhi.
This has rarely been seen outside of the orient.
There's nothing she can do.
Is there anything you can do?
His inner circle would run at him and he'd go, ha!
Like that with his hands and then they'd fall down.
What I want to do is interfere with their minds.
The mind is the ultimate weapon.
So they're going to come at me and I'm just going to project a wave of energy out of my
body to disable them, right?
Good.
Okay.
Come at me.
Come.
Say!
One more time.
Come at me.
Come.
Say!
For a moment, a wave of energy sweeps through their body and they don't know where they
are, what world they're in, what dimension they're in.
It's embarrassing.
It's cringy, right?
How bad it was.
But man, did it look good when I was under mind control.
Holy shit.
That guy could move.
Lenz seemed to take the strictness of routine from Chinmoy who frequently enrolled his students
in marathons to advertise the center and was known for waking his students up at 3AM
for morning meditations.
But Lenz took what he called a western-oriented approach to enlightenment.
If students weren't progressing in their careers and increasing their salaries, they
weren't making full use of his spiritual energy.
In this modern world, the more money you make, it's the better meditation you're having.
It's difficult to find a consistent membership price for Lenz's meditation group.
The introductory seminars are usually advertised as either free or for a small cover charge.
But as attendees became regulars, tuition could range anywhere from $600 a month to $2,500
a month.
I believe it was $20 a month.
Really?
Yeah.
Is that what you pay?
No.
Since then, my career has advanced significantly and I pay approximately $1,000 a month now.
For me, it started free and then it was like a sliding scale.
Like if you could pay $100 a month, $500 a month, that would be helpful.
And it got to the point where I might have been paying $3 or $500 a month scrambling.
To cover the ever-increasing tuition, students were encouraged to switch careers.
And at Lenz's suggestion, many of them turned to the fledgling field of computer programming.
A person who meditates, who becomes a programmer, is kind of like a duck in a happy pond.
You're in the right situation for many, many reasons.
He believed or he taught that computer programming was very similar to really good meditation
because of where your brain goes.
Computers are fascinating because the mindset necessary to work with advanced structures
in programming and in design is exactly what we do in advanced meditation.
It's exactly the same mindset.
I had credit cards at age 20, 21 that I was maxing out because of the promise of, just
in a few months, you're going to be making $100,000 a year, which was an unbelievable
amount of money back then.
According to ex-followers, Lenz told his students that they'd all been software developers
together in past lives in the lost city of Atlantis.
And he appears to have registered a corporation under the title High Priest of the First Diocese
of the Californian Church of Atlantis.
The computers in Atlantis were infinitely evolved.
All processing was done with light.
Electricity's much too slow.
But if his students had known how to code thousands of years ago, they would need a
refresher.
If you're not familiar with the world of programming, you might take a simple course
in it.
And then there are two ways to plunge into it.
One is to go to a short-term computer school where you go for six months or nine months
or a year, either during the day, full-time, or in the evening.
He talked a lot about the importance of programming computers and artificial intelligence and
relational databases, which is like a three- or four-D database instead of like a flat
spreadsheet, right?
I'm a nerd, so I kind of understood it.
And there were lots of people who were like, I don't know what he's saying.
But they like worked really hard to figure it out.
Was Lenz knowledgeable about computer programming?
As far as I know, he was like a Steve Jobs.
He understood the root of Mentory stuff, but he was just trying to inspire people to go
out and make a great deal of money.
Obviously, it's a smart career choice.
It's our country's number one business now.
And it would only become more so.
But not every student waited until they knew how to code before entering the field.
A pattern began to form of students packing out their resumes with proficiencies and
programming languages, enlisting one another as previous employers who would vouch for them.
If you don't have experience, come up with the names of some companies.
Then you have somebody say, yes, they work for me there, a friend.
Most of them didn't know anything about coding, and they would use each other as references
onto their resume and list all of the computer programming jobs they've had, which they never
did.
With the intention that they were going to do the best job they had, and they had this
enlightened beings energy, so they should be able to persevere.
So what normally would take four or eight hours at their work, they would work 12, 14,
16 hours looking at books, copying code, doing all of this stuff that they could until they
actually started understanding it usually.
The girl that I worked with at City Corp, who was doing this, was on the phone all the
time with the other people in the cult, and she would use me as a source of information.
She would ask me questions that were totally unrelated to her specific job.
They were obviously, she was trying to help these other people.
So basically it would be the blind leading the blind.
Sometimes they'd get caught, put on literal blacklist because they were destroying code.
As one newsletter that circulated among the industry's hiring managers stated, Lenza's
followers were, quote, inserting themselves virus-like on accounts in the tri-state area
where they proceeded to wreak havoc.
But not all who lied their way into these companies were exposed.
Many learned the software languages quickly enough to begin rising the ranks into high
income positions, and they were advised to use this money to reinvest in their enlightenment.
You get more money which tells you how more enlightened you are, and since we're simple
monks, we give this money back to him as a gesture of thank you.
And then he takes the money as the gesture, and then he gives us more spiritual energy,
which lets us meditate better, to program code better, and then give him more money.
To study enlightenment requires a commitment, and part of that commitment is a person's
willingness to go out and work to make the money to pay for their own way.
How much money do you think you spent involved with Zen Master Rama?
In cash, layouts, for the five-month involvement from January to May 1985, I gave out a little
over $30,000 in cash.
And an exceptional person, of course, will pay even more, will give even more, because
they not only want to just pay for their own way, but they wish to make enlightenment
more available to others.
Because you were a spiritual student of his, and you come to him and go, I have this great
idea for a computer program or a database program, he would become CEO of every single
one, like dozens of these companies.
Lenz credited himself with developing software through the 1980s and 90s that he claimed
was used by hundreds of American companies, both commercial and military.
And it's reported that some of his more successful programmers were providing Lenz with upwards
of $5,000 per month each.
If I were to keep on going and had a full-time job out of college, I would have been paying
as much as I could, $1,000 a month, which was a lot, $2,000 a month, and living with
a number of other Lenz followers by sleeping on floors or packing into rooms, so we didn't
have much overhead in eating ramen or just vegetables or whatever, and then giving him
essentially all of our money.
Did he ever, in any of his seminars, verbally justify how he could ask that much?
Lenz would say that at his level, and the amount of energy he had, there are so many
people who want him dead, maybe from the government or these unknown evil people, or they just
wanted to steal his energy.
He needs to hide himself out and in planes fight, protecting himself in impeccable locations
that sat on like vortexes or energy centers that the Earth naturally gives, and also surround
himself with other high-class things that energetically contain his energy and protect
him from this dangerous world.
By 1988, Lenz was purchasing million-dollar homes across the United States in order to
bring enlightenment to a wider audience.
I can work anywhere I want in the world.
I can do what I want to, when I want to, buy or not buy what I want to, and I have a good
understanding of art, literature, mathematics, geography, computer science, and the world.
I know a lot about people, I'm not a bigot, and I try to help people out whenever I can,
but I'm also street smart.
I know the street real well.
By the end of the 1980s, Lenz had begun to elicit a fair amount of attention from journalists.
LA Weekly published a several thousand-word expose, making it the centerpiece of the January
28, 1988 issue, with this illustration as the cover.
There's a newspaper in Los Angeles called the LA Weekly that ran a story called Busting
Rama.
I didn't know that there was anything to bust.
I mean, I don't understand what the problem is.
I teach seminars, they're very mainstream, I do them at Lincoln Center and every talk
about me.
The authors interviewed several ex-followers for the expose, marking one of the first
times Lenz was publicly confronted with the more extraordinary claims he had convinced
his students to believe.
I want to see if anything's are correct.
Others say that you make rooms glow with golden light, you can make the moon change
colors, the star spin, the wind stop.
We should all be so lucky.
It sounds like they're talking about Jesus Christ here to me.
It does to me.
Are you denied having ever climbed any of this?
Of course not.
If you meet an enlightened person, you will see, if you have the ability to see on a subtle
physical level, a beautiful golden light around them, oh, you may see many other things.
You claim to be one of the twelve fully enlightened beings on this planet?
No, of course not.
In my estimation, at this time, there are twelve fully enlightened teachers in this
world of which I am one.
Lenz claimed to be one of the twelve enlightened beings on Earth, do you know what he meant
by that?
Yeah.
People who have evolved, incarnated for thousands of incarnations, who have studied Buddhism
at a certain point, you get to a point like a Buddhist or a Jesus state, where you're
so enlightened and connected to the universe that you're at the top.
Are you one of the twelve enlightened beings on Earth?
I am an enlightened teacher and it would take about an hour to explain what that means.
Who are the other eleven?
Well, there's a very well-known gentleman in here called Satya Sai Baba and so on and
so forth.
Now, you wouldn't even know.
Wow.
It was almost a threat if you think about it.
If it's not him, there's a good chance you're not going to find the other ones.
You really lucked out or you were meant to find him.
Other claims include Lenz telling his followers that he could stop breathing while in deep
meditation.
When you go into Samadhi, very often you won't breathe for half an hour, an hour.
There's no breath at all.
And something called blisses, this line of puppets that Lenz had imbued with spiritual
energy.
What does this have to do with Zen Master Rama?
Anyone want to just jump in here?
I can guess.
It's fun.
I can guess.
It's called a bliss and you've got them in your apartment and part of the things they
do is get rid of demons.
Hold on.
Hold on.
But the most alarming revelation in the busting Rama expose was what Lenz did to many of
the women in the group.
We're not really having sex at all.
It's an exchange of energy.
As a young man in Lenz's circle, did he treat you any differently from the women in the
group?
I wasn't aware of it at the time, but the answer is yes.
So what was happening behind the scenes was that he would pick out some woman or young
woman and convince them that if they had sex with him, it's actually like a tantric way
of him imbuing them with spiritual energy.
The greatest transfer, karmic transfer occurs in, aside from meditating with someone, in
sex with someone.
He said that he had sex with many of his women students.
It was strictly a spiritual exercise designed to energize me and raise my awareness level
up to a higher realm.
I actually heard that some of his inner circle were convincing new people to do the same
thing because they were higher than everybody else.
I talked to one guy after the fact after we were both out and his girlfriend was one of
those people and they broke up because of it and he left the group not because he didn't
believe that he was unenlightened and he was a fraud.
He actually left because this feels unequal because there's no option for him to have
sex or some equivalent with this guy.
Throughout the 1980s, much of Lenzi's advertising campaign appeared to be aimed exclusively toward
women.
He has somewhat of a radical, very pro-women liberation point of view.
From a point of view of meditation, let's say that women have an inner power that men
don't.
We know that women and bodies are stronger than men.
They can endure greater temperature changes, heat, cold.
There are physiological differences.
But from a psychic point of view, women just have a stronger energy.
They can bear more and endure more.
By the end of the decade, Lenzi had accumulated over a thousand followers with a high tuition
inner circle of nearly 400 dedicated members.
The group had spread over the country with meditation bases in Palo Alto, Malibu, New
York, and Boston.
You originally started in New York, you moved to San Diego, you asked people to follow you
from New York to San Diego, you asked some of those people to follow you from San Diego
to Malibu.
Now I had a meditation center in San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
That's true.
I've never asked anyone to move anywhere.
Did Lenzi ever ask his followers to move or relocate with him?
Yes.
There would be rumblings for a few weeks or a month or two, like the exodus is coming
up.
You know, my first exodus was when we went from Boston to Los Angeles or to Chicago.
I can't remember the places.
You would leave all your friends and family and everyone you ever knew, like they were
old clothes that don't fit anymore.
When you show up to this new place, you're finally free of the past.
You get to reinvent yourself.
Instead of talking to your family members, you can give them their beeper number.
So you're like connected, but you never respond to the beeper number.
I was preparing for mine and saving money by living in my parents' house while I was
working full-time to disappear to New York and just disappear, not even say goodbye.
Gone.
There are certain places we call them places of power on the earth.
These are fabulous places.
These are places where there's more energy available.
For some reason, when you meditate in these places, it's easier to stop your thoughts.
There was a time limit hidden from the concerned family and friends who might be considering
an intervention.
If they didn't act quickly, they might lose the opportunity for good.
But without an understanding of what these students were experiencing, many interventions
went nowhere.
He asked, so, Moac, are you getting involved in a cult?
And I said, no, Rabbi, I'm studying spiritual mysticism.
And he sort of looked at me and he said, well, Judaism is a set of laws and we don't deal
with that stuff.
What the students of Frederick Lenz really needed was expert intervention.
Would you mind introducing yourself and giving a description of what it is that you do?
Yeah, hello.
My name is Joe Simhart.
I'm known as a cult information specialist.
Since 1980, I've helped people, families, the media understand the cult problem.
I've done interventions that were called deprogrammings or exit counsellings, approximately 500 or
more.
I also have a career in the fight arts.
Joe Simhart was a recurring voice of opposition throughout Frederick Lenz's career.
In the late 80s, he publicly confronted Lenz on the talk show, A Current Affair.
What does he do that creates such loyalty?
Well, for one thing, he sets himself up as something that he is not.
A Zen master, an enlightened being, a person who can traverse in the occult world at will.
I do two night a month seminars that a person attends and may or may not attend again.
I don't see how this race is a cult.
Joe's interest in this field came organically.
Throughout the 1970s, he'd been a member of the Apocalyptic Church Universal and Triumphant,
led by the charismatic Guru Ma, who claimed to be, quote, God incarnate.
In unraveling that whole thing and deconstructing what I had been involved in, I became kind
of an expert in the field of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age cult, Strait Buddhism,
self-help groups, all kinds of things that are related to this sort of activity.
The programmers and exit counselors got to know about me and asked me to go on cases
with them.
So I got, I guess, good at it at doing conflict resolution with families that were impacted
by this.
And quite a few people would leave these cults after talking to me, sometimes for several
hours, sometimes for a week.
Did Frederick Lenz first appear on your radar?
In 1986, a family called me from California complaining that their daughter had just
got home and she was a mess, had been living with Frederick Lenz, Rama, for three months
at his place in Long Island.
They flew me out and I spent a week with their daughter and she filled me in on Lenz's behavior.
He had her take LSD and she said during the first trip she ever did on LSD, he began to
scream and yell at her for failing him, for not respecting him as an enlightened person
and she was devastated and suicidal, he left her alone in the house.
Sadie's used as a woman, you know her?
Sure do.
She says she was seduced by you, you made her a mistress.
She says you encourage her to use LSD, try to make her believe she was possessed by demons,
told her she was the only one.
She called a friend that came and picked her up and called her family and they got her
on a plane and sent her home and so I helped her to deconstruct or debrief her about what
happened to her, you know what cults are about, what narcissistic leaders are about, the fact
that Lenz didn't appear to be enlightened, his claim to be enlightened was just the claim
to be entitled.
Well, she ran away, that's true, this is someone I spent some time with, a very beautiful young
woman who I went out with and we traveled together for a while and had a great time
together.
It seemed to have an obsession as some people do with demons, it was unfortunate, I liked
very, very much, I thought she was just super.
That started my career with him, one of his mistresses and subsequently I had Exit Council
of about five other mistresses of his and about 20 other members.
What were the greatest challenges in deprogramming a devoted follower of Lenz?
Yeah, so the difficulty is just getting the whole conversation started and once a person
realizes that it's all about their choice, you know, they can stay in the group forever
if they wish to for every reincarnation or they could talk it out and see what I had
to say or what the ex-member I had with me had to say, you know, over time in most of
those cases on the third day the person was ready to defect from the group.
Joe was often joined in these interventions by former students of Lenz, many of whom Joe
at Exit Council himself and when they weren't assisting in deprogrammings, these ex-followers
could be found protesting outside of Lenz's seminars.
Could you describe some of the common characteristics of a Rama student?
Most of them were quite attractive, young, intelligent, they could have been successful
in business, you know, higher than average IQ, lower than average IQ about confounded
religions and not understanding what Buddhism was really about so he could fool them as
far as that aspect of spirituality and, you know, hungry for either spiritual enlightenment
or success.
The unenlightened can only take you to the beach because they can't bring you across
the ocean.
God can do that directly if that's the will of eternity or God will do that through the
voice and the guidance of what we call an enlightened person.
It's this exchange between the narcissist and the hero hungry person.
The narcissist becomes a foil like a movie that they can watch and feel part of and they
join that guru on this stage.
You get kind of caught up in it, it becomes a self-sealing social system and anything
that's critical of that self-sealing social system is considered ignorant or evil or some
other thought-terminating cliche that prevents the person from thinking about the criticism.
During television appearances, Joe was often captioned as being affiliated with an organization
called the Colt Awareness Network.
This guy's not the head of the Colt Awareness Network, our eyes is a new programmer who's
hired to do kidnappings for about $2,000 a hit.
Even as it would be called, formed following the Jonestown massacre of 1978, when spiritual
leader Jim Jones coerced over 900 followers to ingest cyanide in what he called a revolutionary
suicide.
We cannot afford to forget what happened in Jonestown, said Cannes initial director.
They had annual conferences.
The basic function was to disseminate information about controversial groups.
There was a time, if you were worried about your son or daughter being in a cult, you
could get help from a small, non-profit organization called the Colt Awareness Network or Cannes.
One follower of Lens described the Colt Awareness Network as, quote, utterly vicious people
who prey on others religious freedom.
Lens himself told Newsday that, quote, Cannes to small religious groups with the KKK is
to black people.
If anything is a cult, it's the Colt Awareness Network, and I will tell you that.
That is a cult.
I think Lens is an individual who craves power.
I think Lens is an individual who has found how to manipulate people to satisfy his craving
for power.
There's an organization that calls itself the Colt Awareness Network, and they put families
in touch with kidnappers who go out and grab these people, sometimes 25 to 50 grand a shot
is paid by wealthy parents.
There were only two cases that I can recall regarding Lens, two young ladies that began
coercively, where the family had kidnapped them and flew me in after securing them to
try to talk them to leave Lens, and both of those cases didn't work, unfortunately.
But all the voluntary cases I did with his followers did work.
One of those women was Jennifer Jacobs?
Yes.
They had me knocked in this hotel for 11 days until I renounced my Lens system.
Okay, I am 22 years old, I'm a leading adult.
They have no right.
They can be concerned all the while, but they have no f***ing right to kidnap me.
In the September 18, 1992 issue of the Philadelphia Enquirer, a woman named Jennifer Jacobs published
a letter to the editor in response to an expose the Enquirer had published the previous week
As Guru's disciples hit town, critics cried beware.
The author of the expose interviewed Jennifer's parents, and they were quoted saying that
since joining Lens' meditation group, their daughter had stopped speaking to them and
quote, no longer has a sense of humor and has stopped playing the piano, a passion she
had since childhood.
Jennifer had written to tell her side of the story, quote, in 1987, my parents paid
$25,000 to have me brutally kidnapped, locked in captivity, terrorized and abused for 11
days in a filthy motel, in what was euphemistically called an involuntary deprogramming, end quote.
She used similar language in her affidavit, naming her parents as complicit in the kidnapping
and Joe as among the two deprogrammers.
I read the affidavit.
She accused Cannes of kidnapping her and holding her against her will in a motel room for 11
days in an effort to deprogram her.
Is there truth to that?
Well, Cannes, the call to awareness network had nothing to do with it.
Number one, they didn't hire deprogrammers and they didn't manage them, even though people
that did interventions attended Cannes conferences and would do some networking, but Cannes didn't
approve of kidnapping and deprogramming.
So that was wrong.
I'm trying to think of, I don't remember if it went 11 days, I think it probably went
like a week.
She went to a rehab center afterwards, agreeing to go, which was for ex-called members and
she escaped from there or left it because it was voluntary and she went back to the
group and after that we heard all this negative stuff about the experience.
That is a potent self-righteous man and that is the attitude of the whole call to awareness
network.
She was quite angry at her family and at me.
I've since met with her.
After she broke away from Lens and we reconciled all of that.
In 1992, Joe was quoted saying, I don't recommend coercive situations anymore because there's
too much trauma involved for everyone.
Hello power lovers.
I'm here today on top of the Continental Divide, 11,500 feet up above the earth.
I'm parked by the side of the road, it's around 7.45 in the evening on August 7th.
Occasionally a car or truck will roar by, I'm facing some distant power mountains, a
suitable place to discuss with you the end of the world.
By the 1990s, Frederick Lenz's career had entered a precarious phase.
On the surface, things seemed to be trending in his favor.
He published his first novel titled, Surfing the Himalayas, the story of a young spiritual
aspirant and a Zen master named Flop, who set out to snowboard their way to enlightenment.
Now your book is about a lot more than snowboarding, I mean in this case the perfect ride is really
about spiritual enlightenment, isn't it?
Snowboarding is spiritual enlightenment, snowboarding is the fastest growing sport
in the world and in five years there are going to be more people on snowboard than on skis.
But yes, you're absolutely right, snowboarding is about balance.
The novel sold 90,000 copies.
It was even publicly endorsed by Chicago Bull's head coach, Phil Jackson, who quickly
whiffed through the blurb after backlash from the Chicago Tribune.
The sequel, Snowboarding to Nirvana, also sold well.
In Rolling Stone, after reading the latest coverage of Pearl Jam's battle with Ticketmaster
and flipping past all the ads for CD subscription services, readers would find Lenz's face,
with two full-printed pages dedicated to promoting the new Zazen album.
There's also what must have seemed a reassuring amount of web-hosted fan pages that appeared
around this time, but Lenz's reputation at large only continued to plummet.
In 1993, ex-follower Mark Laxer released a memoir called Take Me for a Ride.
The book details how Lenz convinced his students that Sri Chenmoy couldn't actually achieve
Samadhi, the deepest state of meditation in which union with the Supreme is reached and
had only been faking it for clout, and how Mark and other male students were dissuaded
from even speaking to the women in the group for fear of bringing down their energy while
Lenz himself was privately pursuing them.
Laxer's impetus for leaving the group was the passing of a student named Donald Cole,
who'd named Lenz in the note he left behind.
Cole had been among the 400th students purged by Lenz for, quote, maintaining an abysmal
level of consciousness.
There were times where he, irrationally, I mean these were people, three or five hundred
people, who'd be giving him tens of thousands of dollars like constantly, and he would just
get rid of half of everyone.
He would just, like, wipe everybody out.
Sometimes a spiritual teacher will literally kick out some of their best students because
it's time for them to go out and experience for a while in the world.
Sometimes a student just isn't doing well.
They're knocking their head against the wall.
Well, if you're a good teacher, you don't let them keep knocking their head against
the wall.
They hurt themselves.
You send them out for a while.
People would be sobbing.
Lenz was simultaneously threatening to use his spiritual energy against students who left
the group of their own accord.
It is possible that he could give me cancer, or as I'm driving late at night, alone.
My card is my flip.
Do you know how Lenz would dissuade his followers from leaving his group?
Well, there was a lot of dark forces out there, according to him, and that without his protection,
you will fall into insanity, your life will collapse, you won't have a chance for enlightenment
for many lifetimes.
Now that you're sort of connected with his energy spiritually, if you were to leave your
body as so kind of addicted or connected that you would quickly fall into the lower levels,
kind of the hell levels of existence, in which case you'd go crazy, you'd get cancer, you'd
get into a car accident.
About three years out of the group, I still believed he could do that.
He could stop my heart.
He could cause a car accident.
But the 1990s saw Lenz's opposition ramping up as well.
Lenz's students managed to get his novels dropped from Barnes & Noble promotional events,
and reports surfaced of a group of parents called LenzWatch, who worked synergistically
with the Cult Awareness Network in order to find students and connect them with exit counselors.
For more information about Lenz and his followers, you can contact the Cult Awareness Network,
or a group called LenzWatch.
I had told my mother, whatever you do, if the Cult Awareness Network gives you a call
and tries to convince you that I'm in a cult, just hang up on them, they're going
to try to deprogram me and try to get tons of money out of you.
And then I walked away and she said, the Cult Awareness Network, that sounds legit.
So she called them, and it turns out one of the top cult interventionists or exit counselors
lived just three towns away, or five towns away.
And I still thought that they were going to be full of shit, but I was like, I might
as well listen to what they have to say.
My friends are there, my family's there, this guy who's the cult expert, and a few ex-members
are all there.
They show me videotapes of Scientology, the Boonies, and stuff like that.
And I want to say three or four hours into just talking and learning about Mind Control
and other cults, I had the sensation of popping out of it.
It was like, pop.
And I looked around and I was like, oh my God, you have no idea the shit I believed.
Oh my God, it was like waking up from a year, year and a half long dream and having the
memories of a totally different person.
I actually had my stepfather drive down to where my ex-fiancee, and she was still in
it, drove down after the first day, picked her up, brought her down, and I shared the
intervention with her.
And so she would pop out of it.
She was not as dedicated as I was, but there was still the Mind Control going on with her.
In 1996, Dateline NBC delivered a critical blow to Lenzi's career, a primetime expose
this time featuring an ex-member of Zazen who was quick to call Lenzi out for sharing
songwriting credits with the band.
I never, in my definition of composition and writing, saw him write anything.
What does he play?
He doesn't play anything.
The film crew captured a Zazen jam session, showing what Lenz psychically cleansing the
music looked like in action.
Now let's go in the opposite way down, and I get funky, funky, err.
He was apparently using a lot more drugs.
I mean, he used LSD, upers and downers, and from one inside person told me he had also
been using cocaine, and he looked, you know, the last time he was on television, was on
Dateline program, he was very thin.
I got this Caucasian body, and it's created all kinds of problems in the West.
I've never had one before.
It's a new experience.
I mean, it's to being shorter, and being in a land where I am understood.
He wasn't as effective as an influencer of the last couple of years, and I think a lot
of followers began to break away from him.
The segment also featured a newly defected Jim Piccarello, who at times seemed stunned
by his own story as he recounted it.
I thought that this guy can turn the room into gold.
I was pretty much into it at the beginning of the dinner.
By the end of the dinner, I was willing to hang out with that group for pretty much the
rest of my life.
Over time, not only did I see him turn the room gold, which I saw it every single time,
during a retreat, a desert retreat.
I saw him at night skate on beams of light, you know, over the sand.
Oh, I saw him disappear.
I've seen him turn into a woman, into a princess, into this weird bug-like creature.
I've seen him levitate.
In the very beginning, what did they do?
They had us get into a trance state by meditating, and then they would talk about what the experience
is when you're with a enlightened being, and you are spiritually sensitive.
A, you want to be spiritually sensitive, and you want to be better than other people.
B, you're interested in being with an enlightened master, because how cool would that be?
You're a special person who's learning stuff that no one else is learning.
You're in a room with 300 people that believe this guy is enlightened.
You've got the group dynamics that are shaping your experience.
And then when he comes out and he lowers the lights and gets you into a state and you have
a belief like, I want to be special.
I want to follow someone who's special.
Experiencing what they describe as historical enlightened beings are like an eye, saw, gold.
In the early spring of 1998, Long Island police pulled the body of Frederick Lenz from the
bottom of a bay located behind one of his New York homes.
A local reporter described a small crowd of onlookers who'd gathered to watch the scene
and a leading hypothesis that Lenz had been killed by the parent of a student, someone
who'd felt Lenz had, quote, brainwashed their kids.
Adding to this theory was a section of damaged railing along the pier, where it was determined
Lenz entered the water.
But when the body was recovered, they found Lenz dressed in a Versace suit with a dog
collar buckled around his neck.
Scotty Dog had died years before in a volume, and he had that dog collar on his neck.
He claimed the body was his most enlightened student, and that they had been together
many times in past lives.
I mean, this is how delusional he was.
Inside Lenz's home were two other Scottish terriers and one student.
The dogs were in critical condition, having eaten volume that was hidden inside their
dog food.
The student had also taken lethal amounts of barbiturates and was found staring at a
framed photo of Lenz with a note beside her that read, we all tried to go to the other
world last night, and only Rama made it.
Please help us make it to the other world.
The woman was discovered by the housekeeper when she came in, and she got help and survived
this overdose, and so did the dogs, by the way.
After a toxicology report found that Lenz had ingested 150 tablets of volume mixed with
vodka prior to drowning, his death was deemed self-inflicted.
Beyond this world, beyond other worlds, be they interdimensional worlds or physical worlds,
there is something else, which is that vast unknown that we call eternity.
It is where we have come from.
It is that which is within us, and it is where we eventually return.
I can't tell you what that is like.
I have meditated and experienced that.
I have tasted it and felt it, then I went beyond that to become it.
The widespread reactions of followers to Lenz's death have mostly been lost to time, but archived
message boards show students sharing photos of group memorials, and a sudden urgency to
reconnect with other members they might not have seen in years.
Oh, I actually found out about his death at my wedding.
I was walking around with my friend Bob, who was involved in my intervention, and we're
walking around and he goes, oh, what did you think about Lenz dying?
And I was like, what?
I was just surprised that he tried to kill other beings, which is so un-Buddhist.
I was like, okay, well, one less cult leader in the world.
I was in my mid-20s.
I didn't have a lot of empathy for incredibly abusive sociopaths.
Hi, my name is Rama, and today I would like to teach you how to meditate.
Lenz never groomed a successor to lead the meditation group in his absence.
On the contrary, he'd been adamant that none of his students had come close to achieving
a level of consciousness that could be called enlightenment.
So when my friends write me and tell me they're enlightened, it's like someone who's just
taken a second year of French course announcing that they've just completed their PhD.
So the group continued without a living figurehead.
Today, the few remaining and incoming students have virtual meetups to discuss Lenz's teachings
or to watch his favorite movies.
Some meditate on framed portraits of him they keep in their homes, others simulate his golden
light with augmented reality, and clips from his VHS tapes will occasionally appear while
scrolling YouTube shorts.
When you meditate over a period of time, you'll come to see more and more of the many faces
and sides of creation.
And in this one brief lifetime, you can experience ecstasy thousands and thousands of times.
Why do you think someone like Rama, even after all these years, still has a loyal fan base?
There are other groups that are selling his halt.
One of the ones that's most successful these days is run by a guy they call himself, Samvara,
who's a Lenz offshoot, or a Rama offshoot.
His real name is Jeff Malone, G-E-O-F-F Malone, and his group's called the Buddha Dojo, and
it was called Awaken Mind at one time.
But it's very Lenz-like.
When people approach that group, they don't know that Lenz is behind it, and they might
never know.
But once you get deeply involved, then it's revealed that Lenz is the guru.
You know, just like in his day, the seekers out there that want to believe that there's
people out there that are enlightened, and they think that if they come across one, they'll
recognize this person.
You know, they all use this line, when the seeker is ready, the Buddha will appear.
That line, that slogan, has probably gotten more people into bizarre cults, at least
Eastern groups than any other, because people in their own narcissism think that they will
have this insight or this psychic power to recognize a real guru when they see one.
It was Lenz's will that his net worth, which included several houses and cars totaling
around $18 million, be used to establish a charity in his name with the objective of
quote, disseminating Zen Buddhist teachings, meditation, and yoga in the context of what
I have taught as American Buddhism.
The Frederick P. Lenz Foundation for American Buddhism still exists today, and claims to
give millions to Buddhist-friendly causes across the world.
In 2013, a follower named Liz Lewinson crowd-funded $29,000 in order to write a biography of
Frederick Lenz, titled, Gaze in My Direction.
It was New Year's Eve, 1998, and he said to me, you will be my biographer.
Three months later, he was gone, he staged his exit.
Lewinson's account of Lenz covers much of the same time period as Mark Laxer's memoir,
but the tone couldn't be more different.
She describes the change of stage names as Lenz incarnating into the Hindu god Rama.
I don't like calling him Rama.
It's an insult to those who actually follow either Hinduism or Buddhism.
And Lenz's reasons for breaking away from Chinmoy, having largely to do with Chinmoy's
strict rule of celibacy.
I went through terrible times.
I went through times of self-hate, thinking how undeveloped spiritually I was everyone
else in the ashram, a thousand people.
We had a girlfriend or a boyfriend.
I did.
Sree Chinmoy never had the reputational downfall that Lenz experienced.
Around the time of Lenz's death, the Chinmoy centers around the world were celebrating
the completion of seven million bird drawings.
Chinmoy's students continued performing endurance challenges throughout the decades.
By the 1990s, powerlifting had become Chinmoy's preferred method of demonstrating the supreme.
Whether he was calf raising a helicopter or an elephant or wrist curling a giant dumbbell,
he always kept the cumulative weight prominently displayed for the audience to consider.
Occasionally he would combine his creative miracles for a show-stopping finale.
Chinmoy's sheer quantity of creative output has always been seen as dubious by those outside
of his meditation centers.
And some of his more outlandish feats, such as this lift, listed at over 7,000 pounds,
were difficult for even his most loyal adherents to believe.
But Chinmoy had a seasoned defense.
I don't blame people who suspect my performance, he said.
My own mind suspects it.
When Chinmoy passed away in 2007 at the age of 76, the way he was eulogized in the media
couldn't have been more different from that of Frederick Lenz.
In 2015, 13 ex-followers converged to form a YouTube channel called the Sree Chinmoy
Disciple Experience.
And you know, it's very scary and very daunting, especially when you hear all the horror stories
that gurus just tell, Sree Chinmoy says, oh, if you leave the center, you know, you're
going to want them, you're going to get raped, you're going to get cancer, you're going to
get the hostile forces going to capture you.
You know, that was like my only family because I had to cut off my real family for 21 years.
I just had pretty much resigned myself that that was it for this life.
You know, I just many times grew so it's just one incarnation.
And I thought to myself, okay, fine, I can just give one incarnation for this.
Being in the Meditation Center was very much about trying not to be human.
Certain parts of the being like between here and here and everything else was meant to
be dead.
He started out by having me sit in front of him and meditate.
And then he was like saying, are you surrendered?
And I had my hands full and I said, supreme, I bow to thee.
And then he was like, oh, are you really surrendered?
And then he said, take your clothes off unconditional surrender to the will of the Supreme.
The last development of the story of Frederick lens came in 2021, when the remains of Brenda
Kerber, a programmer and meditation student who disappeared in 1988 were recovered.
Her car had been driven into a reservoir and act that police ruled intentional.
She'd given up custody of her kids before her disappearance and her diary entries indicated
was so she could move across the country to follow lens, who she referred to as golden
boy.
So the cult awareness network seems to have dissolved in the late 1990s.
Can you talk about what happened?
So Scientology was one of the groups that really went after any group that criticized
them and especially hated the cult awareness network.
They sued the can group 50 times.
I got hit with 12 suits in one week.
I would open the door, a process server would give me a suit.
They were suing us all over the country, sometimes simultaneously.
There was a case in the early 1990s where the programmer named Rick Ross took on a case
in West.
It was a fundamentalist Christian group where he takes a counsel teenage sons of a woman
out of a group.
And then she wanted her then 18 year old son exit counseled also and it didn't work.
He had been kidnapped.
He went back to the group Scientology got a hold of the young man and got him to run
a lawsuit against the cult awareness network based on the fact that Rick Ross had some
vague connection to can even though he didn't attend the meetings.
Scientology's lawyers were quite adept at this kind of case where can didn't have good
representation because it was pretty funded and they couldn't afford a good legal team.
Scientology won the case.
They bankrupted can bankrupt the bankrupted group had to sell its assets.
The only top bidder was Scientology.
So Scientology purchased can in 1996.
So whenever you call one of his old cult awareness network numbers in those books you would end
up talking to a Scientologist.
What are you going to do when they're trying to destroy you look if you're a Jew if you're
if you're a Jew.
No no Jew is going to cry about the fact that the Nazi party is gone.
If you're an African-American no one's going to cry that the KKK is gone.
I'm not crying because can is gone.
Yeah.
The programming still happens across the country although it's rare to find cases labeled as
involuntary after the 1990s.
I still do cases.
The last case I did intervention case was in India was flown over there in September
and that case turned out fine.
Many ex-Rama students still appear to be in the computer programming industry.
One former student is quoted as saying I don't agree with how he treated women.
I don't think he was enlightened whatever that is.
What I did get from him was a career.
Others have turned their experience into cautionary tales.
After leaving Lenz's organization I didn't get cancer.
I didn't get into a car crash.
Since then I've had a number of companies as an entrepreneur that I started and I moved
up here to Maine and I built my own house with my wife.
We just read books on how to build a house and we did it.
And in the last 10 years I've discovered a love for rediscovered a love for filmmaking
and screenwriting.
I wrote a bunch including the one I had mentioned before about two people falling in love as
they try to save each other from their respective cults.
It's a dark rom-com called the cult of us.
But there may always be a market for the mystique of enlightenment as defined by those who
claimed to have achieved it and in a reality where only they can teach it.
Someone might say oh yes Rama wonderful he's an enlightened teacher but gosh I just don't
feel comfortable with him.
I just don't feel more comfortable with people than someone else whose name we won't mention.
Why won't I mention it?
Well you have to do some work.
I mean there has to be some adventure here.
Part of the test at least to get in is that you have to find them.
It's how you can go see.
And then you have to believe them.
I mean I could just be making all of this up.
Maybe I'm not enlightened.
Maybe it's an extra double bluff where I'm just saying all this so you'll just think
that I am.
You see?
Who can tell?
You can tell.
Who can tell and your heart can tell.
A big thanks to Jim Piccarello and Joe Zimhart.
I wouldn't have been able to present this story nearly as comprehensively without their
openness to sharing their experiences.
All day long from morning until night I thought about this dude.
Check out the links in the description to find Joe's YouTube channel where he continues
the cult monitoring work he's been doing for decades, and Jim's short films which
have won many awards in independent film festivals.
I also want to give a shout out to a YouTube channel called Slave O'Bays.
Without their efforts in archiving these talk shows from the 80s and 90s, important information
about these groups would have been lost to time.
And this isn't the first video of mine in which I've used archival clips from this
channel so a shout out is long overdue.
Lastly, if you enjoyed this video and would like to support the channel, my merch can be
found at atrocityguide.com, or you can support me directly on Patreon where you'll get
access to my Discord server as well as written progress reports on upcoming videos.
