The stage is yours.
Thank you, Zlatko.
Well, in this talk,
what I want to do is to ask
the following question.
What does quantum mechanics mean?
Well, without further ado,
let me just skip to my conclusions.
Nobody knows.
Thanks for coming to my talk.
I'll take questions.
Well, okay, actually, I do have a few other things to add.
The first is that
if you read a book or an article
that asks this question
and it doesn't, at some stage,
acknowledge this basic fact
that we really don't know
what quantum mechanics means,
then I advise you to read it
as you might say a book review.
That's to say, don't imagine that
the position it is giving
is one that will necessarily be
either right or wrong.
Judge it instead by whether it seems
to offer a stimulating
and productive way
to think about its subject.
I think this at the moment is the best
approach we can take
to trying to answer this question
of what quantum mechanics means.
Now, you don't need to take my word
for it that this ignorance
about quantum mechanics exists,
because I'm sure that many of you
will know this popular quote from Richard Feynman,
who said, I think I can safely say
that nobody understands quantum mechanics.
And let me remind you
that he actually said this in
1965, and that was
the year that Feynman shared
the Nobel Prize in physics
for his work on quantum mechanics.
So
at that point, there was probably no one
alive who knew more
than Feynman did about quantum mechanics.
And if this is the conclusion
that he reached, you might well ask
what hope is there for the rest of us.
But I think today there's
another way to answer the question
of what quantum mechanics means.
You see, one would be justified
in giving an answer to that question
like this.
This, of course, is IBM's
quantum computer.
And in other words,
quantum mechanics must surely tell us
something about the world
because we can now use it.
We can use its principles
to build machines like this one,
which in fact, Feynman himself
first envisaged in the early 1980s,
in which quantum objects
are manipulated so as
to let us do something real
and useful.
If quantum mechanics was not in some
sense a valid description
of the world, then quantum computers
would not do what they're supposed to do.
But as you'll see,
I think that today's
quantum information technologies
like this tell us something else about
the possible answer to the question
I started by asking, because
what they embody, and in fact
illustrate, is an emerging
sense among many, perhaps not
all, but many of the people who ponder
the meaning of quantum mechanics, that
it has something to say
about the fundamental rules
of what information is
and how it can be encoded,
moved and transformed
in the world.
Now, quantum mechanics has,
of course, a reputation
among lay people, in fact, among
many scientists, particularly those who
don't make use of it, for being
impossibly hard.
So here's some quantum maths for you.
But it's not the mathematics
that's the problem, or at least
it wasn't the problem for Feynman.
He could do the maths just fine.
The problem was, that's all
he could do.
What he couldn't understand
is what the maths meant, what it tells
us about the nature of the world.
Now, Feynman himself didn't seem
too troubled by that.
He said, you know, we've got a theory that works.
It gives amazingly accurate
predictions about how stuff
will behave. In fact, it's potentially
the most accurate theory
in science at all.
So what more can you want than that,
an accurate theory that works?
Well, some scientists feel the same
way today, but usually we do
want more, because we want to know
what our scientific theories tell us
about what the world is like.
And it wasn't clear to Feynman
that quantum mechanics
lets us do that, and it's
still not clear today.
But I want to suggest to you that
we can do better than
Feynman's admission of bafflement, or
defeat, I might say. We don't
have all the answers to what quantum mechanics means,
but we do have better questions.
We have a clearer sense
than we did in the 1960s, or even
in the 1980s, of what's
important and what is not. And I want
to try to give you a sense of what those
things might be.
So let me start with some things
that everyone knows about quantum mechanics.
And when I say everyone, I believe
that this audience is a diverse
mixture of experts who know much
more about quantum mechanics than I do,
and non-experts, perhaps non-scientists
who are nevertheless interested
in the subject, and everything in between.
So if you didn't know any of
these things yourself, don't worry, all I mean
is that these are notions that
you'll encounter pretty quickly the moment
you start looking at what at least has
been popularly written about
quantum mechanics. First of all,
we're told that quantum mechanics
is weird.
Things don't behave in the quantum world
in ways that we're familiar with,
and they don't quite make sense.
And here are some of the ways in which
they're weird. So
quantum mechanics can be both waves
and particles. This is called wave-particle
duality. Quantum objects
can be in more than one state at once,
and they can be both here and there,
say, this is called superposition.
You can't simultaneously
know exactly two properties
of a quantum object. This is
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
Quantum objects can affect
one another instantly over huge
distances, and this is often called
spooky action at a distance, and it
arises from a phenomenon called
entanglement.
You can't exactly measure anything
without disturbing it, and so the
human observer can't be excluded
from the theory.
It becomes unavoidably subjective.
Everything
that can happen, or that can
possibly happen, does happen.
And there are two separate reasons
why this claim is made. One is rooted in
Feynman's work itself, which says that quantum
objects take all possible
paths through space.
The other comes from the controversial
many-words interpretation of quantum
mechanics, which says that every time a
quantum system faces a choice,
it takes both choices, splitting
into separate worlds.
Okay, now
here's the thing. Quantum
mechanics itself doesn't
say any of these things.
They are all attempts
to say what quantum
mechanics might mean. Some
of them are misleading. Some
of them, I think, are plain
wrong. Others are just
unproven interpretations.
So I'm saying that
we need to change the record when
we talk about quantum mechanics. We need to
stop falling back on these tired old
cliches and metaphors
and to look more closely and more carefully
at what quantum mechanics does
and doesn't permit us
to say.
And the first point to realise is that there's a big
difference between quantum theory, the maths
and the mechanics that
scientists use daily to predict
stuff and to make devices like laptops
and phones and indeed quantum
computers. There's a difference between
that and the interpretation
of that theory.
And this is what's so hard
to grasp, because normally
the interpretation of a scientific theory seems
obvious from the theory itself.
Newtonian mechanics,
the old classical mechanics
that works for everyday objects like
tennis balls and spaceships,
this
tells us what paths
objects take as forces
act on them.
And we don't have to ask,
what do you mean by object?
What do you mean by path?
It's obvious.
That's not so for quantum mechanics.
And let me give you a glimpse of why.
To predict what a quantum object will do
in place of Newton's equations
of motion, scientists generally use
an equation devised by Irwin Schrodinger
in 1924 to describe
the idea that quantum particles
might act like waves.
The Schrodinger equation
doesn't give us a trajectory
for the particle, but instead
something called a wave function.
And the wave function can be used
to figure out where we might find
the object in space.
So the shape of a typical wave function
in space might look
something like this.
So what does this mean?
Well, it's often said that it means the particle
is smeared out over space.
And, you know, it does look that way,
doesn't it, from this.
But this isn't showing the density
of the particle over space.
This is the wave function,
and it's a purely mathematical thing.
And what the wave function
lets us deduce
is all the possible outcomes
of measurements of the particle's
properties, along with their relative
probabilities.
So to find the position
where we might observe the particle,
then we simply
calculate some number from the wave function
at that point in space,
and that gives us the probability
that we will see the particle
at that point.
So the wave function doesn't tell us
where we'll find the particle.
It tells us the chance
that we might find it
at any particular position
if we look.
And this is what's so odd about quantum mechanics
in a long direction compared to other scientific
theories, not down
towards the system we're studying,
but up towards our experience
of it.
It says nothing, or perhaps I should say
it says nothing obvious about
what the quantum system itself
is like.
In other words, the wave function
is not a description of the quantum object.
It is a prescription
for what to expect when we make
measurements on that object.
But it's even more peculiar than this
because the wave function doesn't tell us
where the particle is likely to be
at any instant, which we can then verify
by making measurements on it.
Rather, what the wave function...
Well, the wave function tells us nothing
about where the particle is
until we make a measurement.
Strictly speaking,
we shouldn't talk about the particle
at all, except in terms
of measurements we might make on it.
And this account of quantum mechanics
is more or less the one that was given
by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr
and his collaborators, such as Heisenberg.
And it's known today as
the Copenhagen interpretation.
And I'm not saying that the Copenhagen
interpretation is right, but what's
valuable, I think, about it is that it tells
us where our confidence about
the meaning of the theory has
to stop. As it stands,
quantum mechanics doesn't permit us
to say anything with confidence
about reality
beyond what we can measure
of it.
And here's what I mean by that.
One way of speaking about this measurement
of a quantum particle goes like this.
We say that before the measurement,
a wave function is typically this broad,
spread out thing. But
when we make a measurement
and find the particle to be in a particular
place, then the wave function switches
suddenly to being a sharp
spike at that single place.
And this is generally called
the collapse of the wave function.
And let me just mention that, contrary
to popular belief, wave function collapse
was never actually a part of
the Copenhagen interpretation, at least
as far as Bohr expressed it.
Now, the problem here is that there's
absolutely no mathematical
prescription in the theory itself
for how this collapse
happens. You just have to assume it.
You have to put it in by hand.
That doesn't seem very satisfactory.
But wave function collapse doesn't
mean that the particle goes from being smeared
out to being
sharply defined once we make
a measurement on it. All we can say
is that before the measurement was
made, there were different probabilities
that a measurement would reveal
it, in particular, in different places.
Whereas after the measurement,
we can say for sure that it is
here and not there.
It's our knowledge that
has changed. And some researchers think
that this, in fact, is really
what quantum mechanics is. It's a theory
that describes how our knowledge
about the world changes
when we intervene in it.
And we can't deduce from that anything
about what the world was really
like before we had that knowledge
of it. So, you see,
it's misleading to talk about this situation
as the particle being in many places
at once. The situation
tells us only what the possible
outcomes of a measurement
will be.
And it's the same with
quantum superpositions.
Now, it's often said
of superpositions that the odd thing about
quantum objects is that they can be not only
in two places at once, but in two states
at once. For example,
quantum objects have a property
called spin. And
all you need to know about it for now is
that for some particles
it's a property that can have
two possible orientations
when you measure it. The spin you could find
the spin of the particle points up
or it points down.
And so this is a property that can be used
to encode bits of binary
information. Up could represent
a 1, down could represent
a 0. And that's the basis
of all quantum information technologies,
such as quantum computers, because it means
that spins or other
quantum states can act as quantum
bits or qubits.
But you see, spins
at these quantum objects
can be not just up or down. That's
to say a qubit of
encoding a 1 or a 0. They can be
in a superposition of up and down
states. And this is a
property that somehow expands
the space of possible
states for quantum bits
and allows quantum computers to do
some calculations much more quickly
than classical machines.
Now, I've written it like this with these
odd-looking brackets
to stress that this is just a formal
way of writing
a superposition. It's not
a picture of reality.
You see, although
a spin qubit placed in a quantum
superposition is often said to be in
the two states at once, simultaneously
a 1 and a 0, let's say,
that's not really right. Because remember
that the wave function tells us
only what we can expect when we make a measurement.
And so in this case, it says
that a measurement on the qubit
could yield a 1
or a 0. Both, in this case,
are possible outcomes. And in fact, they're
the only possible outcomes.
But what's the qubit like
before we make the measurement?
Well, quantum mechanics doesn't really
tell us that.
Well, now you see, I'm talking not about smeared
out particles or collapsing
waves, but about how
information can be encoded
in quantum systems and how it can be read out.
And this is the basis
offered by quantum information technology
which isn't just
a basis, which isn't just
the basis of these amazing new technologies
like quantum computing or quantum
cryptography. It's also
a new way of talking about
quantum mechanics itself.
And potentially, talking about quantum
information might allow us
to see past all this
old style paraphernalia
of wave functions and
Schrodinger equations and quantum
jumps and to get to the core
of what the theory really
seems to be telling us.
And there's an example of what I mean by that
in one of the most perplexing features of quantum
mechanics, which is that
the outcomes of measurements
or observations seem to
depend on how much information
we gather about the system.
And this is something
that's commonly illustrated by the quantum
double slit experiment. So
if we send water waves
or light waves
through two closely
spaced slits, then
the waves emerging from each
will spread out and interfere with one
another and create a pattern
where they alternatively
reinforce or cancel each other.
So for light, if you do this, you find
a series of bright and dark
bands on a screen that's placed behind
the slits. If you do it
for electrons,
which according to quantum mechanics can also
show these wave-like properties, then you'll find
the same thing. You don't just get
two images of the slits
as you would if you were firing
sand grains through a mask from
a sand blaster, so
as you would in the top case here,
you get wavy interference.
You get this interference pattern, these many
bands of
more or less electrons hitting the screen.
And this interference
persists even if the intensity
of the beam is so low
that you know that the electrons will be going
through the slits one at a time.
It's as if each electron
goes through both slits at once
and interferes with itself.
But now if you put a detector
close to one slit
which can detect the electron and see
which slit it went through, then
you'll find indeed that the detector
will tell you it goes through one and not the other.
The detector might click or it might not.
But then if you find out
that information, what you find
is that
the electron
this interference pattern
goes away and the electron behaves
like a regular particle.
And crucially, it's not the detection
it's not that the detection itself
is somehow disturbing the electrons
motion and getting rid of this wavy
behavior. It seems to be the very
fact of knowing which slit
it goes through that destroys
the quantum like waviness.
And you can see that that's so in what's
called a delayed choice experiment
where you set up a detection scheme
in a clever way so you only detect
the particle's path
sometime after you're sure
it has passed through the slits.
So then you can be sure
that the detection itself isn't physically
influencing the passage through
the slits. Nevertheless,
finding out that
information will again destroy
the interference pattern. The particle
will behave like a particle.
But if you leave the detector there
and just turn it off
so that you don't know which slit it went through
then the interference returns.
It's as if the particles spookily
know whether or not your eaves
dropping on which path they took.
It's behavior like this
that led Niels Bohr to assert
that there's something special about measurement
of quantum systems that compels
a quantum object to make a choice
about the properties that it has.
And until we do that, or unless
we do that, the property
that the object has is undefined
and we simply can't talk
meaningfully about it.
Now famously, that idea
was at the core
of the dispute that
grew up between Bohr and Einstein.
For Einstein, this notion
that the world is somehow indeterminate
until we looked
seemed absurd. It seemed like
the antithesis of science itself.
And in 1935, Einstein
and two younger colleagues, Boris
Podolski and Nathan Rosen,
came up with a thought experiment
which they believed showed why Bohr's
view had to be wrong.
Now this experiment was
later put in a slightly clearer
form by the physicist David Bohm
and that's how I'll describe it here.
So this is how it goes. You have a box
that spits out two quantum
particles that are in an entangled state.
And this means that
their properties are interdependent.
So let's say that
they have
spins which can only have two values
when measured, like I said, spin up or spin down.
Okay, so if they're entangled
this means that the measurement
outcomes must be correlated
between the two particles. Typically
if one has a spin that points up
then the other one has to point down.
We can't specify
which is which, but we know
for sure that they must be correlated
because of the way we produce them.
So then if we measure the spin on one particle
and we find that it's
a spin up particle
then we know that the other particle
must have spin down.
Okay, now this correlation in itself
might seem unremarkable because you could
say the same thing about two gloves,
let's say, if I
sent, if someone sent them separately
one glove to me, one glove to you
through the mail. If I open
my package and I see I've got the right hand
glove then I know instantly without even
having to ask you that you have got
the left hand one.
But here's the crucial thing because according
to Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics
the direction of the spins
unlike the handedness
of those two gloves isn't determined
in advance. It isn't
determined until we, one of us,
actually observes
what they've got.
Now if that's so
then this so-called EPR experiment
seemed to be saying that making a measurement
on one particle
instantaneously fixes the
direction of the arrow of the spin
for the other. It's as if there's
some spooky
communication passing between them
and this is what Einstein called
spooky action at a distance.
It was Irwin Schrodinger
who shared Einstein's skepticism
about the Copenhagen view of
quantum mechanics. It was Schrodinger
who named it instead entanglement.
This kind of
instantaneous communication
or action between two objects
separating in space
was known to be impossible.
It was forbidden by Einstein's
own special theory of relativity.
So Einstein argued that quantum
mechanics couldn't be the whole story
here. There must be some missing ingredient
which he said was
some property which we now call
a hidden variable that
we couldn't measure but that
somehow gives
definite values
to these properties, the spins say
to the particles all along.
The problem is
that simply measuring particles
like in an experiment like this
measuring two entangled
particles isn't going to tell you who's right
Bohr or Einstein because that won't
reveal anything about what the particles were
like before you measured them.
So no one knew how to deal with
this apparent EPR paradox
as it was called and for decades
it was just brushed under the rug.
But all that changed in 1964
when the Irish physicist John
Bell whose day job
was as a particle physicist at CERN
in Geneva reformulated
the EPR experiment in a way
that suggested that it could be conducted
for real. So in short
Bell's experiment involved a clever way
of combining measurements made by
two observers on pairs
of entangled particles
where the observers themselves
decided how they'd
make the measurement.
The setup is actually what's sketched
on the blackboard here
with Bell but here's maybe a
clearer depiction of it.
So what you do is you
look at how strong the
correlations between pairs of
entangled particles are for different choices
of how you make the measurement. And Bell
showed that if the particles were either
classical or were
governed by Einstein's hidden variables
so that either way their properties
were actually fixed all along
then the strength of the correlations
that you get in many
repeated experiments here added up
in a certain way couldn't
exceed a certain value.
But if they were governed by quantum mechanics
as Boh put it
and Boh was right to say
that we couldn't see anything about
the properties before we measured them
then this correlation would be larger
than that threshold.
So these experiments were first done
in the 1970s by John Clouser
and Stuart Friedman at the University of California
or at Berkeley using laser photons
as the entangled object
and they've been repeated many, many times
since then made ever more
rigorous and ever more able to
rule out possible loop holes in Bell's
argument every single
time they've given the same very
clear result which is that
quantum mechanics alone is
right. Boh's argument seems
to be right and there's no need
no argument for Einstein's hidden variables.
So how can this
be? What's wrong with the EPR argument?
Well, Einstein
and his colleagues made the perfectly reasonable
assumption of locality
which is really saying that the properties
of a particle are localised
on that particle itself
and that what happens to this particle here
can't affect
what happens to another particle there
or some different part of space without
some way of transmitting an effect
across the intervening space between them.
But it seems that
nature doesn't work that way
at the quantum level. We can't
regard the two particles
in the EPR experiment as separate
entities even though they're separated
in space. When they are quantum
entangled they can be both
they have to be both considered in some sense
a single non-local
entity.
In fact, it's only if we accept Einstein's
assumption of locality
that we need to tell the story in terms
of particle one somehow
influencing the spin of particle two
when we make the measurement, this spooky action
at a distance. The alternative
view is that we
have to invoke quantum
non-locality.
This idea that somehow
quantum properties can be
delocalised between
two or more objects.
So here again, we seem to find this
issue of how measurement and information
and the re-information we get
from it seem to affect the
outcomes itself. As with
the double-slit experiment, you can
show in a belt test that it's not
the physical act of making the measurement
on one particle that somehow seems to fix
the property of the other.
It's the matter of
whether that measurement
unambiguously tells you
what the state of your particle is.
It's the knowledge that matters.
Measurement has become
something of a dirty word in quantum mechanics
because it seems to bring up
all these peculiarities. In fact, John Bell
placed it on a list of
bad words, which incidentally
also included information
that he thought should be banned from
talking about quantum mechanics. But these
days, measurement isn't quite
the mystery that it once was, even though
it's not fully understood yet either.
You see in Bohr's view, a measurement
is necessarily something governed by classical
physics, because ultimately
it needed classical-scale stuff,
a piece of apparatus and us to look at it.
And so for him, that was
the end of the mystery, because
he said that quantum and classical were
just distinct regimes, and we shouldn't
expect to be able to pronounce
about what went on in the quantum world
from the perspective of the classical one.
In effect, he declared that there was
a fundamental divide between them.
Now, it's not surprising
that that seemed a deeply unsatisfactory
answer to some researchers,
including Einstein, but today
we can do somewhat better
than that. We know, for example,
that a measurement involving
any measurement involving the interaction
of a quantum system with some
classical environment, like
a measuring device
that aims to extract information about it,
any measurement like that
involves entanglement.
Entanglement happens whenever
one particle encounters another.
In fact, quantum mechanics says
if they interact, that's the only thing
that can happen. They have to become entangled.
And if you make a measurement
so that more and more of these interactions
with the environment accumulate,
the quantum system itself
becomes more and more entangled
with its environment. You might say
that what this means is that the process
spreads out the
quantumness of the original object
into its surroundings.
And in that process
the quantumness kind of gets
diluted into the environment. And here's
what I mean by that.
Let's say you have a quantum bit, a qubit
in a superposition, and then
you make a measurement on it and it becomes entangled
with its environment. So the
superposition then spreads into
those particles too.
And if you want to demonstrate
that you still have a superposition
there at all, then you have to look
for it in all those entangled
particles. And that quickly becomes
impossible. It will be a bit like trying
to keep track of every single
gas molecule that you just breathed
out as it collides with and mixes
with all of those in the air around it.
So this process
is a real physical
process. It's called decoherence
and it leads to the apparent
disappearance of quantum
properties like superposition
in the original quantum object
when it's observed and when its properties
are measured. And it's possible
to calculate how fast
decoherence should happen
when a quantum system interacts with its
environment. And we find that
generally it's so fast it's almost
instantaneous. So for example
if you could somehow put a dust grain in
the air in a quantum
superposition of states, you can
calculate that it would decohere in this
room in about 10 to the minus
31 seconds, faster than
anything we can measure. And what
we're left with when that happens is classical
behaviour. Definite properties
with fixed values
such as a well-defined
position in space.
In fact, according to one theory
that describes how this decoherence
changes quantum to classical
it's a theory called quantum
Darwinism. This
process not only gives objects
fixed definite values
of their properties, but it actually picks
out from all the quantum
features. Precisely
those properties that are meaningful
in the classical world, properties
like position and speed
and charge.
So only certain
quantum features, the theory says,
have the right characteristics
to survive the filtering
process of decoherence.
And they do
that. They have those
properties because they are particularly good
at making many imprints
or copies of themselves
in their environment.
That's where the Darwinism part
of the theory comes in.
You see, when we make an observation
of an object, what we're really doing
is detecting the traces that it imprints
on its environment.
You can only see me now
because of the photons that have scattered
from my particles and made their way into the camera.
This all gets a bit more complicated
when we're talking about
virtual talks, but it sort of works.
And you can only hear me because of the
imprint that my particles have made
on the air molecules,
the movements of the air molecules.
In fact, you could reconstruct
everything you can say about
an object, like a dust grain,
say, from those
imprints, like the photons of light
that are bouncing off it here.
You could reconstruct all of that
even if
just after those
photons have bounced off, the object itself
was somehow to magically
vanish from space.
You could still see it from
the imprint that it's left
for a short time.
And you can all agree on my
properties, my position, the color
of my shirt, what I'm saying,
classical properties like this.
You can agree on them because there are
lots of the imprints that I'm making
on the environment. They're highly redundant imprints.
There are loads of scattered photons
from me, enough for all of you to share.
If one of you was somehow
able to harvest every photon
I scatter, no one else
could see me and make any
observation of me.
It's this creation of many
copies or imprints via interactions
and entanglement with the environment
that is described by quantum Darwinism
and that,
in this theory at least,
that is how quantum becomes
classical.
There seems to be no avoiding
for objects the size of a dust grain
even in a vacuum.
Interactions with thermal radiation
infrared photons from the warmth
of the room would still cause it
to decohere in about 10 to the minus
18 seconds.
Even if you put that grain of dust
in the cold emptiness
of interstellar space,
it would still decohere in about a
second because of the microwave
photons out there
from the cosmic background
of radiation.
In other words, the reason we can't
generally observe quantum effects
like superposition in objects of
everyday scale
is not because there's some law of nature
that forbids quantumness
at those scales, but because
decoherence will destroy it almost
instantly.
It does so because of quantum entanglement
itself. If we could figure out
how to put a tennis ball in some
well-defined superposition of states
neatly from sources of decoherence
and yet this is a tricky bit
somehow still monitor its state
accurately enough, quantum
mechanics says there's no reason why
such a superposition should be impossible.
Some physicists think
that there might be other factors in that
situation that will come into play
that will destroy quantum coherence
anyway, some think that gravity will do
it, but it's not clear
that anything extra is needed
to effectively banish quantum phenomena
at everyday scales.
In other words, the world
is quantum all the way up
and classical physics is pretty much
just what quantum physics looks
like when you're six feet tall.
And that's really what I mean
by the title of my talk.
And I should just add for this audience
that decoherence is the enemy
of quantum computing.
Computing with qubits relies
on keeping them in a collective state
of superposition while the computation
proceeds, decoherence will mess
that up. And that's why
quantum circuits have to be cooled
to such extremely low temperatures
within a whisker of absolute zero
because this suppresses all
the thermal jiggling that would otherwise
disrupt the qubits. And it's the
difficulty of maintaining this coherence
and suppressing decoherence
in ever greater numbers
of entangled qubits
that explains why quantum computers
so far don't have more
than around 70 qubits or so
to play with. But it's
a testament to how much power
quantum rules give you
that already quantum computers
can do in seconds
with just that number of qubits
some calculations
that would take today's classical
supercomputers a billion years
or so.
Now there's a curious thing about Bell's
experiments that's often not remarked
upon. Remember I said that the quantum
mechanics allows correlations between entangled
particles to be stronger
than they would be in classical physics
or for hidden variables.
But quantum mechanics too
sets a limit on how strong those correlations
can be. And it's not obvious
why they couldn't be stronger. We don't
know why that is. Why the world
isn't, if you like, even more quantum
than it is. But one useful way
to think about what's going
on there is that there seems to be
a limit on how much sharing
of information quantum mechanics
permits between
entangled particles.
So here again
what makes quantum mechanics what it is
seems at root to have nothing to do
with mathematical notions
and this is precisely where some scientists
think we should start
in trying to reconstruct
quantum mechanics from scratch.
Not from these ad hoc
guesses, as they really were
to begin with, about waves
and particles and Schrodinger equations
but from some simple
axioms, some simple assumptions
about what is permitted with
information, how it can be encoded,
how it can be transferred, how it can be
read out. And I want to give you just a
flavour of what this sort of reconstruction
would look like. There are many
of them that have been suggested. They all
are somewhat similar and I've taken
one at random that was suggested
in 2009 by
Borovoye Dakic and
Chaslav Bruckner at the University
of Vienna in Austria. They proposed
what they said were three
reasonable axioms about how the
world might be and this is what the
axioms were. First of all
the most
elementary components of the world
whatever those are can
carry no more than one bit
of information within them.
They assumed secondly
that the state of
what they called locality. So
the way they expressed it was the state of a composite
system made of many subsystems
is completely determined by measurements
made on its subsystems.
What that really
means is that there
are no secret
mechanisms like hidden variables
manipulating what's going on. Thirdly
they assumed that this property
of reversibility that you can
convert any pure states
from one to the other and back
again like a coin toss flipping
heads and tails.
So Dakic and Bruckner showed that
with these assumptions alone about
information really that
they will lead you inevitably
to only two sets of
possible rules about how things
can happen and those other rules
that are described by classical
mechanics and by quantum mechanics.
And what's more
if you modify this third axiom
to assume that
states can be interconverted
gradually little by little
rather than in one big jump
then you only
get rules that conform
to quantum mechanics.
So for a classical coin toss
for example a head and a tail
interconvert sort of abruptly in one big jump
it's either heads or it's tails.
In a quantum system you could
have a situation where you know you've got your hand
down on the coin and it can gradually
as you hold
it down it convert from a heads or tails
without having to pick it up and flip it over.
Okay so the point is
that these axioms about information
can by themselves lead
to quantum behavior that we're familiar with
like superpositions and entanglement
and some researchers think that these efforts
at quantum reconstruction
might lead to a completely
different perspective on quantum theory.
One in which
the physical meaning of all the
seemingly strange behaviors
at last becomes clear.
Now it remains to be seen
whether that will happen but I think it's already
illuminating that they
all focus on information
on how answers or measurement
outcomes are contingent
on the questions we ask
and how we ask them
and I think this is the most productive way to think
about what quantum mechanics seems
to be telling us.
It's a perspective that
I think is illustrated
really nicely by
a metaphor that the American
physicist John Wheeler
who studied underbore and who had
Feynman as one of his students incidentally
he suggests that maybe we should
think about quantum mechanics
as like this.
Let's think of it as being a bit
like the game of 20 questions
so I'm sure you know this game.
Somewhere you know one player leaves
the room and everyone else in the room
agrees on a certain person
a historical figure
a well-known person and then the
person outside has to come back in
and they start to
ask each person in
turn a question to try to
find out who it is that they've chosen
and they have to be questions that can only
be answered yes or no.
So you see they're really
quantum questions.
Now imagine you're the questioner here
so you come back in you start to ask
questions and you get your answers
you start off is the person male
and the first person says yes
and the second person
then you go to second person is he alive
no okay and you carry on
and
but you start to find an odd
thing that as you go on asking
more and more people it takes them
longer and longer to answer your
question is that you know they're having to think
about it well that's odd because
you know if they've agreed on a person
it's either the answer is either yes or no
what is there to think about anyway
you carry on playing this game and eventually
you think you're zeroing in on who it is
and finally you think I've got it
and you say it's Richard Feynman
and everyone laughs and tells you that
you're right it's Richard Feynman
and then you say well what was
going on why were you taking so long
to think about the answer and they explain
how they decided to play this
so instead of deciding
on a particular
person when you were out of the room
what they decided to do was to say that
the answer
that anyone gave
to the question you asked had to be
consistent with all of the answers
that had been given before they didn't
decide on anyone
but the answer that they gave
had to correspond
to all the answers that have been given so far
had to correspond to a famous
person of some sort or another
and so of course you know as the answers
went on it became harder and harder to think
well who does that apply to they're male
they're dead and so on they're a physicist
and so on you have to think
harder and harder and what happens
is that
as the questions are
asked the possible
answers get narrowed down
and in the end there's only one
person it can be it has to be Richard Feynman
but everyone was forced
by the nature of the questions themselves
to converge
on that same person
if you had asked different questions
you'd have ended up with a different person
a different answer
so the answer you got
depended on the context
there never was a pre-ordained answer
you brought that answer into being
in a way that is
fully consistent with the questions you asked
and what's more the very notion
of an answer at all only makes sense
when you play the game
you know if you'd come back in and said
oh I can't be bothered to go through this
just tell me who you chose
there would be no answer to that question
you have to do the
the enquiring before an answer
will be forthcoming
so quantum mechanics is like this
it seems to be a theory of what
is and isn't knowable
and how those knowns are related
and I like to think of this
in terms of a distinction between
a theory of is-ness
and a theory of if-ness
quantum mechanics doesn't
tell us how a thing is
or how a quantum thing is
it tells us what
and with what calculable probability
it could be
along with a logic of the
relationships between the various coulds
if this then
that and what this means is
that to truly describe the features of quantum mechanics
as far as we currently can
we should replace all the conventional
isms with ifms
so for example we shouldn't say
here it is a particle
there it is a wave
we should say if we measure things like this
the quantum object behaves in a manner
that we associate with particles
but if we measure it like that
it behaves as if it's a wave
we shouldn't say the particle is
in two states at once
we should say if we measure it
we will detect this state with probability
and that state with probability why
this if-ness is perplexing
because it's not what we've come to associate with science
we're used to science telling us
how things are and if there are ifs
at all it's because we're
partially ignorant about that
but in quantum mechanics as far as we can tell
at the moment the ifs seem to be fundamental
well okay
you might say but what's the stuff
that this if-ness is referring to
quantum mechanics doesn't
obviously tell us much about that
and all we have right now are hints
and guesses and to try to bring them into
sharper focus is a tricky business
it seems to demand an almost
poetic level of expression
which will send some physicists scurrying
for cover so here for example
is an attempt to do that
that the physicist Chris Fuchs
suggested he said maybe
quantum mechanics is telling us
that the world is sensitive to our touch
it has a kind of zing
that makes it fly off in ways
that were not imaginable classically
the whole structure of quantum mechanics
may be nothing more than
the optimal method of reasoning
and processing information
in the light of such a fundamental
wonderful sensitivity
and what Fuchs means here
is not the mundane truism
that the human observer disturbs the world
that's true in classical physics
rather quantum mechanics may be the machinery
that we humans need
we humans pitched at a scale
midway between the subatomic
and the galactic
to try to compile
and quantify information
about a world that has this
incredibly sensitive character
it embodies what we've learnt
about how to navigate
in such a world
and I think it's vital at any rate
that we understand that this if-ness
doesn't imply that the world
our world, our home
is holding anything back
from us
it's just that classical physics
has primed us to expect too much from it
we've become accustomed
to asking questions
and getting definite answers
what colour is it
how heavy is it, how fast is it moving
forgetting the almost ludicrous amount
about
that we don't know about everyday objects
we figured
that we could go on forever
asking questions
and being answered at ever finer scales
and when we discovered
that we can't
we felt shortchanged by nature
and we pronounced it weird
I don't think that will do anymore
nature does its best
and we need to adjust our expectations
so we need to go
beyond weird
thanks very much
thank you Philip
thank you Philip
for the wonderful talk
and I can
relay to you a few comments
before I get to questions from the audience
and the audience please feel free
to post questions again
and the chat is very active right now
so I'll try to
pull them out of the stream here
we have
by the way a few folks
I would just like to relay to you
since you can't see the chat yourself
this is nice stuff, enlightening
I thought I should relay that
we had
quite a few discussions
and questions I think that spawned off of
the discussion as to
let's see hopefully you can see me now
there we go
as to
why is quantum weird
in the sense of deterministic
is it because
we're used to deterministic theories
and I think you touched on this throughout the talk
and this is one of the essential points
but maybe if we
kind of come back to that
there was the locality
the deterministic
versus maybe non-causal potential
maybe if we could
sort of get your thoughts again
in a
in a bit of a summary here
of the discussion that is going on in the chat
yeah okay well I mean
certainly it seems to me that
as far as we can say at the moment
quantum mechanics
isn't deterministic there are
ways of interpreting quantum theory
that are deterministic
that in fact
do return us to some sort of
picture of there being real particles
that have real properties
and real places out there
there are
interpretations that suggest that
and if you like all the quantumness
or what we've
conventionally called the weirdness
put on to another
aspect of the theory but we recover
the particles so that's possible
but
but it's you know it's
unproven and
it's just one interpretation
and at the moment it seems
to me it's safest to say that
you know the
there does seem to be this fundamental
indeterminacy in quantum mechanics
so that if we make a measurement
on a system all we can
thankfully say is what the probabilities
of the outcomes will be
that perhaps we can never
say more than that
so we can ever exactly predict
what we're going to find
that's very interesting
and I think
folks I'm sorry we were going to have to leave the videos
off but hopefully you can still hear us just fine
we're having some bandwidth issues today
yes
so
interesting and maybe
a follow-up question from the audience here
in the classical world
are we perhaps too used to
trying to write down deterministic laws
could the classical world be modeled under
any probability or a probabilistic theory
perhaps to rephrase the question here
and should that really be
the comparison between
the quantum world and the classical
well
I'm certainly not an expert on this
but what I can say
in response to that is that
these efforts at quantum
reconstruction that I talked about
one way of looking
at that is that really
quantum mechanics
is simply a kind
of probability theory
it's just a different sort of probability
probabilities work
a bit differently from how we used to them
in the classical world
and one way of looking at it is that
is that
we should be thinking
probabilistically
more generally
and there are a whole set of possible
probabilistic
theories or theories of probability
and one of them corresponds
to quantum type rules
here again
we sort of come back to
quantum mechanics being
a theory about
no ability and how much
the world is really knowable
I mean the way that I think about it
that makes sense to me
is to
to suggest
that quantum mechanics seems to be
telling us that
we are
it's possible for us
to ask more questions
that nature can have answers
can have definite answers for
that seems to me to be really
the point
and that doesn't seem to be such an unreasonable
thing to propose
why should every question that we can pose
that we could pose
necessarily have a definite answer
quantum mechanics seems to be saying
it doesn't and so you have a choice
if you choose to ask these questions
you'll get this set of
responses if you choose to ask
this set of questions you'll get a different one
and they may not be compatible with each other
because you ask different questions
so it depends on the context
of the questions
that you're asking
I think that's
enlightening and maybe that reminds
me a bit of this game
you brought up earlier which was very nice
and I think you concluded by something along
the lines of you brought that answer
into being of oh it's Feynman
by asking that particular
set of questions
and I think it was Sash Karotkov
who also says in quantum mechanics
you don't see what you get
you get what you see
and
that brings me to
maybe your perspective or thoughts or opinion
on no ability
right so in these more recent
experiments
the quantum trajectory type of
experiments
those experiments can't always
they usually can't tell you
the future they can predict the future
they can't always tell you
exactly what in a way the state is
the quantum description
the quantum state is doing
as you are
subjecting the system
to an ongoing
interrogation
a measurement
and there seems to be this very close
one to one direct correspondence
in a sense
the randomness
only comes if you now suddenly change
that you have
a knowledge
about the system that is conditioned
on what you are measuring and you can update
that and there is always
in the case that you can do that update
perfectly which you can get close
to these days for some experiments
there are always
not a complete set of questions you can answer
perfectly like you said there are always more questions
in quantum than perhaps you can always get
a deterministic answer for but there is a subset
of those questions that you can always know
but if you ask the question
is the qubit along
the x direction
let's say you always get a perfect one
even though you have been injecting randomness
into the system
throughout with your measurement
maybe that was a bit long of a question
so I apologize for that
Phil
but perhaps if we can get your thoughts on QTT
and a bit of that that would be great
well I mean
of course Lako
knows about this rather than me
I was absolutely fascinated
by those experiments
for various reasons
but I think that
perhaps the main one
was that it seemed
to me that you were
really starting to narrow
to zero in
on what is happening
when we make a measurement
and in particular
to dispel this idea that
measurement is this mysterious black box
that suddenly turns
all the quantum
vagueness into something concrete
that
what really excited me about them
was that you can see that process
happening
and that there are laws to it
that it's not
just magical and unpredictable
and everything else
that as you say
if you are able to follow it
in sufficient time resolution
in sufficient detail
almost everything about what is happening
in the system
then you can see something that does look like
a trajectory that is taking
the system from one state
to another
and
this is why
I mean it certainly convinced me
that this notion of wave function
collapse as a mysterious thing
that suddenly snaps
a wave into a particle
that we really
it's never really been needed in quantum mechanics
I understand why it got there
but it's time to get it back out again
because we don't need it
and it seems to me that
that is getting
much closer to having
a proper understanding
of what it is that happens when we make a measurement
perhaps the one thing
and I'd be interested
in whether you have thoughts about this
because the one thing that
it doesn't
seem to
explain
and this is really the sort of
fundamental mystery in quantum mechanics
why do you only ever get one thing
and of course there are some interpretations
that say well you don't you just get both
in different universes
but as far as we can ever see
quantum measurements are unique
so where does that uniqueness come
from given that we know in principle
more than one
outcome is possible
that's a really deep question
I think in fact I got asked a similar
question at my dissertation
defense
in the private
dissertation part where they take you
aside to a room and quiz you
until you come to a point of
anyway
so I don't know that I have a great
answer but maybe a few thoughts that
probably something you've written about quite a bit
as well is this notion you brought up
earlier and I think
you said Bell maybe had introduced
two different
disconnected worlds
the world of the quantum
and the world of the classical
and there's this notion of Heisenberg's
cut
the boundary between these two
and there's no
prescription
in any textbook or in any paper that I know of
that you can find that
really pins down where
does this difference
occur between what you call a measurement
apparatus
where you get classical results
out of the system
and what is the quantum system
so for example coming back to this
to the quantum jumps
nature paper you brought up earlier
you could model, you could take
that Heisenberg cut at different
stages of the experiment
and pretend like for instance just the
qubit itself is quantum and it's being subjected
to a particular classical measurement
apparatus that has this particular
type of question it's
interrogating the system with
kind of like the game that you mentioned earlier
but it
turns out that in what we had
to do for the experiment is we moved the cut
one step further that
apparatus was a particular
type of superconducting cavity
and we model all
of the quantum behavior of it as well
now
that particular cavity
is then followed
by another quantum amplifier
and we could actually include the quantum amplifier itself
and also make this very
large now quantum system you know now you have
three different quantum systems that are all coupled together
and you have this kind of matrushka
doll of nested
larger systems that are
increasingly becoming more classical in a sense
because at each stage
you're amplifying and in a sense
the signal there's more quanta of
excitation that are getting involved
and perhaps with that once you
have like you said the
grain of dust that's floating
in the air
when you have so many quanta so many excitations
then you tend to
couple more strongly to
this
well
decoherence right whatever that is precisely
in itself
and you tend to move already in the limit
of where
a lot of the quantum nature
tends to seem to get erased
or washed out in a sense
at that stage though it's still purely
quantum system you could reverse and undo
the measurement in the sense of
taking that information because you're keeping track
of it and sort of feed it back into the system
you still have all those degrees of freedom
and then after that following amplifier
that comes after the cavity
then we kind of don't know where to draw that
you know in terms of the empirical
experimental world
that's roughly as far as our models
are able to get us you know after that
we don't really have an equation or model
we could write down that
we're currently able to say oh you know now it's quantum
so it's
empirically we see that okay it occurs somewhere there
but is that a limitation of our ability to express it
or not
is this I mean it sounds to me as though
this is again really about information
but in you know this notion of a
cut it sounds as though what
that really means is
where do you decide the point comes
where you're not going to any longer
or you can't any longer gather
pretty much comprehensive information
about everything in the system
and once you
you know once you relinquish that attempt
that's where the cut happens
because you have imperfect
information is that is that the right way
to look at it
I think that's
that is definitely a practical way
to look at it that seems to work
in practice
is it the ultimate solution I couldn't say
and
sorry go on
no no no that's fine
that's just what occurred to me as you were describing
the experiment you know it seemed to be
a matter of well how far
out can you keep going
in your apparatus
and still retain the ability
to monitor
you know more or less everything
that is happening at the sort of quantum level
exactly
and more we've been able
to now push that further and further out
and see that as you kind of climb up
the Matreska dollar the chain
of nestedness here
you can move that Heisenberg
cut quite far out
and still model things
but at the end of the day we've simply moved the cut further away
but we still have the cut
so is it a fundamental cut
or not I think that's an open
question as far as it could tell
but another way that people think
about and I think we'd mentioned this is that
you could say that
to the contrary I think of
what
Bell had said
John Bell I think he said
had banned measurement is a bad word
I think to more experimentally
minded people like myself measurement
is actually probably the essence
of the whole theory it's what we do
it's what we model it's what we
describe that should actually be the core of it
so perhaps we should start not with Schrodinger's equation
which describes what the state
of the system would have you know
if that even exists in of itself out there
is but maybe we should start with a description
of the measurement so you know I could save
closer along the lines of QCT
you know you could take that
interaction between what you call
a system and the actual measurement
because the problem is that in Schrodinger's equation
a measurement is completely absent
so Schrodinger's equation is linear deterministic
there's nothing really
weird
in Schrodinger's equation in a sense
the randomness if you want
the weirdness of the quantum randomness
that comes into play
only occurs at the stage of the
actual measurement when you have von Neumann's postulate
and so on
that process that I think you so nicely pointed out
is what now
the field of physics is being able to
kind of open the hood on and describe
but I think
we've maybe said a lot on this
perhaps if you'd like to share this
a question from the audience here on
and you'd let me know if you'd like to take this one
if you could share your thoughts on Maxwell's
demon
and perhaps how that relates
to all of
quantum mechanics in the sense that
you have
I'm kind of reading into the question here
you know
this
when it comes to no ability
and
trying to kind of sift or parse
and sort of beat the laws of thermodynamics
in a way
but now at the level of quantum
so perhaps if you'd like to offer some thoughts on that
on Maxwell's demon
very timely I've just been writing about Maxwell's demon
today
and have done previously
and
everything that is
discussed
within the context of Maxwell's demon
is classical
although there is a quantum Maxwell's demon
as well
there is a quantum version
but classically again
it illustrates how
so much seems to come down
information
so
and in essence what Maxwell's
demon
tells us is that
information itself is a kind of resource
that we can use
to do stuff with
which I just find extraordinary
I mean it may be that not everyone
knows what Maxwell's demon is
very very briefly
it was a way that James Clark Maxwell in
1867 suggested
of subverting the second law
of thermodynamics
the second law says
you can express it in many ways
I mean the simplest is just that
heat always flows from hot to cold
and never the other way around
but what
it also implies
is that
you can never get energy for free
there's no perpetual motion
that any system
that
works
some energy is always going to be wasted
and lost as sort of random motions to the system
as entropy in fact
so the entropy of the universe always increases
and Maxwell didn't like this
partly for religious reasons
and so he came up with this idea of a little demon
that could actually reverse this
by
having a trap door between two compartments
with gas in them
both with gas in them
gas starts at the same temperature in both
hotter molecules are the ones that are moving faster
in the gas
so the demon looks at the molecules
and sees if a fast molecule
is approaching from one direction
he opens a trap door and lets it through
if a cold molecule is approaching from the other direction
he opens it and lets it through
and so all the hot ones go one way
all the cold ones go the other
and he ends up with hot gas on one side
cold gas on the other
which is basically then there's a thermal gradient
that you can tap
to do some useful work
so you've got energy essentially from nothing
from just an ordinary gas
so for a long time
people figured there must be something wrong with this
how can it subvert the second law
and it turns out that the answer
is it can't because of information
and in this case it's the information
that is recorded
in the demon's mind
it has to be
gathering information about those gas particles
in order to do what it does
and eventually
that information, its mind is finite
and it has to
erase that information
otherwise it's just too full and it can't do anymore
and erasing that information
costs energy
and in effect you get back
all the energy that you thought you'd got
from the operation of a demon
so there's, you know, you still don't get anything
for free, any energy for free
so this is about information
and people have realised that actually what this means
is that what looks
to be sort of randomness, statistical randomness
you know, at one level
if you can zero in
and get detailed information
about what is going on
then you can use that information
to mine the sort of random
fluctuations in there
and get energy out
and there have been experiments recently
that have shown this
that have actually shown that you can
get an object, in this case it was sort of
raising up a tiny little
particle
that was sort of floating about
in a liquid if I remember rightly
by making observations on it
gathering information about its movements
and using that in some clever way
you can actually do work and raise it up
against gravity
so information becomes
a resource
so again there's this fundamental idea
and then the quantum
version of it which I won't go into
is just sort of enacting that same idea
in terms of quantum information
so it's really
interesting how yet again
so many ideas, fundamental ideas
in physics
but we also see it happening of course in biology
are coming down to this
question of what information is
how it is embodied, how it can be
used and manipulated
and how it can become
a resource that we can exploit
Thank you Phil, that's wonderful
I see that
we have a few more questions
I won't be able to get to all of them since I see
we're about 15 minutes over
but perhaps let's take one more final
question from Pranav
here
if of course Phil you would be happy to share
with us on
how did you decide
to go into physics and then if you could tell us
a little bit about your transition into becoming a
science writer
and editor, I think
it seems like there's interest from the audience
if you'd like to share with us
Well, talk about random walks
this was certainly one of them
because I began
my first degree was in chemistry
and it was at Oxford where
the final year you have to do
a research year which was
fantastic, it was by far my favourite part of the course
and I did it
in physical chemistry
on the
quantum mechanical behaviour of molecules
absorbed on surfaces
which is right at the borderline
of physics and chemistry
so when I came to do a PhD
I just so happened that I ended up in a physics department
looking at similar stuff
condensed matter and behaviour
of objects
and fluids at surfaces
and so that brought me into physics
but I figured at the end of that
this was going back a long way
I can tell you
unlike most people I'd actually enjoyed
writing up my thesis
and I enjoyed writing the papers that came out of this
out of the PhD
and so I thought well you know I'd never thought about this
before I'd always enjoyed writing
but I'd never thought about combining my
enjoyment of writing with science
but you can and I decided
I'd see if I could do that
in science editing
and I was very lucky that just at the right moment
a place came up at nature
which in those days this was a late 1980s
was just a journal
it wasn't this big publishing empire
it was just a single journal in a little office
it crammed off this you know piled with paper
and I got a job there
as an editor of physical sciences
and it stayed there for a long time
it was a fantastic place to work
it meant I got exposed to all areas of science
it was a very very steep learning curve
and it also opened up other opportunities
to do writing for newspapers
and so on
and eventually I decided maybe I'll write a book
and I did and it was an awful experience
in the sense that I was working
full-time at nature which was already
you know working
it was already an intense job
so I figured I don't want to do that again
but I want to write more and I gradually
became more and more part-time
at nature until I finally stepped down
I forget when it was but it was probably about
20 years ago now I
stepped away from nature
and I'd still write for them regularly as a freelancer
but I became completely freelance
and now I split my time writing
I guess pretty much 50-50 between
writing books generally on scientific
subjects often about how science
interacts with the rest of
with the wider culture
and writing scientific journalism
Thank you Phil, that's
an inspiring story
I think with that
I'll
take maybe any final words
you'd like to share with us before we
thank the audience and yourself
for joining us here today
Well
well just to thank you again
Slaco for
inviting me to give this
talk, it was great fun
it's always been a lot of fun
having any interactions with
IBM generally and with the
IBM quantum computing
efforts in particular
so it's very nice
to be able to sustain
that relationship and you know
I'm always fascinated
to see where
quantum computing at IBM and quantum
technologies at IBM have advanced to next
so keep me
in the loop about that
Wonderful and I think we all look
forward to rereading many more books
and articles from you Phil, this was
an absolute delight, thank you
everyone for tuning in today
I still see we have over 130 folks
tuned in, you know 20 minutes over time
so I appreciate your time, thank you
very much, this talk will stay recorded
and live on the Kisken YouTube channel
so feel free to subscribe to hear about future updates
Thank you Phil for taking our invitation
it has been a real
privilege and pleasure to have you here today
and
thank you everyone, we will see you next Friday
at noon eastern time
Thank you
you
