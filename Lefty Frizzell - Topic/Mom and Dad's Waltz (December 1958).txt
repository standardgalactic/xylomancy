I'd walk for miles, cry or smile for mama and daddy
I learned them, I learned them to know
How I failed, my love is real
For my mama and daddy
I failed to know, I love them so
In my heart, joy, tears, stars
Cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for mama and daddy
And each night I'd walk for miles, cry or smile for mama and daddy
I learned them to know, I love them so
In my heart, joy, tears, stars
Cause I'm happy
In my heart, joy, tears, stars
Cause I'm happy
And I pray every day for mama and daddy
And each night I'd walk for miles, cry or smile for mama and daddy
I failed to know, I love them so
I love them so
