What is the first book to start in learning differential geometry?
What is the best choice to select books?
What are the most common mistakes that you make while reading books?
What is the method and sequence of study?
Will you learn the proofs first or go directly to the problems?
Is it difficult to start learning differential geometry?
In this video, I am going to answer all those questions and I am going to give you the right
choice of books.
I am also going to go through each chapter of the book, explain them to you and tell
you the right method of study.
Remember, a wrong choice right at the beginning might destroy your interest as well as love
for the subject forever and you may never find it interesting to study.
So please be careful.
Well, my name is Shaanak and you are watching this video on my channel, Physics for Students.
Welcome to yet another new episode.
What is the right book to start learning differential geometry?
Well, we would go through the book and the further details but first let us see what
are the topics that we are covering today.
We will first learn what are the mistakes that we make because until we recognize them,
we will continue making these mistakes forever and we will fall into a forever loop.
How to overcome the mistakes that would be today's focus?
The very first book to start with, what is the edition you should select?
What are the reviews that are published at Amazon about that book?
Who should read this book, I mean to say the target audience?
What is the content of the book and importantly how to get this book?
Here I am making this video after going through at least 20 to 25 books on differential geometry
and that is how I have come to this book and I want to make you very careful that while
you are selecting the book in order to study for the first time, be very careful in understanding
which book you select.
So first we will understand what are the common mistakes that we make and how we can overcome
those.
So as you see the differential geometry as itself can be divided into two parts.
The first is the extrinsic differential geometry which basically consists of submanifolds of
Euclidean space and these are easy to visualize because they are mostly on R3 or a three dimensional
space.
Now the intrinsic geometry are basically manifolds which contains the Riemannian metric and other
metric spaces and these are difficult to visualize because they are very very abstract.
The question is that when we are talking about difficulties in terms of visualizing and something
which is easy to visualize, what is the way and what is the path that we should take?
Now see the common mistakes that you make is that first you do not have the necessary mathematical
prerequisites and you immediately jump to differential geometry, you get frustrated,
you get problems and you get rejection.
Now I have talked at length what are the prerequisites, even what are the books that you should read
before getting prepared for differential geometry, I would request you to look into my earlier
videos which is there in the playlist of differential geometry.
So my advice would be please go through that video and first learn that yes are you ready
with those mathematical tools to jump to learn differential geometry, if yes you can go ahead,
if not then please go ahead and learn those prerequisites and then come to differential
geometry.
The second problem is that you directly jump solving the problems and what is the effect
is that you waste time because you are unable to solve it, you get confused, you look around
here and there, you know the blogs and the YouTube videos etc and you look around to
find the right solution but you waste a lot of time and you do not do.
And the third one is that you get into the mathematics to know without the reason which
is the most important factor and we are going to make a remedy out of that, you make mistakes,
you are unable to visualize and the abstract mathematics becomes an enemy for you that means
that it is no longer an abstract mathematics but you try to fly away and try to avoid those
things.
The question is that what is the solution?
Now these are the things which are very common knowingly or unknowingly you make a mistake
or we make a mistake without understanding we jump directly to the problems.
What is the solution coming up in the next part of our video?
So today's focus would be in this video we would focus on which book specifically we
would be talking of one book because unnecessarily dealing with many books does not really make
sense.
We what and why we should read the book and how shall we study and most importantly what
is the process and method of study.
Now I would like to tell you that because there might be many other books which I have
spoken earlier in the videos as well as this book you might want all those books with you
but remember there is problem which is called a choice overload.
If you have too many books you won't go through it.
If you have too many texts you won't read through it.
If you have too many solutions you won't run through the solutions.
So what will happen it will remain in the text box in the text of that or in your inbox
or in your hard drive.
So let us pick up one book concentrate learn that and that would solve our problem.
So the first thing is that you understand we need to understand why you are studying
the subject.
If you understand why you study the object then you get a proper direction and objective
that okay so I know what I am learning and what is the direction.
Now once you get a proper direction you start seeing what is in front of you.
That means okay this is not abstract but something I can see that this is the result.
This is the outcome and this is the practical application and what will happen is that abstract
mathematics starts to become concrete as I was telling that if you jump directly without
knowing the objective it will forever remain as an abstract enemy but if you start seeing
what is in front of you the abstract mathematics starts to become concrete.
You can understand the practical application of the subject which will give you a concrete
reason that when you do the mathematics you do it with a proper reason.
What is the final outcome of all those things that we are talking you would start loving
differential geometry and I can tell you it is one of the most modern and one of the
most interesting subject which can give you a great career and a great learning ahead.
So what is the first books to start with.
Before we start mentioning about the book we should know what is the objective.
So we will enjoy the learning differential geometry to know the present we need to know
a little bit about the past.
You really know the reason why those theorems came and once you know the reason why those
theorems came the learning becomes much more effective.
So this is the reason that why you should read this book to enjoy to know the present
and you know what the theorems coming from so that the understanding become fun.
Okay so there are several editions of the book that I am talking about.
This is the book called Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometrics Development and History by Marvin
J. Greenberg and this is the book we are going to talk about.
It contains the mathematics it contains proofs and many other things which are yet to explore.
So the first edition would look like this.
The second edition has changed its color.
The third edition would be this and the fourth edition is the black one.
So more or less you can expect the fourth edition.
The first and second are there but I won't recommend to read it.
So let us start with the third edition and the total number of pages are around 665.
So quite a heavy book to read.
So what is the price at Amazon.
It is around in India, Amazon it is around 26,000, 17,000 and if you want to buy a paper
back it is 16,625.
Don't worry about the price.
There is an element of surprise waiting at you.
How do you get this book?
Okay if I go to amazon.com then it is around 13.34 dollars and it comes for 34 dollars and
the fourth edition comes for about 99.95 dollars.
So you see here we get the third and the fourth edition but if I go to Amazon India
I even get the first, second, third and the fourth edition and if you go for an e-text
book it would be around how much it is coming to 63 to something.
That's it.
So this is the book.
It has got an Amazon rating of 66 percent.
This is the professor, is an American professor of mathematics, Marvin J. Greenberg and received
his doctorate from Princeton University under the famous Sir Glank.
And you know who is Sir Glank, got a lot of books on differential geometry and specifically
on linear algebra.
Okay, what is the review at Amazon?
So it has got a five star and more or less you can see whether for class or for personal
learning remarkable, somebody has written four stars, it is a good deal.
So more or less you can see great content but bad impression.
This bad impression you can read is basically for the printing but overall that means it
says that it is quite a good book.
Okay, question is that who should start reading this book?
I mean to say who is the target audience?
So you see the author himself has written over here school and college geometry teachers
with a rigorous treatment of the foundations of Euclidean geometry and introduction to
hyperbolic geometry, general education, even liberal arts students can go through it who
are willing to know the philosophical implication and the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry.
So it is very clear, high school and college geometry teachers and it can go ahead with
general education and liberal arts people.
Okay, and he has further written that here you see if students do not do a good number
of exercises they will have difficulty following subsequent chapters.
So that means this book which we are going through will have lot of exercises and I encourage
you doing those exercises otherwise you won't be able to learn.
Now the question is that before jumping into maths, one of the things that you really need
to know.
Okay, who should read this book?
Now here is an important thing, see he has written that I have used the development of
non-Euclidean geometry to revive the interest in the study of Euclidean geometry.
So you see it goes the other way round instead of going from Euclidean it starts with non-Euclidean
because that is fairly more interesting we will all agree on that so that the people
have an interest in Euclidean geometry.
So you will learn the non-Euclidean geometry and then you will learn Euclidean geometry
much better.
So I believe that this approach makes a traditional college course in Euclidean geometry more
interesting.
Okay, okay yeah that's it and to identify the philosophy.
So we will see the content of the book very in details.
The first would be the Euclid's geometry which basically starts you see we are starting
with Euclidean geometry why because we want to make the base very strong.
So there is a very brief survey of the beginnings of geometry.
It starts a little bit with the history that is the Pythagoreans and then it goes to Euclid
of Alexandria.
So this is very important because until we know who are the founders and how things happen
it would be difficult.
The book goes further into Euclid's first four postulates attempt to prove the parallel
postulate.
There are figures like that and that's it.
So Descartes analytic geometry is being covered and the briefly the number pi along with I
mean to say a little bit of history.
So you establish a relationship with these geometers and these people were way back in
the history and that is how you start learning that.
Okay, logic and incidence geometry, incidence geometry you all know that when we remove
those curves and these functions and angles what it is basically the line and the point
that is called.
So here you see logic and incidence geometry has to start with teaching you what is called
elementary logic.
So you see it starts with elementary logic then it teaches the theorems and proof if
hypothesis then conclusion and it can be translated.
So if first you are again learning logic why because there will be certain proof based
systems which you need to prove.
Then the book will go into see this logic rule and it explains all those symbols also.
So if you don't know logical quantifiers you can take a deep breath because this book is
going to teach you that and you see that incidence axiom one two and so on and then
at the end there's a huge number of exercises projects and things like that.
So here you see the definition is given with axiom a brief history of real projective geometry
and what is projective and affine planes.
Then we start with Hilbert's axioms the flaws in Euclid the axiom of betweenness and what
are the axioms of betweenness that is being covered.
Then we forth come to what is called neutral geometry I have just mentioned those because
otherwise it would be too long.
It will start with geometry with parallel axiom then into exterior angle theorem and
angle sum of a triangle conclusion and so on.
Then it moves into history of the parallel postulate.
So you see now that we have understood a little bit of the geometry it is important that we
know the history.
So it starts with very ancient history of Proclus then the concept of equidistance then John
Wallace who made contributions in analytic geometry the Clorius and Proclus theorem and
then the Farkas Voli.
So everything regarding the history of the parallel postulate is covered so that you
don't have any problem understanding where from the theorem scheme.
The discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is covered.
It is a good history and people like Gauss Riemann and Lobaczkowski is being covered.
So parallel line similar triangles it is an excellent read.
Then the seventh chapter speaks of the independence of parallel postulates.
So you see the Poincare model the inversions in circles models Beltram is interpretation
and everything.
This is very important it books contains philosophical implications fruitful and applications.
So here you see what are the philosophical implications what is the geometry of physical
space very important what is mathematics all about the controversies about foundations
of mathematics and the fruitfulness of hyperboleic geometry for other branches of mathematics
cosmology and art.
So you see why it is important because once we go on through the seven chapters now we
are going deep into the philosophical implications and fruitful applications.
Finally it goes into geometric transformations which would include motions and similarities
client learning or Erlanger program and this is the entire list of geometric transformation.
So now let us take a pause and you understand how well this book is organized.
It starts right at the beginning with the history then it goes into mathematics then
it teaches you logic then again it goes back to the history of parallel postulate then
it goes back to the mathematics and then it goes back to the philosophy and then finally
geometric transformations.
The 10th chapter deals with further results in hyperboleic geometry.
So these are the hyperboleic trigonometry sachery Lambert quadrilaterals boilize construction
and all those things.
Finally it contains an appendix to appendix elliptic and other Riemannian geometries Hilbert's
geometry without real numbers.
So what we can summarize from this is that we need to first understand the reason for
learning then how the development of thoughts took place who why those theorem and proves
are developed what is learning through history which is makes it more interesting and the
actual reason then comes in front.
So this is kind of a quick summary and this is the first book before going anything into
other three things like Gauss theorem and Gauss Bonnet theorem etc.
This is the first book I know it is contains a lot of pages it is a long read but you will
see how the entire journey of differential geometry is evolving in front of you.
You can go and you can live through those philosophers mathematicians starting from
Greek and coming up to Bolli and other new geometries.
So that is interesting that gives you the motivation and you find and fall in love with
differential geometry.
