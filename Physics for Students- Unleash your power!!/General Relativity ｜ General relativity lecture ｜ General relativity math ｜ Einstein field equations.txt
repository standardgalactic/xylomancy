In this video we are going to look into the mathematics of general relativity, we are
going to build up the basics of the foundation of the mathematics step by step one by one
so that we can understand all the components, the detailed structures, the space-stand curvature,
tensors, everything related to general relativity.
I am keeping this video to be as simple as possible and I will make the formulations
of mathematics pretty simple using analogies which are very easy to understand so that
we can get to the basic root and understand the concepts of relativity using the mathematics
involved in it.
My name is Shaughnak and you are watching this video on my channel physics for students
seasons ratings and a warm welcome to watch this video.
So before we go ahead and start watching these details of the video let us look into what
are the topics that we are covering.
So yes we are covering Euclidean geometry then we will move to Euclidean metric covering
Newton's law, what is gravitational, gravitational field, how gravitational field and Christoffer's
symbols are related to each other then understanding a very important concept which is called a
connection, what is the geometric meaning of Christoffer's symbols and Christoffer's
symbols, how are they written in terms of the metric and finally they will summarize
what we have learned.
So first we start with the Greek philosopher and geometer Euclid, Euclid was an ancient
Greek mathematician active as a geometer and logician considered to be the father of geometry
he is chiefly known for the elements treatise which established the foundation of geometry
that largely dominated the field until early 19th century.
So here are a few of the key results of Euclidean geometry, the internal angles of a triangle
add up to 180 degrees, two straight lines that are initially parallel can be extended
which is known as Euclid's fifth postulate or the parallel postulate area of the circle
is given by pi r squared and the Pythagoras theorem which is the length of the hypotenuse
hypotenuse squared equal to b square plus perpendicular square.
This is something elementary which we learned in the schools but as you understand mathematics
is always built by adding one concept on the other so it is good to look into that.
So we move on to the next part where we can define a space where Euclidean geometry works
which is known as Euclidean space, now it can be two dimensional or example this tabletop
or it can be a three dimensional or example a cube.
Now working on the approximation to the ordinary space that we look at.
So this may be a statement of the obvious but we will see that Euclidean space is just
not one of many possible spaces curved surfaces for examples are not Euclidean on the surface
of a sphere for example lines of longitude start of parallel onto a equator but meet at
the poles.
Now in relativity we deal with two types of four dimensional Euclidean space the first
is the flat spacetime or special relativity where Euclid's parallel postulate holds and
the curved spacetime of general relativity.
So returning to Euclidean space Pythagoras theorem can also be used in three dimensional
dimensions to calculate the corner of the opposite length of a rectangular cuboid.
So what we do is that we will use this cuboid ABC and we just define this length as one,
one and two and just keep it simple just to give you the basic idea so that you can understand.
So here we take the two square plus one square plus the height, width and breadth and from
there we calculate square root of six which eventually results into 2.45.
Okay so now why I showed you this because if we take the same cuboid from here and we
try to use this same thing so we get L square equal to A square plus B square plus C square
so what happens is that using the condition coordinates in three dimension which is as
written the distance or the distance between two points x, y, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 can be
given as this right or what I can do is that alternatively in terms of the interval I can
write is as delta L square equal to delta x square plus delta y square but delta z square.
Now why I am showing you this delta you will soon understand because this is the first
notion we are trying to use the Euclidean geometry in three dimensional space and this
is known as to be the space has to be Euclidean I mean to say in order to make it true and
this applies for any interval when it is working for Euclidean space right and this is what
we arrived to the first fundamental important mathematical concept which is called the metric.
So I mean to say the metric is basically a function defines distance between two points
however this interval actually applies when it is working remember in Euclidean space.
Okay so we now move to the second part of our video where we will be working a little bit on
the Euclidean metric which is equally important for us to learn. Now as I told you the metric is a
function that defines the distance between two points in a particular space once we know the
metric of a space obviously theoretically at least we can know everything about the geometry of
the space what is a metric or you know it's fundamental important. So because of the nature
of the Euclidean space the distance function is constant it doesn't matter where it changes.
So this one if you say that this is constant due to the nature of the space that means that we
can plug in any values of x1, x2 minus x1, y2 minus 1 and so on and end up with the correct
answer right and the distance between points x1, x2, y2 and z2. So now this is something which
is not same for other species right this is not same for other species but the distance function
is I mean to say is not constant so to get over this problem we now introduce a kind of a new
notion which is this one dLx, dLy, dLx, dx and dy and what we call these dLx, dLdxy, dYz all those
I mean say for four dimension etc. This would be what it's called coordinate differentiations
although we discard dL it is dx, dy and zeta so these are called coordinate
differentiations and when we used to describe the distance between two infinitesimal close points
in space we call this distance as line element I mean to say this is between when it is two
infinitesimal close point it is called line element so the Euclidean line element in Cartesian
coordinates this is the so this is represented as this one and let me let me go back to that yeah
so this is the Euclidean line element which is represented in Cartesian coordinates where
we are taking dL equals so that is the length equals to dx square plus dy square plus dz square
which is exactly the same as l square is equal to x2 minus x1 and so on which is the same in the
Cartesian coordinates but in case of a curved space we need to understand something in a differential
way so we are using those okay so now let us see that if this dL is equal to dx square for dy
square so what happens is that you see this one into dx square term and one to dy square term
and one to dz squares come these are actually the matrix coefficients right so we can arrange them
so these are one this one this one these are basically coefficients so dx multiplied by
this one equals to one and so on right so that is how it is so we can on all other products
remains the same so we can arrange them and it looks like a nice kind of a matrix like this right
so this matrix actually tells us how to multiply the differentials dx dy dz and we can see this
in this kind of a matrix right now seeing that dx into dx times dx equals to one and dy times
dy equals to one and dz times dz equals one all other products of dx dy and dz dz equals to zero
so the indices if you identify i j and g by reference of rows and columns
so this is the one which comes when we write now note that here is a bracket
which means that we are referring specifically to the entire matrix and not to individual
components so this is just a convention right so here it goes g one equals to one one g two two
equals to one and g one three equals to zero and so on okay so this is something important when we
are representing this into Euclidean matrix we multiply this coefficients with one in order to
make it in a nice three by three matrix where all other products goes to zero and this bracket denotes
that we are specifically denoting the entire matrix but not to individual component okay
so now we see that this matrix actually helps us to form the metric tensor of general theory of
relativity and this is something which is called a symmetric tensor so g mu nu equals to g nu mu
and yeah so the metric tensor in relativity is symmetric tensor and bilinear in form this mu
nu actually denotes four dimensions of space time and you will also see there are certain duplicate
terms so zero one equals to one zero and so on so this actually reduces from 16 components to 10
components i have shown this pretty clearly in one of my earliest videos on general relativity
called richie tensor richie scalar and metric tensor which is there in the playlist of my general
relativity video if you want you can look into it so this is just a kind of a quick note that how
the 16 components of the metric tensor reduces to 10 components because of the duplicacy and how this
g zero zero etc comes we have just seen these are the coefficients once they are multiplied
it from and forms a line element it can be arranged a matrix right so till now we have
understood what is the metric how it starts with the Euclidean geometry but now we turn to the real
physics and we wait for somewhere someone whose birthday is nearing very soon that is Sir Isaac
Newton and physics as we know is not complete by Newton's law of motion so just a quick glimpse I
mean to say let us not go into that this is again you might say it's the repetition so and the first
law tells that an object would remain at rest until acted upon by external force this is a quick
kind of a you know visual treat that this person is kicking the ball unless acted upon by extra force
so it would strain and we know that inertia is the property of a body to resist and that is called
the law of inertia and the mass of a body is a measure of its inertia and is called the
initial mass so we straight away move to the most important that is the second law of Newton
which states that if a net force acts on an object it will cause an acceleration of that object and
the relationship between an object's mass m and its acceleration a is given by this famous formula
f equals to ma note that f and a I have written it in bold because I want to make sure that it
is a vector notation and it also can be written in scalar notation right so the first vector form
of this law is also states that the force equals the rate of change of momentum which I have shown
p equals to m of m of v where momentum equals the mass of the object times its velocity now another
way of stating the same law is this one like p equals to differential of p and t where I take
this one further right so we can as you can understand pretty pretty simple I mean to say
nothing more to you know tell and from here we get the SI unit of Newton which is the force required
to get given mass and this is one Newton that is a force required given this is one Newton
to move one kg of an acceleration of one meter second square right so what we get from here
we now move on to the second part where we take about from Newton's law of motion we move into
what is called the gravitation right so we again stick to the laws of Newton that every particle
attracts the other particle in a force that is proportional to the product of the mass we all
know every point at a mass attracts every other point of mass by a force acting along the line
intersecting two points and we know that can be expressed in this kind of a formula so we know
all what it is this g is basically the Newton's constants the gravitation constant which is written
over there and it also can be written as this because right so here what happens is this this
is the scalar form and yeah so this r hat is basically a unit vector in the radial distance
remember it's a radial distance it's pointing out from the center of the gravity right from m1 to m2
and the minus sign actually indicates that gravity is a force of attraction not repulsion
although law refers to point masses it can be shown that spherically symmetric objects behave
gravitationally as if all their mass is concentrated on a central point we're not going to look much
into that rather from gravitation we now move into what is called gravitational acceleration
right so we move ahead with the second law the magnitude and direction which is given so if an
object is freely falling in a gravitational v Newton's second law tells us that the object's mass
must be to be a subject of force and this is for f equals to ma now the magnitude and direction of
the force of a freely falling object is also given by Newton's law of gravitation right which is this
one and we know that experiment shows that the inertial mass capital M equals to the gravitational
mass small m so from here what we can do is that we can write this part of the equation and then we
finally write okay yeah so the acceleration of a body due to gravity does not depends upon its mass
the famous feather and iron experiment so from here we write this right so this is the mass of
the gravitating body for example earth and the minus sign indicate the acceleration decreases
as r increases here it is so we have till now shown the fundamental result that the acceleration of
a body due to gravity does not depend on the mass I was just telling you that the feather falls
as fast as bricks and so on so we know this experience right so inertial mass m equals to
the gravitational mass m small so we take the gravitational mass forward acceleration forward
and this is something which is a vector description of the gravitational acceleration and this is
something which is a scalar description which is just a kind of a notation to make things clear
so okay so when we are talking of gravitation and acceleration why don't we go into something
which is called a gravitational field now gravitational field as itself it is basically
a concept so it is a model or a concept you can say it is used to explain the influences that a
massive body extends onto the space around itself producing a force or another massive body so
this is the gravitational field basically kind of a concept or a model that we physicists use
in order to describe things so the gravitational field which we can call as g of r at any point
small r is a space defined by the gravitational force felt by a unique mass at a plot place at a
point r so this is a kind of a gravitating body for example you can consider this to be earth
I've just given at m so and what we can do is that this is a remember it is a vector field
right because the gravitational force is moving the unit mass in a radial direction so this is
the radial direction and it is found by taking the vector equation of Newton's law of gravitation
which is this one and now what we can do uh f equals to minus g same what we can now do is that
we can just substitute one okay just a unique mass for one of the two masses like putting
unique mass and what do we get is this right so here also capital M is the mass of the
gravitational body for example earth so what happens is that this is the mass of the gravitating
body right and we can plot to show the gravitational field under the uniform this kind of a uniform
sphere now we know about divergence right I'm not going back so I have got a complete
video on divergence in the playlist of Maxwell's equations so we know I mean to say I'm not
not going to explain those partials right so we made the idea of divergence we know this it's a
vector field so it can be shown that the divergence of the gravitational field at any point is this
one nabla dot g equals to minus 4 pi g rho right where this rho actually denotes the mass density
this is a Greek letter there's the mass density at that particular point and evidently what happens
is that if the mass density for example we are in a space where there is no mass mass density
is zero so rho becomes zero and the divergence also becomes zero right so this is to show you
the basic concept of gravitational field why we are going one by one two steps because this would
be required in further approaches in general activity which we will look now this nabla dot g
minus 4 pi g rho is something which our old prince of mathematics has done which is called
Gauss's law for gravity now Gauss's law of gravity is actually also known as Gauss's
flux theorem of gravity and it is a law of physics that is almost equivalent to Newton's law of
gravitation so it is it says it is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss it states that the flux
or the surface integral of the gravitational field over any surface is equal to the mass in close
so Gauss's law for gravity is more convenient sometimes to work in and Newton's so this is
what you know the law is just a quick note that the form of Gauss's law for gravity is similar
to that of Gauss's law of electrostatics in the Maxwell's equations so Gauss's law gravity has the
same mathematical relation to Newton that Gauss's law for electrostatics beers with the Coulomb's law
so I mean to say just I wanted to make things clear so we take an a quick note on understanding
these component by component so this one is the any closed surface this is the differential area
this g is the gravitational field this 4 pi is the area of sphere now we are not going to take a
derivation why it is 4 pi because it's 4 pi r square some of this got cancelled 4 pi a g is the
gravitational constant and m is the total mass so we come to this one same so this is the divergence
this is the gravitational constant and this is the mass density at each point so Gauss's law for
gravity actually states in a closed mass in a you know surface integral over a closed surface so it
is good point to quickly recollect Gauss's law of gravity also I'm going to say this is this is
equally important right so this is the differential form of Gauss's law the earlier the left hand
side is the integral form of Gauss's law but taking from here ahead what we need to also understand
that is the core of the today's video that is gravitational potential and how it is related
to Christoffel symbols so a name after Elvind Bruno Christoffel so we will now look a little
bit deep into what is the gravitational potential now the gravitational potential as we know is
denoted by this Greek letter phi right this is the gravitational potential so it is actually
is defined as the work done in bringing a unit mass to that point that particular point right
from an infinite place infinity so what we can say in other words that phi is the gravitational
potential energy of unit mass now when we talk about gravitational potential energy the equation
that immediately comes in our mind is this one right so potential energy is this we already
know that from our school day physics again letting one of the masses equal to one kilogram
for example we put this we can define the gravitational potential field which is a scalar
field as this one right phi equals to this should be not minus i'm sorry it should be minus gm by r
and if we take a kind of a point at a distance r from the point mass yeah so for a for a point at
a distance r from the point on the center and outside the uniform sphere of mass m
so if the sphere has the radius capital r right this one would be true right this one would be true
so for instance inside a uniform spherical mass if I take this one right the inside you can see this
one right this one so for inside a uniform spherical mass that is for small r this one if I take
the small this this holds for r which is greater than r but in case that we take a uniform mass
where small r is less than bigger right so this is actually what a little bit you know
it comes up to derivation so phi equals to minus gm to r cube thanks that I have written this time
correct so right and now what we can do is that yeah so this is r3 r square minus r square yeah
so this holds actually when small r is less than bigger and this holds phi equals to it should
be minus gm by r anyway so if r is bigger than greater than equals to r like so at a point
to m at a distance r from the center and outside a uniform sphere of mass this happens and inside
for a point uniform mass where it is inside this happens right okay so we now take a step back and
we want to go back to that cuboid concept now why because we want to understand something which is
called the magnitude of a position vector so if we take you know these lines right and what we get
from here is that position vector or radial vector r from the origin o so we get this one right we
already know this so we know that r equals to this one x square root of the radical of x square
plus y square so in Cartesian coordinates we can now you know rewrite the gravitational potential
which was this one phi equals to minus gm by r thankfully I have corrected this here right so
equals to minus gm so this is the Cartesian coordinate I just wanted to take these example
of skewbox cuboid so that we understand that how the square root of the denominator comes
now also note that we use this nabla operator this differential operator and this is basically
used for three reasons it calculates the divergence gradient and curl now if we use this nabla which
is of a scalar field phi then what we get is this one right so what we get is this one I think this
this this part is quite clear so we take this value okay this one yeah this is the gradient
obviously so what we do is that in ordinary Euclidean space for a point a scalar phi the gradient
is the vector points so we take this one this is the partial difference and then we get this one
right then we use the differential operator and we get this value calculating further we get this
value now I'm not explaining it right now because this requires a kind of a differential operator
calculator which you can just check on the equations so we further go and we get this
and now what we do is that we get ultimately the answer is this as because this small r equals to
the modulus of this what we can do is that we can write yeah this one I mean to say this equal as this
right and now by definition r equals to x y z equals to this this is by definition yeah given r
so it denotes an ordinary Cartesian vector right and so the basis vectors are implied
and we know that we don't bother to show them so some now we can rewrite this one it gets cancelled
off this one r cube and all this get cancelled off and we finally arrive into this and this is how it
is treated right so now we what we do is that we find this one so this part is actually this part
right so this is okay let me explain you again so now we have found an equation that relates the
gravitational potential field with that of the gravitational field because this the right hand
side of it is equals to this which we have dealt earlier so this is the phi the gravitational
potential field which is a scalar field and this is the gravitational field which is a vector field
and somehow there's a relation between these two fields and finally what we do is that it's a
gravitational field so if g equals to we replace it by nabla phi and we get this
right so you can check on to this part I mean to say this is pretty simple I just
trying to get in a kind of relation between the potential gravitational potential field which
is a scalar with a vector and we use those differential operators in order to get this
so till now what we have learned is that the gravity the gravitational potential
and also we looked into how you know the gravitational potential field can be used
in order to make a construct of a sphere where the solid sphere is inside and outside so I hope
but this is okay now the problem is that when we're dealing with general theory of relativity
gravitational potential etc what the geometry changes with curve space time and with curve
space time we need a different tool in order to establish a kind of a connection so that is what
the Christoffel symbols does so in general again you will get a wrong notion that Christoffel
symbols denotes gravity or gravitation potential it does in a different way so Christoffel symbols
represent the connection coefficients of the levy-chivita connection don't worry in coming to
that and they describe a change in the basis vectors through a given coordinate and it represents
the fictitious forces induced by a non-inertial frame of reference initial frame a non-inertial
frame which is moving so what we are trying to make a point over here is that when the basis
of the vectors we will soon see examples changes then we need a kind of a connection
and the Christoffel symbols actually does that but before that we'll very quickly take a look
in what is called an affine connection so the notion of affine connection has its root in the
19th century geometry I mean to say tensile calculus it was developed later in the 1920s
by Ellie Carter right and Herman Weil so the many invariance of an affine connection are its torsion
and curvature this is a photo you know illustration of torsion so you can see these are the tangent
vector fields which connects and it can be differentiated okay so I will go step by step
what I'm trying to make a point is that see in Riemannian or any pseudo Riemannian geometry we
deal with manifolds right this manifold each of these manifolds are characterized by what is called
an affine connection they do have an affine connection right now the manifolds also is
characterized by what is called a metric tensor which measures the causal structure of space time
and many other things we know what is a metric tensor now these type of manifolds who have a
metric tensor they are actually called Riemannian manifolds right those who have a metric tensor
now these Riemannian manifolds also have what is called an affine connection and these affine
connections are called Levy-Chivita connection right is named by Tulio Levy I don't remember the
name of Chivita right now but Tulio Levy-Chivita Levy-Chivita connection so the Levy-Chivita
connection I can tell it is a very special case of an affine connection obviously it is the affine
connection for a manifold with a metric right so it is basically an affine connection of a
manifold with a metric now what happens typically is that we need this affine connection or I would
say that affine connection is already there because it connects the nearby tangent basis
so that we can differentiate and do a better connection and Levy-Chivita connection is basically
a special affine connection which we will see soon how it behaves
okay so now we take a quick look what I was telling that we need a special tool what is that that is
called a connection now what happens is that in in the case of transporting local geometric objects
from a place to others etc tangent vectors and tensor so we need a long family of curves in a
parallel and consistent manner so a choice of an affine connection is also equal to the notion
of what is called a parallel transport which is a method of transporting tangent vectors along curves
now I will just use the analogy which I have used earlier in my videos also that how will you
understand which one is bigger I mean to say simple concept of found rates so we put one another
arrow on the other and if it overlaps then it is bigger this is obviously the smaller one right
now what do we do it is a way of comparing vectors at different positions of manifold I mean to say
the connection actually does what the parallel transport helps it's the way of transporting
detail of smooth surfaces so let me quickly you know explain with that so here is a triangle and
I've got a point this one red I'm trying to move I'm trying to keep it as safe as possible I do that
I do that and then this you see that red arrow pointing towards right overlaps that that means
in flat space when we have parallel transport of a vector it comes back to the original point
so we have no problem with that but you know generativity has got complexities and it has
got curvature so we take this kind of a sphere and we stand over here this is the red point
and we're trying to go to the blue and we're carrying a kind of a spare or an arrow which we
try to keep as straight as possible the original arrow is marked in yellow so I move over from
here it is called V and I'm trying to keep it but you still see that the arrows are bending
and this is due because due to the curvature now from this point we try to go from the equator
we are trying to keep it as clear as possible so yeah yeah the direction of the vector is due to
the curvature and then from here we try to move back to a regular place right so we are keeping
this as straight as possible here also but this one when we come back is a v prime which is totally
different in the direction where we started that's the yellow vector so when we take out this yellow
vector and this we find there's a difference v and v prime so parallel transport which is
trying to move around the sphere we try to make the sphere as constant as possible but it is not
so parallel transport cannot keep vectors and all that we need something which is called a
covariant derivative don't worry about the term I will soon explain you and covariant derivative
is a tool which helps us to find parallel transported vector fields or who will find the
parallel transported vector phase the covariant derivative and in connection with another value
so connections are basically local geometric objects they allow a comparison between local
geometry at one point and local geometry at another this has got two types of connection one
which measures infinite symbols and another which measures local theory and these are the different
type of connections however we are just dealing with the levy-chivita connection so just to tell you
that what actually you know the connections are okay so we know this is a kind of a covariant
derivative and this is being replaced by the nabla operator which is covariant derivative
actually what happens is that levy-chivita connection refers to the covariant derivative
what do we mean by covariant derivative I'm not clearly telling you but it's a kind of a derivative
right so in a nice intuitive way to think about this you know connection coefficients is to think
them that they are corrections of an ordinary derivative right so because the ordinary derivatives
cannot work here because the basis of the vector changes how it changes I will demonstrate to you
soon and levy-chivita connection comes to save this and do the necessary corrections to an ordinary
derivative so let me explain you the components of this levy-chivita connection so first we go with
this right this one is basically the levy-chivita connection which connects nearby tangent spaces
define a corrected notion of the derivative in arbitrary coordinates or arbitrary variables
that means there is something wrong that means ordinary derivatives are not being happening
we are using covariant derivative and in order to do that there is a tool which is the connection
this is the levy-chivita connection right so we've looked at the second component which is pretty
easy this is basically the ordinary derivative which basically is defined of a tangent space
for example in Cartesian coordinates and this is actually this gamma term is actually a correction
term remember it is a correction term called the connection coefficient or Christophe symbol
and this is correct the ordinary derivative for an arbitrary or manifold or coordinate system
so here note that the indices really doesn't make any sense this was because the covariant
derivative is an operator that needs to act on something so the indices really doesn't make any
sense so all in all this is a connection you understood what is a connection
meteor it is distributed local theory on infinitesimal it is a kind of a connection
which helps us to you know correct the ordinary derivative which is not possible on a curved
manifold okay so these are all mathematical calculations but as always I prefer in the video
to show a geometric meaning of Christophe symbol so that it becomes clear how it looks like so
geometrically Christophe symbols can be interpreted as describing how basis vectors changes through
our coordinate system right so the basis vectors may change even due to the coordinate system being
curvilinear or due to the geometry of the space as it is being curved so here I have written the
Christophe symbols essentially defined as the derivatives of basis vectors okay so here is the
you know kind of a vector and what I'm going to do is that I'm going to explain it so this is how
much the basis vector emu changes when it moves along the x new axis so you can coordinate this
is actually what is called the dot product however I have got a separate video which deals with the
deep details of what is a dot product and cross product so intuitively understand this dot product
describes how much it is derivative and the basis actually overlaps so it overlaps and it
is absolutely overlap that means that they are the same and so on
okay so I would like to explain you intuitively geometrically what is the basis vector it changes
and what all those problems are all about so in a flat space we get a vector called a and
this is being measured by the component a y and a x and I if I draw the lines it are more or less
the same and if I take a kind of a curved surface and I plot the same I get a curved surface let's
look yeah something like this so x y goes into x prime and y prime and I'm trying to make this
vector the same but when I'm trying to make the measure of this vector to this component so you
see the x component is something here and the y component goes something here so what happens
is that when I join those I see a prime x is longer than a x we see that a prime y is also
longer than a y and but the a remains invariant right so a remains invariant in the sense that
it doesn't change so this is the problem that the basis of the vectors are changing in curved space
so now let us say that we have some curved coordinate system this is one x1 this would
be t or x2 anything that you like and this is the basis vectors like okay so these are just
you know labeled as e1 e t and e x so what happens is that if you if you really calculate
the dot product which we used to do in UV in a typical Cartesian coordinates the basis vector
changes in the time direction and we cannot do this e dot equal to the components we cannot do
because you see here in curved space style things are changing so we take this one and we plot this
one as x1 and x2 this is a curved space right curved coordinate system with x1 x2 but the basis
vectors which are these which are e1 and e2 now just try to imagine this is very important imagine
that you move along the x1 axis and see how the basis of vector e2 changes along the x1 axis right
so a small change in a vector along the coordinate axis is simply the partial derivative with respect
to the particular coordinate obviously you have to do a partial derivative because it's changing on
a curved manifold so this derivative vector this one we take the red one can also yeah
it can also components along the x1 and x2 axis obviously so this is done by taking the dot product
of the red vector which way I will show you this is a derivative vector right and the
Christopher symbols are basically telling how the basis vectors are changing how they're actually
changing okay so we see this one which if I differentiate takes this for equation this one
and this one so all in all if you don't want to go into the mathematical cases of calculating
those derivatives then understand that Christopher symbols geometrically represent different components
of the derivative of basic vectors remember this is the different components of the derivative of
basic vectors because the basis vector changes with the curved spacetime so if you you were to
take the derivative of a basic vector this would give another vector right so the Christopher symbols
then represent the different components of this of this new vector all these things changes now
from this Christopher symbol how the vcs vectors changes and all those you will see that there is
underlying force which is also working so these are in bold remember these are corrections to an
ordinary derivative okay now if these Christopher symbols which are corrections in terms of derivative
if they're written in the metric form then how it would be let us have a quick look on that so
we know that g mu nu is a metric tensor to define the geometry concept or on arbitrary coordinate
system so we get a kind of a I would say equation like this we get a kind of a equation like this
and don't worry I will just explain to you so you see these derivatives these are partial derivatives
of the metric with respect to the different you know spacetime coordinates this is the basically
the metric when I'm writing the levy chi beta in terms of this metric this is actually happens right
and this one is the index is a summation in it is a summation you know from 0 to 3 for the
mention please so what I'm trying to tell make a point over here is that the metric tensor to put
simply is used to define different geometric concepts in arbitrary coordinate system the metric is
as you know is denoted by g mu nu so the crystals now the Christopher symbols in the term metric it
is that's how it is explained okay so what we draw a conclusion from here is that gravity is obviously
a fictitious force in generativity Christopher symbols because they are denoting a change in
basic vectors anything the changes it moves so the change of basic vectors obviously will give rise
to fictitious force if I've gone to my earlier videos on geodesics and Richie scalar you will
find that how the basis of vectors changes and the geodesics are causing a curvature which is called
gravity in relativity right so the change in basic vector usually gives rise to a fictitious force
the Christopher symbols actually describe what are those fictitious forces and it plays the
role of describing how objects actually move or get accelerated because it is actually showing
the change right and Christopher symbols are gravitational fields in generativity because
it is subject to change so the gravitational potential of Isaac Newton is being replaced by this one
that is g mu nu the metric tensor and the gravitational force field is being replaced by this
Christopher symbol now in order to understand what it is I will like to give you a quick
and a very simple comparison without examples as you understand physics is not complete
so in Newtonian gravity the gravitational field that is the gravitational acceleration
at each point in the field is represented as a vector field right so this g which you can see
is defined as the negative gradient of the gravitational potential that is why it's a minus
sign so all these are partial derivatives of the gravitational potential remember that these are
all partial derivatives of the gravitational potential now if I write this one right you will
see these are the partial derivatives of the metric it's a big difference right so the Newtonian
gravitational potential partial derivatives are the gravitational potential but in generativity
partial derivatives are that of the metric and that is why gravitational potential is replaced by the
metric tensor so I hope yeah you can understand what I'm trying to make it trying to make a point
that how this shift really happens and this the partial derivatives in both the cases these are
partial derivatives in this case Newtonian case it's gravitational potential and this is the metric
okay now there is something which is called a weak field approximation it is just a hypothetical
case when gravity is less and complications are less and things are moving slow you will see that
Christopher symbols are reduced which looks almost like Newtonian gravitational key so this is the
geodesic equation of weak field in generativity and you see this one this is the equation of ocean
in Newtonian gravity doesn't it look the same in weak field limit and this is the Christoffel symbol
which looks at this limit so finally we come that Christoffel symbols represent gravitational
acceleration in general relativity why because it denotes the change of the basis of vectors
with that change it causes the gravitational acceleration okay so just finally I just wanted
to show you that the geodesic equation is basically the second law of Newton and the Einstein field
equation is basically the Poisson's Poisson's equation right so now when we are talking of
Poisson's equation we need to look how Poisson's equation actually reflects Einstein's field equation
and that is basically what is coming up in the next part of our video we are going to look into
Poisson's equation when Cauchy metric pseudo Riemannian manifold geodesics parallel transport
Riemann curvature tensor Rieschi tensor Rieschi scalars space time geodesics energy momentum
tensor and finally the Schwarz-Gill metric so yeah the mathematics of generativity will be intense
it will be long so I thought to divide it into different parts so I haven't gone into the real
you know summing up or the summary of this video because it is all mathematical and you know these
concepts really require a summary which you can use to do so this is all I mean to say we started
with you that we moved into gravitational potential and then from gravitational potential we showed
that how this is related to Christoffel symbols further in from Christoffel symbols how the
connection actually is what are the different connections and so on so I will put a pause
