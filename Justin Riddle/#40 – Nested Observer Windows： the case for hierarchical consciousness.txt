Welcome back to the show that tells you you are a quantum
computer with free will supervising a vast hierarchy of
cognitive systems. My name is Justin Riddle. And this is
episode 40 of the quantum consciousness series. In today's
episode, I'll be giving you an update of the nested observer
windows model and recapping a lecture I gave at the science
of consciousness conference in April of 2024. By the end of
today's episode, we'll ask the question, what is it like to be
at the apex of a hierarchical consciousness? This episode is
available on YouTube and an audio only version is available on
Spotify and Apple podcast. If you like what you hear today,

So today, I'm going to be basically recapping and giving
you the same lecture that I gave at the science of consciousness
conference in April of 2024. But I'll be giving it a little bit
of of an expanded version. You can find the original
recording on on the internet, I'll provide a link that you can
go look, you know, at the original version if if you so
desire. But essentially, this is a update to a previous episode
on this channel that I gave. However, the manuscript is now
published in the neuroscience of consciousness journal. I will
also give a link to that paper. It is open access so free to
download and read for yourself. And this is work that I've done
with Jonathan Schueler. He's a professor at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. So all of this work is
collaborative with him. So without further ado, let's hop
right into it. So the title of the paper is hierarchical
consciousness, the nested observer windows model, or the
now model for short. So to introduce this idea of hierarchical
consciousness, because it is not, you know, usually a typical
way that people imagine that the the brain or the mind is
organized. So I'll give you a quick example here. So when
driving, you start to mind wander, pondering the nature of
consciousness. Without warning, you suddenly realize you were
almost at your destination. You wonder where the time went. Now
your attention is focused on navigating the which freeway exit
to get off. And on what side street to turn. You are acutely
aware of the lack of awareness paid to driving. But you do not
notice that the wandering mind kept wandering while you were
focused on navigating the side streets. When parking your car,
you revisit the wandering mind. There is a fresh batch of
theories and models that seem to have materialized. You
diligently proceed to review those new ideas, as you absent
mindedly walk up the driveway. So this example is meant to
sort of showcase a couple different ways in which we are
not fully aware of all of the cognitive processes that are
ongoing within our own mind. And it appears that there are many
cognitive systems coexisting simultaneously in your mind. And
you usually can only pay attention to one or a subset of
these different cognitive systems. So a very common example is
driving. A lot of the times we're flying down the freeway at
70 miles per hour. And we're barely paying attention to what
we're doing. But this is kind of alarming, right? I mean, you
could almost die at any moment if you lost control of your
vehicle. And yet we consume our mind with fanciful ideas and
and fun thought processes as we are driving. And it's very
second nature to just kind of let your body take over the act
of driving. And then at certain moments, you need to interrupt
your, you know, mind wandering and pay attention to driving, you
know, once again, and there's a way that your mind can get your
attention gets you re engaged with the act of driving. And, you
know, in the absence of that call to pay attention, you can
freely wander your mind around. And in this example, we give
kind of an additional way that your mind could be operating
autonomously. And that is mind wandering itself. Could it be
that there is a part of your mind that is maybe always
wandering, always engaged in abstract thought. And when you
pay attention to driving, let's say you need to navigate some
side streets as you're going to your friend's house, you really
need to pay attention to everything that you're doing.
And then you revisit the wandering mind. And could it be
that the wandering mind kept going when you were paying
attention to driving? This is something that we much less
often kind of attribute to what can be performed autonomously in
our brains in our minds. However, why not? And I think if you
were to introspect on your conscious experience, you'd
probably be able to recognize many instances where there
appears to be fully formed ideas that are, you know, springing
into your mind, springing into your attention. And you say, Hey,
that was a great idea. I just had. But where did that idea really
come from? Were you aware of the creation of that idea kind of
from the ground up? Okay, so hierarchical consciousness is a
very novel way of really thinking about you and your mind. So
you are at the top, you are the apex of a hierarchical system.
This means that there are systems nested within you. And within
those systems, there are further subsystems nested within
those. So what are some of the implications of hierarchical
consciousness? And what is it like to be at the apex of a
hierarchically consciousness system? So we often kind of
naively conceptualize the mind as a monologue. There's a
narrative stream, the story I'm telling myself as I go through
my day. And while there's a lot of validity to the idea of a
narrative monologue, there's also a lot of moments where our
mind is more like a dialogue, right? When you're in your
thoughts, and you're simulating these different ideas, you can
go for minutes and minutes and minutes at a time, debating
different positions, different ideas. And a lot of times we
talk to ourselves, you are talking through some idea,
hearing your own counterpoints to that idea. And it's as if
there is a dialogue of multiple competing interests within us.
It says if we have many different personalities, drives,
views, ways of conceptualizing the world around us, and they're
not necessarily compatible. And we're faced with a lot of
conflict, inner conflict as we navigate new situations. What
should we do here? What should we do there? Do we view this as
you know, viewpoint A or viewpoint B? And there's a
rich dialogue occurring internally. Another implication is
that we often kind of have this idea that we're creating our
thoughts. I thought this thought, this is my thought, we
claim ownership over our thinking. You are building and
constructing ideas. And once you have an idea, you proudly, you
know, tell the world, ah, look at my idea, I've created this
wonderful new product of my mind. And this is my product.
However, there are many examples, if we're kind of honest
with ourselves, where we just have an idea, and it seems to
spring out of nowhere. There's no experience of creating the
idea. It's like an epiphany moment, an idea is thrown into
your mind. Could this be some sort of nested substructure,
some cognitive system within you, that created and constructed
and did a lot of the hard work, and then just presented you
with an idea at the apex level. You still claim ownership over
that idea. However, you weren't really a part of the creation
process per se. Even more extreme, there are intrusive
thoughts. Sometimes we have a thought and we say, oh, I did
not think that thought that was not me, my brain just generated
this thought and I am not responsible for that thought
whatsoever. This idea, this thought just occurred. But that,
you know, that's not me. I delete that I will willingly
suppress and remove that thought from my mind. And I also
reject ownership. I am not an owner of this thought. It was
something my brain generated. So this is also a very common
place example that, you know, if you introspect, you'll have
many moments where you might not want to claim responsibility
over your own thinking. And we also have this idea that we are
in control of our bodies. You know, I choose to move around
and I'm making this hand gesture with my hands. This is me
controlling my body. However, I'm not really aware of what my
hands are actually doing. I am initiating a cartoon version of
what I want to happen. And then a very complex intricate muscle
activation pattern then arises. And so I am, you know, in
control of that to some degree. But I really don't understand
any of the details of what my body is actually doing. And so on
some level, you know, you're in control, but you're not as in
control as you might think that you are. And if you really pay
attention to what your body is doing, you will sometimes find
these sort of automated or seemingly unconscious movements
that your body is performing. And could it be that they're
nested systems within you that are potentially kind of
mediating your connection to the body? And when they act
semi autonomously from your will when you're, you know, not
paying attention, there's some evidence of cognition or some
sort of will or form in your body's movements, even if you're
not fully consciously aware of what is occurring. So at the
core of hierarchical consciousness is the idea that
yes, you are a cognitive system. Yes, you are thinking. But
within you are thinking cognitive systems. And they are
providing you with this information with these
cognitive streams. And you are supervising a bit of a
corporation of subsystems within you. And this gives a very
rich landscape to our internal experience. There are so many
cognitive structures inside of you. And they all are acting in
these very complex nuanced ways. And this sort of increases the
richness, the variety of our inner life. And it gives a way of
kind of understanding biology from a from a new lens. So now I'm
going to dive into that kind of biological motivation. Alright,
so where did this hierarchical consciousness idea come from?
On some level, it came from introspection. But in another way,
there is a really strong motivation for hierarchical
consciousness that arises from our observations in biology and in
neuroscience. Okay, so if we ask the question, where in the
brain should we study consciousness, right? There are
many different people that are neuroscientists. And yet they
use very different tools, different systems that they're
studying. And so, you know, we might make this kind of pitch
of reductionism. Every system is reducible to a subsystem. Okay,
a brain region is made out of neurons, a neuron is made out
of synapses. Synapses are made out of proteins and proteins are
made out of atoms and atoms are made out of quarks and the
forces of particle physics. And so to understand a brain
region, you shouldn't study the brain region, it's actually
just neurons, you need to go study neurons. But you know, you
can't really study neurons, because they're just too big. And
you know, they're not really real. Neurons are really just a
bunch of synapses and electrical potentials. But to
understand the electrical potentials, you got to go study
the synapses. But you know, synapses are really not real
either, they're just made out of different proteins, different
receptors. And the synapse really just emerges from the mass
action of many, many protein receptors. So forget about the
synapse, we got to go study proteins. And then proteins are
really just emerging phenomenon of all these amino acids. And
those are really constrained by these, you know, more atomic
style, chemical forces of organic chemistry. And then, you
know, it's an infinite reduction, maybe down until you hit
mathematics, or something like that. But then oh, you know,
math is just a construct of humans and human society. So
really, there's this strong reductionist bias. And I would
make the argument that this is sort of a naive thought to say
that, you know, to study something, we have to go study
the parts, because eventually, we're all just particle
physicists, and we're all going to our nearest, you know,
particle accelerator, and no one is doing neuroscience, right?
Then it's completely inappropriate to study the brain
at all, because we should all just be particle physicists,
right? So if you take reductionism to the ultimate
extreme, it gets a little ridiculous. So right now, the
status quo is that to study consciousness, you have to study
neurons. And in a weird way, this is like a an assumption that
people don't even admit that they have, right? There is a
strong bias to say the brain is neurons, and you have to study
neurons, right? But for the same reasons I just laid out with
reductionism, why study neurons? Why not study synapses and
proteins? What is it that makes the neuron special? Well, you
could say, well, the neuron has the capacity for action
potentials for these meaningful electrical potentials. It's that
electrical property, which is so meaningful. However, there are
very profound electrical properties at the level of
functional brain regions of entire brain nuclei. Why in the
world would you not be allowed to study brain nuclei? Why is
it inappropriate to study brain nuclei? And yet it is
completely appropriate to study neurons themselves, right? So
moving in either direction, you can construct some rationality
for that movement. However, all theories out there, you know, in
status quo, typical neuroscience of consciousness are these kind
of toy cartoon neurons. And so hierarchical consciousness is
really making the pitch, you know, what if all of these levels
were meaningfully contributing to conscious experience to the
information processing of the brain, you can study brain nuclei,
and you can study neurons, and you can study proteins. And more
so, what if there was some system that actually allowed for
information transfer between all these different levels, if you
could transfer information across these levels, then perhaps
there is genuine information processing happening at these
different scales. And it might be different information that is
being processed, right? As you move from these orders of
magnitude of difference, there could be unique channels of
information being processed at these different scales, and then
some sort of meaningful exchange across levels. And so I
think there's a pretty good motivation to say that this is
happening in the brain. And then the follow up question would
be, what does this mean for consciousness? What if there's a
hierarchical biological system at play? How do we shove
consciousness or how do we make sense of consciousness within
that system? Could it be that there was some sort of cognition
esch processing occurring at all these different levels? And
maybe there is even consciousness at multiple levels
within the brain. All right, so to kind of motivate a little bit
of this theory of the evidence for it, I'm going to pivot a
little bit to say, you know, what is the evidence that these
large scale brain nuclei are real? Because in a in a strange
way, or maybe it's not so strange, it might align with like
just human bias of where the status quo is at. We are much
more hesitant, as a field, to say that brain nuclei, functional
brain regions are real. Those get the label of epiphenomenal much
more often than a neuron. There are very few people walking
around saying neurons aren't real, they're just epiphenomenal.
However, there's many people walking around saying functional
brain regions aren't real, they just, you know, are kind of a
circle we draw around the brain in one way or another. But
really, we should all be studying neurons. So I'd like to give
the example of a train. So if we were to imagine the brain as an
engine as a train, what is it that pushes the brain train
forward through time? What is the engine of the system? And status
quo would say that the engine is neurons, there's a bunch of
neurons, and they have electrical potentials, the
spiking activities that are occurring, they release chemicals
from one onto another, and then they react and activate based on
this chemical signaling. However, if you put a recording
device inside of the brain, you observe these large electrical
fluctuations at the scale of entire populations of neurons.
And what we used to think as a field is that these electrical
fluctuations were just kind of the steam off of the brain
train. These are epiphenomenal. They're not real signals. Well,
they're signals in the sense that you can measure them, but
they're not really doing anything, right? It's not
contributing to the function of the brain. However, we now
realize after you know, some experimental work and after some
theoretical work, that there might be a bit of a circular
causation here where even if these electric fields at the scale
of hundreds of thousands to millions of neurons, even if
that's generated from the activity of smaller, you
know, neurons themselves, and the mass collective action of
these neurons, once the electric field has been generated,
once it exists, it then exists independently of the
individual neurons. And that electric field can then change
and constrain the activity of neurons. And there's a little
bit of a circular causation here. Neurons can cause electric
fields. These electric fields can then change neurons. And it's
not saying that one is primary, although maybe you could make
the argument that you wouldn't have the electric field without
the neurons. And that is, you know, likely true. However,
they're, you know, they both are contributing meaningful to the
processing of these systems. And there has been a lot of work
lately, really diving into what do neural oscillations do for the
brain and for cognition. And we're getting more and more
evidence that they appear to be meaningfully related to
cognition. So what I would make an argument to you, why should
we care about these electric fields about these neural
oscillations? Well, these neural oscillations are really the
closest correlate that we have to cognition. So I'll give you a
couple examples here. So one example is the theta oscillation
that you can witness in sound waves. So as I am talking to
you, if you were to record the words coming out of my mouth, you
take that sound wave recording, and you break down the
frequency domain, the frequency components of my speech, you'll
see that there's a lot of rhythmic structure to the way that
we talk to each other. And more so, if you zoom into individual
words that I'm saying, there are different sound chunks in each
of my words, and those sound chunks are coming at a very
rhythmic rate. Across all different cultures that we've
measured, people tend to speak at a very canonical rate. And
there's a prominent theta frequency oscillation, roughly
between four and eight hertz across all these different
languages that we can record from. And that rhythm is a very
prominent rhythm in the sound waves. And we can find that
rhythm from the sound waves in the electrical activity of the
brain. And if we look at auditory cortex, for example, as I'm
talking to you, your auditory cortex is rhythmically
fluctuating in sync to the words that I am saying. So this is a
really profound electrical property within the brain. And
it really closely correlates to the type of information that is
being processed in the world around us. And is it a
coincidence that we all speak at a certain rhythm? And this
rhythm is found all throughout the brain with various protein
constituents that give rise to this rhythm. There's a really
tight correspondence in frequency domain between our
behaviors and the electrical properties of our brains
themselves, which might suggest that, you know, our brains are
helping us produce language. There's some electrical
determinants, some biological brain determinants for our
speech. And then, you know, we're tuned into these rhythms in
our environment. Another example comes from the visual
cortex. So in the back of your brain, there is a electrical
rhythm called the alpha oscillation. This is occurring
roughly around 10 times per second, 10 Hertz. And if you
measure visual cortex, you'll find this big prominent electrical
wave traveling through your visual cortex. And what people
have found in one example experiment is that if you flash
a light really quickly, there's a certain rate at which if I
flash the light really quickly, you will perceive it as a
single flash versus if it's a little bit slower, you perceive
it as two separate flashes. And there's a certain time point at
which it crosses over from being two flashes into getting
fused into a single flash. And this is the flicker into fusion
rate. And this is roughly around 100 milliseconds in the average
individual. And what people have found is that the rate at which
your visual cortex is fluctuating is correlated with your
flicker fusion rate. So the time at which you shift from a
flicker into a fusion is related to the ongoing electrical
fluctuations in your visual cortex. So what this means is
there's basically a one to one correspondence between visual
awareness refreshes and the electrical activity in your
brain. If the flashes show up in different refreshes, then you
have the experience of two separate flashes. But if both
flashes end up in one electrical fluctuation in your visual
cortex, then you just have the experience of a single flash
fused together. So this is quite wild, right? I mean, this is
basically saying that your visual awareness, the perception
that you're having right now of visual information is actually
flickering and updating. And we're maybe not aware of this
update in our experience. And you know, I would argue that
maybe it's because you're a little bit slower up at the apex,
but more on that a little bit later. And this is directly
related to the cognitive processing within your system,
right? So to be reductive and say, Well, who cares about these
electric field fluctuations, we got to dive into the neurons
because the neurons are all that matters. Well, we have a very
strong tight correlation between the electric fields in this
large brain structure and your experience. So what evidence can
we make that there is a strong correspondence more so than just
correlation, right? Because just because we can measure
something and just because something is correlated doesn't
mean that it's really or causally related to the thing itself. So
electrical activity happens, cognition happens as well, these
two phenomenon or correlated to each other. And so the way that
we can test this in the laboratory, and my lab does, you
know, exactly this, we will deliver what's called noninvasive
brain stimulation, and we can do this in humans, where we can
deliver a brief magnetic pulse to the brain. And that causes a
brief electric current to arise within a part of cortex. And if
we apply these brief pulses at a certain spacing, right? Then
what we find is that we can very selectively drive these
electric field fluctuations in the brain, where the repeated
application of multiple pulses will start to build up and ramp
up an electric field fluctuation. So here I'm including a
image of you know, some data that was recently published from my
group, where we essentially show just this that if you're
delivering brief magnetic pulses to the brain, and you're
recording the electrical activity in the brain region that
you're targeting, you can see a ramp up in these electric fields.
And what's really interesting is then we can actually change and
shift cognition as a function of just the frequency that we're
targeting in the brain. And you know, in my day job, I'm a
cognitive neuroscientist, and a lot of my work is delivering
frequency specific brain stimulation in human participants
in order to alter or change their cognition. And the idea is
that this is a way of building causal evidence for these
macroscopic electric fields in the brain. It's not just
reducible to neurons, but by changing these electric fields,
we change cognition. So this is building much stronger evidence
that these electric fields are directly related to the cognitive
processing within the brain. So my work and that of others is
really trying to validate this highest level or one of the top
levels within the biological hierarchy, the level of functional
brain regions of electric field fluctuations roughly between 10
Hertz and two Hertz, this low frequency range in the brain
really is real. It's doing something for cognition. It is a
part of the engine of the brain. It is not just the steam
emanating from the brain, but it is really doing something for
cognition for our experience. And I think what is really
exciting about this work is that, you know, we have a very
slow reality, we're thinking our thoughts, we're pondering
things, our thoughts occur at the scale of multiple seconds,
we're perceiving things at the scale of sub seconds, doing
analyses like these and doing experiments like these really
build evidence that that low frequency electrical activity in
the brain is meaningfully related to cognition is meaningfully
related to the processing of the brain. And it one to one
relates to our experience of being a human being inside of
our brains. So the next question here is, is there a way to
communicate from one scale to another scale? And this is where
the concept of cross frequency coupling comes in. So cross
frequency coupling is saying that there's coupling between two
different frequencies across those frequencies. And this was
first observed in rodents with invasive recordings of the
hippocampus, which is a part of the brain involved in spatial
navigation. And what was found was that there are these big
electric field fluctuations in the hippocampus, as rats are
navigating mazes, and simultaneous to those big theta
frequency electric field fluctuations, you also have
neurons that are coding for individual locations in space. So
these are called place cells. And so you'll have, for example,
neuron a fires when you're in location a, you have neuron B
that fires when you're in location B, neuron C in location
C, neuron D in location D. And what you find is that in the
hippocampus, there is a sequential activation, neuron A,
the neuron B, the neuron C, the neuron D, as the rat is sitting
at location A and thinking about the future of their movement
through location A and to B and to C and to D. And there's a
sequential activation of these neurons firing. And the sequence
of firing is occurring within a theta rhythm. So it says if the
brain is going ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, ABCD, there's a rhythmic
activation of these place cells being activated through time. And
so this is the first observation of cross frequency
coupling between the scale of neurons and the scale of the
hippocampus. And the neurons are inside of the hippocampus. But
you can now decode a trajectory of motion, a movement of the
animal from the electric field activity on its own. And granted,
you know, all these neurons are coding for information and
building and, you know, projecting information into these
electric fields. And then the electric field is sort of an
abstract representation of all that information at the lower
level. So I think what's really interesting here is that you've
built a trajectory of motion from locations, right? This is not
a more complex location. This is a abstraction away from
location into movement. Movement is like a higher concept than a
location. And so we have the construction of a higher order
abstract concept from lower order information. And maybe cross
frequency coupling, the co occurrence of fast neuron
activity nested within low frequency electric field
activity, and the coupling, the systematic relationship between
these levels. This is evidence of some sort of mechanism, some
sort of means of information transfer between nested systems
one within the other. This example that I've shown you is
called phase amplitude coupling, where the phase of the theta
frequency basically where you are in a single cycle is related
to the amplitude, the activation of these neurons. And it says if
the low frequency signal is kind of sequencing the higher
frequency signal. And there's been a lot of work since this
original rodent work on the hippocampus finding cross
frequency coupling in memory processing, working memory,
long term memory, attention, decision making, there's many,
many examples that we've now observed of these big low
frequency, entire brain regions, entire networks of brain
regions, coupling to more microscopic scales. So the next
question is, you know, okay, we can measure these correlations,
but is it quote unquote real? Do we have causal evidence for
cross frequency coupling? We can use the same magnetic
stimulation approach that I told you about just previously.
But we can also use what's called transcranial electrical
stimulation. And this is something that my lab also uses
actively. And there's been many people, you know, using this
tool. But essentially, you can deliver electric current to the
brain that's designed to mimic these endogenous coupling
patterns that you observe in the brain. So one example that I'll
show for you right now is we can observe cross frequency
coupling between one signal and another signal, we can extract
the peak frequency of that coupling in a human participant
using EEG. And then we can derive a electrical stimulation
waveform based on our observation in EEG, and then
deliver electrical stimulation back into the brain to then
change and enhance the endogenous cross frequency
coupling, and then change people's cognition. So the example I'm
showing you here, you can go check out the papers if you're
interested. But this was a cognitive control tasks where
people had to, you know, memorize a bunch of different rules
and use context. And there was sort of a multi stage decision
making process that they had to engage with. And there were
numerous cross frequency coupling signals emerging from the
brain. There was a perception control signal and action
control signal. And we differentially targeted either the
perceptual control cross frequency coupling signal or that
motor control signal. And we could change behavior in a very
systematic way based on what frequency we were targeting,
either that motor control frequency or that perception
control frequency. Alright, so we have causal evidence for
cross frequency coupling for these interactions between
many different stages or scales in the brain. And so the
question now is what does this mean for consciousness? So in the
nested observer windows model, at the core of this model, is this
idea of a nested hierarchy. And this is directly motivated by
cross frequency coupling. And so the primary question in
hierarchical consciousness is what does it mean if we were to
take cross frequency coupling very, very seriously, right?
Cross frequency coupling is not only real, but it is a
fundamental property of what it means to be a conscious being.
So what if cross frequency coupling was very, very, very
much real? And what that would imply is that there is
information processing occurring at a slow, big scale, and
information processing happening at a faster, smaller
scale. And these systems are nested within each other. So the
metaphor we use to describe this is mosaic tiling. So in mosaic
tiling, you have an image that is made out of mosaic tiles.
These are different smaller tiles. And the collage of all
these tiles together produces an image, a mosaic image. And what
we suggest is what if there is a recursively nested mosaic
tiling, where every image is made out of images, where those
images are then mosaic tiles of even smaller images. And the
pattern repeats recursively as you zoom into an image. So what
this means is that your cognitive system, your
experience is a collage of all of these different cognitive
systems within you. And all these cognitive systems are
bubbling up into your experience. And collectively, they form
you as this collage of cognition. But if you were to dive into
any one of these cognitive threads, you would find that
that is in and of itself a collage of more microscopic
cognitive sub processes, and so on and so forth as you zoom
into smaller and smaller systems. So the nested observer
windows model is basically saying that you are an observer
window, you are a bounded space of cognition, and within you are
nested sub windows. And within those are more sub windows. And
there's a recursive process of nesting motivated by the
observations from modern cognitive neuroscience for a
role of cross frequency coupling in cognition. So the now model
in order to get to the point where we can talk about these
nested systems, we need a couple other metaphors, a couple
other mechanisms to kind of flesh out the model to be
complete. So the first metaphor is mosaic tiling. This is what
I already spelled out for you. The next metaphor is a theater.
We need a boundary around a cognitive system. And we use the
metaphor of a theater. And we call this an observer window. This
is a spatio temporally bounded system. And within it, there is
a holistic gestalt representation. There is sort of a
wholeness to what it is like to be an observer window. And
there's some boundary around the system that excludes the rest
of reality, to say that either you're in the window or you're
not. And if you're in the window, you are bound together into a
single observer, a single frame of reference. Now, because there
is this nesting structure, what this really needs also to have
is a mechanism for dialogue or communication between observer
windows that are within the same scale. So it might be that you
are at the apex, you're at the top, you're the head honcho
observer window. As you zoom in, there's a bunch of cognitive
systems coexisting. But more so those cognitive systems, they
can communicate up to you to the observer window. But they also
need to communicate laterally to each other. And this requires
a different mechanism than just communicating up to the top
observer window or down to a sub observer window, you're talking
to your peers. And this we use the metaphor of dialogue. And so
there are three mechanisms that we propose in the nested
observer windows model. The first mechanism I already talked to
you about this is cross frequency coupling. This is a means of
transferring information up and down the nested hierarchy. You
can have a emergence of information from the lower
order into the higher order. But you can also have a
submergence of information from you, or from a sub window down
into the smaller faster windows. And this is a means of
sending control signals down into your substructures. Now the
formation of an observer window, we use a mechanism called
synchrony. This is a zero phase lag connection between all the
components of a system. Very simply put, it means that
everything within an observer window is perfectly synchronized.
There is a zero lag synchronization, where all the
sub components form the whole component. And this is something
that we kind of intuitively assume is the case. When you
call a thing a thing, you kind of assume that everything in that
thing is synchronized and acting as if it was one thing. Here
we're kind of formalizing that and saying that synchrony is the
foundation for creating one of these observer windows. This is
very similar to Wolf singers binding by synchronization, the
idea that you can create a gestalt representation, a single
meaningful construct through synchrony, through synchronization.
So we're really just building off of and using Wolf singers
mechanism here. And then finally, we have coherence.
Coherence is the mechanism for dialogue or communication. This
is very much akin to Pascal Fries's neuronal communication
through neuronal coherence. The idea is that two systems that
are fluctuating will will communicate to each other. This
isn't that they're so synchronized that they fuse and
become one thing. But there is a non zero phase lag between the
two systems, where one is kind of talking while the other
listens and vice versa, they're coordinating their processing
through time, their dynamics. But they are not fully
synchronizing and fusing into into one another. So we updated
communication through coherence to use the word dialogue
through coherence. It really is the same as Pascal Fries's
method or his mechanism. However, we think dialogue kind of
preserves a little bit more of the autonomy of the individuals
instead of viewing these as like switchboards in a in a circuit
diagram. Instead, they're kind of autonomous beings or autonomous
cognitive systems that are like talking to each other, rather
than fusing with some sort of direct wire connection. Alright,
an important caveat slash question here is, you know, we
propose synchrony, coherence, cross frequency coupling as the
core mechanisms in the now model. However, we want to kind of
caution that we don't really think that these mechanisms are
sufficient to create consciousness. We think that
these are necessary mechanisms for communication across scales
for the formation of an observer window for communication
between observer windows. However, just because you have stuff
that is synchronized, we don't think you're spontaneously just
gonna have consciousness anywhere that you have an electric
field. There's probably a little bit more to it than that. If
you've been watching my YouTube channel, then you'll know that
I am very much fascinated and interested in theories of quantum
consciousness, the idea that quantum computers might be
somehow core to the nature of reality and to the nature of
consciousness fundamentally. So I'm kind of holding out that
there are, you know, more mechanisms that we will discover
to be really at the core of what it means to be a conscious
being. However, in the meantime, we got to go out there and do
some cognitive neuroscience. And there's a lot of tools and
methods we can use from cognitive neuroscience like
noninvasive brain stimulation, like the observations made with
EEG or fMRI or invasive recordings, optogenetics, you
know, there's a lot of great tools out there. So we think that,
you know, there's a lot of work to be done just by viewing needs
as necessary signals related to consciousness, even if they're
not sufficient to create consciousness outright in a sort
of generative way. But I think it's a really honest portrayal of
where the value of the theory is. There's a lot to be done in
this moment right now with the tools that we have. And there's
room in the future to incorporate new ideas that
inevitably will be emerging from advancements in technology
and in science. Alright, so let's dive a little bit more into
the phenomenology. What is it like to live at the apex of a
hierarchical consciousness system? So one way in which it is
like to be the top of this nested observer window hierarchy is
that ideas will just pop into your mind fully formed. This is a
pattern of emergence. So what does it mean to receive
information via cross frequency coupling? Maybe it would feel
like a light bulb going off in your head. Bam, there's an idea.
There's a fully formed, fully fleshed out concept right there
in front of you, right? The emergence process would kind of
abstract away the lower levels. You are really only aware of
maybe one layer deep into your brain, maybe two layers deep
into your brain. But once you get to three layers deep or
even two layers deep, probably it gets a lot more murky to kind
of see the origin of all this information. Another way that
it's like to be at the apex is we initiate a very cartoon image
of what we want to do. So let's imagine you're playing tennis
and you gotta run to the other side of the court, swing your racket.
How aware are you of all the muscle activations of all the
groups in your in your hand, in your legs? We are initiating
cartoons in our mind. You know, and I think cartoons
are a very apt way of kind of thinking about apex life.
You know, your apex is a cartoon diagram. It exists at a very
abstract level and yet it has access to all the details.
So we perceive HD reality. We perceive fast, high detail
information and we generate very complex movements.
However, we experience these at a very abstract level.
So one of the beautiful things about the now model
is that you can kind of have your cake and eat it too
in the sense that you are very slow and yet the data within your mind is very
fast. So we get all of the rich details of all
the brain regions, all of the neurons, all the proteins,
all that information processing that's bubbling up the hierarchy,
you get access to it. You get all of that information
and it's very fast except you are very slow
and there's no contradiction here, right? This is a way of
integrating information across very different time scales
and you can think and act very slowly and yet you can propagate that down
into the lower levels. Another example of what it's like to be at the apex
we have somewhat limited control over these lower levels
and there's a few examples that I think really showcase or highlight
that limitation. So one of them is optical illusions.
So, you know, if you have these undulating checker patterns
in some image that you're looking at, you could have full conscious awareness
that the sheet of paper or the the image is not moving.
However, there is an incorrigible sense
that there is some movement in the image even though you know that it's not
there. You cannot help but perceive the
optical illusion and this is a nice way of also
showcasing the apex. You are not fully in control of the
subsystems. Okay and I think this is one of the
real novel predictions of the now model is that you
cannot control your body fully. You are, you know, sending commands out
but the body can't fully interpret your commands
and you're so many levels of abstraction away
that you can't even fully grasp all the sub-processes going on internally
and you are truly an abstraction within the body.
Probably still have free will and probably still have full control
but your control is limited to what you are able to know
and you're only able to know a very high level of detail.
All right, so the apex is fundamentally slow
and I think that this is kind of counterintuitive to what
a lot of people imagine and this was one of the components of the now model
that it even took us time to accept as we were kind of thinking through the
implications of our own theory and the idea here
is that you the apex are likely operating at the time scale
of a second to multiple seconds. Okay and so what's happening here
is you are this fully integrated observer window
and you are observing the information content within yourself.
So it's as if you are looking down upon your hierarchy
at all times and you're looking down at these cognitive subsystems and
perceiving them and they're very fast so you think to yourself
ah that's my thought right there oh that thought is mine too oh that thought is
mine too and you're like looking down on these nested observer windows and
identifying them as you and the nested systems are faster
than you you are terrible at seeing
yourself you only see all the sub windows
and so you mistake the content of your mind
for your mind it is a part of you it is a part of your mind
but it is not your mind so we now believe that your mind is
integrating over these faster cycles of these nested systems
and here's a couple examples you climbed a mountain
you're looking out over the mountain and your eyes are darting around picking up
information so your fovea of your retina the center of
your retina the center of your eyeball perceives high density color vision
the periphery of your eye only perceives black and white
and it's very low information content so when you see the mountain
you just hike to the top do you perceive
little spotlights of your retina as data is being collected
no your eye darts around at theta frequency
roughly six times per second your eye is moving around
and it's gathering all these snapshots of the mountain scene
and then it assembles all of that information
into a gestalt representation of the mountain scene
and our argument is that your mind
is at the scale of the gestalt representation of the full scene
there are multiple processing time points
where your eye gathers data here gathers data there gathers data there gathers
data there and then it packages and integrates all that
information and your experience is wow isn't that
beautiful look at that mountain scene but if you zoomed into one of your nested
observer windows they would only have oh there's a mountain
oh there's some trees over there oh there's uh the beautiful sky over there
with some clouds each of their snapshots their
gestalt perceptions is the mountain is the trees is the sky
but you are slow at the scale of one second
you've had six eye movements occur and now all six of those eye movements all
that data gets packaged into your experience
and you have this voila this image of the whole mountain vista
another example as i'm talking to you i'm sending you all these words
but think about what it's like to listen to words to listen to someone
talking you're not really paying attention
to my words you don't actually really care or know
all the details of all the sound waves i'm sending
your experience of my words is oh wow a sentence oh wow another sentence
oh wow another sentence we argue and we are like planning an experiment to
like formally test this we argue that you are perceiving
sentences fully gestalted together you're not really paying attention
to all the sound bites of course a nested system is and if you want to call
that you go ahead and call that you but you are most
closely this big slow observer window and you receive
the fully packaged information content of a sentence
and if you introspect on your experience you can pay attention to my words if you
want to but most of the time you're not you're just like
wow what a cool idea oh that's an idea oh that's an idea
you're perceiving the fully fledged idea construct of the sentence
more so than perceiving words sequentially and building up a sentence
of course there's violations of this there's exceptions to this
it's a nested interacting system so there's ways of like diving in and paying
attention to the details but if you choose not to pay
attention to the details you still receive all the
information right and that is somewhat counterintuitive and
not the typical thinking on how cognition is occurring
another implication here is that it actually is quite hard
to be aware of separate sources of data in your mind
okay and we we go into this a little bit in the paper but i'm going to expand
more on it right now so when you introspect on your experience
you are a integrated whole and even if there was let's say eight
sub observer windows and maybe you could name them you could say hey this is uh
you know just in one just in two just in three just in four
all these sub processes within yourself what if it's hard to distinguish
who is giving you this information right you are so highly integrated at the
top level that you are terrible at perceiving
the individual sources of information that are becoming
integrated into the apex and this is one of the reasons why it's kind of
eluded us that there are multiple sub windows right
because it's kind of hard for us to learn about these different sub processes
however this isn't to say that it is impossible to learn about these
different sub windows inside of you and so we also make the argument
that maybe one reason that meditation
is so bizarre and so weird and why we would need to meditate
is because if you close your eyes and think about your experience in your mind
it is a chaotic mess inside of your mind
of all these different thoughts and feelings and drives and perceptions
could the complexity of our inner life
be because we are a nested observer window system
and all these sub windows all have different drives and different
personalities and different things they're trying to do
and you just naively say I am me I'm one person
and yet there's all these different conflicting selves internally
and when you try to introspect on yourself on your experiences
that milieu of cognitive systems are all being bounded together
and so the observer window nature of yourself
makes it even more challenging to then introspect on the various sub components
or sub processes that might have a unique origin internally
all right so what evidence do we have in the brain
that we are modular and what's kind of wild is that the brain is
almost bizarrely over modular and the intuition that you're one person
almost doesn't line up with the data of the brain
if you look at the brain it's got two hemispheres
and these hemispheres if you hold the brain in your hand you can kind of
twisted and move the brain and it's really not touching
itself that much there is a huge chasm running through the center of your
brain separating it into two different halves
what if this is a huge process of the observer window system
where your brain is intentionally divided right
the brain wants to create cognitive dissonance
it wants competing narratives of self and by creating competing narratives
you encourage a greater diversity of thought internally
and this leads to higher intelligence through
simulating more possibilities of what could be out there of
how to view and how to act and this would be maybe a
evolutionarily beneficial thing to create internally is a high high
high modularity you have examples like split brain patients
right if you cut the brain in half you cut the corpus callosum
these were patients that had intractable epilepsy so they were having a lot of
seizures and so they cut the brain in half
to try to reduce the amount of seizures that these people were having
and there's some really bizarre findings out of these patients
essentially that immediately following the surgery
it appears as if the individual now has two different personalities
there's a lot of these like simple dissociations of information coming in
between different eyes or different visual fields
the hands kind of being controlled by different hemispheres
these are kind of like the simple things you learn about in textbooks about
split brain patients but what you don't learn as much about in
standard textbooks is that following the surgery if you talk to people that
work with these patients it appears as if there's two very
distinct personalities co-habitating within the individual
all right and there's some pretty wild examples like one that
VS Ramachandran talks about where people appear to display very different
belief systems one hemisphere believes in god the other
hemisphere does not one hemisphere has like a funny
sense of humor the other hemisphere is quite serious
you know there's a lot of internal conflict
and the stories you can learn from people that work with these patients
are quite wild right and i feel like this is somewhat missed
the mainstream public discourse in a weird way partly in my opinion
because this is kind of fundamentally unsettling
in a weird way we don't want nested observer windows to be true
because it's so alien and it feels so wrong
to our naive intuition of being a single individual
there's something culturally preventing us from taking nested observer windows
seriously in a weird way but is that just some cultural
quirk or some bias that we've kind of
grown into and can you explain two personalities coexisting within a
single individual in split brain patients
kind of bizarre you also have the inverse example for example
krista and tatiana hogan these are twins that are conjoined at the brain
so there is a connection between the thalamus of these two girls
where their skulls are fused and their brains are connected
and the two girls are able to communicate telepathically
with each other they can think thoughts and hear each other's thoughts
they can allow each other to control each other's bodies
they get annoyed at each other when they eat foods that they don't like
right they can tell each other jokes and have you know a fun time internally
and you know i think this is really interesting to ask the question
you know are these two girls one person or are they two separate people
probably they're two separate people however
it's quite strange that they can communicate using just their minds
it's almost as if there's two apex observer windows
and a means of communicating between the two apexes
and we might think to ourselves wow this is so alien this is so bizarre
i have no idea what it would be like to be
the hogan twins but if the nested observer windows model is true
then you might actually know what it's like to be the hogan twins more than
you might realize maybe you're talking to yourself
all the time when you talk to your sub windows
maybe you haven't had the experience of having a lateral apex window
communicating between the apexes however you have the experience of having
sub windows talking to each other and having internal conflict and dialogue
so maybe it's not as foreign to your experience as you might expect
i also think there's some really important work
occurring in the domain of psychotherapy to really
conceptualize the self as a family so richard schwarz developed what's
called the internal family system psychotherapy
he is a person working in the mental health space
and he was working with family therapy so he would take a family that wanted to
work through some of their issues into his clinic
and he developed a method of having you know different pairs of the family
talk to each other work through their differences
he crafted kind of a canonical archetypal framework that most families
appeared to fall into there's different familial roles
that people will take on in the family
bizarrely what he discovered is this family based psychotherapy
was highly effective in the individual so if you took a single person
and you walked them through a family based psychotherapy
you would realize or uncover that it is as if there are different personalities
internally and these forge the same canonical familial roles
that you observe in families you have a family inside of your head
where there's different personalities competing for space competing for time
and as you experience psychiatric illness
or cognitive dissonance it could be that there's some sort of
battle debate conflict between these different internal family members
and this sounds completely bizarre maybe it's just a psychotherapy that works
hey take it or leave it or it is metaphysically ontologically
reality because there is a nested observer window system inside of you
and if you dive into the observer windows inside of your apex
these are your family members you have an internal family system
of different sub windows with different desires and goals
communicating with each other throughout your entire life
you are a cooperative enterprise of multiple competing cooperating cognitive systems
feeding into your experience and this is the nesting within you
that explains who you are and what you're doing
and what if you could better characterize the different personalities that coexist inside of
you could you live a healthier more productive life this is the you know the pitch of internal
family systems also some really interesting cases like dissociative identity disorder or
multiple personality disorder so when i was receiving clinical psychology training back in
my postdoc i brought this up to some of my mentors i was like ooh what about multiple
personality disorder how does that you know work in a psychotherapy and in psychiatric illness
and they told me oh that doesn't exist that is made up from the movies there was a little bit
more nuance to it but essentially the vibe or the impression was that multiple personality
disorder is not real okay however there's been a lot of interesting reviews out recently
and i've talked to a couple people who have you know loved ones with dissociative identity
disorder or who have worked with these patients or who are these patients themselves and i
personally am fully convinced that dissociative identity disorder is real it really happens
but let's wonder you know what is it that makes people so resistive to DID being real
i think it's that metaphysically ontologically we don't have a way to make sense of this it's so
bizarre to our intuition that we reject the premise that this could ever be real however
the nested observer windows model of course you know has a way to account for this if the apex
window experiences some really strong trauma then maybe it would dissolve maybe it would you know
loosen its grip slightly and some of the sub windows would take on a more viscerally real
quality right the sub windows are the multiple personality internal family within all of us
and DID is not necessarily a complete pathologicalization of you know reality but there's some truth
in every psychiatric illness to our experience and so DID represents some component of us
that maybe freaks us out maybe we're not coming to terms with but if there is this rich internal
cognitive nested hierarchical structure then DID is not impossible it has a biological explanation
and there's elements or components of their experience that resonate and are true within
your experience as well it's not so alien as to be impossible to empathize with or to understand
so another phenomenon of relevance to the now model are tulpas and tulpa mansers or the act of
tulpa mansi and so this is the intentional creation of an imaginary friend so these are people that
actively and willfully create a imaginary friend in their mind and they talk to this person they
listen to this person they hang out with this person and this is not unlike the phenomenon of
children having very vivid and real imaginary friends in their experience and so tulpa mansi
is the as an adult intentional creation of an imaginary friend for what purpose well for fun
to deal with loneliness maybe this is some sort of coping strategy for your for your life
um you know whatever your motivation for doing this there's a growing community especially on
reddit that is developing the skills related to tulpa mansi and i think this is fascinating
in a way this lines up very well with the now model potentially tulpas are the recognition
of a sub window internally and encouraging a sub window to take on its own voice to take on its
own reality and you encourage independence separately from the apex or with a more direct
line of communication with the apex so i think this is a really fascinating phenomenon and is
probably worth studying um so i'm talking with uh some people there's a few researchers out there
tania lerman and michael lifshitz who are really diving into tulpas in tulpa mansi um so i think
this is a really exciting area to kind of look at maybe validating the now model all right some
other examples that might be of relevance um there was some work recently uh looking into the
octopus for example as a sort of exotic organism that might show more of a hierarchical consciousness
system than humans display so in the octopus there is some pretty solid evidence as of late
that the tentacles are semi-autonomous they appear able to learn and act and behave
somewhat separately from the full organism however they can of course be wrapped into
the goal directed behavior of the full octopus and so this really like kind of in a beautiful way
exemplifies the now model where you have semi-autonomous sub windows that are able to nest
into the apex upon demand and maybe the octopus or other organisms might give us insight into the
human nested observer window framework because there might be different mechanism biological
structures at play which tweak and change the expression of the biological hierarchy maybe
there's less cross frequency coupling maybe there's more autonomy at a lower level and that would
give rise to a shift in what it is like to be this organism but it could be compared and
contrasted with the human physiology and i think that is just a really fascinating new line of work
to dive into um another philosopher neuroscientist biologist on this same kind of thought pattern
is michael levin michael levin in his group have been doing some really great work thinking about
hierarchical information processing and he has these really bizarre xenobots which are clumps
of cells that appear to form holistic organisms and this is super bizarre right there is no
biological infrastructure to make a xenobot but it appears as if there is a macroscopic
structure that emerges from these clumps of cells a different approach as studying the octopus
would be to look at the emergence of maybe cross frequency coupling some sort of hierarchical
consciousness system in these very simple models which might give us you know more novel insight
an important question here or a fun thing to think about is what is the nature of consciousness
in your brain so the very safe simple kind of naive one is what we call apex hierarchical
consciousness this is the idea that you exist at the apex of the hierarchy and you are the only one
that's conscious in your brain it's just you don't worry about those nested subsystems they are
processing your cognition but you're the only one who's home you're the only one that's conscious
in your body alternatively there is a emergent hierarchical consciousness some threshold where
above this line all of these observer windows are conscious beings your nested observer windows
are conscious they have independent experience from you not fully independent right because
there's some interaction but they are conscious in and of themselves and then finally there's some
sort of pan psychic hierarchical consciousness possibility where every observer window is a
conscious being period full stop however you know the observer window requires synchrony so there's
some threshold some mechanism that needs to be at play to create an observer window to create a
conscious being so it's not that it like spontaneously consciousness can just be everywhere
but you know this still kind of holds some sort of boundary some sort of condition for
consciousness to to be present all right so I just want to end with a reference to Daniel Dennett
who sadly recently passed away he had this idea called the Cartesian theater and it's the idea
that you know your naive sense of consciousness is that there is a little little man in your
head that's perceiving everything hearing everything smelling everything pulling the
levers moving the body around he points out the confusion in this that okay if there is a little
conscious being inside of your body wouldn't there need to be a smaller little conscious
being inside of that person's body and then wouldn't there be an even smaller conscious
being inside of that person's body and there's an infinite regression of smaller and smaller
people inside of your mind and so this is completely preposterous when you need to do away with this
simple notion of a theater of experience and he called this the homunculus problem the problem of
having nested infinite consciousnesses well the now model right is very uh at odds with this and so
we you know think what if this is a homunculus solution what if there is a Cartesian multiplex
instead of it having a Cartesian single theater there's only one show that's playing what if there
are many shows a multiplex or a synaplex a a theatrical establishment with many movies going
on inside of your brain the nested observer windows model says there are many experiences
internally and you maybe are a bit of a movie goer popping between the many diverse experiences
happening inside of you and there is maybe this near infinite fractal of smaller beings nested
inside of you and in that sense it really would be turtles all the way down maybe there's some floor
maybe it keeps going and i think an important question is you know could there be something
bigger than us something larger than us going in the other direction is there an observer window
greater than the individual and at one point i will have a couple episodes probably on the
concept of collective consciousness is there any substance to the idea of a shared or collective
experience so with that um wrapping up with the now model um check out the paper for yourself i
think it's a really cool exciting new theory um obviously i do because i've you know poured a lot
of time and energy into this i'm gonna also want to you know point out jonathan schuller is really
a core contributor to these ideas and to this model um and we're now looking at different ways
to test these theories in people with dissociative identity disorder in people with tulpas in split
brain patients um looking at these low frequency integrations that are occurring within your
experience um so a lot of new research um on the horizon and i will talk to you again very soon
goodbye
um
