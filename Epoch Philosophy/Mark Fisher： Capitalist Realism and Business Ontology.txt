And capitalist realism isn't just there being pushed by neoliberal ideologues.
It's in us as well, and I think nothing illustrates this more clearly than the real widespread
failure of so-called leftists, if there was any such thing anymore in parliamentary terms
in Europe, to have taken advantage of the most spectacular failure of a political project
ever, probably, which was the financial crisis and the bank bailouts of 2008.
Looking in a contemporary global capitalistic world, one that has siphoned out any radical
economic dissent, the question looms, are we able to escape capitalism?
Is there anything past it?
Is any such endeavor even possible?
To an arguable majority, they understand the looming issues with capitalism, even if
it's something painful to admit.
But this supposedly post-ideological world, a world with the end of the Soviet Union,
of an actual communist Chinese government, is there any coherent vision past global capitalism?
This is essential ethos of this book.
Can we escape capitalism?
What is capitalism?
And what is this capitalist realism that Mark Fisher talks about?
It should be noted before the body of the video, I have been told numerous times to read this
book and its whole, and in regret I have not done it sooner.
After reading this, this is hands down one of my favorite works of theory, and the greatest
visualization of American capitalism I have ever seen.
It is bleak, it is depressing, but more than anything, it is beautifully relevant.
A relevancy from an author who fundamentally lived what he wrote, and who understood these
very conditions to his core.
I want these core points to be accessible to all, if possible, for these ideas to work
into the collective unconsciousness, and to help break and understand this weird matrix
that we are in.
There has been numerous videos on capitalist realism, but I want this one to be the absolutely
most ambitious one.
I want it to completely encompass this book and its whole, and with an accessible form
for all.
More than anything, I want to do capitalist realism justice.
This video is Capitalist Realism, just in video form.
Then after 1989, when capitalism loses its visible antagonists in the Soviet Empire, then
capitalism doesn't have to defend itself as such.
It just becomes the horizon of the imaginable.
It doesn't have to be named anymore, it is all the more powerful because it is not named.
Right from the start, Mark Fisher comes out swinging with the phrase, it's easier to
imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism, a phrase widely attributed
to Frederick Jameson and Slavoj Zizek.
As shocking as this phrase is, it's undeniably true in almost every way that capitalism isn't
a mere economic system.
It's an imposed psychological reality and condition that has permanently altered our
being.
If post-mortem consciousness existed and we collectively destroyed our existence at the
whims of capital, the very idea of restricting capitalism would possibly scare more than
a very real apocalyptic scenario.
In this context, capitalism is an a mere system, it is us.
This is why, when the impending threat of climate change is brought up, the reasonable
response is, I just simply try not to think about it.
To end capitalism is to end our contemporary human subjectivity today.
But given the nature of this book, we must closely define what capitalism is and how
it molds to us.
Mark Fisher does just that with a whole host of prior theory.
From the start, he elaborates on the traditional ethos of capitalism with a quote from Marx
and Engels and the Communist Manifesto.
Capital has drowned the most heavenly exorcises of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm,
of Philistine sentimentalism, and the icy water of egotistical calculation.
It has resolved personal worth into an exchange value, and in place of the numberless and
defeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom, free trade.
In one word for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted
naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
Capitalism is the human condition that is left after culture, ritual, and symbolic elaboration
is dead.
The new culture is now consumption and spectacle.
Capitalism moves into the aesthetic realm, and as aesthetics and rational ideation go,
we see capitalism as the ultimate purveyor.
Humans do not merely go on military conquests like Genghis Khan, we do not merely kill and
burn down villages for fundamental power and control.
Instead, we set up camp in foreign countries and systematically set up shop and exploit
human labor with the shiny facade of progress.
But only when the exploited recognize the game they are being subjected to, they revolt
and fight back.
Even extreme brutality emerges, a brutality that is arguably worse than prior forms, brutality
like we saw in King Leopold II's Free State of Congo, plantation slavery in Cuba and in
the Caribbean.
Brutality doesn't cease to exist, it's simply massed, it's a more efficient and
systemic endeavor.
Capitalism sucks up culture, it sucks up history, turns the very things that often
made us human into museum pieces.
Everything is objectified, it's commodified.
With Fukuyama's idea that we have reached the apex with liberal capitalism after the
fall of the Berlin Wall, Mark Fisher believes that critical insight into late capitalism
is often Nietzschean rather than Marxist.
Nietzsche wrote about the overflow of history into the human condition.
We have replaced human engagement in life, culture and politics into spectatorship.
We retroactively learn what it is to be human.
We retroactively examine truth rather than engage into activities that make it so.
After quotes, Nietzsche's most prescient pages are those in which he describes the
over-saturation of an age with history.
It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself.
He wrote in untimely meditations and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism,
in which cosmopolitan fingering, a detached spectatorialism replaces engagement and involvement.
This is the condition of Nietzsche's last man, who has seen everything but is decadently
enfeebled precisely by this excess of self-awareness.
This quote absolutely hit me to my core.
Think about what we are doing right now.
We are learning about something very abstract, theory-oriented, while simultaneously ignoring
the very woes that we are learning about in reality.
This learning, this education, this self-awareness simultaneously pacifies us.
If this isn't one of the most scary insights, I have no clue what is.
Moving on, Mark Fisher visualizes this living from history with Kurt Cobain.
Kurt Cobain understood this new society of historical life.
Kurt Cobain knew, as a star of MTV, he was just a prop, a prop that will eventually collapse.
He was a spectacle, a newer mimic of stars like Jim Morrison and Hendricks.
There's nothing more embarrassing than a group of people walking up to you and shaking,
and clamoring, and praising you like you're some kind of fucking god or something.
It's embarrassing.
Further, even understanding this phenomenon to Cobain was a cliche.
These anxieties he expressed further resulted in the nihilistic facade he portrayed.
Why does it matter if I will be replaced by something greater?
Why does it matter if I am just another spectacle?
Another object of desire.
It's not fundamentally me anyway.
This abundance of history creates a weird, new form of nihilism.
If we know the results of our action, how time will repeat itself, why do anything at
all?
This is a nihilism that works perfectly within postmodern capitalism.
This is often not a conscious nihilism either.
The nihilism of the past, the very Nietzschean anxieties around the loss of culture, the
loss of things that make us human, is child's play to this new form of nihilism today.
And in many ways, it isn't just nihilism, it's a new, pernicious form of it.
One that convinces you of the opposite.
Fisher showcases this in the film Wally, a movie that shows an uninhabitable world from
radical human consumption, a movie that actively decries the forms of capitalism we are subjected
to and face right now.
This movie isn't just spectacle, it invites us in to interact and participate in it, gauge
the world around us, how we are contributing to global disaster.
Because of this, there was a mass outcry from right-wing observers for, quote-unquote, attacking
its own audience.
In many ways, Wally is a Marxian-like film, but there is one thing, there is one huge
caveat at hand.
This film ironically feeds this capitalist realism.
The very film performs our anti-capitalist activism and education for us.
We can consume this film with impunity.
This corporate activism does all the work for us and perfectly pacifies us.
It ties the very innate threat of human destruction into an ideal that we can pervasively enjoy.
Where in other societies, propaganda is needed to cover up repressive acts, the exact opposite
is true with contemporary capitalism.
Capitalism is strengthened by its own critiques.
These corporate anti-capitalist critiques ironically act as a very reinforcement and
an unconscious pacifying agent.
As reinforcement goes, Fisher brings up the mode of mental health and contemporary capitalism,
bearing the work of Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse, link right up above if
you are interested.
We see that mental health is a radically individualistic and internal problem.
Psychology and mental healing are purely partitioned into an interpersonal thing.
You have a chemical imbalance, you are super stressed, etc.
Yet we recognize that external events play a role in this regardless.
You go to therapy after a family member dies, after you are having a rough time in life,
but the medical apparatus never touches work, it never touches economics.
That is purely off-limits, it's off-limits because of capitalist realism.
The idea that neoliberal, contemporary capitalism is simply innately us, therefore it presents
a depth that even psychology hasn't even been able to systematically penetrate.
This moves us into the newer economic working conditions that affect the western subject.
We used to live in a Fordist world, a capitalist framework that mirrored Henry Ford's production
model, line workers doing the same menial task over and over and over again.
This is where traditional Marxists derive much of their ideas around alienation and
the modern state of industrialized work.
Yet today we are living in something more pervasive and totally different.
We are now in a very post-Fordist economic world.
We see that in this post-Fordist world, flexibility, nomadism, and spontaneity are absolutely essential.
You must be flexible, willing to stretch yourself to the absolute max.
Hyper-individuality is now favorable.
You must follow unfounded rules that are constantly made up on the spot.
The main character of this film is in a constant state of useless menial task, sent from hyper-bureaucracy.
The Reagan and Thatcher promises that neoliberalism, market capitalism would eliminate the very
bureaucracy and false appearance of progress found in Stalin's Soviet Union, a bureaucracy
that was supposedly only found in the public sector, is ironically worse in today's post-modern capitalism.
Today's capitalism has found itself in the same dilemma of ex-Soviet states, the pursuit
of symbols and the appearance of productivity and progress, more than the actual progress
itself.
Teachers and professors are now tasked to adhering to strict curriculum where administrators
will watch their lectures.
These educators are now more concerned with fulfilling the appearance of education rather
than the education itself.
But this isn't a phenomenon found because education is within the public sector.
This is a new phenomenon posited by neoliberal, right-wing, and hyper-capitalistic governments.
A strategy that originally took place in private schools, but then subsequently found its home
and public schools from a neoliberal government.
Mark Fisher quotes,
This is, in part, a consequence of the inherent resistance of certain processes and services
to marketization.
The supposed marketization of education, for instance, rests on a confused and underdeveloped
analogy.
Are students the consumers of the service or its product?
The idealized market was supposed to deliver friction-free exchanges, in which the desires
of consumers would be met directly without the need for intervention or mediation by
regulatory agencies.
Yet the drive to assess the performance of workers and to measure forms of labor which,
by their nature, are resistant to quantification, has inevitably required additional layers
of management and bureaucracy.
What we have is not a direct comparison of workers' performance or output, but a comparison
between the audited representation of that performance and output.
Inevitably, a short circuiting occurs, and work becomes geared towards the generation
and massaging of representations rather than to the social goals of the work itself.
This is what capitalism is.
It's an elastic system that adapts, that consumes our former subjectivity, that pacifies
us into forms of entertainment and material idealism, evaporating the very prior subjectivity
that made us human, for better or worse.
The concept of this contemporary capitalism is one of profound ironic contradiction.
Fisher quotes the French philosopher Alain Béryu on this very late 20th century postmodern
capitalistic paradox, a brutal state of affairs, profoundly unegalitarian, where all existence
is evaluated in terms of money alone, is presented to us as an ideal.
To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call
it ideal or wonderful, so instead they have decided to say that all the rest is horrible.
Sure they say we may not live in a condition of perfect goodness, but we're lucky that
we don't live in a condition of evil.
Our democracy is not perfect, but it's better than the bloody dictatorships.
Capitalism is unjust, but it's not criminal like Stalinism.
We let millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don't make racist nationalist declarations
like Milosevic.
We kill Iraqis with our airplanes, but we don't cut their throats with machetes like
they do in Rwanda, etc.
What separates today's capitalism of a post-Soviet world is one of postmodern capitalism, where
universal values do not really exist.
There is a rejection of responsibility outside of the pursuit of capital, but Fisher articulates
that this realism he talks about isn't merely postmodernism.
It's more intense than that.
It's a form of postmodernism beyond itself.
Fisher says capitalist realism no longer stages this kind of confrontation with modernism.
On the contrary, it takes the vanquishing of modernism for granted.
Modernism is now something that can periodically return, but only as a frozen aesthetic style,
never as an ideal for living.
This is what capitalist realism is.
It is a rejection of concepts of space and time, history, everything.
Capitalist realism rejects absolutely everything except the pursuit of capital.
And subsequently, we see a world that completely cries out for modernity and of the very better
days of the past.
And in a very capitalist, realist society, this is what crying out for modernity looks
like.
Biden represents our prior tame postmodern
capitalistic world.
One just with a nice modern facade.
This world still has a connection to modernity, though.
He is a representation of normalcy, a horrid neoliberal normalcy, but he is a cry for a
return to better days.
Admittedly, still terrible days, yet better than the latter stages of this realism.
But while there is a connection to modernity, this normalcy is still removed from modernity
itself.
With Trump, Trump is the very embodiment of elastic capitalist realism.
He is the embodiment of the ultimate form of postmodernism.
As capitalist realism really is a hyperpotent form of postmodernism.
We've covered a bit of postmodern conservatism on this channel, here's a link above if you
are interested.
Biden acknowledges the fact of climate change, student loan debt, and the woes affecting
capitalist subjects.
Yet it will still be a massive struggle for him to do anything of substance on these issues.
He will fight tooth and nail to keep capital at the forefront of importance.
Compared to Trump, Trump denies these issues altogether.
It's as simple as him claiming these massive issues don't really exist.
And like that, they quite honestly disappear from his sphere of responsibility, as his
base simply follows along.
He's a reverse of the former.
He lies about the issues plaguing humanity, yet he's ironically honest about the result.
You see, he is cryptically honest about the political reality we are residing in, in the
very disturbing, yet true results of his action.
But these actions, these desires for a return to modernity, to normalcy, can be viewed through
the psychoanalytic lens of the Lacanian real.
In this case, Fisher uses the real as something that any reality must suppress, an unattainable
void that can be viewed through the fractures and inconsistencies of what we perceive reality
to be.
And in more Lacanian psychoanalytic terms, the appearance of reality can be seen as a
symbolic order in the imaginary.
But of course, we'll have to refrain from doing a complete deep dive in the Lacanian
psychoanalysis.
Yet through this lens of looking at the fractures within capitalism, fractures that give us
a glimpse into the real, the concept of the real can be used as a tool to uncover the
true reality of capitalism, capitalist realism, and the very psychological effects it attempts
to cover up.
Rather than using a more ontological or metaphysical approach to the real, Mark Fisher is simply
using the real as an application.
While the real can kind of ironically be used and concepts symbolically.
So with a very symbolic approach to the real, Fisher gives environmental catastrophe as
an example of a real.
It's impossible for capitalism to truly assimilate climate change-induced apocalypse
into a potential reality.
This statement might be confusing to some, given we use the example of Wally, an ultimate
critique of capitalism.
Yet even within the most cynical examples such as Wally, we don't even concede that
human annihilation is actually possible.
Even Wally, humans are still alive, with robots to do the fixing of human woes and mass consumption.
Even the most cynical critiques within mass entertainment and media does not truly contend
with absolute catastrophe.
Rather, the idea of catastrophe is just ironically reinforced within the system of capitalism.
Solutions are just repackaged within the commodity, packaged into advertising and marketing
campaigns.
In simpler terms, under this stage of capitalism, the solution to climate catastrophe, driven
by capitalism, is repackaged into more capitalism.
Fisher quotes, environmental catastrophe is one such real.
At one level, to be sure, it might look as if green issues are very far from being unrepresentable
voids for capitalist culture.
Climate change and the threat of resource depletion are not being repressed so much as incorporated
into advertising and marketing.
What this treatment of environmental catastrophe illustrates is the fantasy structure on which
capitalist realism depends, a presupposition that resources are infinite, that the earth
itself is merely a husk which capital can at certain point slow like a used skin, and
that any problem can be solved by the market.
In this case, the hidden real in a capitalist system is the emergence of surface capitalist
solutions to solve the very issues capitalism has created.
The privatization of stress, a new emergence of neoliberal hyperbureaucracy, a very much
worse audit-based version of bureaucracy neoliberalism promised to solve.
Fisher describes this massive issue of mental health and how capitalism privatizes it and
reestablishes mental health as purely internal, a natural occurrence.
This mirrors the naturalism that neoliberalism espouses.
When you ask the majority of Americans if they want socialized medicine, government-funded
healthcare, universal healthcare, and the like, a likely majority show fear or shudder
in confusion.
That's because private healthcare is as natural as the trees around us.
Not only this, but the private entity of any tangible service or product.
Mark Fisher calls this existence people in the US are threshing into as a business ontology.
Mark Fisher talks about how theorists like Foucault and Badiou have described potent and
successful politics as something that explodes the very appearance of the natural order.
To make their ideology, core beliefs, policies appear as something innate as nature.
Fisher points out that the sheer amount of privatizations that took place in the 80s
were unimaginable in 1975.
Denationalization of utilities, railways, the existence of prisons as a profitable enterprise,
these used to be things that were unimaginable.
This changed because of the emergence of neoliberalism as something natural and with our new existence
being centered around profit and finance, a complete business ontology as we see.
This is why 21st century Americans still seem shocked at the idea that something isn't
for sale, that something's existence isn't centered around profit, that being business
and even people.
Thus a world where our existence and ontology is centered around business.
Despite a universal, a single payer, not-for-profit healthcare system being statistically cheaper,
more efficient, and an ultimate benefit to nearly everyone, many in the United States
still shudder in fear or complete confusion at the prospect of it.
But this business ontology goes further than this.
It's the prospect or hope that monetization can reach absolutely everything.
It's a world in existence where commodity fetishism is at its highest point.
Chapter 6 of the book brings us back into the new hyperbureaucracy that's present in 21st
century capitalism.
Fisher argues that the consequences of this new economic world is a world that melts into
pure PR.
Business and progress is gone, work now exists for the illusion of work.
It's an ultimate anti-production work strategy.
He sees this new phenomenon that marketizes Stalin's aesthetic approach to production.
The irony in this is beyond comprehension, neoliberalism has sought to become the most
efficient system that would fight the Stalinist approach to the appearance of work.
Fisher uses the example of Stalin's white sea canal.
In the 1930s this canal was one of the most impressive feats in engineering, but only
on the surface.
The canal was too shallow to use for most 20th century cargo, thus it was a symbol
of production, and more importantly anti-production at that.
Stalin's USSR would turn this canal into PR, people would photograph it, whole Soviet
public relations teams would be tasked with showcasing this canal, an empty canal that
was really only pretty and useful on the outside.
This is the very symbolic anti-production neoliberal capitalism sought to destroy, yet
neoliberal capitalism has made this PR business meta a more efficient endeavor under the use
of constant auditing.
Because of managers, bosses constantly breathing down your neck, workers are more concerned
with the image of production, teachers are more concerned with adhering to complete guidelines
and the very appearance of education rather than education itself.
This is what capitalist realism is, it's a post-fortis system where we cannot get too
attached.
This move all the time, sentimentalism is turned into pure profit motive.
We are sucked into the end of history, an end of history that turns to new nihilism,
a new nihilism that makes the old look like child's play.
So can we get past this capitalist realism?
Can we break through capitalism?
To Fisher, there isn't a huge, tangible, prescriptive answer.
Seven-eighths of the whole book is descriptive of our current capitalism, but there are prescriptive
bits and pieces he gives us.
The first is not to underestimate the system we are living in.
It's arguable the traditional Marxist approach that capitalism will kill itself is far too optimistic.
Marxist critiques of the past cannot hold a candle to the situation we are currently in.
The reality is way more grim.
Capitalism will kill itself by killing virtually all life via ecological disaster.
The second is we must constructively approach neoliberalism, postmodern capitalism as a
framework that is hyper-artificial.
Because it ultimately is, it's a massive ideological construct that isn't natural whatsoever.
It's constructed for the benefit of a few oligarchs with the expense of the many.
We need to point out that our capitalist realism relies on public fundings.
It relies on bailouts when it will ultimately fail every decade or so.
Capitalist realism hides that collective intervention is necessary.
We need to make this public, the existence of purely private enterprise is the artificial
reality that has been implanted onto our being.
Our approach should be new, it should be organic, it shouldn't be hyper-fixated on ideology.
It should be humane with the approach to mental health, the material conditions people
face, and most of all, we must create new politics that exposes the prior reality as
something purely artificial, as a world past capitalist realism is the natural order of
things.
Fisher ends the book with this, in any case, rationing of some sort is inevitable.
The issue is whether it will be collectively managed, or whether it will be imposed by
authoritarian means when it is already too late.
Despite what forms this collective management should take is, again, an open question, one
that can only be resolved practically and experimentally.
The long dark night of the end of history has to be grasped as an enormous opportunity.
The very oppressive pervasiveness of capitalist realism means that even glimmers of alternate
political and economic possibilities can have a disproportionately great effect.
The tiniest event can tear a hole in the gray curtain of reaction which has marked the
horizons of possibility under capitalist realism.
From a situation in which nothing can happen, suddenly anything is possible again.
