Today on the podcast we have our third conversation with Michael Levin to
kick off the new year and we talk a lot about the developments that he's been
making in his lab that all centered around the idea of embodied cognition,
intelligence versus consciousness, some of the specifics of the way that the
experiments work because the last time that we talked to him he had just
published his paper on Frogskin Xenobots where they had taken Frogskin cells
from Frogskin, grown them in special conditions and then created these
ambulatory little creatures that could then corral other skin cells to produce
more of themselves and so basically in I think a pretty transparent way made a
new life form out of a cellular format that you wouldn't really expect would be
able to do something new and he kind of teased us with the idea that they were
working on doing the same thing with the Malian cells and this paper was
published over the course of the last year and so a lot of our discussion
centered on what are called Anthrobots which are tracheal epithelial cells
that grown in a 3d matrix then released from the 3d matrix are now become
these multicellular ciliated structures that astonishingly migrate to the
location of wounds inside of plated neuronal cells and then act to heal
the break in the cellular layer and so it opens all of these questions that are
kind of a perpetual topic with Michael Levin right like what are the parameters
that create the design limitations that we associate with the bodies that we
live in and as always it's a absolutely fascinating discussion because I think
that Levin is thinking about these questions in a way that honestly very
very few people are Levin and collaborators as he mentions towards the
end of the episode and there's extraordinary second and third order
effects from the instrumentalization of these experiments as well right so
what does a world with truly regenerative medicine look like how do we
account for the ability that we can build our bodies back but our minds are
perhaps wrestling with the longevity issue and also how does
disembodied consciousness appear at other scales throughout the cosmos in
systems that we might not have access to how do we examine those systems in a
way where we can poke at them if they're on different time scales and
different spatial scales and we're used to these are huge questions so it's a
wide-ranging conversation part three and we'll look forward maybe next year to
doing part four we wanted to say a huge thank you to our patrons for being here
all year this is our first podcast for the new year it's actually New Year's Day
today we're really stoked on the next year we're having our first conference out
in Austin Texas we would love to see you there it's going to be a really close
knit conversation circle we have some incredible speakers lined up you can
check out all of those things at the link down in the description and up here
and I really hope to meet you guys out there and check out the total solar
eclipse which is happening that weekend we also have live stream tickets that
are going to be on sale and right now those are $10 but the price is going to
go up in the next few weeks so get those now on the early sale when it's still
affordable and we're going to be making a big road trip out there and playing
music shows along the way so if you are on the path of Oregon to Austin get in
touch with us if you want us to play in your town and we will figure out a way
to make it happen and as always a huge thank you to our patrons we could not
do this without you guys because as you probably well know we live in a society
where you uh you got to make bread to eat bread and we do eat a lot of peanut
butter and jelly but this has been a transformative experience because we
have been able to build this show on the basis of having an audience that
believes in what we're doing and so if you've been listening to the show for a
while and you and you want to support us then come on over to patreon.com that
link is right here and you can join for just a couple dollars a month and really
help us keep the ship going and help us develop it and make it so that we have
more in-person conversations so we can go see you in the towns where you're at
and not have it just be something that is through the computer screen where
everyone is experiencing it by themselves.
All right let's talk to Michael.
It seems like you're spending a lot of time thinking about this idea of
intelligence and the manifestations of intelligence and the the smallest
possible unit of what can be said to be intelligent and studying how
it evolves and organizes and sorts like there was a paper that was just
on the Reeveson side where you were looking at the way that these different
sorting algorithms clustered during evolutionary
experiences and I wonder if we could start with a conversation about
the minimum unit of intelligence and evolution
and behavior because if you can do it with such a simple system
then it seems like those principles are being applied actively
in the bio about work. Sure sure yeah I mean the thing is and I have
somewhere on my website I have a video that I made of
the word cloud of all our papers from every year and how it's changed from
I think 1992 or something all the way and you can watch them change and
the thing is that it's not that I've spent more time thinking about this now
I always thought about this stuff this was always what I'm interested in
but there was a time when that wasn't the right time to talk about
any of it and progressively over the years it's become more and more fruitful
to start to talk about it because these are topics that go
sort of across the grain for a lot of the way that people think about biology
and so on and until we had a body of work that really
was able to say no look this is a useful way to think about things because it
leads to new discoveries right until that had reached a certain level there was
no point in becoming out and talking about basal cognition or any of that
so now I think I think we're in an interesting point now where we can
actually robustly talk about some of these things
yeah and in particular if you want to start with the with the sorting
algorithm so so the thing about the sorting algorithms is that there is no
evolution there this is purely the standard
very few lines of code that a sort of we're talking six seven lines of code
tops that a standard sorting algorithm has
and the reason I picked it is because
understanding the very minimal system that exhibits some sort of
very kind of basal aspects of intelligence of cognitive behavior of
problem solving and so on is really important because a lot of people
have and this includes you know professional
neuroscientists and so on they think that a lot of these
kinds of capacities show up fairly late right and so you know so
Nick Humphries would put it at birds and mammals for example like it may be
really late and I inevitably when I start talking
about the symmetries or the invariances that exist
in terms of these different capacities across
the tree of life across all kinds of weird implementations and so on
inevitably the question becomes well what's the smallest piece in other
words are you then saying that every rock
has hopes and dreams and things I write that that's the question that people
ask and so so actually I think it's very important to answer that question to
say what do these things look like when they
become really minimal right you know what what are the earliest
things that or the simplest things that have these properties
and so what was cool about the sorting algorithms
is that a few things they're well known so people have been
you know computer science students have been studying these things for many
decades they're completely deterministic there there is no even
there's not even pseudo randomness there they're totally deterministic
they're completely transparent you can see all the code the nice thing about
that as opposed to biology is that if I say look here's a biological system
that's doing something new and unexpected someone could say
there's a mechanism for you just haven't found it yet it there's always in
biology there's always more details to be discovered right and you never know
that you've got it all and you probably will never have it all so
so but but with these things I can say no look here are the six lines of code
like there's nothing else there literally is no other place for anything to
hide that this is it and so then if you have something
like that it also has the interesting property that people think they
know how it works and and what it can do and this is showing up a lot in the
current AI debates because people it's not everybody of course there are other
people who disagree but but a lot of people are saying
well this is just linear algebra we know we made it we know how it works it
does you know and people have very strong feelings it can't this and it
doesn't that and you know it it there's no there's no way it has
whatever interesting thing they think they have as biological creatures
because they made it and I want to say that
even even these incredibly minimal things where we think we know exactly how
they work in these and and have very small
parts we don't know everything they're capable of there are major surprises
and that and that's what we found in this paper now I should I should also be
clear this is a preprint so it's not been peer reviewed
so so you know I always like to kind of point out that that's what we're talking
about and so can we go into some of the details
about what is the system that these algorithms are
inside of in the behavior that you see yeah so so the things that we're looking
for we're looking for the two two main things
number one we're looking for what I call basal intelligence which which I define
as the ability to solve problems and get to the same
outcome by different means this is William James's definition of
intelligence you know same goal by different means and in particular there
was one very particular thing that we looked for and found
which I call delayed gratification and it's the idea and in fact William James
talks about this imagine imagine two magnets
and you know they're trying to get together and you put a piece of wood
between them that's it right what the magnet is
never going to do is go around and the wood and get to where it wants to go
because because that would temporarily actually take it
further away from its goal right the energy the free energy would actually
rise as and they can't do that all they do is they go down the gradient
if you have an animal or certain kinds of self-driving vehicles or in
James's example Romeo and Juliet right facing all kinds of physical and
social barriers they have all kinds of tools to do this they understand delayed
gratification they know that temporarily you might have to go away from your
goal in order to reach it later and and so that's a kind of metric of
cognitive sophistication right but but the ability to do it at all is
already something so so one thing um one thing that we were looking for
is the ability to to do that kind of problem solving or delayed gratification
the second thing we were looking for is unexpected
unexpected goals and when I say goals I don't mean human level
metacognitive goals like I know what my goal is I don't mean that I mean very
simple cybernetic goals which are states that you
spend energy to try to achieve and if somebody sort of pulls you away from it
you'll you know you'll you'll you'll continue to try
to get there in some kind of way so those are those are the those are the two
things um that that we were looking for and so
so let's just go from the beginning what do these sorting algorithms do well the
idea is that you start with a with an array of numbers
these are random uh random numbers they're they're you know let's say from
one to a hundred you have a hundred numbers and they're shuffled they're all
all randomly distributed so the sort of the the job of the sorting algorithm is
uh we're going to crank through this algorithm we're going to we're going to
look at what the numbers and we're going to follow a very simple recipe
and by the end of it all of them are going to be in order that's all it's
going to do it's going to arrange the numbers in order it's a very short
algorithm now the main way that it works is uh there's a there's a centralized
kind of top-down mind that or in this case a computer
that knows the algorithm and is just sitting there rearranging the numbers
and there are many different sorting algorithms is bubble sort selection
sort whatever um we made we made two small
modifications to allow us to ask all of these interesting questions
and by the way what the the other thing we did is to
visualize that process as a walk in a navigation in a certain space in other
words a walk in sorting space so you start out over here and in
many potential configurations where all the numbers are shuffled
but everybody's got to get to one particular point which is when all the
numbers are in place and it's guaranteed these sorting algorithms are guaranteed
to eventually get you there right it might take a while depending on the
length of the stream but they all get there so they all sort of walk around
and and they get to this they get to this one spot
okay so and and that's that's what we're interested in in terms of intelligence
we're interested in ability to navigate uh in some kind of problem space so we
so we made two changes number one um so so we made this a little more
biological uh instead of having a top-down
controller that sees all the numbers and is following
one algorithm and doing its thing we made it distributed and bottom up meaning
that we gave each each uh each number we call them cells now in each cell
has a has associated with a certain number they all have their own tiny
little um agency and all they know how to do
is look around and they have preferences about their neighbors
so if you're a five what you would like to have is a four on your left and a six
on your right that that's it so instead of and and but but you're
going to follow that same algorithm so you've got you've got the algorithm
but now every single cell is following the algorithm it's not
top-down you know omniscient uh single um uh agent that's sorting them but
every cell has its own little little preferences right so that's very
biological because in biology you're dealing with an
agential material where every cell has local local knowledge local
preferences and so on um but we don't add anything new
so there's no memory we don't we don't give them all kinds of complex
all they have is that same original algorithm it's just they can't see the
whole string all they see is some some distance away all they see is local
so it's we haven't added anything we've just sort distributed it out
and uh and by the way the first amazing result of the paper is that that
actually works when when you do that you still get sorted numbers
so so if you break the if when when nobody nobody knows what all the
numbers are you can still get them sorted that's kind of cool
so so that kind of distributed source so that's that's the first thing um
then then we added something else which is very biological and is really the
key to testing this intelligence which is that
we stepped away from the notion of a of an infallible
algorithm in other words normally when you do the algorithm you assume that it
works in other words when i say swap the the the five and the seven
you assume that they in fact get swapped we introduce the notion of an
unreliable medium the algorithm might say you want to swap
but one of the cells could be broken it could be damaged maybe it can't be
moved maybe it can't initiate moves so so we introduce this notion of a frozen
cell now notice that in the traditional algorithm
there is no notion of hey did my did the operation succeed
how am i doing what what am i actually uh you know am i going in the right
direction the algorithm doesn't have any of that all it
has is a set of steps and you sort of blindly take those steps and that's it
so so you see this is a super minimal system uh initially you would look at
and you would say well there is no machinery here for
any of any of the things you want to find there's no machinery here for dealing
with broken cells there's no machinery here for delayed gratification
there's no sense of how am i doing or what path am i taking through that space
not none of that is there and that's why i i like this
system so much because it shows us that even um in scenarios where you you
think you know what's there and what it does you can you can be
significantly surprised so so here's what we found here here are our
surprises first of all we found that if if you do
introduce these broken cells which can't move and then you track the
progress of the sorting algorithm across the space
you find out that in fact what it does know how to do is delay gratification
it knows how to go backwards which means in this case
unsort the string a little and in order to have gains later on
that that's an amazing thing because that is not in the algorithm
if you look at the actual algorithm there's nothing in there like that
you don't see you don't see that so so that already starting to tell you that
that there are competencies that are not obvious from looking at the material
um so that's the that's the first first thing and then
um we were able to do something else because you know in the traditional
way of doing this there's one single algorithm that's sorting the whole
string right you're you're sort of god looking at it from the top down and
you're following selection sort or insertion sort or whatever it's going to
be and you're moving whatever you need to move around to get them
sorted in this case everything's bottom up every cell has its own
uh is following its own algorithm so we were able to do something something
very unusual which in fact we do in the biology too we made a chimera and that
is a mix of cells where some cells are following one algorithm but other
cells are following another algorithm and for example our our
frog a lotl is a chimera when you take cells from a frog embryo and you take
cells from an axolotl embryo they have different local rules that they're
going to follow because one's going to make a frog one's going to make an axolotl
but you can put them together in a single organism you can ask what happens
right so we did that here we we um we mixed two two algorithms in the same
string now the way you do it is you when that um
as you you assign them randomly so we have a bunch of random numbers
and each one gets a random assignment you're either you're either going to
follow selection sort or you're going to follow a bubble sort something like
that right and it's in its random it's mixed up you can think about that as
the genetic sort of right it's the thing that determines your policy of
action it determines what you're going to do and there's two different there's
two different kinds um again surprise the first the first kind of
interesting thing is that that works in other words you don't need to both have
the same uh journey through that space in order to get to where it's going
and so you can have a chimera string that still gets sorted even though half of
it's following one set of rules and half of it's following another
okay that's cool then we asked that we asked a really wild question which is
if you if you look at the string uh in the middle of the process
what's the distribution of the of the cells that are following the two
different algorithms like where do they hang out in the string
now now here's what we know we know that at the very beginning
it's going to be random so so let's define a notion of clustering which is
just this I look to my left I look to my right and I ask
what are the odds that the that the guy sitting next to me is using exactly
the same algorithm as I am we call it we we defined a new a new term um
Adam Goldstein came up with this he calls it an algotype like you have genotype
phenotype so algotype right and so and so okay so clustering is just I look to
my left I look to my right um what's the odds that my neighbor is the same
algotype as me we know that in the beginning it's 50
percent because they're random we assign them randomly
we also know that at the end it's also going to be 50 percent because at the
end everybody's got to be sorted according to their number
but the algotypes were assigned randomly they weren't assigned according to
number so that means if we really if we sort you on the number the
algotypes are going to be of course just like at the beginning it can be all
over the place they're going to be 50 50 what happens in the middle and this is
the amazing part what happens in the middle
is that what the curve so so 50 it's clamped at 50 50 but in the middle it
kind of goes like this so what happens is that in between the sorting process
cells with the same algotype like to hang out together they spend
a bunch of time in these clusters where we are all the same type of we're all
following the same procedure but then they inevitably get dragged apart
you know I sometimes joke that this is like a um it's a minimal model of the
human condition of you know for any living being
like for a period of time in your life you get to do some things that are
against the general trend of the physics of your world but eventually
you all end up in the same place right it's like this really minimal
minimal way you have you have a period of time where where you get to do some
things that you want but eventually the inevitable physics of your universe
sort of grinds you down right that's that's like a minimal
model of our of our existential state so uh what's what's amazing about it is
that again nowhere in the algorithm does it say
I know what algotype I am or how you find that out nowhere in the algorithm
does it talk about checking the algotype of your neighbors
none of that is there it's completely emergent and it's not just emergent
complexity the way that you know fractals are an emergent complexity the game of
life so you know automata emergent complexity
from very simple rules it's not just that it's what one step beyond that it's
actually um in the case of the um uh the the the delay
gratification it's it's emergent competencies and in the case of the
uh the clustering or hanging out together it's some sort of it's some sort
of emergent computational goal that you as the programmer did not put in there
this is a very simple system that has goals and competencies that you did not
put in there even though you wrote the algorithm the algorithm
is deterministic it's small and transparent and you know
this is I this is why I think it's significant because if
if that's the case in these little things when people say they think they know
what you know various AI architectures do or various um uh you know
collective uh swarm robotics or swarm you know various things like that
I mean I I think there are so many surprises
in store for us that we really need to develop a science of
guessing um guessing these kind of emerging goals and so this so the last
thing I want to say is that this takes us back to your point at the very beginning
that okay so what does this have to do with the various biobots
because much like with with these um with these algorithms
when when we make novel biologicals where the answer to
well what what are going to be its goals or well have a you know long history of
of selection with determinism well they don't have a long history of
selection they've never been here before these biobots
there was never a selection to be a good Zanibot or a good
Anthropod so how do you know what the goals are going to be where do they come
from right so that I think is the is the emergence of a new science of
figuring out the novel goals of systems where you cannot
say that evolution is what did it and that's I think that's going to be
really important for us as a species going forward
I love that we have this really straightforward experiment that's so
simplified available to be able to consider the larger implications and so
I want to spend a little bit more time really understanding
the dynamics that emerge from it and so when you say that
these algorithms in the midpoint cluster according to type
do you have a sense for why that is yeah um
why why is interesting because we have to think about what kind of answer
we're looking for so on the one hand and this is also true
in biology there's no magic here I'm not saying that these things are doing
anything that isn't allowed by the by the algorithm
if you were to track the data flow you would say well this is perfectly
consistent with the algorithm there's nothing to see here
which is exactly what some people do for biology they look at you and your brain
and they say well this is just chemistry this is just just electrons
moving around there's nothing there's nothing special here
right if you insist on the lowest level of description that is all that's all
you're ever going to see and that's it's not false it's just a very limiting
worldview on the other hand if you if you if you take
a step back and you ask yeah but knowing what you know about the
algorithm why why didn't you predict that that
was going to happen yeah and this is this is kind of my my
thing about a lot of biology is that after the fact after somebody has done
something interesting and shows you a new phenomenon you've never seen before
it's very easy to go back and look at the micro details and say
yep no miracles here therefore all good like we can explain it you know
yeah you can always track down the the steps that you took
but unless you had a theory that actually told you in advance that this was
going to happen in other words you know not not not just explanation looking
backwards but invention looking forwards then then
then you're missing something and so now so so what we're missing in this case
is a system that would have allowed us to say ahead of time
oh i know that's what your algorithm says but i can see what's going to happen
here these guys are going to want to travel together
right that's that's what we're that's what we're looking for and and do i have
that theory no although i will um i'll propose a
hypothesis which which we're going to test as soon
um the hypothesis is this uh based on uh kind of carl
friston's framework of surprise minimization um
chris fields and i had this had this paper a few years ago now
on why it is basically he calls it an imperial model of multi-cellularity
the idea goes like this why why would cells want to get together right
and and one way to think about this is that well if every cell
doesn't like to be surprised let's face it if you're a living thing and you're
constantly getting surprised you're not gonna last very long so so everything
is is trying to minimize minimize surprise well one of the least surprising
things out there is you so what might be nice is to
make some copies of yourself and put them around you to make a sort
of like stem cell niche kind of thing where the cells on the outside
are frontline infantry they're facing the uncertainty of the outside world
the cell on the inside is protected and has a very consistent environment
because everything it's dealing with is basically a copy of itself
so um that's our idea so that that was our idea and so
so uh following this firstonian paradigm what you really want are neighbors that
are predictable well how will they be predictable well they could be like you
if they're like you they're they're pretty predictable
so my gut feeling is that that's what's going on here i suspect
that this is a primitive version a very early version of surprise minimization
that the reason they're traveling together is uh because they're trying to
minimize joint free energy or some such thing i'm sure carl would would say it
much more much more elegantly but but i think that's probably what's going on
here they're they're traveling together for as long as they can
because it minimizes their uncertainty about their environment and again notice
that they don't have any explicit mechanism for this there's nothing in the
algorithm that says uh you know make a prediction
compare it to your war model that there's nothing in there it's it's it's
emergent although this is emergent and i think it's consistent with
carl and chris and and other people when they apply this active
inference framework to particles you know they apply it to things that do not
have explicit mechanisms and we knew this from a long time ago
when you do um some kind of a least action model and you say hey look this
beam of light gets to where it picks the path
where it loses the you know the least amount of of effort right
and you say yeah but how does that work it doesn't have any mechanisms inside to
compute all the paths and right it doesn't have explicit mechanisms for it
but i think this is what we're learning is that you don't need explicit
mechanisms to do some of this stuff that's and i think that's really important
well there's an aspect of with you know the path of least resistance for light
which i imagine has to do with like permissivity
which is that if you're traveling through a field where there's a bunch of
different potential paths one path will have
less resistance than a different path and so you fall and that that's
i've realized that you know physics doesn't necessarily have a material model
for light like it's field based but i think that there is probably
a material property of of the substances that it's traveling through
that that affects it like one atom will transmit light more easily than a
different atom and so when i think about the sorting algorithms
my first thought is algorithms take different amounts of time
to run right and so do you think that there's an
aspect of of time that is important here where you have
the information of a of one sorting algorithm is
more quickly accessible than the information of let's say another
and so they're running on different time scales and so at the beginning when
they're sorting they're sorting relative to
which neighbor has a an answer that matches the time scale of the cell
itself does that make sense yeah it does
yeah it's an interesting it's it's definitely an interesting point i mean
the thing just to go back and and i'm not a physicist so i don't want to get
like too deep into this and say something stupid but my understanding of
the what's cool about the least action business is that
you're right of course the different paths of different permissivities but
in order to pick the right path in some sense you have to try them all out
right you don't know that you're on the least path until unless you have some
information about all of them and and so and so that that kind of
non-locality i i think i think in in our case in the case
of the the algorithms there could well be a time component
because in order to know whether your neighbor
is like you or not you need to spend some time with them
so so one of the things we're doing now is tracking their life histories
to figure out things like well how much time do you need to spend next to
someone before you decide that hey they're like me or they're not like me
and i think that the active inference framework is going to make some
clear predictions about that you know in terms of and just just in general
Bayesian you know reasoning is going to just going to tell you like how many
experiences do you need to have with someone before you know
whether their policies are surprising to you or not right
again underlying the underlining the idea that
none of this is explicit these things don't have the the algorithms don't have
explicit code for doing any of that but we can track it from from you know from
observations so so stay tuned this is this is super super early
still but i do think it's interesting that
i'm gonna i'm gonna have a discussion with with carlin also mark solans about
this because you know it has this it to me
anyway and maybe they'll tell me this is nonsense but to me it has this weird
resonance with uh this idea of of conscious and unconscious drives
right we tell stories about why we did things and you sort of have this like
logical that's your algorithm those like i well i did it because xyz
but it turns out that actually there may be some underlying pattern that isn't
apparent to you at all and may or may not be apparent to somebody else who's a
different observer may you know maybe an analyst a psychoanalyst or whatever
who's looking and say yeah well you think that's what you did and in that local
you know in that situation that story kind of makes sense but look at the
bigger pattern if you look at the bigger pattern you find out that
actually you tend to x y c right and so i just wonder whether this is also a
really minimal model of how we understand implicit goals which are
there directly in whatever algorithm you're following
sorry those would be explicit goals and then and then there are some implicit
goals that you're following and i have no idea where those come from right and
that's i think that's about an exciting area for the futures to figure out
where they come from
i'm curious about the instrumentalization of this because it it seems well is
is that the goal of studying these systems is so that perhaps you can
program these bio bots eventually to towards some end and then if that is the
case is it ideal for the bio bots to be
intelligent like would you really want them choosing their own goals or making
decisions um perhaps it is but but it's it's a bit
hazy for me how that would be useful um yeah yeah that's a that's a great
point well the first let's just let's just start off here
uh if they if in fact they do have their own goals we would love to know about
that before we use them in some particular context right and this is
true with bots it's true with bacteria with CAR T cells with
um swarm robotics with the internet of things
with financial institutions with social structures if these things are going to
have goals beyond what we think of when we built them we need to know about it
right so whether you whether you want them to have goals or not they may or
may not so you need to know so it seems like the the on the spot
developments of goals right the changing of goals is i guess more what i was
concerned about you know if they decide well we had this goal before but now
now we've changed our minds so to speak yeah yeah second order right second
order goals you know choosing your own goals
again i i don't know that that uh and by the way i've made no claims that either
the answer either either the bots or the algorithms do that all we've done so far
is find some goals they have that we didn't know about we i've made no
claims that they have the second order ability to choose their goals
but if that's true we need to know right whether that's whether that's true
or not so that's that's the first step now why now let's answer the other
question why do you want them to have goals well
imagine um think of uh the the spectrum of of intelligence all the way from
very simple machines that do very specific things and there's sort of
you know whatever else happens they're just going to do the same thing over
again all the way through various cybernetic
creations that have goal directed abilities and then some animals that
can be trained and then some humans that can set their own goals to some extent
and so on um think about think about medicine you know
biomedicine uh where do our interventions fit on that scale
right now almost all of with with only a couple interesting examples
all of our interventions are way on the left side of that spectrum
they're extremely simple mechanical things matter drugs for example right
so typical drugs they just do what they do they're not context sensitive
if they're binding something they're going to bind it and that's it and
whether that's good for you or bad for you and this is why we're having
massive divergence of efficacy and side effects in people
because they just do what they do imagine if we could get beyond that and we
could have interventions that are higher agency interventions where you
could push some of the complexity onto the reagent
such that it would have some and so so now the obvious thing that people think
about here are like smart insulin pumps right they don't just sort of pump out
these you know they have a little bit of sensing and they kind of know what's
going on right so smart insulin pumps um
i think our example uh which i think we talked about last time
of hcn2 which is this ion channel that we use to
repair various birth defects that's a step in this direction because that
um that the drugs that open that channel
are they act in a context sensitive way that's what allows them to fix very
complex structures like brain face heart and gut it's
not because they do the same thing no matter what they're actually
trying to do a very particular thing which is to increase voltage depending
on what's going on in the environment increase
the difference in voltage the the sharpen the boundaries so that's
that's already a step up and um i think that
what what the opportunity here is with the for specifically with the
antherobots and we could talk about what they do and why
is we can take advantage of the various competencies of parts of
your own body in this case these are tracheal cells from the same
patient um to do complex things that we have no idea how to how to force in
medicine so we could take advantage of the
intelligence of your own cells to heal things and to do sensing in both
directions of the push meaning meaning to to to heal and to improve
and then to to read which is the the sensing side you know
these cells probably know more about each other than we even know
to ask questions about nevermind have sensors for and so i think having these
kind of reagents that actually do have a processing they have
you know signal detection amplification memory decision making
readouts all of these things that are part of a
a a simple cognitive system you you want your your medical
intervention to have that because then you can do things that
we couldn't possibly micromanage and the thing that we found the
antherobots could do which is just mind boggling to me
is that if you if you put them on a on a on a scratch that you've made in the
two-dimensional culture of neurons so you take human
pluripotent stem cell derived neurons you grow a lawn of them on a on a on a
petri dish you scratch you put a scratch through it that's
that's you know some people use that as a simple model of wound healing it's a
scratch scratch assay you put down these antherobots
and what they'll do is over a few days they'll they'll take the edges of that
wound and they'll knit the they'll knit the neurons together
now who knew who could have said that um the cells of your trachea which
normally sit there quietly for whatever 80 plus years that if you
that if you let them go and let them reboot their life
they can actually run around on their own and find neural
wounds to heal and who knows what else i mean that was just the first thing we
tried who knows what else what else they know how to do like that's
that's a competency of these cells that we had no idea about and again it's
that sort of thing where uh i'm sure somebody
reading that paper could say well uh there must be some pro you know pro
neural molecule that they're putting out and i'm sure we'll find it yeah no
sure of course there's going to be a physical explanation for it's not going
to be magic there's going to be there's going to be some after the fact there's
going to be some explanation for it which we are of course investigating
but how come no theory predicted that ahead of time how come we didn't know to
expect that that's what i think is much more interesting it's easy to tell
stories afterwards the question is you know uh
yeah how you know what what what models what models in world used you have to
get you to do the experiment in the first place
and so that being the first thing we tried like i don't think you know we
should be playing the lottery every day it's we're not the luckiest people in
the world i think what this is telling us is that they have
tons of unexpected capacities and we're going to be of course
looking for these is naming them bots ambitious
because it seems like you're you want to have control over their behavior that's
the way i think about robots anyways i'm not a robotic scientist or anything but
do you is that the ultimate goal is to tell them exactly what part of the
dish to go to or what which of the cuts to heal perhaps
something like that and and what what's the road to that
yeah um well first of all let's just talk about the terminology for a moment
yeah um it's it's certainly true that we could have just called them
organoids uh but but the thing with organoids is
that organoids are typically the perp so so here's what i think
words are for and nomenclature is for i think words
are um just protocols for for interacting with something
so so when you name something what you're doing is
uh facilitating or preventing ways to interact with it so if you call it a
if you call something an organoid what you're really saying is
i'm focused on making this as uh as as best of a model of the of the real
organ as possible i want it to be exact i'm going to screen
drugs on it i'm gonna you know study airway biology
i wanted to be a little model of a lung that's what i want
by calling it bot what i'm saying is yes all that and there are plenty of people
who have made airway organoids and and and so on
but actually there's much more here to to do because because you we can in fact
in the future program them and this this came up when we were doing the
xenobots people said why are you calling them
xenobots i mean developmental biologists who study amphibian embryos
have seen ciliated epithelium for decades we call them animal caps
these are just animal caps why why do you need a new word for and i couldn't
say it at the time because this stuff was was not published but
the point is yeah and if you call them animal caps you'll never make an
anthrabot because because why would you because if
because that's an amphibian specific embryonic thing why would you take an
adult human trachea that you wouldn't get there
and so words have real power they they they tell you how you're thinking about
something and they facilitate once you once you call them bots you say well
bots can be made out of a lot of things maybe it's not just a frog thing maybe
we could make this out of out of human cells right
and so they facilitate so that's what i'm interested in is terminology that
facilitates research programs and um and so and so yeah so the
future is definitely to program them in in various ways
much like with the xenobots you know the first three xenobot papers
were basically just studying the native properties of these things and so i mean
Doug did some super cool stuff about sculpting them and and and so on
but the thing is uh what what what i really want to do
is focus on surprising native capacities because if the first thing we did was
knock in a bunch of synthetic biology circuits
people would say ah well but you've engineered the heck out of them so yes
of course they do whatever you made them do and that's fine
i want to say we've we've in the in the case of the anthrabots we've done
almost nothing to them right we've so gizem came up with it with a
with a protocol to to get them to to grow from a single cell and then turn
inside out so that the cilia are on the outside surface and all that
but but we didn't do anything to make them heal uh neural wounds
they already do that and and that that i think is really valuable because yes
of course we'll get to programming them and this means giving them all sorts of
stimuli when they're assembling and it means putting in different cell types
perhaps and it means training them maybe so we haven't
we haven't shown that yet but we're working on that both with them and with
the xenobots uh can they be trained can they be
you know what native preferences do they have all that kind of stuff
that that will all come but but what i think is really critical much like with
the algorithms is to say we thought we knew what tracheal epithelium
does and we thought we knew what organoids are for and look there's a lot more
to it than that yeah that make that that clears it up a lot
it's interesting that in some sense that golf between doing what you want
and doing what they want is both dangerous and exciting
and it seems like there's a lot of crossover with the AI world because a
lot of people are very concerned with that valley between the two
now do you have conversations with AI engineers
about the similarities and what you're finding yeah yeah um yes and and there's
some uh there's some fun that twitter threads are about it too
and and we have you know about probably a quarter of my group is uh
computational machine learning experts so we certainly you know we certainly
think about that stuff a lot um yeah i i think i think the main limiting factor
in a lot of these discussions is that they take place in a vacuum that
neglects the wider context of diverse intelligence
i mean people people well first of all first of all this this this focus on
specifically language models and things like that
it that's like a tiny corner of what's actually coming right diverse
intelligence is going to be so much more challenging and
interesting than than than just what we have now and that's really important
i think a lot of people are not not i'm not getting it and also
you know a lot of people are saying things like
it's it's intelligent like us and therefore it's dangerous there are plenty
things that are incredibly dangerous that are not intelligent like us you
don't need to be super intelligent to be extremely dangerous
you don't need to be like us to be intelligent like there are all kinds of
leaps here that that people tend to make that i think are not warranted
but just um just in general like a real uh
understanding of the fact that intelligence
can be uh expressed in unfamiliar guises and some and some humility around
like how bad we really are at recognizing
other other forms of it you know besides what we're what we're used to
would be what i would be i think really useful and inessential i think it's an
existential need for us going forward if we're going to survive
with the antherobots and the xeno bots both
they're derived from organisms that have immune systems
and the action of cells migrating to a place where there is a wound
seems really immune like to me do you think that there is
a significant relationship between those two functions
where there is a certain drive inside the body to produce cells that will heal
that is encoded somehow in the substrate genetically
where it's like once you liberate a cell from its context
there's some sort of other deeper level programming which is like
okay my job now that i'm free since i'm not a cancer cell is to do the the
opposite of proliferate and is in fact to go into fix
yeah that's a very interesting hypothesis
i mean these are epithelial cells they're not specifically immune cells and
in the normally in the body they don't do any of that they just sit
quietly basically but but i like i like where you're going with this and i
think that one advantage that these things have over other
kinds of robotics that we might make or drugs or various other
things is that they probably share with us the
priors about what it's like to be healthy about what's good
about being a being because not only are they mammals not only are they human
but they're also your own cells so it's entirely plausible to me
now we haven't proven any of this i want to be super clear we don't know that
they home to wounds we don't know what they can recognize
you know we don't know any of that but it's very plausible to me that they
share with us this notion of what damages and what
repair is um yeah this this this may be you know this may
be something that that is really uh advantageous about this
technology you know is that you don't have to teach them what's good and bad
about being a multicellular organism and from from what i read of the
antherbot's paper the way that you're generating these cells is that you take
them you grow them in an extracellular matrix that's
three-dimensional from single cells and then you put them into
what you call it a low viscosity medium and in the low viscosity medium you
see these changes occur and
the changes are like you said pretty stark so you have these
these cells that normally would be ciliated
on the interior of the cells you turn them so that they're ciliated on the
outside and so all of a sudden you have this
motile collection of cells and
i wonder if you have looked to see what the actual changes are inside of the
cell that permits this kind of new organization
as a consequence of the different growth conditions
yeah um no we we don't know the details yet it's
the change is a multicellular in other words
it's not an individual cell that does much of anything it's the whole thing
turns itself inside out so you start with a ball where the cili are pointing
into the center of the ball and then then the whole thing just turns
inside out when when we wash it out of the out of the matrix it turns inside
out now what exactly does that we we don't know
my gut feeling is that there are going to be some pathways
that probably would look like embryonic gas
relation and some things like that i'm going to guess it's probably reusing
some of that stuff that's a total guess we don't know
yeah the answer is we don't know but embryonic gas relation to me
is a almost quasi stem cell property
where it's where stem cells probably the wrong the wrong word to use but
there's early development like early development like they aren't
differentiated to their context yet and so
do you think that it's just a property of cells that once you take them out
of the context of the body where they have grown used to being and now you
put them into this matrix where they have to
re-contextualize themselves that this is an opportunity for them to
to kind of redesign their own their own relationship to the environment
suddenly that's that is a yeah that's a great
point that what this is all currently under investigation
do they think they're recapitulating some kind of embryogenesis we don't know
so so the xenobots for example the normal xenobot
lives for about a week but we've been able to if you feed them and keep them
ridiculously clean they can go longer and they will go
i think our record is like 84 days or something
and during those weeks it changes shape it changes shape it becomes
transparent it it does some other stuff and
i don't know is that is that some new developmental sequence that
you know that normally no no one ever does
yeah we you know we we don't know and the same thing with the anthrobots
like like is this a is this a developmental sequence basically for
this it does it think it's an embryo we're gonna find out we're doing all the
you know we're characterizing all the new genes that they express both the
xenobot and the anthrobot side yeah we're gonna we're gonna find out but
we don't know yet there was a there was a science fiction story i want to
say it was carter clark but maybe not a long time ago where
um they cracked aging and so people started living
longer and what they found out was that at around 120
humans undergo all these changes it's just you've never seen it before because
nobody ever lived that long and so you know they start growing a third like a
new set of teeth and all this stuff and i think i think at the end
what i think they they grew wings and look like angels i forget what it was
but it was the point where yes actually there was this new developmental
stage it's just you know what you we had didn't access it before but
so so maybe this is like that maybe these these things have a new a new
developmental sequence that they can do i don't know
it seems like uh when i think about the major health crises
let's say the threats in most people's lives assuming they don't die from an
accident or something it's cancer and heart disease
and those are very different bioengineering projects
one where you're in the case of cancer perhaps trying to
teach cells how to behave themselves again something like that
i mean i suppose the approach right now is to just destroy them
but i i i suppose ultimately you would want your bots to be teachers
in a sense and perhaps it's similar with with cardio vascular disease as well
but that seems like more of a repair in the wound healing sense
uh perhaps a cleanup job is there some uh well do you think about this in
terms of the bots in terms of what their ultimate functionality will be in
terms of maybe not simply joining or or obeying some specific
program goal but in terms of teaching and interacting with their new
environments and re-instructing them and
what yeah what is the future of that look like in your mind
yeah i think that uh there's a there's a few there's a few different
use cases for the bots the most the most obvious
things are we're going to make useful synthetic living machines for specific
purposes so maybe they drop off pro regenerative
molecules maybe they clean up cancer cells maybe they
scrape the plaque off your artery walls maybe they they clean up arthritic knee
joints they repair you know retina or spinal cord
with like very specific things so so we'll be some of that
i i think bigger picture what both they and the zenobots
are are a kind of uh platform in which we get to learn to control morphogenesis
so so cracking the code the mapping between the experiences you received as
a cell and the pattern that a group of you are going to build
because if we solve that that's it that's a completely different path to
regenerative medicine that has nothing to do with the bots per se in other words
at some point we're going to know how to grow a new heart how to grow new limbs
how to grow new organs why you know and and and the stuff what we're working on
right now in the lab which is trying to understand why do they forget why do
tissues forget what the correct pattern is why does everything fall apart after
some number of decades right so so using the bots as a kind of sandbox
platform to understand how do collections of cells make decisions about what
they're going to do so that's kind of that's kind of the second thing and
then there's there's a more philosophical stuff but but but for
biomedicine right there are the direct use cases and then there's the bigger
picture of you know what we really want is complete control over growth and form
that's that's what we really do do you imagine that to be like an
in situ process at the end of the day or is it x vivo are you going to be growing
do you imagine these medical technicians I don't know how many years from now are
growing these externally and replacing diseased organs or is it more
something that's happening inside of the body like you're actually you know in
the sense reprogramming your body or giving it the external environment that
needs in order to regenerate itself it seems like two very different approaches
yeah I think I think long term it's all going to be in situ and
in in the meantime are we going to crack the x vivo morphogenesis and
transplant before we crack the in vivo stuff I'm not sure I'm not sure down the
line it's it's it's all going to be it's all going to be in vivo but maybe maybe
maybe the the bioengineered organs will get cracked first I'm not sure
that seems to be the more traditional approach as far as I can tell
you know we are we're already doing organ transplants with varying levels of success
obviously the huge advantage here is just that you have ideally your own cells right or
something that matches and you don't have the horrible immune problems with the transplantation
yeah I mean the so you could argue both ways on the one hand you could say well
just just growing a specific or a single specific organ should be easier and then we'll just
pop it in maybe but but look at look at for example the case so so back in 2010 or so
we show that there's a particular um bioelectric pattern that causes frog embryos to make new
eyes in weird locations when your eyes on the gut on the tail whatever um we are nowhere near
being able to bioengineer and grow an eye in in vitro right I mean so so so people have shown
like if you explant the eye progenitor cells and you sort of leave them alone they can make an
optic cup and some things like that but but it's not that it's not that we knew how to how to
engineer an eye eyes are very complex they have lots of different tissue types what we simply did
was to take advantage of the competency of the material meaning the cells of the in in vivo
they they they know how to make an eye they've already done it twice they they certainly have
all that information what you need to be able to do is convince them to do it again somewhere else
and so if you look at this problem as can I micromanage the cells to be an organ you know
using traditional bioengineering maybe we make a bladder maybe we make you know ears are not hard
we can make things where we can make a scaffold we see a bunch of cells on tops this may maybe
3d print some things um maybe you know you might think that's the way to go but I actually think
the easier way to do it is not to try to control any of that it's to convince the collective what
you want them to build and just do that in vivo where the surrounding material is is basically
much smarter than we are about how it's done so I'm not sure I we'll see how we will see how it goes
there's a really interesting aspect of this where if you can reprogram an embryo to grow eyes
in places where you wouldn't expect eyes
okay so there's two places where my mind immediately goes number one
there's a certain permissivity of the embryo where the entire context of the being is that okay
we are in the process we are we are we are creating the structure we get instructions we make it
and then we get to a place where we cease our differentiation and the structures are more or
less fixed and they get repaired in place and so one question and you can you can go either way
with this is a do you think that once the structures are fixed you have a completely different problem
where you would then have to inflict some kind of damage in order to get them to regenerate
and number two which is kind of orthogonal is the eyes that form in places where you don't expect
are they then wired into the brain in the way that you would expect
yeah let me let me do the first one and then remind me of the second one because I'll
forget by the time I'm done the first thing I want to say which is which is kind of a cool
point it has to do with the permissivity or the competency so and and this is something that
one of these things that I couldn't you know say back in 2010 but now now that we're talking about
development as a uh as a collective intelligence process now we can start to think about it this
way uh if you look in the developmental biology textbook they will tell you that only in the
frog only the anterior norectoderm so the stuff you know basically from here up is competent to be
I and it's that's the only stuff that can make I and the reason is because if you prompt it with
what they call the master I gene which is this thing called pack six then yeah that those are
the only regions that ever make I but it turns out that uh actually that that that limited
competency and and developmental biology competency is a narrow definition which is what
what it's able to make I use it more broadly but more generically the competency of your material
is opaque to you unless you probe it with the correct prompt we we need to and this is you
know when people say oh we can't do this you know this this doesn't do that whenever you're
making an assessment and an assessment of intelligence in some system you are basically
taking an IQ test yourself as an external observer you are saying this is what I have
noticed how to make it do that doesn't mean that's all it knows how to do that's just what you know
so so in this is a great case for that because actually it turns out that if you go to the
bioelectric level no I have almost any cell in as far as we can tell any region in the in the
tadpole is a is competent to do this we just didn't know that because we were using the wrong prompt
and so and so this should all of this everything we've talked about should really
fill us with with with significant um humility about about what we know about the material
that we're working with you you don't necessarily know if you know I've I don't know if you've
ever seen these things I've got pictures of them um on my blog and and a couple of papers um these
these plant galls you know these amazing just about to ask about that because they create these
insane structures prompted by the presence of like wasps and bugs that move inside the leaves
yeah and and if you didn't know that if you didn't have that example you would never in a million
years say that the that the oak genome could make this red spiky round thing you would say no it
makes a flat green leaf and and it takes a living bioengineer who as Dan then it would say you know
competency without comprehension is able to to prompt the leaf to do this crazy to build
this crazy thing you would never know it knows how to do that so um that's uh you know that that's
the important thing is that we really need to understand the competency of our material
and what what we're working with and I actually don't think that adulthood is when all of that
ceases there's um there's a there's a ship a thesis thing going on here which is that in a
standard body right cells and materials are coming and going all the time and you need to be able to
it's this thing like uh like like like in Alice in Wonderland where you uh you have to work really
hard to stay in one place you in order to maintain a body you can't just say well okay now I don't
need this information I you know I'm just gonna hang out you will not last very long and and I
think there probably are insects in other organisms that that you know that live a day or a couple of
days where that's where that's true but typically if you want to persist you have to continuously
re repair remodel replace and and and so on and um so so I think uh the only thing that happens
during uh during maturation is that the scale of those projects gets smaller so instead of
re shaping the whole embryo during neuralation and gastrulation all that you're now saying okay well
these few cells are gone how do I maintain the integrity of my epithelium and things like that
right so but but I think I think that process of of homeostasis anatomical homeostasis which
which I am really into is uh continues your your whole life and and without that process uh
in fact that's what I think aging is is a is a defect in that process it's just it's basically a
you know I think I think aging is a version of failure to regenerate it's a way which and
development is basically just the sort of regenerative repairs from each embryonic
stage to the next stage I think all of this boils down to regenerative remodeling which
boils down to homeostasis humans can't really grow gauze though sorry say again I said humans
can't really grow gauze though which is we don't know that we don't know that you know sure sure
I guess I guess the only thing that I'm saying is that if I think about the various human diseases
right because if if there's a parallel between okay oak gall would you say that that's a disease
no no I don't think no I don't think it's a disease I think it's a
no no there are there are virus induced galls that that screw up cells and so on so and those
those are basically featureless lumps they're kind of like a tumor but maybe you can say that's a
disease a standard one of these galls I mean from the perspective of the plant it might be a disease
but I think it's morphogenetic hacking I think I think all you've done is you're with the what
the wasp has done is to hack the material to go to undertake a different journey in morpheus space
and I don't think that's I don't think that's it that that that's a disease do we have any sense of
what the different morphological purpose is like why does one wasp make one gall another wasp make
another call I do not know there are people who study this so so insect ecologists and and such
there are a couple of folks that I'm in touch with that study that kind of stuff I don't know
for me the interesting thing is the space of the possible and how little so so if you think about
this giant multi-dimensional anatomical morpheus space which holds all the different shapes that
things can be normal standard reliable development gives you one point this tiny little keyhole
into that space and all you see is the embryo and the normal thing that it builds and then if
sometimes you have what they call developmental plasticity and look this plant can have two
different shapes depending on if it's a dry environment or a wet okay so so instead of a
single point you see kind of like a little little halo or up through your keyhole but through that
keyhole is a giant space of possibilities that we are still very bad at mapping out and what I think
these uh all the synthetic stuff that anthro bots the xenobots other other things that people the
goo galls other things that people build are all vehicles for exploring that space they let you
they let you take that little keyhole and like like stick your head in and look around like a like a
periscope and and look around and say here are the other possibilities you know and and what human
cells can do uh well we didn't think they made anthro bots until you know we did it a few years
ago so I don't know my guess is I so so so the way to um uh kind of uh uh just just drill down on
on that question is uh are there any limits so people ask is there any limit to what a given
cell can build and some people say yeah they're called developmental constraints there are things
that I'm not sure I believe in developmental constraints I I think that in a given context
there are limits to what it's going to do does that mean that if you knew what you were doing
you couldn't prompt it to do something completely different no I I think um and and again this is
conjecture on my part but here's here's here's what I think um that basically there are going to
be like like for example if you have planaria if planaria don't have genes to make bone you know
app the the the hard minerals and all that okay you're not you're not going to get them to to
you know to to to make bone because if the if the if the hardware isn't there it isn't there
but beyond that in terms of shape I'm not sure there are any limits I don't I just I you know I
think in the end um except for materials limits and the laws of physics I don't believe there's
going to be any limitations on what shape you could build I guess this ties back to the question of
whether or not the eyes are tied into the brain right because if you have a crazy body plan and
all of a sudden your like elementary canal is all screwed up and you're just dumping waste
into your internal cavity you're going to have a bad time yeah so uh yeah um I'm glad you remember
that um okay I'm I'm not going to say that there aren't ways to screw things up because
absolutely there are and uh the competency of regulative development that fixes all these
problems is not infinite then there's many ways to screw up an embryo for sure for sure but
this is some work that um Doug Blackiston in my group did same same person who did all the
the xenobot biology um by the way if you can get him on you'll have a great time uh
he's he's amazing but anyway back back in the yeah around 2013 2014 something like that we uh
we we did some experiments where what we did was we we we grew ectopic eyes on the backs and the
tails of tadpoles and we asked that question can I see out of these eyes what happens when
you have this new architecture is it is it functional um the the answer is super interesting
first of all it turns out that yeah they can see we we we actually built a machine that um trains
them on on visual cues and and and and we made tadpoles that did not have primary eyes but they
had this you know this one eye on its tail yeah they can learn in visual a visual assay so they
can absolutely see the next question is you know you said does it connect to the brain well it
doesn't connect to the brain actually it connects to either the spinal cord or in some cases nothing
obvious that we can figure out and they can see anyway so so not only is it um plastic in terms of
making the right uh the right organs in the right structure excuse me but actually um
even even the wiring is uh is up for uh is is you know is is up for change and you know just imagine
like you you you come into this world and you have this weird itchy patch of tissue on your back
like how do you even know that's visual data you know but the brain is able to is able to use it
and um and and i'll tell you two two two fun fun things about that one is that um we we then uh
let some of those okay so imagine you got an eye on the tail you let that animal grow eventually
that tadpole is going to turn into a frog well the tail has to disappear and what happens is
normally the tail gets the signals it it degrades it the you know basically um apoptosis uh you
know it eats itself and so on and then the tail disappears so we had a pool going in the lab about
well what's going to happen to the eye right and uh because the whole tail is going to die
what what about the eye does the eye think it's part of the tail does it so so this was this was
super cool and we watched this thing and uh i'm not sure if we publish i don't remember if we
published it but i i got these amazing pictures of um frogs with eyes on their butts because what
happens is the tail gets smaller and smaller the eye gets bigger and bigger and the eye of it just
rides it back and eventually just ends up sitting on the butt of the frog the tail is long gone that
eye is is is perfectly clear that it's not part of the tail and it's not going to you know degrade
the way the tail will and we don't know if it's functional on the adult frog because we don't
really have a good um behavioral method for adult frogs the way we had for tadpole so i don't
know if the adult frog can see backwards we don't know but um but but yeah the tail the the eye
survived the death of the tail and so just just more broadly you might think about why i mean why
is the frog why is the tadpole ready for this for for eyes to be formed like that doesn't happen in
nature why would ever and why would evolution do that and i think the lesson that uh i think we
not not just from this work but from from a lot of work is this evolution i don't think makes
solutions to specific problems but i think evolution does is make problem solving machines
and part of that is the um and and i i got a paper from a few months ago um where i beat this uh
you know in in significant detail this this idea that because because evolution is working
with an agential material it naturally makes systems that um that that can solve these problems
and and here's one of my favorite examples of of of this kind of thing is um this was found back
in the 40s that if you if you have a salamander and um what you can do is in in uh for the very
early embryos you can you can do this procedure which causes them to multiply their genetic
material so instead of two n you can have four n five n six n and so on so the first amazing thing
if you do that you still get a normal salamander so that's why it like extra genetic material
doesn't seem to confuse it that that's already kind of cool the next thing that happens is that
the cells get bigger in order to accommodate all that all the copies of the genome but the
salamander sees exactly the same size so that means that as your cells get bigger you need to
know to use fewer of them to build the same the exact same organs and so what what he did was
he took um um this was uh frank hauser and he took cross sections of this tubule that it's a kidney
tubule and he takes cross sections of it and he shows that in a normal uh animal there's like
eight to ten cells that go around and they sort of make this tubule and the middle is a big empty
space and then and then you make these cells big and now there's fewer of them there's like four or
five of them going around so that's amazing thing number two is that if uh if your cells are the
wrong size you know to adapt their numbers so that you can have the same overall structure
here's the real kicker if you make the cells gigantic and i believe these were maybe like
five n or six n nudes or something like that the cells are so big only one of them fits and so what
does the cell do it bends around itself like this leaving a hole in the middle to make the
exact same tubule now the reason that's super cool is that that's a different molecular mechanism
in the former case you have cell-to-cell communication tubuleogenesis blah blah blah
in this case you have cytoskeletal bending so so this is top-down causation this is crazy this is
calling up different new a different molecular mechanisms to achieve the same high-level anatomical
goal right that that's i mean if that's not intelligence i don't know if we had if we had
any kind of a a machine that could do this i mean this would be super amazing intelligence
because you're faced with a problem you've not seen before you can you can call up different
resources of yours to get to get the job the same job done if you're prevented from and and now think
of think of the amazing thing that this that this embryo has to has to deal with i'm going
to come into the world i don't know how many copies of my genetic material i'm going to have
i don't know the size of my cells i don't know the number of my cells i don't know if somebody's
going to cut me in half uh early on i have to be able to make a salamander despite all of this
changes in the environment changes in my own parts for god's sake right like i don't i can't
even depend on my own components i i don't know what what dna i'm gonna have but but i'm gonna
make this salamand right and and so and so i think that is what evolution gives us it gives us in
for many species not not all i'm not sure c elegans does any of that but but for for many
species what evolution has given you is this amazing problem solving machine that does not
make too many assumptions about what the world is going to be like now you now you would think that
that's what evolution is for is to is to is to progressively over time extract information
about the environment and make sure that whatever you're born in you've got the benefit of all those
prior generations but in machine learning you've got this notion of overfitting you know overtraining
on your examples you don't want to just memorize your training data set you want to uh you want to
be smarter than that and i think um absolutely uh development is smarter than that i don't think
development over trains on on on these priors i think it learns a lesson of how to solve these
problems and i think really every life multicellular probably all but but certainly the multicellular
life is um is is is born into the world solving problems i don't think you don't know what you
have until you sort of take stuff and this is why you can take an early embryo and cut it into pieces
and have multiple twins instead of you know half embryos and and so on yeah i know that
Shaila has a bunch of stuff uh do you want to do you want to pick up on the on the idea of
the platonic salamander form that remains even with five n i mean i have some more like divergent
philosophical questions about this regenerative medicine that i can hang out if you've got if
you want to keep pulling on this thread i mean the let's let's stay here for a little bit because
i think the regenerative medicine is what this all kind of centers around right because we want
to be able to see if as as much as i don't like the idea of science being an instrumentalizable
process where there's there's discovery simply for the sake of discovery we we all live within a
system where the discoveries at some point need to be instrumentalized onto something in order to
get people to really see the point of it and to really get people viscerally invested in it and
so i think that that's that might be a good place to end but where do you think the platonic form of
this salamander comes from the idea that you can take this embryo and you can screw with it you
can change the genetic organization you can make the cells enormous so that it goes from
cell cell signaling to create a kidney tubule to just one cell that wraps around it like what is
that yeah boy uh yeah um that that is the uh the hard question isn't it um i mean i should say
from the beginning that uh i don't know but um i think we definitely start with that but um we
can we can say a few things about it um one one thing is that uh there there are um there are a
lot of what what physicists would call free lunches in this kind of scenario in the following in the
following way imagine imagine that um you're you're running evolution in a particular world where the
most fit um the thing is a particular kind of triangle yeah it's it's it's a certain kind of
triangle so here comes evolution and it does a bunch of generations and it nails down the first
angle and it optimizes the first angle and then a bunch more generations and it optimizes the
second angle now it's done it doesn't have to look for the third angle because we already know that
once you know two angles in flat space you know what the third angle is supposed to be uh isn't
that amazing isn't it it where did that come from it's certainly not in the genome uh it's a free
gift from the laws of geometry physics i don't know but but it's it's super practical because
whereas one can think you know the old this this whole idea this this platonic Pythagorean idea
of of these um these information structures that hang out somewhere else not in the physical world
then when you make specific physical embodiments for them then you get to to to to interface with
them you know when you have a fulcrum you get to have um you know our committees uh so simple
machines and things like that um it it it all sounds initially it all sounds very um philosophical
and the bad in the in the pejorative sense it's like why we need any of that but you know it's
it's all you're just adding crazy you know crazy stuff onto our ontology you don't need it but when
you're saving 33 of evolutionary time now this is quite practical now this is this is you really
have to ask where does this where do these things come from and there are tons of these
throughout mathematics or you know think of all the truths of number theory uh all of the you know
the distribution of primes all this other stuff where where where where do those things hang out
presumably all the all the physical structures at the beginning of the big bang that set all the
you know the the forces the relative strengths of the forces all that all that stuff could have
been completely different and still the truths of number theory are what they are and so i'm
partial to this idea that there is a platonic realm of some sort um that it does contain a
bunch of free lunches that evolution is really good at searching it that i i don't think that
what evolution is doing is searching the really hard space of microstates on on the on the on the
outcome i think that what it's really basically searching for is and this is this is a bad analogy
but we don't have better ones yet it's searching the space of pointers into this platonic space
it's searching for ways to capitalize on these free lunches this idea that i mean there's there's
so many of these like i can imagine if you if you have a when you um evolve a voltage gated
ion channel what you really have is a voltage gated current conductance you have a transistor
and if you have a couple of those you can make a logic gate and when you have a logic gate you
have a truth table you have the basis of rational thought you have a truth table and you have the
fact that nand gates so not and gates are actually quite special compared to all the other gates
so where is all that stuff all you did was make a voltage gated ion channel where'd you get all
that stuff from you you didn't need to evolve a truth table you didn't need to nail down all the
components you get all of that for free and so so so i see everything we're doing as a research
program in which we develop tools to map out that space what else is out there because because again
you have to ask yourself what what what is this crazy world you do for you well i think what it
does for you is it sensitizes you to look for things that you didn't expect things that you
didn't bake in it helps you think about making tools to explore that right um and uh i think that the
way that you know if you look at um somebody made this thing called the map of mathematics and it's
just like this literally this map and you get different areas of math and how they relate to
each other i i think i think platonic space has a structure to it i think there are all kinds of
interesting things there from from from geometry and the things we call geometry and algebra and
and you know computation and so on and evolution is really good at capitalizing on some of that stuff
and so so so what else so so to get back to your question does does the form of the salamander
hang out there maybe but also form and function of the antherobots and zenobots and who and
Gauls and who knows what the heck else is there um and i think i think that structure is um rich i
don't think it's flat and homogenous in the for example when we when we studied the behavior
in the shape of these uh of the antherobots we didn't just see a continuum of here's every possible
thing it came in in in in morphotypes it came in in in chunks like this there's this kind there's
that kind there's this kind and so yeah i think i think this the the space has structure and i think
we need to and so i'm i'm also working on and this this you know we'll take a little bit and we
can maybe talk about it at some future time because i don't have it all worked out but i think there's
even there's even an interesting uh thing where like under under my understanding of this of the
standard um kind of view of this this platonic space thing is that the contents are supposed to be
eternal and unchanging right it's sort of fixed there aren't they just to hang out and they are
what they are and like that's it so so i'm not sure that's true i think i think we can start to develop
a um a kind of chemistry of it that ways in which these things actually are active in some sense
distinct from the the way they actually manifest here and i think there are useful
i think there are useful models of that that we can that we can develop to say
how do those things combine and uh and change and how does that impact which ones and how
we are able to implement in in you know in engineering and biology and so on i wonder to
what extent those forms are stored in the external environment too like when you were talking about
the nephron tubule things i was thinking i wonder how much the hydrostatic pressures and so forth
are sculpting the cell into the form that it takes and how much of the salamander is a product of
forcing by the world the entire i mean i hate to say the entire universe but essentially
everything collaborating to make the salamander yeah yeah yeah it's well for sure for sure the
context of those cells matters right and and it's entirely possible that in order to explain
what's going on we need to consider inputs from the biophysical environment from the energetics
and from the from all kinds of stuff i'm sure i'm sure that's true um the question is is and
this isn't this is an open question is there a more informative meaning a more um a model that
leads to better in invention where what you're talking about is ways in which those parameters
index into a pre-existing space of options versus some other i mean frankly i don't know what the
what the what the you know competing model would be but but some some way of just um
you know sort of calculating locally all the forces and and and things like that which i'm
sure can be done the question is does it help you find the next thing you know
there's a really interesting limit to the kinds of synthetic organisms that can be produced and
the routes to them like i know that craig vent craig ventner was working on you know what is the
minimal cell that can be produced and the way that they arrived at it was not from bottom up
production it was they took a cell and they continuously deleted portions of it until they
got to some minimum component and the minimum component was some i think it was like 350
protein coding genes and if you look at the papers they're pretty wonky looking cells like
they're not really super functional anymore and there's a there's a there's a limit there that
i think is breachable with a different kind of design right because none of that nurse work was
about this idea of okay environment forcing parameters what can we take to produce a cell
that rises from a different environment and matures into something new and with a salamander i like
you could probably produce a different kind of salamander with a different kind of body plan
with different organs but like do you think that without genetic modification you could
do something that's like a bird probably not right well i'll tell you what what we have done
in planarium so so so two examples and again on the on the on the bird thing how about those
galls like there's no genetic modification there right like we would have again the
looking backwards somebody's going to say oh yeah i can see how this particular growth factor is
this and that right so you got flat leaf and you got gall great but the bigger issue here you would
have not known that there's a gall you don't know what the next gall is capable of like right so
there's more to it um here's here's what we did in planaria first of all we made two-headed
planaria by uh altering the bioelectric pattern we talked about this last time uh there's no genetic
modification there they're permanently two-headed so that's something it's not another species
it's definitely different than the original species so it's something also we've shown
that you can actually make planaria with heads that belong to other species so about other species
about 100 to 150 million years evolutionary distance so again no no genetic modification
now can you go can you go further and you can you know can you make it look like a bird you're
not going to get bone i don't think but could you could you get patterns that look like other
animals i bet you could if you've ever seen um uh there's another thing that's uh that that speaks
to this those uh i forgot i forget i forget what the name of the the fly it's it's a little fly
and on its wings it has a picture of ants and it's right you know what i'm talking about so so yeah
so so there you're what it's doing is running a stripped down like low resolution two-dimensional
and morphogenesis program on its on its wings and so i think the the reprogrammability in the
virtualization is massive i think we've not scratched the surface of it so so you know could
i tell you what the limits of that are or whether there are limits no i don't know
but i would i would bet large amounts of money that the the uh the narrow view that we have now
of the mapping between genome and anatomy is way too narrow for reality
so one of the things that comes up a lot when i when i discuss your work with people who maybe
aren't scientists or aren't really thinking deeply about these questions is okay great we'll be able
to regenerate our organs maybe we'll live for a very long time but the brain or the mind starts
to become an issue at some point and there's something about the mind that's very different
from a kidney in that it seems to be that the cells the functionality of the brain let's say
i know that the mind is sort of delocalized but let's say the nerve central nervous system or
whatever you want to call it the thinking machine of the body those cells patterning depends on
their experience and so if you had a disease of the brain like a brain tumor or something
in terms of treating damage to the brain or regenerating the brain is it conceivable
that we'll be able to in some sense pattern these experiences without having gone through
the entire path of the life in order to have those connections it just seems like kind of
the the expert level regenerative medicine would be this very dynamic architecture this
this web like network which it just depends on on a past almost in a way that perhaps a
kidney doesn't is that something you've given any thought to yeah yeah yeah we yeah i think
about this a lot um a few a few things um first of all uh your brain is different from the kidney
but i don't think it's because the kidney doesn't think i i do you know i like right now you my
left hemisphere is having a chat with your left hemisphere and and we we're sort of pretty proud
of ourselves for having language and stuff but um there are plenty of other uh systems in the body
that solve problems that navigate physiological and other spaces and and we we just don't sense them
anymore than we sense each other's consciousness so i'm actually not sure it's it's special in that
way but um to address your other point about how do we how do we deal with long-term memories um
i'll give you i'll give you the kind of bummer idea and then the positive idea after that uh the
bummer idea is is is this i i don't know let's let's imagine and this this goes back to like the
traditional view of of heaven right like this idea of eternal let's say let's say you're you're you live
unlimited amounts of time it's aside from any issues of regeneration or damage or anything
like that it isn't obvious to me that any cognitive system can stay sane for an unlimited amount of
time like i'm pretty sure i could keep myself busy for 10 000 years probably but like 10 million
years i i don't know you know a while and would you be able to integrate your experiences from
10 000 years ago at some point it's like i wonder if we just start pasting i feel like i pasted over
my experiences at some point you know i replaced them with new experiences there's obviously the
cognitive psychological modeling where we're constantly rehearsing our memories as we go
and it's not clear that you would even have access to your experience at some range and that would
maybe that's what you mean by going insane is you just lose track of who you are i'm worried
about more than that actually in that in that case um so so so it's entirely possible and for
example i'm i'm pretty sure that uh you know most of my memories past a few years ago are pasted to
a certain degree in the sense that if somebody said oh no you got that all wrong this this is
how it really went down and we have video i'd be like all right i suppose that's it like fine
you know like i i don't know that my memories really go like you know that i would really
trust go back very far at all anyway so so that's fine maybe that would just keep happening
and i think that some creatures like could could a dog stay perfectly sane and happy on a farm with
rabbits to chase and all that good stuff for like a billion years like maybe right maybe every day
would be as joyous as every other day and it would all be super cool like maybe that's fine
could a human do that i'm not sure i'm just not sure i don't know um but uh but let's let's let's
let's talk about the more the more realistic case um i think i think it's actually a lot a lot more
hopeful than than it sounds for the following reason uh the work on plenaria and this was uh
first discovered by mcconnell in the 60s and 70s and then we replicated the important parts of it
in 2013 ourselves um they you can train them and you can cut off their entire head brain and all
and the tail will sit there doing nothing over the next eight days it regenerates a new brain
and now they remember the original information assuming and when we have to say it's an assumption
i don't know what the alternative is but let's let's assume that it's stored elsewhere in the body
what that shows is that you can actually imprint information onto a new developing brain
because until then they do nothing it's only once the brain is there that you see the behavior
the wherever the information was maybe it was neural maybe it wasn't maybe it's holographic
throughout you know there's an amazing book called shuffle brain um about salamanders by
this guy paul peach and uh incredible and and he talks about this holographic theory of memory
but maybe it's all over the body who knows uh it's imprinted on the new brain now i'm not saying
we're exactly like plenaria but they're telling us that it's possible they're telling us that it's
possible to uh imprint learned information onto new brain tissue um i actually don't believe
that memories are encoded by the specific micro um the architecture of your synapses
that that story there are increases that story is increasingly sort of cracking at this point
and um whatever it is i i have a feeling that if if we do regeneration correctly uh the memories
will regenerate now that's now now so i think i think that part is optimistic the part we have to
keep keep track of is that in an important way i think we are all like plenaria in that we don't
have access to our past what we have access to are the engrams that the past has left in our
brains and bodies and at any given moment and i don't know the thickness of that moment for for
each of us but at any given moment all we're doing is reconstructing a plausible story based on those
engrams about what happened before and we all know it's fallible and it's you know we and every
time we do it we sort of alter the thing you were just talking about we're all doing that anyway
all the time like we are basically like people say oh my god these plenaria are amazing yeah we
we're pretty much all doing that you know all the time i think so so given that that that that the
core self is a process it's a continuous homeodynamic process it's a reconstruction that's not a
physical structure that kind of sits there and you might lose it and then what happens
i think we're fine i i think we're going to if when we get to the point of being able to
regenerate brain tissue i think we're going to be fine and and and i want to also put in a couple
of other a couple of other pointers to some stuff first of all and i have a student carina with whom
we are writing a review of the of of all the mismatches between brain state and and and cognitive
state but you know there are these cases of well there are many cases many different kinds of cases
but i'll just talk about one which is these these specific specific cases of of hydrocephaly
where somebody's someone is born with a fluid very high fluid pressure in their in their in
their skull and that prevents the brain from developing and so you know this guy Lorber in
the 80s documented some guy that had less than a third the the the brain volume of a chimpanzee
and he was doing a master's program in math and he had above normal IQ and like he wouldn't know
he would you know he would introduce himself and meet people he would take a flashlight and
shine it in one ear and it would sort of you know like pink light would come up the other end
and and he was completely fine and so um so so i think i think our mapping of information to to um
brain uh medium is we don't understand how it works we have we have no idea and um and and
there are many other clinical cases uh that underscore that underscore this idea so so so yeah
so i think uh i i think it's going to be fine i think i think it's much more um robust and you
can think about think about the um the caterpillar butterfly thing right like not only so so so
caterpillars basically destroy their brain they break up most of the connections but
when you do these experiments this is against some of Doug Blackiston's old work when you
check the moth or butterfly they remember the original information that you train the caterpillar
on not only do they remember but they actually generalize across that process because if you
train them to eat a particular kind of leaf on a particular color background the the moth or
butterfly will go feed the same way but they don't eat leaves they drink nectar and so you're not
remembering that leaves you know this particular color means leaves which you're remembering is food
so you're actually smart enough to generalize the category to a complete one when i'm a completely
different kind of being that doesn't care about leaves at all whereas before that's all i wanted
but now i don't care about leaves at all i i'm still going to generalize and i still know what i want
so right this is amazing during like there's so much plasticity here i think we're going to be fine
this makes me think of the reports that i've read of people who have organ transplants
and appear to manifest the characteristics of the people that they get a heart transplant or a
lung transplant from yeah yeah we wanted to cover it in that review there's not enough clinical
well documented clinical cases but you're right and i've talked to i've talked to transplant
surgeons about this kind of stuff interestingly enough kidney donors liver donors they don't talk
about that stuff it's heart lung i don't know why um but you know again the numbers are small so
not sure what you know the really egregious cases are are you know there's not that many documented
but yeah yeah there's there's something going on here and we have we have a bunch of unpublished
data generated by Johanna Bischoff in our group where we transplanted little pieces of two-headed
planaria into one-headed planaria and some percentage of them if you recut them again they
convert to two-headed and so so this idea of transplanting information be it morphogenetic
information or be it behavioral information i don't make that much distinction between them i think
they're the same process um it moves it moves with tissue and it spreads when you put the
little implant in it actually spreads across that information not the cells the information
spreads across the host so ultimately you know you know mcconnell joked at the time as it was
67 68 he joked about the concept of professor burgers this idea that you could actually in you
know uh get somebody else's knowledge by eating you know pieces of flesh made made from their
body uh i don't know right like we know nobody's shown that you know you can learn calculus and
then pass that along in a in a burger but some kind of information maybe and if we knew what the
proper encoding and decoding was i think there would be all sorts of interesting new routes
for for memories this is i mean a dysfunctional example but prions seem like they're
the transfer of information without any kind of organ or genetic relationship yep yep i agree um
yeah i think yeah prions are a kind of non-genetic inheritance glansman shows RNA
so he trains these aplasia and he and he takes you know extracts RNA and injects it into a new
animal and they and they acquire some of the information yeah i mean it's just really fascinating
because when we're talking about the tadpoles with the eyes some of them are wired into the
brain and some of them can see without being wired into the brain and so you have all the
sudden this new framework for understanding even something as basic as visual perception where we
equate it from conventional frameworks as being a necessary you know eye brain relationship and
so if you start to release that and all of a sudden it's actually in the body does that
radically change the way that we have to consider of bodies and minds and and consciousness to me
it seems like it must yeah yeah i think so i think that um all of this has a lot to say
about what fundamentally what we are and uh what it is that that persists through time and
where things are encoded i mean in planaria you can chop them into multiple pieces and each of
those pieces will become an animal and that's you know in philosophy of mind 101 you know you
you go over this example of the malfunctioning transporter right so it sort of replicates you
puts a copy over there but it forgets to delete the you know the old star trek episode right like
it forgets to delete the original and now which one's the real one well yeah you can do that and
you can actually do that in planaria so i think our concept of this this idea that there's a
discrete border between me and not me you know me between yourself and the outside world between
different individuals between the memories that belong to you or the memories that belong to
somebody else i i think our uh conceptions of all that stuff are are pretty primitive and and
probably um you know wrong you you mentioned uh the the danger of overfitting with training
machine learning models and that links to this kind of tangentially where i think that the way
that i've been thinking about consciousness and awareness and intelligence has to do with the
presence of a sensory system that can then integrate information and then have effects upon
the world and when we discuss the ability of computer scientists to produce consciousness
or intelligence to me i always see there being a limitation in these sensory systems i'm like yeah
you can have a brain on a chip but in order for that to be something that i recognize as conscious
it has to be tied into some kind of body that is able to process multiple modes of sensory
information integrate them and then apply them to goal directed behavior and if there is not
a necessity for a brain the way that i've conventionally thought about it it really changes the way
that i think about machine consciousness because as we start to develop these systems and even
if they're not embodied in the way that i'm used to thinking of embodied systems it seems like
we we are opening the door into what don hoffman calls you know like another conscious portal that
we're booting up yeah yeah um well a couple of things uh first i would be really careful not to
lump consciousness and intelligence in the same bucket i don't think these are synonyms and so
we have to i think talk about them separately um with respect to embodiment i would say that i
agree with you that uh some sort of perception action loop is really important but i don't think
three-dimensional space is the only space in which to do that and so if you're doing that in physiological
state space or you're doing it in transcriptional space or you're doing it in anatomical morpher
space or metabolic space or linguistic space i think that's good enough i don't think there's
anything um i don't think this three-dimensional space is privileged i think we treat it that way
because that's how our sensory motor system developed and we're really used to things that
move around well in the three-dimensional world being the interesting intelligent things like us
but uh that's just i think that's just prejudice on our part i think these other spaces in which
other beings strive and suffer are equally real and so you can have embodiment that is not obvious
to us um that is that is in these other spaces um what was the last thing that was it was the third
oh well and so and so and so another another example of that is uh some is people with locked
in syndrome right so so you can you can be locked in syndrome where you have basically zero ability
to have uh functional efficacy in terms of anybody noticing you doing anything but you
are perfectly conscious and and you know you've you've got a rich inner life so um i think i think
i think we have to be careful and i think um uh it it used to be that intelligence and
consciousness were very closely tied together i think that evolution kind of makes sure that
those things go together and things that are naturally evolved you can kind of gauge one
from the other probably like again we really don't know right so so the other mind's problem is
serious when you when you start to think about unconventional things like it's it's pretty easy
to say oh come on i know you and i both have minds even though i don't have access to yours but but i'm
giving i'm i'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt well that's that's that's easy until you
get to things that don't actually look like you or are made of something different right it gets it
gets really hard intelligence is easy because because problem-solving ability is a third person
verifiable objective competency um first person consciousness is is is different different and
difficult um yeah but uh but but yeah i i think uh i think it's uh it's much it's much wider
than than we normally think and it's and it's not hard to come up with cases
that basically break almost any um i mean this is the one of the main things i work on now is to try
to the the one my tame framework is is trying to do is to come up with a um a framework for
understanding uh cognition and agency in extremely diverse across extremely diverse embodiments
because because all of the existing frameworks they they break very easily with with biological
examples most of the things that people um walk around you know kind of talking about okay here's
my criterion you can come up with you know seven examples that will just like crush it within you
know within minutes it's pretty easy it's it's hard to come up with a good with a good framework
yeah i wonder to what extent this mode of re-envisioning intelligence could be applied to
other scale systems like i always thought it was really interesting that the physicists got
uh let's say dominion over astrophysical or cosmic scale processes um it could i could imagine a
different planet with humans on it that the biologists took over that that work and saw
different things different patterns in the sky and different uh let's say behaviors of galaxies or
or systems and and approach them as intelligent and that that wouldn't be treated as superstitious
or rational uh in some sense uh to what extent have you how do you do have you collaborated
with astrophysicists about about this possibility um i don't know it just seems like in some sense
very heretical but it but at the same time i can't find a rational cause for why that's so
yeah um i i think uh two two two things to to think about there one is that
i i i think uh the reason that um i think you need an impedance match a kind of um
kind of uh cohesion between the tools you're using and what you're hoping to find
i think the reason that physicists always see dumb matter and dumb machines and never mind
is because they're using tools that are very low agency tools volt meters and rulers and
you know telescopes and things like that these are very low agency things all they're ever gonna
see is low agency stuff uh i think you need minds to recognize other minds and um uh so that's
that's one thing another thing is is this uh i feel very strongly that assessments of weather
many people say this to me all the time i say oh uh you know your your team framework is very
kind of panpsychist so what you're just gonna say that um that the weather and and and the sun
are conscious too well my point is is this but you can't say that you can't just say anything
you can't say it is or it isn't you have to do experiments and so um but both directions are
are bad right so so in the olden days every every rock had a spirit behind it and every you know
whatever like that says so that's problematic because then you say well what what is that
doing for you and your ability to understand the rock and whatever but the other option when you
say oh no the weather definitely doesn't have any any you know any agency to it i i don't know
have you tried training it because we have tools in in behavior science where you can
actually address novel systems and ask does this thing have habituation sensitization
associate of learning predictive predictive coding uh you know a metacognitive assessment all that
these are not things you can have feelings about or or preconceptions about you have to do experiments
so so my question is um you know uh yeah you can you can you can entertain i i think you can
entertain the idea that wow what if the you know the whole galaxy is this like giant intelligence
totally possible but you can't say that until you've done some sort of experiment
and they have to be perturbational experiments you can't do it just by observation that's really
key um you know they did these experiments uh in the 70s where this guy made these um
movies where there were different shapes moving around so triangles and squares and circles and
things and he would show them to people and people go oh look it's very obvious the the the
circle is in love with the square and then they're trying to run away but the triangle keeps trying
to break them like you can tell these stories all day long but the only way to to develop them into
things that help your research and help you understand nature is to do perturbational
experiments is they find if i put my finger on the triangle and don't let it go what's going to
happen or i put a barrier does the circle really go around and get this way like what's actually
gonna happen and so i'm completely open to um potential intelligence is at other scales of
time and space in fact i did i did annoy a bunch of physicists at one point asking them
could redesign a planetary scale synapse so so some kind of a gravitational system where
a pulse comes in and so it's some sort of asteroid comes flying in something changes and then the next
time you know the next three asteroids come flying in it does something different because it's
learned and it's got you know it's it's a synapse right so it has a historicity to it and yes i think
you can design such things whether they occur in nature i have no idea um well there's some
interesting anecdotes i think there's some flyby anomalies with anomalies it's hard to say
there's some flyby anomalies with uh the jupiter probes you know that that end up leaving their
orbits at you know and and and they're just kind of catalogued and moved on and and again like it's
not such a perturbation it's actually terrifying to think about uh perturbing another galaxy or
something and all of the people in that galaxy are like what's going on um but i suppose you
would need to do that because there there are these anomaly i mean the galactic rotation
problem is another really interesting one it's like we have a very robust model of gravity
quantitatively we've checked it out locally in our solar system to the best of our ability on earth
and then we look at these large-scale structures and it's like well they're moving by some other means
and uh it really opens the door but i suppose without being able to mess with it you can't
really see if it's responsive or or if it's just some physical process that we are not aware of yet
i mean that's the thing right crossing crossing levels between
local physical process suppose suppose you have a you have a conversation with somebody
and uh you convince them to go to grad school you have this you know four argue four really good
arguments why they should go get their phd and they do and then and then here you know along
comes a physics is how did you do that and and you say well here's and it's okay so let's measure
so there was this air vibration and it went into the eardrum and then there's a okay it's not that
that story is false it's just completely useless that the next time somebody else needs to be talked
into whatever it is right it doesn't capture the essence of what's going on even though even though
at the local scale yes it all was true and it all held together and these are the sets of frequencies
and air vibrations that happen it misses the whole point of the story so um it's almost i i feel it's
like um and again this is this is just you know kind of a very very hand-wavy stuff but but i'm
working on something something a little better um the the notion of synchronicity right the idea that
there are large-scale patterns that show up at specific observational scales when you as the
observer know what to look for but down below they are just chance or they're you know it's it's
never magic it's never against the laws of physics but it but but if you look at a larger scale there's
often like yeah wait a minute though yeah i know each one of these things kind of was was random by
itself but all together there's some there's something going on here and so you have to know
how to look for those patterns and even better you have to know how to read and write those patterns
which means perturbational experiments so you know i i don't have any ideas on how to um do
perturbational experiments on on galaxies but but like the weather kind of a thing should be absolutely
uh uh tractable and and we did something like that with um with gene regulatory networks
because they're very simple dynamical systems and you look at them you say well that's things
kind it's it's we you know for sure it's dumb it's never gonna look turns out they're capable of
six different kinds of memory including pavlovian conditioning and all it takes it doesn't you don't
need cells you don't need synapses you don't need any of that it's it's a it's a handful of genes that
turn each other on and off and already you get this amazing free gift which is that some of them
the biological ones anyway they can they can learn why do you think that the physicists have such
preeminence in our academic tower you know i feel like people all like if you look at nsf at least
the last time i looked it was mostly physicists that were in charge uh it just seems like people
expect physicists to answer these really huge cosmic questions and i've always found that a
little bit bizarre but and i've been trying to trace how that came about and if it's arbitrary
or if it's is there something innate about the way that we perceive the world that demands
that kind of explanation even if it's not capable of it yeah um i would argue that it's because
uh they make cd players right like they i mean they they're the ones and and it's because they
pick the low hanging fruit i mean literally like not to take anything away like physics is amazing
and it lots of hard problems and all of that but but um as as anybody who does computer science or
physics when they try to reach bi they get into biology they want to rip the hair out of their
heads because because they're used to systems that are precise uh basically the low end of the
spectrum you can you can you we know how to deal with the low end of the spectrum and that now we
do anyway after all the hard work and those are the things where we make reliable technology
so so you know if you want a washing machine or you want a cd player you didn't get there
without the physicists now you need some other stuff but but but but the stuff from the right
side of that spectrum so so psychoanalysis and uh but you know all of that kind of stuff
in and art and everything like it's great but it is notoriously unreliable for doing any particular
thing you know it sort of will enrich some of us and not others and who knows but but if you
really want you know if you if you um if you want to build a house or you want to you want to you
know antibiotics or something like that it's physics and then chemistry and i i i think that's
that's what it is it's just people people can see what works and and it's going to take a lot of
hard work to get that degree of um a predictive utility out of these higher higher agency things
if we live in a world of platonic forms that are being biologically manifest and evolution
is you described it as being something that makes problem-solving machines
do you have a sense of your own role in that as like what is the what is the platonic form
of the problem that you see yourself as solving
yeah so so this is uh just my phenomenology of it i i don't know because i'm not able to do
experiments controlled experiments on the scale of you know life and science and all of that right
so so i i don't know if any of this is has any truth to it this is just how how i feel um yeah um
it certainly feels to me like i'm discovering not inventing and that the people in my lab
we are we are uncovering something i don't know if they would agree by the way but but
but me personally everything that that we've done over the decades i feel like we're unearthing
something that already existed and that has a particular structure to it we don't make it up
we find it and we kind of we can do better or worse at figuring out what it is and how to
relate to it and how to bring it out into the world um that's how it feels to me i don't know
that any of that is true um but um yeah and i also think that so so here's another kind of
wacky thing uh and and i've told this to some of my students um i i also feel like
some of that stuff is under positive pressure in other words it wants to come out in other
words it's there for you to like like when you poke that little hole into that platonic space
by making uh the you know a botter or some kind of new technology stuff comes rushing through that
hole and i really feel like again this is very non scientific i'm just telling you how it feels
to to to me um that that's what we do we figure out ways to kind of put a crack in that in that
boundary and then stuff starts pouring through the boundary you don't have to you don't have to
pull it out if you if you make the if you if you um uh make make a make that barrier porous it it
comes out i think i think it's under pressure it it whatever you whatever you create in this world
that's uh uh it will it will um pull patterns that that are that are there and is that how
you approach your own goal orientation in your science like you know we're starting a new year
here and and it's almost like if it's a miracle year for you what would it look like but i sense
that it's almost like you see it as just chasing that that you know positive pressure that positive
pressure yeah you're sort of flowing with it do you set that that's sort of objective bar for
yourself when you when you look out on to the immediate future as a scientist or are you are
you just kind of going with the muse um well i well i definitely think there's a muse no no
doubt about that but um i also think that the space of possible things to chase after is infinite
and so i actually like like on the spectrum you know in some labs you you know you sort of show
up in whatever you do as long as you discover something cool everybody's you know happy with it
but i'm on the other spectrum so i have a very specific research agenda i would like everybody
who joins hired in my lab we're all working on very specific things where i know what i want to
to come out of this um so and that's that's not to say that uh that i'm you know uh defining it
like designing any of these things it's just that there are many many different things that
different muses that one could tune into and i have one particular one that you know i'm sort of
flowing with and that means being very thoughtful about um what are the channels through which
you write these these findings will hopefully hopefully flow the center i've got a i've got a
mind map that hangs in our um in our in our lab and it's like this this this this giant
poster that we put like nine feet wide that we printed on silk and and the center of the
mind map is called embodied mind that's the center so so it's all the different ways and you know all
the different questions and things that that we're doing and then different people's specific
projects are sort of peppered around the leaves of the trail of that of that graph and so that
everybody can see where where they kind of plug into this but it's no it's very specific and it's
very curated it's a beautiful world that you're building i really think that when i i think i've
told you this before that when i went to go study biology i imagined that it would be the the study
of what is life and i very quickly realized that it was much more mechanistic and much more
molecular than that in most cases and one of the reasons that we started this podcast was because
i was certain that there were people out there who were asking the larger questions of the
significance and pushing the boundaries of what it meant to understand bodies and life itself
because it does seem to be a very weird center of the universe and obviously that's like a very
you know earth centric or human centric perspective but there is something that is
there's a motive force of life which is the solving of problems and the universe seems full
of problems to solve and so figuring out the process by which we can do that in novel ways seems
to me to be the passage into something that is greater than the past because at every single
juncture where humans have run into problems the way that we have solved them is by figuring out
technological approaches to resolving what has happened and obviously that creates downstream
problems like you look at the you know the green revolution or something we have solved the problem
of mass starvation but now we have phosphate runoff and pollution of waters and now we have so many
people that we don't have regenerative agriculture that prevents us from just decimating animal life
on the planet and I think that the the passage into the next era is the passage of understanding
our biology much better than we ever have before and I think that your work is really really at
the center of this and I just I'm I'm grateful to have to have met you and to know that that someone
is is doing this it's really it gives me a lot of hope for the future well thank you so much
yeah I'm that's one of the things I'm happiest about is when people get hope from some of the
things I say and I this is maybe a good time to point out that it obviously isn't just me so so
in addition to the people in my lab that do a lot of the hard work it's also I have I have some
amazing collaborators that that have been pulled together some some of whom you may want to have
on so people like Richard Watson and you know and Chris Fields and Mark Holmes and some other folks
um they really make a lot of this possible because these are some of the things I say these ideas
have been around for a really long time but they've gotten no traction because there's a huge
difference between saying something and pushing it to the point where it actually generates new
discoveries and until you do that second thing it doesn't move the needle and that that's the
really hard part and so so there have been a lot of people that I've worked with that enable that
they have to have enabled some of that some of that to happen and I think I think what you're
saying is super important in the sense of understanding life beyond kind of the lowest
levels of it meaning the the mechanistic molecular stuff is is critical it's going to be important
for us going into the you know whatever the future of humanity is the one thing I want to say though
is people get hyper fixated when when when they hear life people get hyper fixated on the material
and on how it gets here so so the biological wet cytoplasm stuff and the products of evolution
and I just want to say that I think life and and that kind of um uh focus on what's important
is really critical but we have to remember the protoplasm isn't magic and it isn't uh unique
and the meandering course of the evolutionary process is not the only way that uh mind enters
this world and we have to get broader than than a focus on the easy stuff which is the material
it's really easy to say oh uh you're made of silicon yeah you're not real you're just you're
just faking it and and really the hard work that we have to do as a species is to get beyond those
those um kind of superficial criteria and to really say what do we really mean by um I don't
I don't know about life I you know you can you can keep life what it is but but but cognition um
I think goes way beyond the living world and we we have to understand we have to develop um
rigorous frameworks of of recognizing it in novel guises that we wouldn't necessarily say are alive
and I think that this next year is going to be really interesting to see what happens because
I feel like we're approaching that question in a massive way technologically
yeah we we are um I I'm I'm really um disappointed about how narrow that debate has been
and the hyper focus on language models and and uh the kind of ai's that we have today and the things
you know the people people just get so so focused on these examples and and and the broader lessons
of the field of diverse intelligence are they haven't even been scratched yet everybody's just
like really focused on this on this one thing I think I think we get much bigger issues actually
coming than than just than just this yeah I mean I think that we can plan to spend the next year
reading up and studying more on the the diverse intelligence and hopefully we can see you again
and cool at the beginning of the next year yeah absolutely anytime thank you so much it's always
awesome so eye-opening talking to you and I really appreciate you giving us your time
and giving it to our audience as well that's great I appreciate it thank you always a great
discussion be well um yeah stay in touch yeah happy new year happy new year all right happy
new year yeah send me uh send me a link when this comes up we'll do you got it all right bye everybody
