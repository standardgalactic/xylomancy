10 years ago or 15 years ago, very few people realized that they had a battle on their hands.
Largely the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these movements, but now everybody around the
world knows there's a battle, they know what the issues are and people are getting up to speed on
them very quickly. Today I'm joined by Professor Stephen Hicks and very grateful to him for taking
the time to answer some questions in the hope of answering exactly what it is that is happening
in schools and universities and other educational institutions around the world. I think what happened
to me where presenting ideas for debate was deemed to be gross misconduct and a sackable offense
is something that has been taking place a little bit more commonly in the U.S.
So I'm hoping Professor Hicks can provide some insights about that, but first could you just
tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered your passion for philosophy please?
Well I'm a Canadian by birth, born and raised. I didn't come to the U.S. until starting graduate
school and philosophy came to be a bit late in life. I was not really serious about becoming a
philosophy professor until well into my 20s. I actually thought I was going to become a
civil engineer and architect and go into the real estate business with my dad, but I always had been
a reader. My parents were both readers and I loved reading kind of all kinds of books,
whatever I came across, whatever was on my parents' shelves. And a couple things happened when I
started university. I took a course from a very dynamic political science professor, but he was
very much engaged with the great thinkers John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche and Thomas Hobbes
and so forth. And this was my first really systematic engagement with these these great minds
and sort of things that in my semi-adolescent way I'd thought about but nothing systematically. So
I was largely blown away by what I was reading and thinking about and the idea that you can
think about those issues in a fundamental way. And realizing that what I was most interested,
even though this was of course in the politics department, was the underlying philosophical
issues about knowledge, about human nature, about how we decide what the good life is that we are
perhaps organizing all of our society in terms of. So that was going on at the same time independently
of reading Locke and Nietzsche and I was also reading Ein Rand and Ludwig von Nises and Friedrich
Hayek. So it was an awesome first year of university for me. Yeah, it sounds fantastic.
And was there any particular book or idea that really seized you that you can recall?
I think it was, this might sound boring, but more methodological, you know, the idea that you could
think all the way down on these issues and in a partly in a structured way, saying there's,
if you take this as an assumption, well, you're, you're, you're depending on this, that depends on
this, but at the same time that is being challenged by this position and this position. So you need
to consider all of them, make up your mind here. And then if you accept this one, then this follows
and that follows. So that was a, you know, I don't want to sound too hippy at this point,
but that was mind blowing expansion, this thing for me at that time. Yeah, I like the way you've
framed that as being very much a conversation or dialogue between different voices. And what was
exciting about education is being given an opportunity to join that great conversation
across centuries and new, new vistas sort of opening up that you'd been dimly aware of,
but now you saw the extent of them. Yeah, absolutely. Yes. And to my, my professor's credit,
his name was Fred Vaughn. By the end of this course, I had no idea what his particular
views on any of these, these issues were. So I, you know, we talked about safe spaces. I
had entirely the sense that I could safely explore any view and voice any opinion and my
essays for that course, try out any ideas that I was, was working through. So that was wonderful.
Interesting. I think that sadly is what many people feel is being increasingly lost
in the educational world now. It certainly is. I know you take the view that ultimately all
discussions about what education is and what its aims are are fundamentally philosophical ones.
Could you go into a bit more detail about that? So why is it that philosophy underlies education?
Yeah. Well, I know when we are professional teachers, for example, you know, we have our
particular passion, our particular specialization, and we want the students to come to be more
knowledgeable and more skillful and hopefully passionate about, about our area of expertise.
But if you think about any of the expertises that we want to make a place for in the curriculum,
they're always put in the curriculum by reference to some conception of what the product of
education should be or what the goal of education should be. So if we're going to put mathematics
in the curriculum, it's because we say, well, you're going to need this later in life or if
we're going to put the arts in the curriculum, it's because we say, well, all your life, there's
this great universe of artistic product for you to explore, enrich your life, or maybe you will
yourself become. So we're always thinking longer term about what the child will grow up to be
as a full adult. But then when we start saying that conception or thinking about that conception
explicitly, what is it to be a full human adult? And then immediately, we have to become very
philosophical, right? So we're saying, you know, what, what capacities need to be developed? What
are our genuine mature needs? What things really are worth pursuing? And what things really are
not that important? And how is it all going to fit together so that by the time the child leaves
our, our educational institution, and we're saying, you know, you were on your own, go out and live
your life, we have some conception of what kind of a life we are we're preparing that for. So,
you know, if you think about all of the, all of the great battles we have in education, sometimes
it's a matter of turf war, you know, are we going to put this in the curriculum or not? And oftentimes
that means to make room, we have to take something out in order to put something else in. We have
to make a value judgment about what really is going to serve the student well in the long term. So,
you know, in, in business courses at the high school level, there's, you know, teaching about
bookkeeping and finance and marketing and management and so on. Well, should we add a course in
entrepreneurship? And there, what we have to do is, is really make the case that students need to
learn how to be entrepreneurial in their life. And it's a different conception of preparing
students for, say, a business career of just, you know, someone will give you a job and you will
show up and they will tell you what to do. The entrepreneurial way of thinking is a different
philosophical mindset, right? Or, yeah, if we're going to say, should we teach Latin, right, or
Greek on the curriculum, or should we substitute a modern language, then what we're going to say is,
well, you know, there's, in many cases, a philosophical difference there. One side wants to
say we are inheritors of this great tradition and students need to know that great tradition,
absorb it and pass it on to the next generation. Another side wants to say, well, we're not so
sure that those old traditions are all that's great, so to speak, but the more important thing is
students live in the real world now. It's a global cosmopolitan world. And for that,
they need to multiple languages and so on. So again, we're thinking very philosophically
differently about what kind of life we're preparing students for.
Yeah, the way you've put it there, you can see it ultimately depends on some of the
biggest philosophical questions there are. What is a human being? What is the good life for a human
being? The relationship between the individual and the state, all these things factor into
some of those big educational questions. Exactly right. Yes, that's right. And then some of the
people who've been most impactful on education, just, you know, in the last century or so, John
Dewey, Maria Montessori, Paolo Freire and so on, all of them have deep philosophical frameworks
that they are working within. And then they're coming along and saying, we need to
revolutionize education based explicitly on that new philosophical framework.
So you mentioned some key thinkers in education there. Which philosophical battles would you say
have had the longest lasting or biggest impact on educational thinking?
Yeah, that's a big question because we've been thinking explicitly about education for millennia.
So I'm going to cheat just a little bit and say just say in the last 600 years or so as we get
into the modern world. And this is a debate that still is with us in our generation. But I would
say it's a twofold debate between some kind of more religious paternalistic model of education
and a more naturalistic and independence-generating model of education. So if we think of now our
standard, but the one that's now being beleaguered, standard model, nonetheless for the last couple
of hundred years of liberal education. So the idea is students need to have a broad base of
knowledge. They need to be able to operationalize that knowledge in terms of skills. It's not just
abstract theory. And all of those things are very complicated. And so students need to be aware
of all of the issues and all of the major positions that are rivals in there. And they need to be able
themselves to to think and enter into the debate as participants. And the idea is that there's still
a huge amount that we need to learn and figure out the universe is more open-ended. So students
then need to have a fairly strong mind, many of them, to be active discoverers of new knowledge
or active creators of new things. So that's kind of an idealized understanding of the liberal arts
model. And so we are training free minds. So we're going to free us from ignorance,
free us from superstition, and free us from all of the self-doubt so that we can actually go forth
and make our own lives and make our societies better places. So then that is to say education
is precisely about training students how to do all of that. So we're going to have passionate
experts in a lot of different areas. Those experts will engagingly present all of the major theories,
invite students to learn about them. But at the end of the day, it's going to be that the student
has to internalize it and then find some way to demonstrate his or her best understanding of it.
And then the person is coached and so forth along that direction. Now, that has been for the most
part to your big picture question for centuries. Its main contender has been a model that says
liberal is not the right part of education. Instead, education needs to be much more
paternalistic and or on that sliding scale even more authoritarian. And so rather than an active
minded students, students are expected to be more passive. They are receivers of inherited wisdom
and there are authority figures who have basically figured out or had revealed to them all of the
important answers to life's questions. They are known, they are settled, and it's a top-down
transition. And so you don't challenge who are you to challenge as a young person, the
great minds of the past. In some cases, overstating this, this is on a sliding scale,
but nonetheless, we have a traditional curriculum that's not going to change over time and it's
going to be delivered in a hopefully benevolent paternalistic fashion. But then depending on
how pessimistic you are about students' aptitude for learning, you might need to use some more
authoritarian methods. So that has been the great battle in the modern world. And in historians'
label, that's sort of modern liberal education versus pre-modern or hardcore traditionalist
pre-modern education. And do you think that that is fundamentally the most important battle
over education today? Or do you think that it has shifted slightly? Some of what you described there
sounded as if we might be seeing a return to a more authoritarian model of education,
but a very different perspective. No longer a authority rooted in religious education traditions,
but that's very much secular, but has the same fundamental vantage point. So I expect you to
come into class and hear some things which ultimately I want you to believe because they
are correct and they shouldn't be challenged. Yes, no, absolutely. That's right. On my reading of
the big ideas, it's almost always a three-way debate on all of the fundamentals. So yes, to say
either we're going to be more supernaturalist and religious in our understanding of the way the
world works or we're going to be more secular and naturalistic, that's two positions and they are
those are huge ones, but there's a third position that is a skeptical position that says the nature
of reality. We don't know what that is. It's impossible to know. There is no such thing as
an objective God and a supernatural reality or an objective natural reality. Instead,
everything is some sort of subjective creation and ultimately I or we make up our own reality.
So that's a three-way debate. Just on the cognition issues that become very fundamental to
education, one side traditionally has wanted to say there is such a thing as truth. Typically,
it's truth with a capital T. It's in a higher dimension and what we need to do is find some way
of accessing that higher dimension. Sometimes it will reveal itself to us through revelation
or some special individuals will have a mystical insight and or people who don't get those mystical
insights or revelations. They will need to have faith and so there's been one traditional on the
model of knowledge that then gets applied in education circles that says it's a matter of
revelation, training people for mystical insight and or expecting them to have faith and so then
you will base your model of education on that. In contrast to that, there's another position that
says no objective knowledge is possible but knowledge is of reality and reality is the natural
world which is cause and effect. So we need to train our senses to observe it very carefully
and then to use our reason to categorize things and try out hypotheses and then develop all the
formal tools of scientific method. So we can get objective knowledge of reality but by not
by faith and revelation but rather by doing kind of hard empirical and rational work. Now the third
position though comes along and says well look both of you guys are saying that there's a reality
out there that can be known and that there are ultimately truths but we're skeptical. We don't
think there is any such thing as knowledge. We think mystical insight that's just a matter of
wishful thinking. Faith is just dogmatic following the leader and not thinking for yourself but at
the same time we think the senses are illusory. We think logic is just made up word games.
Math has no connection to actual reality and so nobody really knows anything. We all just have
various sorts of subjective preferences that have been instilled in us and so we're skeptical,
we're relativistic and so on. So again we have a three-way debate. So to come back to the first
part of that it is that third position. Philosophically we have been at a very skeptical place for
the last century or so. The collapse of positivism, the rise of existentialism,
and any number of other movements that have become household names. All of them are
very skeptical at their core and as a result of that they doubt that there is such a thing as
truth, such a thing as knowledge, facts, and that we're in some sense trapped in a kind of subjectivity.
Now that then could go in a couple of directions. One then is to say well you know if nobody really
knows anything then we should all just be very tolerant and let everybody do their own thing
and believe whatever because nobody is in a position to say that I'm better and you're worse
on on whatever the issue is. But the way it more often comes out is that it's very hard for people
to live that way saying I don't know anything, nobody knows anything, and we're all just going
to go off and do our own things because people want their lives to be meaningful and typically
they want to be committed to something and typically they have a social value framework in
many cases a political framework that they want everybody to live in terms of. So what they will
then typically do is adopt what you're referring to as a new kind of authoritarianism. Now if it is
the case that nobody knows anything, there's no such thing as a true reality out there. It's all
just subjective value beliefs and the things that have been conditioned into us. Well I might as
well just plunge into the fray right. I might as well just say here's what I happen to believe.
This is what seems significant and meaningful to me and I'm not going to claim that it's true
or that it's objective but and I'm very well recognized that there are lots of other frameworks
out there but really we're just a bunch of people with our own subjective frameworks
in competition with each other to see who's going to prevail and I just want my viewpoint to prevail
and so I'm going to use any techniques including authoritarian techniques if it's going to enable
my view to prevail. So you can get an authoritarianism out of that kind of skepticism as well.
You mentioned Nietzsche as one of the thinkers who was influential for you as a
young man just starting formal education and experiencing your passion for philosophy for
the first time and the idea that there are no facts only interpretations is one which
some historians of philosophy trace to Nietzsche. Much of what you're describing there
sounds like it's influenced by that idea and Nietzsche has been called the kind of grandfather
of postmodernism. If we're left with just the interpretations and it's just power narratives
is what you're suggesting that people just want to claim power for their own narrative?
Yeah absolutely yes and you're right to cite Nietzsche. I'm not a Nietzschean. I learned a
lot from Nietzsche but I think he is the most influential philosopher for the last century
or so and in some ways the dates are perfect because he died in 1900 and basically the 20th
century intellectually was largely a Nietzschean century. So the philosophers whom the current
social justice warriors, the wokists, the advocates of political correct authoritarianism and so on
so they are the children or the grandchildren. They will go back and be citing figures like
Michel Foucault. They might not have read him at this point but Foucault cites Nietzsche as a
formative influence or it might be Heidegger another giant of 20th century philosophy,
Martin Heidegger and Martin Heidegger is largely influenced by Nietzsche as well so
that grandfather grandfather grandchild narrative that works as well. So Nietzsche is a very
fundamentally subjectivist philosopher with respect to knowledge. He's standing at the end of a long
tradition of skeptical philosophy and he comes to believe on all of the major issues about perception,
about our forming of abstractions, about our memories, about our ability to do grammar and
linguistics and to form scientific theories and narrations and so on. All of that is driven by
skeptical arguments that have hollowed out any positive account of those. So we're just left
with subjectivism and then there's a kind of relativism that comes out of that. So then Nietzsche
though is also first-generation thinkers to grapple seriously with evolutionary ideas and partly this
means that you don't see reality as fixed for all time in terms of one stable framework that
reality itself including humans as organisms are evolving and so what's good for this organism at
this time is going to be different from what's good for that kind of organism later and so you
have the idea that the rules of the game are evolving over time instead of fixed absolute
truths as well. But you also get this idea that well look if there's no such thing as truth,
there's no such thing as your rationality is figuring out objectively what the facts of the
situation are. If it's all subjective and this evolving struggle and rivalry then you do start
to start using language like power a different way. So then it is just a power struggle between the
strong and the weak and the strong have their narrative and their subjective preferences and
the weak have theirs and it's not going to be decided by truth and decency and universal rights
because we don't believe in those anymore. It's just going to be a naked power struggle so there
a very adversarial understanding of power comes out of that and Nietzsche is one of the most
clear sighted on that issue and then the 20th century is largely, largely inheriting that.
Now by contrast to that and this is going to be closer to my own views so power is an important
word but so what do we mean by power and there's a much more optimistic benevolent understanding
of power that is that is that is possible. Power is the capacity to get stuff done. You're
more powerful to the extent that you have the knowledge and the skills and other kinds of
resources to be able to accomplish stuff right in the world and so knowledge comes in a lot of
different forms of intellectual power so here we think about Francis Bacon knowledge is power
and this then ties us back to education so here we think about power as a good thing we want to
empower our students to build up their cognitive power and their physical power and their character
power so that they can go forth and do good things in in in the world and if you couple that with a
more benevolent understanding of human beings that human beings are competent at acquiring knowledge
they are competent at working out socially and a mutually beneficial ways of living together as
friends as romantic partners starting family starting businesses even doing politics you know
politics of course is about power but we're going to do it in a democratic and republican way that
respects every individual's own power and their own agency right and so forth so here we have
the idea that power is very important and we want more and more power but we think that that power
of course it can be abused but human beings can work out ways of using power benevolently so
that understanding of power though has philosophical opposition to those who say no human beings are
much more irrational much more impotent with respect to cognitive matters much more subjective
and animalistic with respect to the formation of their values and so power becomes a much darker
thing so that battle over power is also part of what we are engaged in right now I think that's
certainly the case and what people often first think of when they think of power is hierarchy
and therefore things no longer being equal and I think this idea of power and different power
centers struggling to get the most power for themselves is interpreted by many people as
relating to the marxist concept of oppression and struggle between different classes that's right
and do you think that the division of the world that nature puts forward as struggling power centers
is deeply related to marxist concept of struggle or have the two become intertwined in the way that
some thinkers have related the two of them no I think they are variations on a fundamental
theme I mean both of them do have this idea of power completely dissociated from truth
knowledge and values right so it's not the idea that we can figure out what the truth is
and that we can figure out what's good in the world and then respect that all individuals have the
capacity for learning the truth and that all individuals have certain core value statuses
you know that we call that we call rights so what we then will think is that we want
those kinds of people to have power but it's in the service of discovering more truth
and advancing their rights and advancing genuine good in the world if you reverse that if you then
say no really in the first place it's just power and all of these so-called truths and all these
so-called values are just subjective and variable across human beings then what you're going to find
is your your truth is in the service of power right rather than power in the service of actual
truth and so that fundamental reversal is there now to get to marx and nicha what both of them do
is start off with a very skeptical subjectivist understanding of the world and an adversarial
understanding of human beings so for them the difference between strong and weak centers of
power that is the fundamental and on the basis of that it really just is a a question of where
your sympathies are so for marx he's going to divide them into bourgeoisie and proletariat right
or right those who own property and those who economically sell their labor to those who have
property so you have these two different classes and then you make them adversarial to each other
and so on the basis of that they it's just a matter of are these guys power going to prevail in
this rivalry or these guys power going to prevail in the in the in the rivalry and in the case of
marx his sympathies are just with the weaker currently on the in the power struggle but
nicha is going to give a very similar analysis he's going to say not economically but rather
biologically and psycho biologically there are different centers of power some of us are more
predator like some of us are more prey like some of us are stronger some of us are are weaker
and and we are in adversarial relations to each other but in the case of nicha it's just that
his sympathies are with the the stronger the more predatory like so he's going to say no
these people over here are kind of pathetic they're not the ones that are going to advance
the human species so i'm going to go for them so the marxists are in favor of the weak and
against the strong the nichians are in favor of the strong against the weak but both of them
are agreeing fundamentally that it's an adversarial you versus me power struggle and there are no
such things as universal rights universal goodness or objective truths i think there's a lot of depth
to that and one thought that i had about it is that if the the marxist sympathies with the weak
would it also be true to say that in order to equalize things they themselves need to be in a
position of power yes for sure it's it's going to be the more nichian position that says the
inequalities are natural perhaps biologically driven it's going to be the marxist position that all
all inequalities are artificial and driven primarily by social circumstances and so on
but then yes so the nichians then are going to say you know we have no problem with dramatic
inequalities across every single dimension because it's going to be the high flyers they're the ones
who are going to advance the human species whereas the marxists want to level everything
on the grounds that it's going to be through some sort of collectivity of equal human beings that
we're going to advance the advance the human species so yes for both of them the most fundamental
debate is this social power equality dimension right and so that makes them both in going much
more I think in the post-modern direction by contrast the position I'm much more sympathetic
than neither marxist nor nor nichian is you know that you know equality is an important concept
but it's an equality at a slightly abstract level right we are all equally human beings in the sense
that we have our own lives we have our own cognitive capacities and the important thing
is that each of us is free to develop our own capacities to our to our fullest extent
and that socially we need to be left free in order to be able to to do so right that makes a lot of
sense and you can see the temptation from a marxist line of thinking if everything is due to
social inequality and it's socially constructed then presumably it can all be reconstructed
into a much more amenable version of the world I think that's a possibility whereas the niche
perspective would be no some of these things are built in yeah absolutely so another you know
very fundamental issue and we've touched briefly on it but I think it's worth stressing at this
point is you know who is going to be doing this restructuring so we all say there's problems
in the world and you might be more pessimistic or more optimistic so there's problems in the world
and we want to fix those problems well then the question is who is going to do the fixing
and what you do get out of marxism is the idea that it has to be some sort of powerful group
the vanguard right of the proletariat who takes it and uses basically all of society's resources
in order to to change to change it and the nichians are also going to argue that
whatever improvements they're going to come from certain special individuals and both of them are
contrasted to the position that says it's the individual all of us who have agency in our own
lives and if you want to change your circumstance all fundamentally it is up to you to develop
your individual capacities in order to to change the world in the way you want to go
and what's very important here is how both the nichians and the marxists the marxists even more
so and then their their second third generation inheritors now who deny individual agency
fundamentally right they will say this is the birth of victimhood culture right so
I mean the victim is the person who is the ultimate lack of agency right I am who I am
because I've been pushed around by all of these social forces beyond my control I have no agency
and anything that's that that's nasty in my life is somebody else's fault and anytime we say well
maybe you could do something about it right or maybe you are in part to blame for your
circumstance right now that is just swept off the table you're blaming the victim or you're
doing some other kind of sin from that that particular lexicon so this issue really does come
down to that old again philosophical debate about volition and or or free will versus some sort of
determinism and another important part of this is that the the marxists and the cultural marxists
and the neo marxists and the post-modernists and so on all of them do advocate very strongly forms
of determinism that says that really the the human being is just a lump of plasticine born into a
world shaped by social forces and other environmental forces beyond his control and all you can really
do if you have any measure of agency is just decide to accept where you are and then commit
yourself in a non-rational way to to advancing that set of of interest but of course everybody
else is doing the same thing really does does become a power struggle now that deterministic
view of human beings does that shed any light on why we most often tend to see the the proclivity to
cancel debate among post-modernist perspectives so rather than answering speech with more
speech and emphasizing the importance of debate instead what we get is no you're not allowed to
hear that perspective or that view is somehow beyond the law yes why aren't people trusted to
listen and make up their own minds yes no that's a great great question and it goes to the heart
of what liberal education should be so the last part of your phrase that we're going to trust
individuals to make up their own minds so make up your own mind that's an agency point yeah
that's a part of the answer is going to be we don't think individuals have agency or the middle
part of it individuals the post-moderns and the they don't believe in individuals you are a social
construct social construct you are fundamentally a part of a group that has has shaped you so the
the identity politics it's actually the identity part that's the most important there it's not really
primarily about politics it's about what is your identity and what we find is that they are arguing
is that your identity is not as an individual or most the individual just is the you know the
thing of all of the Venn diagram constructions you're the overlap of a whole bunch of group
identities so you are a collectivized individual so you're a collective being that is shaped by
forces rather than individuals who are going to make up their own minds but then also if you
think about debate as a formal educational device the assumptions of debate are that you know here's
a controversy and we're going to acknowledge that this is a controversy that there are at least
two positions and that they're both important positions and probably most of us don't know
what position we should accept yet so we're going to go through a certain formal process
to get there and we are going to respect advocates of both positions that are that are going to be
there and that we are interested in the truth or at least the best approximation of the truth
that we can get right now so we still believe in truth we believe in respect we believe that
there are genuine controversies and we think that the way we should proceed is by using
a formal reason you put a position out there you develop an argument for it the other person then
critiques that argument saying you know your factual basis is incorrect here or you've made
an error of logic there so we're talking about facts and logic and argumentation and
the world is complex and we're going to be rational and then of course in a debate again
we're back to where you ended in your formulation we're going to leave it up to each
member of the audience to make up his or her own mind after hopefully having carefully considered
so that whole apparatus is necessary if you're going to think that debate
is a useful and important pedagogical device but then what we find is that by the time you get to
strong skepticism strong kind of adversarial cynical power understandings of the world strong
collectivity and lack of agency everything goes out the window we're not rational logic is a myth
there are no facts respect for each other you got to be kidding me right it's all just an
uncivil power struggle and so what you then do is that whatever institution you are is you don't
listen respectfully and engage the debate instead you act as a a member of the adversarial power
struggle you try to shut down the debate by using you know intimidation tactics or just
physical shouting over the person or using threats and so on so you are you know you're
fundamentally opposed to everything that goes into making making debate possible and so that's why
cancel culture is on the rise i think that gets right to the heart of the matter and it's it's
sad to to hear it put succinctly like that because fundamentally what's under attack is the commitment
to rationality itself exactly right primary component of education so there's just no value
in debate because traditionally the value of free speech and debate has been that both parties
are somehow interested in working together collaboratively to struggle towards the truth
together and if that is taken away then there's no point in it that's right there's no truth
there's no collaboration right we are in a different philosophical universe altogether
there's a really chilling line in Victor Clemperer's book on the language of the Third Reich
i'll just read this so i get it right he said that words are like tiny doses of arsenic
swallowed unnoticed and then after a while the toxic reaction sets in i'm wondering whether we're
starting to experience a toxic reaction to some words that have been in the political
educational culture for some time now but it's only now that the impact is really being felt
do you have any thoughts on that no absolutely right uh yeah that weaponization of language
is uh it's a very useful phrase and and and uh accurately descriptive of of what's going on and
it's a part of a self-conscious strategy so if we think of you know concepts like
racist and sexist and privilege and you know the structural part of structural right whatever
pathology we were we're interested they are all now those can all be legitimate concepts
but they are all concepts that at least in my language are used as
anti-concepts in the that's partly a technical term of arts let me let me say a little bit about
that but an anti-concept is meant to be a word or a phrase that's used to dismantle language
and this an undercut communication and nonetheless in an adversarial concept or context rather to
put your adversary in a defensive position right and so the weaponization part is is absolutely
right there um so the idea here is you know so here again we have to get deep so what is what's
the purpose of language what what is language about and then partly uh the standard modern
view has been that language is a tool of cognition we have a big brain we can form abstractions and
concepts and then start developing you know complex propositions and putting them together
in narratives and theories and so on but ultimately we use language as rational animals to figure out
and carry around a map or a representation or a set of theories of the world in in our heads so
fundamentally language is a tool of cognition but of course a lot of that we do socially so we we
want to connect with each other and so language is also a tool of communication but if we're going
to communicate then we have to make sure that you're using words in the same way that I'm using
words and so definition and concept formation and all of that exercise that we go through sometimes
frustrating to make sure we're on the same page that's very important because we are interested
in communication as a form of collaboration now of course sometimes we are in an adversarial
situations and so we're also going to use language as rhetorical weapons in that particular but that's
hopefully a last resort and that's a really a sign that something has gone terribly wrong
because fundamentally language should be about helping us understand the world and communicate
with each other so the weaponization of language though as a prevailing tactic as your first course
that you start off with an insult you start off with an accusation you start trying to get inside
the person's head to put them on the defensive that is coming out of a an ideological strategy
that says no we don't cognize the world right and life is not about social communication it is a
dog eat dog war and language is just one tool in that war but the kind of tool you need in
that war is weapons and so you become very good at using language as a weapon in whatever social
where you're going so you know racism for example you know that's a very important concept in the
modern world and we all need to think about what it means or what are the psychological and the social
underpinnings of it to what extent are the person's intent and their knowledge and their
commitments and their values and so forth are organized so on and the same thing for for sexism
and so on so all of these concepts do need careful understanding and careful definition
and at the same time we should recognize that particularly you know now that we are you know
well into the modern world we're believers in in rights and human dignity and human freedom
and equality under the law that you know racism is a pathology but we've made great progress on
that and so yes there are racists out there but we really should use that word in a very targeted
way and before we accuse someone of being a racist we better have done our homework
and make sure that we're using this highly important concept accurately but what we of
course find right now is that that's not at all what's going on right the word racism is very
promiscuously applied and people have not done their homework they're just throwing it out there
they've never met you they don't know anything about you in particular but that's what they
that's what they lead with and in many cases you know people who are leading seminars in business
they will go in and you know just throw out very gross generalities about the racial attitudes of
entire groups of people and take it for granted and so on so that is very clearly a weaponization
of language but racism then is being used to put people on the defensive right because you know
they know very well for example if you accuse someone of being a racist in the early 21st century
the person's reaction is going to be you know immediately defensive what me i'm not a racist
and then they start doing some self-examination here but you immediately put that person on
the defensive and disoriented that person and then that puts you in an advantageous position
for how the how the argument is going to go or how the proceedings are are going to go so
each of these has a story but how racism sexism privilege and structural in structural racism
are used right now there is a a worked out academic literature over the last now two generations and
so these do come to be terms of art and it is part of a strategy about how to use these words
to advance certain rhetorical goals and those are in the context of a certain kind of broader
ideological goal as well so i don't know if we want to drill down into those more specifically
you know maybe structural racism would be a good one to examine or the concept of privilege
but i will follow your lead on that well the way you explained how it puts people on the
back foot puts them on the defensive hmm i'm wondering whether some of the the key words
that many people have noticed in contemporary culture words like diversity for example or
inclusion or equity some of those just sound attractive it seems like they can work like
a Trojan horse so they're a way of sneaking in almost by stealth some prior or fundamental
assumed concepts that not everyone has really thought about deeply and yet those words get them
in and that's a new vantage point to attack from do you think that's exactly right exactly right
for sure in some cases these are you know technical terms of art and there's a whole
package of associated beliefs and assumptions that are that are built into it and the the people
who are coining these terms that's what academics do in their areas of expertise they always are
choosing words carefully you know because and part of it is if you're trained in rhetoric you know
you sometimes can't nakedly state what your position is about you have to come up with an
attractive label and at the same time you know that many of the labels that are out there and are
popular or have cachet in the culture are coming from a different philosophical tradition
and you want to get those ones taken off the table so to speak and one way of doing that is by
hollowing them out and one way that typically happens is you know here's a word that's now
has a current understanding and then you will just add an adjective to that and then that
adjective brings with it a certain number of assumptions and it sounds like you're just engaging
in the debate but over time the adjectives assumptions comes to dominate and this part
gets hollowed out so I think structural racism is a very good example of that or the concept
of privilege as it is used now the concept of diversity which has a genuine meaning equity
is a another new kid on the block those are all very good examples of exactly that strategy
and we find strangely as well that these words end up in practice meaning almost the opposite of the
kind of untutored reading of them so diversity ends up being no we don't do diversity of thought
it's very much a monoculture that's right that's right so the standard liberal arts ideal
embraces diversity because it understands from the get-go that individuals are individuals you
know partly it's that we are different in many respects as individuals so we have to be respectful
of individual diversity but also the world is very complicated and there's a lot of things
we don't know yet so built into the liberal education model is that people are going to come
up with diverse interpretations of the world as they are working them out and so we need to respect
and in some cases tolerate a lot of diversity of individuality and a lot of diversity of opinion
and so that is a beautiful concept and that is the established concept but then if you come along
and you have a very different philosophical agenda that is one of the concepts that you need to
hollow out and replace with a different understanding of diversity and that's what has
been happening over the last two centuries not the two generations yeah i'm wondering whether
based on what some concerned teachers have been expressing to me privately
have we seen a hollowing out of the term education itself some people are starting to
feel like there are institutions increasingly which on the face of it aim at education but
really are aiming at some form of indoctrination yes no that that's exactly right so we're having
a huge philosophical ideological battle over over what education should be
and to a large extent it's also a politicized battle not only because government funding of
education is is a significant part of the story in the modern world so yeah so we do as teachers
and as parents and i would say parents are going to become increasingly important in this generation
because you know for the century or so we have as parents been able to assume that education
is a certain thing and that there are people who are experts and that they are benevolent and we
can you know turn our kids over to them and give them hundreds of thousands of pounds to to do
something significant with my my children and now parents i think are are properly realizing no
i need to do some rethinking about about what's going on here so what what is education and i
think the the word you use indoctrination is the right word to contrast it too so indoctrination
used to have a bad label because the idea there is there is a doctrine a doctrine and it is set
it is known and the people in charge of of education they know what it is and as the word
mean illiterate you take the doctrine and you put it in the students and the students are
conceived of as being more passive they they absorb it they don't question it and then they
regurgitate it in the approved kinds of forms now that model of education of course it's it's
ancient but it does seem that it's coming back in a new form in in our in our current generation
it's for all of the reasons that that we've we've been talking about is there such a thing as a
doctrine that i believe and i'm committed to no matter what an important thing for me as a teacher
is that this gets into the students heads and i will use any tactics or any techniques to make
sure that that one doctrine gets in their heads to the extent that you go down that road and all
of us in the privacy of our own minds as teachers we make this strategic choice but i think to the
extent that any individual teacher goes down that road they are profoundly irresponsible
they should not go into education and i think to the extent that those of us who are fellow
teachers parents in any sort of position of power on school boards and so forth
have as part of our moral responsibility not to let indoctrinators become teachers in the
first place of course there's a trial period if we're going to give them tenure at some point
not give them them tenure it's a total ultimate sabotage of of education i think what you've
described there about the threat of growing indoctrination in education rings true for many
people working in schools and universities seeing this happening around them but they aren't sure
what to do about it what would your advice be for people wanting to resist it it's a very difficult
question because people don't want to end up in my position for example sacked over what many
people regard as a free speech issue even though there might be many people who want to speak out
they're not sure what an effective way to do it is yeah well i would say the the first thing is
be confident in yourself realize that you are a good person you are a reasonable person and i
think anybody who is committed to being a parent anybody in our generation as a young
person has decided they want to become a teacher i think the default position in in the vast majority
of cases is because you are a good person you know what it is to be a racist maybe not you
don't have all of the history and all of the psychology what sexism is what what unfairness
is so trust your own judgment on all of those issues and uh of course we're lifelong learners
all of those cliches and so on but don't let anybody who wants to sabotage your sense of your
moral worth and your competence as a rational adult uh have any space in your in your psyche
at all when you recognize that you're dealing with a person like that recognize a need or
something smells wrong here and that the problem is with the other person and then of course be
benevolent be civil to the extent that you think you're dealing with this kind of person but don't
let them get under your skin i think that's the the most important thing i think the second thing
is to recognize and realize that you are more powerful than you think uh as soon as your peers
and your students your peers as teachers your peers in the broader education community
we're all very good at sizing each other up are you a decent person are you a smart person
are you passionate about your your field are you a fair-minded person and so on
uh your reputation will give you more power than you think even in the case where and this
this should happen in education that we have disagreements about all kinds of important things
political religious social right and and so forth that as long as people know that you are a decent
smart well-meaning person they will cut you a lot of slack and even if they're one of the
quieter ones who's not or not as much interested in speaking up and so forth to the extent that you
speak up you are you're putting forth reasonable positions you're listening to the opposition
you're responding and so forth you will have more influence than you think you might otherwise
you might otherwise have so that's partly a point about self-confidence but it's also of course a
point about courage and we all know that we want to particularly if we are decent people we want to
get along with people we want to to build win-win relationships and so it is a little bit unsettling
to be attacked and to realize that at some point we do have to stand up on principle and fight for
our values so the virtue of courage that the philosophers at least all the good philosophers
have returned to generation after generation is an important one important one to attend to
now necessarily mean to go on you know martyr yourself right right off the bat you have to
choose your battles carefully but ultimately we all do need to work on our courage as well
and to be willing to fight for our important values particularly in our profession's educational
values all of our careers it's it's part of the job yeah i think that's absolutely key and
sometimes courage or fortitude is more important than prudence and it's the the primary virtue
for that reason i think people underestimate what impact one person displaying it can have there's
a knock on effect it's a little bit like if you look at the nature documentaries if the whole
herd turns on a predator all at once then that's it the the wolf won't chase the bison
but if they all flee suddenly the wolf is emboldened so you need people to stand together
and sometimes it takes one or two to be able to get a turn of face and i don't think appeasement
exactly right compromise is likely to work in many cases because of the nature of the ideology
you're dealing with we're all familiar with the example of a tank man in Tiananmen Square
exactly the the arresting image of uh uh i think it was Boris Yeltsin in uh red scare jumping on
top of the the tank you know both involving tanks but that one individual willing to stand up and they
i'm drawing a line here that does embolden huge numbers of other people in this and is very inspiring
some of what we've been saying so far is broadly pessimistic in that we've been looking at problems
do you think that there might be some causes for hope on the horizon some solutions oh yeah
absolutely yes we've been uh diagnosing diagnosing some very negative friends uh for for much of
this this discussion here but i am ultimately optimistic about this i do think it's going to be
ugly and to some extent brutal for the next five years to 10 years i'm not going to do too much
crystal ball gazing because we're in the midst of the the battle right now but what i'm optimistic
about is uh is several things one is uh 10 years ago or 15 years ago very few people realized
that they had a battle on their hands largely the the groundwork was being laid for a lot of these
movements but now everybody around the world knows there's a battle they know what the issues are
and people are getting up to speed on them on them very quickly and to uh to a large extent you know
it's true about sunlight being the best disinfectant to a large extent these pathological movements
have been able to uh do their work in the dark without people realizing but now that we are
aware shining the light on them they are a lot of them in defensive mode they have fairly radical
ambitions but now they're backpedaling and saying oh no we're saying is this that and the other thing
and that's a a sign that's a good sign uh i do think uh technologically there's a lot to be
optimistic about uh i'm a great believer in the power of the internet of course there's a huge
amount of crap out there but young people especially who are much more uh have much more
facility right with these devices to the extent that they recognize they are getting crap in their
formal schooling uh they're still young people and they go off and they've got a huge amount of
awesome wonderful beautiful stuff at low cost available to them and the more intellectually
curious of them are going to go off and do so and then of course uh the all of the new technologies
really are bringing the cost of education down enormously that's it's amazing the the reduction
in the cost of of educational materials and educational delivery systems and they're also
enabling uh all sorts of people who have some entrepreneurial ambitions but are thinking in
education to do all sorts of experimenting with alternative uh mod models of education and so
on so the fact that things have gone downhill so badly and so much of the formal education
system is spawning a kind of entrepreneurial revolution early stages but i'm optimistic
about that the main thing though i'm optimistic about though is uh uh it's more philosophical you
know human beings are are human beings and particularly young people when i think it is
natural for young people to be energetic and ambitious and wants to do something significant
and meaningful with their with their lives i think that's built into human conditions and
i think it takes a lot to sabotage that uh and and to undercut it and i think a lot of times
human beings young human beings they've already got good resources psychologically and physically
and hopefully a social support network when they are experiencing the negativity they know
how to shut it out they know how to develop their own resources and look elsewhere for for healthy
healthy developments and i do you know you're speaking from a british context i'm from a north
american context you know here we live in extraordinarily rich societies with so many
opportunities out there so many resources available to us but i think uh the the next generation of
younger people come up they will be affected by the negative trends but that's that's sad but at
the same time they do need to learn about them and be aware of them but they will become better
armed and they will have the energy and the resources available to go off and do awesome stuff so
ultimately i'm i'm i'm excited about the future yeah i think lots of people share that excitement
and it might not be going too far to say that the internet could have perhaps an even greater
impact on education than the invention of the printing press did i hope we see something coming
from that i think your your excitement about the internet's potential is definitely well placed
great yep good good thanks for giving such detailed answers to the questions i think
taking together those will provide many people with some important clarity about these topics
that concern so many uh where can people find out more about you and your work
well i do have a personal slash professional website it's just stevenhicks.org
and then you know my commentary is on various things short and long and then my publications
and so on typically end up there at some point so i would recommend that as as a starting point
but let me also say to you thank you for for being an example of integrity your name is now
known around the world for for your your commitment to education and not being
willing to back down so i'm glad to know you and thank you for inviting me onto your show
it's been a pleasure and you're welcome i've got no regrets because as i said in an interview i
felt that the career had vanished before my eyes while i was doing it and uh for me it's
fundamentally about integrity and what kind of institutions we leave to future generations
yeah well said thank you very much it's been a pleasure to speak with you all right for me too
thanks
