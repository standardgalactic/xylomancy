So, this is the philosophy of Max Scheller, introduction to the life of Max Scheller.
He was a German social and ethical philosopher.
He was born in Munich on August 22, 1874.
His mother was Jewish and his father a Lutheran.
However, he joined the Roman Catholic Church maybe because of its concept of love,
one of the concepts that Max Scheller developed in his philosophy.
He studied medicine and philosophy in Munich and in Berlin
and he received his doctorate at Vienna University in 1897.
Or he taught from 900, the year 900 up to 1906.
In 1901, Scheller became a lecturer at the University of Vienna
and stayed there until that particular year 1906.
So, from 1907 to 1910, he was professor at Munich
and met some of the disciples of Hussar.
And with their influence, his thinking turned to phenomenology.
He became acquainted with expanding phenomenological movement
but he kept a notably independent position from phenomenology.
In 1910, he retired from teaching and retired to Berlin
and wrote his major works.
In 1917, he joined the German Foreign Office
as a diplomat in Geneva and at the Hague.
And in 1919, he became professor and chair of philosophy
and sociology at the University of Cologne.
During this period of productivity, which ended around 1921,
he became renowned in Germany and elsewhere
for an unusual amount of publications.
Perhaps one of the most prolific writers
of the phenomenological movement is Max Scheller,
second to Edwin Hussar.
After that, his fame reached a worldwide proportion
documented by the many invitations extended to him
to lecture in Paris, in Japan, in Russia,
and in the United States.
In 1920, he became a pacifist
and repudiated the horrors of war
and was converted to Roman Catholicism.
But about 1924,
he turned to a more pantheistic view of ban in the world
and left Catholicism.
In the early 1920s, he went to the University of Frankfurt
where he also lectured there.
And he died on May 19, 1928.
His widow was the devoted curator
of thousands of post-humans manuscripts
until she passed away in 1969.
As a phenomenologist, Scheller sought to discover
the essence of mental attitudes
and the relation to their objects,
in that he will develop in his major work,
therefore, melismos.
He differed from Hussar in his readiness to assign
an independently real status to the objects.
Remember that Hussar took objects
to be the intentional objects
of our consciousness.
At the development of his thought,
the first period of Scheller's thought
centered on the incontrovertible value
of the individual person and value ethics,
centered on the non-formal or material ethics,
which is opposed to the formal ethics proposed
by Immanuel Kant.
This position of Max Scheller
is founded in his major work,
formalism in ethics
and non-formal ethics of values,
a new attempt toward the foundation
of ethical personalism.
That's the entire title of his work.
In the first part of his value ethics,
he established the values,
he established that values are correlates
of three types of feelings.
Feelings in the body, feelings of life
and personal feelings.
Moral experience cannot be divorced
from feeling values as such.
And in the second part,
he showed that each person was a unique self-value.
Personal self-value must be accounted for
in all variable moral situations.
So here in the first part of his ethics
and his formalismos,
he established the notion of values,
values as objects of our emotions,
of our feelings.
But in doing that,
he also criticized the formal ethics
of Immanuel Kant.
And we're going to discuss that later.
So in the second part
of this value ethics,
he focused on the nature of the person,
the exemplary persons.
The nature or the theory of the nature of the person
is a new and most interesting analysis.
The series was also developing
a kind of ethical personalism.
He showed that our being a person
is the form of our mind and our consciousness.
No matter whether the mind and consciousness
are understood to be human,
divine, or just fictional.
We developed his idea of the ideal
moral person.
However, in the second period of his career,
after writing the formalismos,
Scheller developed a more comprehensive
anthropology
that works on the vitalism and pantheism.
And he set out to determine
what he called the meta-anthropological
status of humanity.
And this he developed in his work
Man's Place in the Cosmos,
or Man's Place in the Universe,
which was published in 1928
after his death.
So it was published post-Yomusli.
Remember that he died
around May of that year.
Scheller in that book,
which is actually a very thin book,
offered a graduate view of being.
In his view, man, God,
and the world
are one self-becoming cosmic process
in absolute time.
And this process of self-becoming
has two poles.
The guys and the drunk.
The guys, meaning spirit,
and the drunk, meaning the life-hearts.
The guys, according to Scheller,
is powerless
unless its ideas can
functionalize with life factors,
meaning with material conditions
that realize their actualities.
And the one that can provide
the guys with power,
with vitality,
is the drunk.
So the drunk is the source of life,
the source of vitality.
But the drunk does not have any direction.
So it is the guys
that provides direction.
So the guys is the source of direction,
source of the ideas,
source of reason,
but it is powerless,
does not have any vitality at all.
The drunk on the other hand
is the source of vitality,
but it does not have any direction at all.
So when you combine it to,
then you have both vitality
and direction.
Thank you.
So,
now Scheller ford a particular
kinship to
introspective and intuitive philosophers,
like Blaise Pascal.
And it was also
was actually from Blaise Pascal
that he borrowed the notion
of reason of the heart
or logic decor
which would
be very prominent
in his articulation of
our understanding
or feeling of the values.
So he preferred
these introspective and intuitive philosophers
more than the abstract theories
about morality and God.
These tendencies
become the basis of criticisms
against Scheller's
emotive philosophy
that his ethics is emotive.
It's based on
the emotions,
on the feelings
and no less than
Karol Vitiva was critical
of the philosophy of Max Scheller
although Max Scheller influenced
a lot the phenomenology
or the way Vitiva understands
phenomenology.
Because there are other
philosophers who also influence
his view about this
about the intuitive
about
at introspective power
philosophers like
Nietzsche, Bergzon
and Delthai.
So these philosophers also influence
this orientation
of Max Scheller.
Of course, the other
philosopher who influenced Max Scheller
was Edmund Pusser
and
Emanuel Kant because she studied Emanuel Kant
although he was critical
of the ethics of Emanuel Kant.
The other philosophers or thinkers
who have Scheller's thinking includes
those thinkers in the history of philosophy
who demonstrated
their phenomenological orientation
like Saint Augustine
and other Oriental philosophers.
His other works
also showed the result
of Kantian and post Kantian influence.
As I mentioned
here, there are formalismos
although it was a critique
of Kant's formal ethics
he nevertheless agreed with Kant
on certain points
and we are going to discuss that later.
The influence of
phenomenology
especially Husser
account for Scheller's interest
on empirical research
and in metaphysics.
So those are
the important influences
in the philosophy of Max Scheller.
Now let's go to his
methodology.
Of course
he strongly emphasized the
phenomenological method
which at a time was being
formally developed by Husser
and
he also actually acclaimed this
in his dark formalismos.
He first came in contact
with the movement when he moved
to the University of Munich in 1907
as we have already mentioned
and there he met some of the students
of Husser.
So he was
attracted to this
movement or to this approach
of philosophy.
Although
he applied the
phenomenological method
not on epistemology
the way Husser applied
phenomenology
but he applied it to
axiology, to
ethics or to values
and to his notion
of the human person.
Scheller is firmly convinced
that phenomenology would bring about
basic transformation
in our way of conceiving
the world and ourselves.
Although
some consider it is thought to be quite
unsystematic
Scheller was one of the most insightful
and acutely intuitive
and brilliant thinkers and writers
of the early 20th century
and his works
are bound with
detailed description of the
several states of consciousness
like sympathy which he has a
book on
resentment
of love and joy.
So here are some
of the important
works of Max Scheller
on resentment and
moral value judgment
published in 1912
and then
contributions to the phenomenology
and theory of sympathy in of love
in eight the following year
1913
and then he's there
formalismos and non-formal
ethics of values
1913
and then man's place
in nature or man's place in the cosmos
posumously published
in 1928 and
man in the age of equalization
published
in 1929. So these last two
are posumously
published.
Now let's go to his
theory of values
and here we are going to
zero in on the
formalismos
and it would be nice
it would help if you're going to
read at least the first
chapter of the formalismos
for you to better understand
his theory of values.
Now in that book
the formalismos Scheller explained
that one ought to do
what one ought to do
presupposes a feeling
of the value of what
ought to be done.
Now this ought
is actually
the concept of duty
of Immanuel Kant.
So he's referring to
the concept of duty
the categorical imperative
of Immanuel Kant.
In according to Scheller
what we ought to do
our understanding
of what of duty
presupposes a feeling
of the value of what
ought to be done.
In other words the feeling
is more primordial than
the understanding of
the duty
because for Scheller
even if you know
that
we ought to do our duties
if you don't have the feeling
of value of that duty
we will never do it.
So it presupposes that we already
have a feeling
of the duty.
That feeling of the duty
is based on our values.
Now he divided the values into
five ranks which are given a priori
so for him
the values are a priori
and they don't pass to experience
that fulfills the requirement
of Kant that for something
to be universal
it must be a priori.
So if you apply the idea
of a priori
that the universal
must be a priori
by saying that values
are given a priori
then that means the values are universal.
And these values
are anchored
in our
ordo amoris
or the order or logic of the heart
logic decor.
And this logic of the heart
is not congruent
to the logic based on reason.
So aside from the logic
of reason
Scheller adds another thing
the logic of the heart.
And the reason of the heart
cannot be understood
by reason, by pure reason
by the intellect.
And in this view Scheller
follow the idea of the
French philosopher Blaise Pascal
and of course oppose himself
to the ideas or to the position
of Immanuel Kant.
According to this view
moral acts
and deeds
are individual
and they originate in an individual's
pre-rational
preferring of values.
Meaning
before we can rationalize
about values
we already prefer the values
before we can even understand
before we can even reason out
about values.
We already have certain preference
tendency
for values.
So we will
explain that in details
in the later part.
So moral experience lies in the
what he calls the call of the hour
of the moment
in which the a priori ranking
among values
become individually transparent.
So in a particular
moment we're going
how we value things
will become transparent
it will manifest itself.
No matter how much the order
amoris may be distorted
by the feelings of the sentiment
of hate and other passions.
We will go back to this later.
Now let's go to the first part
of the derpal balismos
because in the first part of the derpal
balismos
it is where Scheller
presented his criticism
of Kant's formal ethics.
By the way
when you say non-formal ethics
it means material ethics.
Material here
pertains to
the non-rational
So the formal is rational
that's the
that's the position of
Emmanuel Kant
reason, pure reason
practical reason. So it's formal.
And the
non-formal
the non-rational
is regarded by Kant
as
empirical
or material.
So
Scheller develops his theory
of values
in the realm of the material
in the realm of the non-formal
what is that material
non-formal in the realm
of the emotions.
So Scheller's
theory of values and ethics
would be in fact incomprehensible
without taking
into consideration his criticisms
of Kant's view of ethics.
Because in the first part
of the derpal balismos
he was
commenting
and critiquing
the formalism of Emmanuel Kant.
Although he agreed with Kant
on certain points
and therefore the derformalismos
in the derformalismos
Scheller preoccupied himself
with a lengthy criticism
of Kant's formal ethics
and built much of his own ideas
on these
or from these criticisms
he said
in the stages of the derformalismos
in this work
I can accomplish my task only through
revealing Kant's
erroneous presuppositions
and by replacing them
with correct ones.
That's how ambitious
the project of Scheller is
in this
work the derformalismos.
Scheller though agreed with Kant
on certain points.
Scheller's agreed with Kant
when Kant rejected all ethics
of goods and purposes.
What is an ethic
of goods and purposes?
Well, it's a kind of ethics that bases
the morality of
action or morality itself
on purposes.
Remember the teleological
theories on ethics.
So Kant
rejected all teleological
theories
on ethics.
Because these ethics base morality
on purposes on uncertain goods
like for example
you want to be happy
if what you're doing will make you happy
happiness is something good
then your
action is
ethical.
But Kant rejected
that kind of ethics
that he rejected
that kind of ethics
that Scheller agreed with Kant
in his rejection
of this kind of ethics
of goods and purposes.
So according to Scheller
Kant was correct
when he refuted all ethics
starting with the question
what is the highest good
or what is the final purpose
of all our volitional
co-nation.
So he agreed with
Kant on that point
and he said was correct
in dismissing them
as having false basis.
So Scheller wrote
in the der formalismus
and I'm quoting him here
I quote
Kant maintained
that whenever we make
the goodness
or moral depravity
of a person
and act will
and deed etc.
in relation to a realm of existing goods
or evils
posited as real
we make the goodness or depravity
of the will
dependent on the particular
contingent existence
of the realm of goods
as well as on its experiential
noability.
So he agreed with Kant
that we cannot base our
the moral goodness
or the
moral depravity
of a particular act
on the basis of a realm
of goods
because this realm of goods
is based on
experience
and anything that is
based on experience or empirical
cannot be permanent
it will be changing
and therefore you cannot base your morality on that
so you agreed with Kant on that point.
Kant further added
that the moral value of the will
would always depend
on the way in which
it intervened
in the maintenance or promotion
of this realm of goods.
However
since this realm of goods
is continually changing
in history
because this realm of goods
is contingent
it's empirical
the moral value of the will
would also be changing
so like for example let us say
God yet
belong to this realm of good
so if you're going to base our
or fame for example
or power for example
but this realm of goods
they keeps on changing in history
so that means
that the value of the will would also be changing
the destruction of this realm of goods
would also mean
the dissolution of the idea
of the moral value
so with these presuppositions
ethics would be
based on sensible experience
and therefore it would only be empirical
and
it will only have inductive
validity
and remember that for a can
validity should be universal
a knowledge should be universal
that's why he said
that morality should be based on the moral law
the moral law is something that is universal
the moral law
is a priori
so the a priori
is that which is universal
so if we base
our morality on a realm of goods
that will be changing
continuously
in history
then
morality will also be changing
the same holds true
if ethics will be based on purposes
on the end
dialogues
any ethics which measures the moral value
of the will against the final purpose
like
you want to be happy
or
you want to be
say
useful
that would necessarily degrade
the values of the goods and evil
to mere technical values
subordinated to that purpose
so
Scheller echoes when he wrote
and again echoed
ethics must reject
all talk of good and bad purposes
for purposes as such
are never
good nor bad
when considered apart from the value
that are to be realized
in positing them
and apart from the values of the act
that posits them
remember that for Kant
there's only one thing that is good
without any qualification
and that is the good will
so therefore we cannot base ethics
on any purpose
because these purposes
may change
it may be good
under certain condition
but remember for Kant
the good must be good
without any condition
and the only thing that is good
without any condition
is the good will
so on this point
Scheller agreed with Immanuel Kant
purposes
are justifiable only when they will
posits
or has posited them
is good
and the only will that can posit
it to be good is the good will
what makes a purpose
good or bad is not the particular
realization of that purpose
but the very positing
or the manner or faces
in which the purpose has come
about
so he agreed with Kant
on those points
however
he refuted Kant
when Kant assume
that the material
or non-formal ethics
which is also an ethic
of goods and purposes
when Kant assume
that
non-formal ethics is also
an ethic of goods and purposes
because Kant
distinguish only
formal
or non-formal
and he included
the non-formal
ethics to ethics
of goods and purposes
so for Kant
the only ethics
that is
viable and acceptable
is a formal ethics
he dismissed the material
or non-formal ethics
Kant believe
that an ethic preceded
by correct methods must exclude
impressive positions
of the concept of good and bad
and the constitution
not only goods and purposes
but also all values
of non-formal nature
so he said
in general
absolutely
Kant rejected
all kinds of values
of non-formal nature
meaning the values that are not
rational
and again he called
all practical principles
which suppose an object
meaning a material
of the faculty of desire
the desire is emotion
at the determining ground of the will
are without exception empirical
and can furnace as
no practical loss
and by practical
by material of the
practicality of desire
I mean an object whose reality
is desired
that's from practical reason
so it's
Scheller quoting Kant
in practical reason
so here
according
to Scheller
Kant eroniously assume
that any material
or non-formal ethics
must necessarily be an ethics
of goods and purposes
in that such ethics
is empirically inductive
and aposteriori
an ethics of success
is an ethics that is
hedonistic, heteronus
and it is an ethics that is incapable
of determining
the moral foundation of action
and is incapable
of fornising insight
into the dignity of the person
so that's the position
of Kant and that is the position
that Scheller
rejected
so on the contrary according
to Scheller
the rejection of an ethics of goods
or purposes
does not imply a rejection
of concrete values
Kant thought that we can or he can exclude
from consideration
the value which represent themselves
in goods
but this would be correct
if instead of finding their fulfillment
in autonomous
phenomena
the value concepts
are to be obstructed from the goods
or if one
could derive them only
from actual effects
an ethics of material
values does not
necessarily presuppose
empirical knowledge
because as
Scheller would show
how the material
values are not
known
through empirical knowledge
but they are also
a priori
meaning they are also universal
so Scheller elevated
material values
in the same level as
ideas
as formal concepts
because for Kant
you have the concepts, you have the laws
the formal laws, the moral law
universal
and the material values
they are empirical
but according to Scheller
no, the material values
are also a priori
they are not
empirical
right?
so Scheller also rejected Kant's
identification of the
a prioristic
with the rational
the material or non formal
with the sensual or a posteriori
because for Kant
so this is the rational
this is the formal and it is
a priori
the material or non formal
is a posteriori
empirical
right?
that's the position of Kant
and Scheller rejected that
position so why can't
believe that a material
ethic must refer to the
organization of the
agotistic crimes
of human nature as found
in all ethical valuation
Scheller
believed otherwise
so he
refuted the claim of Kant
that only formal ethics
avoids the
fallacies committed by
non formal or material ethics
so Scheller believed that
this fallacies
can also be avoided
this agotistic
this agotistic valuation
can also be
avoided by
non formal or material
ethics
so now the main purpose now
of Scheller is to show
that an ethic of material
values which
Kant rejected
by no means
to the conclusion
rich rich rich by
Kant
he developed an ethical theory
based on the inside
that material values
and their hierarchical order
form
a realm
of material
aprioristic data
which is disclosed to us
by emotional intuition
so if the formal
if the concepts
if the ideas
are revealed to us by reason
the values
are revealed to us
by way of emotional intuition
and Scheller also wanted to show
that the dichotomy between the sensible
and the intelligible
or between the intelligible
and the emotional
when it comes to knowledge
is not exhaustive
because
that is a separate realm
between the senses
and the intellect
there's something between
what is perceived by the senses
and what is taught
by reason
and this separate realm
is the realm of feelings
that which is felt
the realm of the emotion
so senses
perceive
thought
or intellect
thinks
the emotions
feel
so
he develop his ethics
based on the emotions
based on what is felt
and what is felt
is the value
so the value
is the intentional
object of our emotion
or of our feelings
and this is where
phenomenology would come in
because just like
Scheller who develop
the idea that
the intentional
objects
are the intentional
objects
the ados
or the intentional objects
of our consciousness
for Scheller
the values are the intentional objects
of our emotions
so now let's discuss
the nature of values
so through
the phenomenological approach to ethics
into values in general
Scheller hope to make
the theory of values
impervious in the criticisms
of relativism
and of the behavioral sciences
we wanted
this theory
this theory of values
immune
from the criticisms
of Kant
so according to him
many emotions have objective
preference
meaning intentional
objects
he stress that the belief that emotions are
purely subjective states
of consciousness
is based on an erroneous description
or misanalysis
or misunderstanding
of their structure
people believe
that emotion is just
a subjective
emotional state
or states of consciousness
now according to Scheller
although some moods
do not go beyond
themselves
the experience of a value
is usually
an intentional act
which is parallel to perception
and conception of ideas
so in perception
we have the material object
in conception we have
the ideas
in the emotion we have the values
so the object
the feeling of joy
about a good news
is an experience
which have subjective
and objective points
so joy is not just
a subjective state of consciousness
because there is an objective
point to
this emotion
the object
of that experience
is seen as a good
thing which instantiates
a value
so for example
you have the feeling
of joy
because of the good news
now what is the good news
why is it
a good news
so the news
is something good because
it instantiate
a value
and the value is the objective
point of your emotional
or subjective state
so
the emotion or the feeling of joy
instantiates a value
so it's not only the good news
that will instantiate
that particular value
so therefore according to Scheller
there is no such a thing
as a cognitive emotions
in that point to certain
real objects
cognitive emotions
and of course this cognitive emotion
is not something that is congruent
to the cognitive
reason
now going back to the Order Amoris
or logic of the heart
that he borrowed from Blaise Pascal
so
again in the Darformalismos
he disagreed with Kant's identification
of the a priori
with reason
for Scheller the a priori
extends far beyond
the uses of reason
and therefore included
feeling
the feeling nature of man
within the constitution
of the mind
and posited what he called
emotional a priori
so the mind is not only
formal or rational
the mind
has an emotional component
so that's where he
said
it's connected to what we have already mentioned
that what one ought
to do
which is
the a priori of reason
presupposes the feeling
of the value of one ought
to be done
that's the emotional a priori
so there is the formal
a priori
of duty
and there is the emotional a priori
of the value of that duty
now let's move on to
the Order Amoris
because this is one very important concept
of Mark Scheller
and this is
where he described
how we
recognize
value as a priori
so values are a priori
and these are anchored
on our
our Order Amoris
or the order or logic
of the heart
and again as we've said
this is not something that is congruent
to the order of reason
to the formal
part of our mind
and again
as we've said this is what he
borrowed from
Reis Pascal
according to this view
moral acts or deeds
are individual
and they originate
in our own pre-rational
prefering of values
now what is this pre-rational
prefering of values
in the ordinary sense when we say
prefering or preference
it may mean
choosing something
over something else
but in Scheller's
terminology
when you say prefering
it pertains to a
pre-rational act
it's an act
that happens
prior to making a rational
or deliberate choice
between one
between two or more
different things
so when
when we make a decision
or a rational decision
we analyze which one
will I choose
we deliberate
we
enumerate
we think of several reasons
why choose this
but in pre-rational prefering
before you can even think
of these things
before you can even deliberate
you already have
certain tendency
you already lean towards
something before you can
even make a choice
so this leaning towards something
has already taken place
in us
even before we make a choice
so we may for example
lean towards contemporary music
over classical music
before we can even think
of why do we like contemporary music
over classical music
or we may prefer
a particular color
we prefer say
color blue
over some other colors
why is that
well
we can think later on
and that's already the rational
deliberate
choice
I want blue because
because of this and that
or I want red because of this and that
but even before you do that
you already have some leaning
towards something
so in such cases
we inadvertently experience
a drift
or propensity towards something
rather than something else
so there is a pre-rational
preferring of contemporary music
over classical music
or
pre-rational preferring
of certain colors
over other colors
now
this leaning towards something
may accompany us for a long time
or even for our entire life
or it may take different directions
during our middle age
or when we grow old
now another parallelism
in our visual perception
we do not choose to see the light
that makes things visible to us
rather our sense of sight
possesses a pre-visual
tendency or trend
towards light
towards what is lit up or bright
there is a pre-visual
preference
to light
rather than darkness
that's pre-visual
and there is also pre-rational
so love is in the sense
analogous to light
love has an intrinsic bent
towards other higher values
than those that were
merely given to us
no matter whether or not
love will realize them
so we prefer
certain values over other values
now
the more experience lies in the call of the hour
in which the a priori ranking
of values becomes
individually apparent
no matter how much the order of more
may be distorted by feelings
or sentiment of hate
or other passions
in other words
there is already a pre
or an a priori ranking
of values
meaning it is not the person
who ranks these values
but values themselves
are already ranked
there is an objective ranking
of values
and these values are
the value of the senses
meaning
the value of what is pleasant or unpleasant
or maybe
what is enjoyable
or not enjoyable
in the physical or bodily sense
the value of life
whether something
is noble or common
the value of the spirit
which is divided into two
the aesthetic values of ugly
and beautiful
the value of knowledge
and then the value
of religion
or the religious values
the value of the holy and unholy
so
if you are going to rank them in ascending order
it will follow this
the lowest would be
the value of bodily comfort
or the pleasure values
and then
higher than the
bodily comforts
the value of the senses would be
the pragmatic values of usefulness
these two lower ranks
of values are
either manageable or calculable
and divisible
excessive cultivation of them
as happens in modern society
this unites people
so this is the lower value
the higher value is
the value
that contains life values
they belong to what is noble
and life values
but
life values pertinent to caries
are only with persons
and then the highest
values
the two highest value ranks
are experienced exclusively
in human personal feelings
the value of the spirit
and the religious values
okay so here
rank of mental values
of justice
beauty
and the cognition of truth
ranking of values
and then the highest of the value would be
the value of
the religious feelings
the holy or the unholy
so fourth
seller
the values are already
rank
there is an objective ranking
of values
no matter how our feelings
or our resentment
or hate
may distort them
some people who are resentful
may think of the value
of beauty
as lower
as lower than for example
the value of
say
usefulness
okay
or the pleasurable
say
we may say justice
the value of justice
is of course one of the highest values
but some people will say
well the value of justice is lower than
the value for example
of pleasure or comfort
okay
alright
now I will stop there if you have some questions
yes
yes Alex
yes Alex it's good
Doc may randin po ba siyang
concept
na parang kaykant na logiver
kasi po di ba sabi po ninyo
nakaramp na po yung mga values
sino po yung nag-rank
po yung mga values noyan
if you think of the
logiver in the context
or same as Kant
it does not say that there is
this logiver
it's simply that in reality
there is this values
okay
so even Kant does not say
that the values are rank
accordingly based on the logiver
can't only say that
there is the moral law and that's the
this moral law is the highest
of the laws
but as to the lower values
where it came from
it's part of reality
the values are
we just not say that values are created
values are there
they are part of our human experience
you can only stress that as well
because humans
are created
and part of his existence are the values
then the values must also
been created by a higher being
but Scheller would not say that
he simply accept it as
it's part of our experience
it's part of the human reality
okay, any questions?
oh, dami palo rito
since there is already a
pre-establish of real rank values
in the rank
no
it's not about
immoral or being moral
this is not an ethics
this is not an ethics that talks about
what is moral or immoral
na na na
we are
you are mixing things
things up
he's not talking of
moral or immoral here
of course
he talks about evil
when later on
you're going to see that if you
evil would be the preference
for a lower value
okay
but it's not talking of
immoral
in the
what you call this
in the Christian sense of being immoral
that it's a sin
it's evil
meaning if there is
no congruence
uh
if our
if our ranking of values
is not congruence, is not in conformity
with
with the ranking of values
then there's something evil in it
there's something negative in it
but not in the
in the Christian sense of being a sin
okay
other questions
alright, no more
now you have one minute
to answer if you are listening
to my lecture
one minute to reply
if you don't reply one minute
that means you are not following my discussion
may
may kindly take note
take note of those who replied
saki po do
okay, thank you
alright, so
that's my way of checking
if you are listening to my discussion
if you are still here or you just
plug in
we know some people are dais
so
so many here
but 37
alright, let's continue
values as intentional
objects of feelings
so again
recall the notion
of intentional objects of consciousness
of who's heart
okay, so consciousness
is always consciousness of something
and
the consciousness has
intentional objects
now, shella adopted this thesis
of
who's heart
that the ideal objects of knowledge
are independent
of the knowing subject
so the ideal objects of knowledge
these are the intentional objects
of our consciousness
so
shella adopted this idea
and he applied this
to his
disclosure of the realm of values
just as there are
intentional objects of knowledge
the ideal objects of knowledge
we contended
that there are also intentional objects
of feelings
and what are these intentional objects of feelings
the values
right
so the
ideal objects of knowledge are a priori
and the values are also
a priori
so what are values
these are particular class of ideal
objects
are objective, eternal
and immutable
so values
are given to us as intentional
objects of our feelings
just as colors
are
the objects of our
visual perception
so concepts
are objects of our thoughts
okay
colors and the other
material qualities
are the objects of our senses
values
are the objects of our feelings
and just like
the concepts
they are objective
eternal
and immutable
so
the modes in which
values are knowable to us
are beyond the grasp
of the intellect
so the intellect grasp
our grasp
the
the essence for example
the ideas
the values
are grasped by
our feelings
how our feelings
are grasped
by our emotion
is beyond
the understanding of
the intellect or reason
it has its own reason
that reason cannot understand
so according to Scheller
just as
the ear
is blind
to color
okay
so the intellect
is blind
to the values
so the emotional aspects of the mind
feelings
preferring
loving, hating, willing
because these are
the emotional acts
the mind has its own acts
the intellect rather
emotional acts
apprehension, judgment
analyzing, criticking
disputing
the emotional aspects of our mind
have also its own acts
feeling, preferring, loving
hating, willing
and so on
and they are not founded upon cognition
but are of an a priorcy character
in our emotional feeling
for example
this or that particular value quality
why do we prefer this
why do we feel for this
we prefer
our emotion has its own reason
but
reason the intellect
cannot explain why we prefer this
of course later on
you can have your own rational
deliberation why you prefer
contemporary music
over classical music
but according to Scheller
there is a very rational
preferring of this
that cannot be explained by reason
okay
so intentional objects
emotional feeling functions
do not need the intermediary
of the objectifying acts of the intellect
like representing
judging or analysis
in order to come into immediate contact
with their objects
values for example as agreeable
charming
lovely friendly etc
in principle are accessible
to me without
my having to represent them
as properties belonging to
things or men
values are not conceptual terms
which find their fulfillment
in the common properties
of things which are the bearers
of these values for example
when you say
what is
a house
what is your idea
of an institution
what is your idea
of beauty
now when you think of your idea
of beauty then you are going to come up
with certain common characteristics
but why do you find
this thing beautiful
can you give
an enumeration
of common properties of things
according to Scheller when you do that
sometimes you end up
empty handed
because when you say
I find this charming
and then I also find this thing charming
and then I also find this charming
but when you look at these things
they have nothing in common
why do you consider this
to be agreeable
and this is agreeable also
why do you have that feeling
you cannot give
a reason because
it is beyond
reason
meaning it is not
within the realm of
reason
so according to Scheller
this is shown by the simple
fact that it's time we attempt
to determine such common
properties
of what is charming to us
or lovely or friendly to us
we always end up empty
and dead
even the habitual
or even the ethical values
or aesthetic values like normal, courageous
and as beautiful
becomes accessible
not through a number of defined characteristics
I find this
I find this beautiful
I find this accessible
I have a feeling that this is normal
so that's the point of
of course other philosophers
are critical of this position
but
here's a point here also
so values are independent
of our subjective emotional states
what is our subjective emotional states
like for example when you are sad
sadness
is an emotional state
but the sadness I feel
may involve in me various emotional sentiments
so being broken hearted
being defiant, being composed, jatra
these are our subjective emotional states
now the feeling of sadness remains
while my subjective emotional state
may change
at one point I'm sad
so I become broken hearted
or I am defiant
or may be sad but I'm still composed
moreover the causes
must not be confused
with emotional, with intentional object
the question for example
why am I angry
is entirely different
from
what do I feel
so what do I feel is your
subjective states
why am I angry
what is the object of my anger
anger is the emotion
and what is the object of this anger
it may be something else
that represents
a particular value
so I am angry
because
I was defiant
my instructions
were not followed
so not following instruction
causes me to be angry
but what is it in
this not following
my order that made me angry
so not obeying instruction
not following represents a particular value
that makes me angry
that becomes the object of my anger
because
I'm going to be angry
not only because somebody
defied me
or somebody
did not follow instruction
I may also be angry
because somebody betrayed me
so betrayal
this obedience
they represent a particular value
which is the object of my anger
so a value phenomena
as a value phenomena
values are true objects
and they are different
from all states of feelings
there's a difference between
feeling of sadness
feeling of anger
and the objects
and the values
that are the objects of my
anger or of my sadness
values are independent
of their bearers or carriers
what is this bearer or carriers
these are things or relations
that shell are collectively called
the goods
the goods are
units of value qualities
which instantiates
objectifies
the value in the real world
the value qualities do not change
when these goods
when these bearers
change
so for example
let's use an analogy
let's talk about the color
that's the color blue
now that's the color blue
turns
red
when an object that is blue
becomes red
like for example
a dress
so dress
bears
or carries
the value bears the color
so if this dress
which instantiates
the color blue
becomes red
is now a red
dress
does the color blue
change into red
no
the color blue
remains blue
the color red remains red
but the dress
which instantiates
which is the carrier
or the bearer
of the colors
have changed
okay
so it's not true
that values are affected
by their order
when their bearers
change in value
food is still food
poison is still poison
the value of friendship does not change
even when your friend
changes
so this person
carries the value of friendship
becomes your enemy
he now instantiates
not the value of friendship
he now instantiates the value of an enemy
friendship
did not turn into
being unfriendly
so goods
are value
things
bearers of value
for example
when you go
go inside the church
see the altar
the altar may carry
or may bear certain values
it may have
aesthetic value because it's very beautiful
or it may also bear
the value of the holy
so the altar
is just a bearer of value
it can
insensate the value
of
beautiful
for the value of the holy
so it's like saying
the absence of light
is not
saying darkness
paro pang ganun
what do you mean
parong
mayapubal
other questions
okay that should be
the aprioristic structure
of values
so
sheller made a distinction between
the realm of values
and the realm of goods
and it's assertion that values are
independent of the bearers of values
affirm the correctness of Kant's view
that a philosophical theory of values
or ethics or even aesthetics
must not presuppose things
or goods
they agree on this
they agreed on this sense
on this point
that there is a distinction
between the realm of values
and the realm of goods
that insensate them
for example a particular person
may insensate several values
the values of friendship
the values of courage
the values of health
the values of holy
the values of intelligence
so there is some
independence between the realm of values
and the realm of goods that insensate them
so it does not mean
that for example the value of the holy
turns to be unholy
when a holy person
becomes unholy
it's just that
that person no longer insensates
the value of the holy
so that's the apriori
thing about
this realm of values
now
the aprioristic relation
of values
all values are
either positive or negative
there's no such thing
as a neutral
value
okay
there's always a value
there's always a quality
of worth
positive or negative
the existence
of a positive value
is in itself
positive
the existence of holiness
is positive
the nonexistence
of a negative value
is also positive
so if
for example chaos
or chaos is a negative value
there's no chaos
not something positive
the nonexistence of positive value
and the existence
of a negative value is a negative value
so
nobody's holy
there's no holiness
that's a negative value
it's impossible to evaluate
the same value simultaneously
as both negative and positive
a bearer of value
an object
may insensate
two values
like for example
a person
may insensate both friendship
or love
or insensate hate
but love and hate
cannot be
simultaneous
as a value
good is the value attached to the realization
of a positive or higher value
evil
is the value attached to the realization
of a negative or a lower value
okay
now we're not saying that
that is immoral in the Christian sense
okay
so this is in the actual logical
sense
now
we have already mentioned about the hierarchical
order of values
values constitute
a special domain
with their own distinct relation
and correlation
there is an order or rank
independent
of the realm of values
so we have already talked about
the hierarchy of these values
all values are
non-formal qualities of contents
possessing a determined order
of ranks
with respect to higher or lower
in this order
is independent
of the form of being into its values
and terminating
the carriers
of bearers of these values
or the goods that insensate this value
so again this value model
those values reveal
by sensory feeling, by vital feeling
by the spirit
and by the holy order
or the religious
so this is the ranking
of values of shallow well
some people may criticize
this rank of values
but that's how shallow
ordered
rank
these values
the next topic will be the exemplar persons
as shallow said
we need to
attain
a higher moral status
and the vehicle
for attaining a higher moral status
is an exemplar
meaning a model
so an exemplar
is an ideal
but a nonexistent model
of one of the value ranks
so every value
there is
an exemplar
an ideal model
that manifest
this value
these ideal exemplars
manifest themselves
in historical role models
like for example
in Buddha, Christ
Muhammad, Hannibal
Ronaldo, Joan of Arc
etc
they are our
they are the historical
role models
they manifest the exemplars
the nature of an exemplary person
is authentic
in being exemplary
the moral effectiveness
of exemplary persons
reaches all people directly
regardless of
occupation, vocation
or interest or even culture
so the origin
of becoming good
in concrete practice
lies in the genuine exemplarity
that a particular
person exercises
on others
without deliberately wanting to do so
so for example
consider Christ
we consider
him to be exemplary
and he exercises
or he exercises a particular
influence on us
without really wanting to be
exemplary
such exemplarity occurs
in living persons
so the living persons are the
concrete manifestations
of the ideal
but nonexistent exemplars
meaning nonexistent
well
the same way that values are out there
a priori
they belong to a different realm
the exemplars also belong to a different realm
but they are manifested
in history
so there are also living persons
who
manifest them
okay
but of course
only outlines of ideal persons
which are embedded in our
value feelings
for example
you have your own
ideal boyfriend
or ideal girlfriend
we exist in that
in that ideal world
of yours
but that will be some
living concrete people
who would somehow manifest
this ideal boyfriend
or girlfriend
so
there are empirical model persons
meaning
these are concrete living persons
so manifest our ideal
and the first concrete
empirical model persons
are our parents
so they become
the models for us
and then of course
our models
they grow meaning
they increase
so parents
and some other people can also have
a strong exemplary effect
on us
a teacher
a president
a prince, sage man, artist
performer
an actor perhaps
depending on the particular
culture
it could be the chief of a tribe
or our ancestors
or wise men
masters
in different cultures
but according to him
it is the exemplary holy man
who exercises
the strongest moral influence
in history
like for example Jesus
Muhammad
Buddha
and only other holy men
in history
and what is common among them
is that they did not choose
or explicitly willed
to be exemplary
or were they chosen by those
who freely follow them
genuine role models
or model persons
almost automatically set up
moral standards for other people to follow
so people are drawn
towards them
and are motivated by their exemplaryity
no matter how deeply
or silently
they follow
these role models
or the holy
or moral persons
in contrast to the empirical model persons
an ideal model person
is only an exemplary
outline in our mind
so like your
ideal boyfriend or girlfriend
it's just there in our mind
in the same way
as values do exist
at least they are realized
in materials or
by persons
so all these absolute value types
do not exist
unless their ideal value
is realized
with concrete persons
okay
so your ideal boyfriend or girlfriend
is just there
but it will functionalize
if they are
you have some concrete person
to embody them
so according to Scheller
these ideal outlines should functionalize themselves
with concrete person
now
based on the
values there are five
ideal moral person types
the ideal personifications
of the aforementioned value ranks
so they are the highest
would be the ideal saint
then the ideal genius
then lower the ideal hero
then the ideal leader
of a society or of a civilization
and
then the absolute master
of enjoying sensible pleasures
so these are the ideal
moral person types
and you can think of
of course of
empirical
concrete persons
who may functionalize
these ideal
moral
person types
now in the same sense
as values are experienced relative
to the individual's natures
historical manifestations
of ideal person types may vary
so for example
the ideal hero
would have different appearances
like for example in Yuan of Art
or in Alexander the Great
the ideal artist
may vary
in a bit hoven
or in a Michael Angelo
and even the ideal saints
may vary
subject to the choices
between them
since one can make choices
only among the lower
sorry
but it vary
depending on the religion
but in the latter
the founders of religion
are not subject to choices
between them because
one can make choices only
among the lower types of exemplars
so
if a person converts to
or otherwise begins to abandon
the original faith
now there may be some defection
or even betrayal
something that does not occur when one
makes a choice among the lower
exemplars
so there are many different
there are different
personifications
of these
ideal types
now let's go to the last
topic here
the moral person
what is the moral person
Scheller retains
Kant's understanding of person
as having an absolute
value and end
in itself
remember the
second articulation of the
categorical imperative
treat the person
whether in you or in others
to be not only as a means
but as an end in itself
so Scheller
as we have said
was influenced by Kant
retain that idea of a person
as having
an absolute value
however he is critical of Kant
insofar as Kant grounds the absolute value
of the person in the universal category
of reason
after discussing his criticism
of the
formalism of Kant
now Scheller describes the person
as the concrete unity of acts
of different types of nature
concrete unity of acts
so the person is present in
each and every act
my person is present in
in every act that I perform
but the person
is not reducible
to any of one act
okay
so I am present in all my action
but my person cannot be reduced
in one particular act that I perform
unity here means
a particular style
particular style of
acting
style of executing my action
or of being
so every individual
will have his or her unique
style of loving
of assigning meaning
of
willing
of choosing
and necessarily has his own
or her own access to the world
and when a person dies
not only
is that the style of loving
of assigning or choosing
thinking is lost
but so is that world
is
own access to that world
it is also lost
now
for Scheller
our being a person
is the form of our mind
and of our consciousness
no matter whether
mind and consciousness are understood
to be human, divine
or just fictional
to Scheller rejected the notion
of a pure consciousness
mind
similar
like what Husser
stressed or affirmed
so the person is just
the form of our mind
okay
so
the form of a person
is indifferent
to gender, culture
race and social station
okay
so the person manifests itself
reference among men and women
culture
race, social station etc
among Asian or European
ancient people's culture
American or Asian
etc etc whether it's or poor
it doesn't matter
the person is different to all this
the existence
of the form of our mind
the person is not also
comparable to the existence
of a thing
when we ask the existence of a thing
is it's being an object to us
personal existence
consists only in the
execution of mental
volitional
and emotive acts
so as persons we
execute mental acts
volitional acts
emotive acts
so we cannot be reduced to a thing
or an object
because objects and things
cannot act
mentally, volitionally
or emotionally
so such acts are for example
that the person is capable of loving
of feeling
thinking, willing, remembering
expecting, hoping, despairing
choosing
etc etc
now also
shallow content that the word person
cannot be applied to being
to a being where we
consume animation
eagleness
consciousness of existence
or value of the ego
it cannot be applied to man
in general
the phenomenological essence of person
reveals that although
there are scenes of personhood
in still and develop levels
of human beingness like for example
in the case of children
in the case of embecils
it cannot be applied
or it can only be applied
to a specific level of human existence
or a certain kind
of man where
certain characteristics are already there
so for example
babies
or shallow other babies
who are not be
they already have the scenes of personhood
but they cannot
because they are to be person
yet because
they are not capable of
disunity of acts
of course there are persons
because they are already
they have the scenes of personhood
but they cannot be considered
person in the full sense
of moral personhood
it's like
it's like our notion of
the age of maturity
or age of
for example when you are a particular age
18 years old then you are already
a full citizen
you can vote because you already
have a certain degree of maturity
so something similar to that
now
the imperative that is given
in the value a priori
in the objective ranks of values
is only felt by person
so consequently
persons are the only beings
who are ethically responsible
and because
every experience
value latent
a person is responsible
to love the object
or a being of that
experience most fully
so for example
in relation to other persons
it's the responsibility
and ethical responsibility
of the person to love
so in loving another person
one is called
ethically to love
even more fully and deeply
the object of that love
is a person
who has the highest
or the absolute value
now finally let's talk about
what are the characteristics of a person
for
shaler
the person possesses
a holy sound mind
so the person
is somebody who executes
intentional acts that are
found by a unity of sense
now the unity that we
talked about a while ago
person is subscribed
only to a certain level of development
so egoness
possession of a soul
consciousness of self
do not make a man
a person in the moral
sense
because you have to perform certain
actions
the emotive
the volitional and the mental acts
a child
or
a person coming of age
has the ability to
experience inside
difference between one act
and other acts
so if a child can already experience this
then he can consider
to be a moral person
so he is able to differentiate
and conscious of his ability
because of this ability
defines a person
so
the question is what about the ambicils
for the ambicils
the men retarded
while they have the sense of personhood
they cannot be considered
to be moral
persons
so a person is restricted
to those in whom domination
over the live body appears
immediately
as a master
a mastery of his live body
and lastly
the concrete subject of all acts
of the essence
of inner intuition
and therefore for Scheller
the person is
only
as the concrete unity of acts
executed by the person
and only in the execution
of these acts
can a person
be considered to be a moral
person
but just to clarify
man, all men
whether it's a baby
or an ambicil
they contain the seeds of
personhood only that because
they have not attained
a certain degree of moral maturity
then they cannot be considered to be
a moral
person
ok so that concludes
my presentation
on this topic this is not the whole
of Scheller we have only
discussed
what he discussed
in the their formalism
not even whole of it
not even whole of it
and I already mentioned many
of some of the important works
of Max Scheller but I hope
that this presentation will help you
you know
you may introduce
give you an overview
of the
philosophy or at least the philosophy
of values of Max Scheller
