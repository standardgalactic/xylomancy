Value props is one of the most important things that we could possibly spend time on because
the number one reason that companies fail is because they're not solving a valuable
enough problem and therefore they don't create the value that's worth investing in and therefore
they fail in their basic form of meeting a need.
So what we intend to do today is to both help you understand how to define the problem
you're addressing or the opportunity you see and then actually evaluate it and then finally
create it.
And this is one of the few workshops where I'll tell you that we do have an answer.
Usually you hear me say there are no answers and I'm going to ask a whole bunch of questions
of you.
The only answer I'm giving you though is a framework and it's a framework for where
we're going to go.
So let me jump right in and get you there so you can hear exactly from the beginning
how this framework set of activities is going to come together.
So as I said first of all we're going to define then we're going to evaluate then we're
going to build.
One of the things I want to tell you right off the bat is that I want to get rid of the
idea of ideas.
It's a terrible thing but most people come to me and they say I've got an incredible
idea for X, Y and Z.
Well ideas are to a penny, sorry I should say to a cent but what they really are is
free floating.
They don't actually have meaning until you can address some kind of a problem or opportunity
with them.
So that's why that first part is so important.
And then of course once you start building a value proposition we want to be able to
evaluate it so you yourself not me or anybody else can judge whether you've got something
that is really going to be compelling and cause people to buy.
And finally if you have then of course you want to build it and get it into a form that's
really crisp.
So it's an easy thing for you to do and everything from an elevator pitch to literally going
to a full on pitch for example to get a customer over the line or raise money.
In every instance though this framework, a set of frameworks should help you get that.
So I said we'd give you an answer.
This is the end of the session.
We want you to be able to actually build this framework and say for who that is dissatisfied
with what due to some unmet need or problem you offer a product that solves that and it
provides some key benefits that are compelling enough that people actually want to engage
with you.
So that's why we're headed this evening.
First thing in the value prop that we want to do is define.
And the first statement sounds so obvious which is for who.
So I'm going to jump right in because I know that they've got a good starting point.
Connect Ed Gulnaz.
Tell me for who is your value prop.
So this is connected as a nonprofit so we bridge the digital divide for people in Kazakhstan
but we have to deliver actually like the value proposition for organization that donate their
computers and devices to us and those who can fund us.
So you went long way down into that but I want to make sure we really understand the
who.
So if you could say who it is for, is it everybody in Kazakhstan?
Primarily children.
So we want to say children.
What else could you say about them?
From marginalized communities and rural areas in Kazakhstan.
What else?
Who don't have basic digital literacy skills.
Okay so basic digital literacy skills.
And you said the last thing is.
And they don't have equipment.
And they don't have equipment.
So this is why I picked Gulnaz because I've been lucky enough to have her in the class
before.
She didn't say my proposition is for everybody which would be very terrifying if it was by
the way because then how do you even pick where you go to market or how you reach that
customer etc.
She's got very specific.
I didn't write Kazakhstan because that's pretty obvious but it's children with marginalized
who are in a marginalized situation don't have basic digital literacy and they don't
have the equipment.
Now we can find out later how she's going to address their needs.
That's pretty clear right?
So anyway one of the teams at the iLab who put their value prop in for tonight was Comprofacil.
And they very openly said they've got a product which is going to help people who are dissatisfied
with current credit products due to high interest rates get through a credit marketplace better
comparison capabilities.
Makes total sense but they didn't say for who.
Now that's a massive problem when you are building a business because if you don't know
who your customer is you don't know what the persona is that you're selling to and
how to focus or target on them etc.
And it just is the beginning therefore of why the value proposition statement is so important.
I will underline it by saying the following.
If you don't know who your customer is and you think it's everybody I can tell you you're
going to fail by default because trying to boil the ocean and sell to the world at large
is a very big undertaking for any company.
Even the largest companies in the world get very crisp about it.
Yeah, and Tato?
Yeah, I had a question and I think related to Golnath's business.
If your user is different from your customer who do you put on the for who?
Great question.
So user versus customer.
What do you think is the answer first of all?
Golnath will answer.
Anybody can answer.
In the room have an answer to this.
This is a terrifically good question by the way.
This is the kind of thing that we really need to deal with too.
The user say more.
Why the user?
Well because customer is just the person who's paying it but user is who's benefiting
from what you're creating.
Great.
Now does it mean it one or the other?
Or are both important?
Anybody else want to comment on this?
Yes, go ahead.
I think when your user is not your customer you actually have to satisfy two different
value propositions.
You have to provide value to the initial funder whether that's philanthropy or government
but you also have to provide value to the user so you have uptake.
Okay, so this is really important.
This which is I'll just use the word pull.
You need the pull from the user.
If the user is not using it nobody is going to pay for it.
But even if the user is using it the person who's got to pay for it whether it's a government
if it's a non-profit situation or it's somebody in IT for example who's the gatekeep of something
they still are going to need the user to convince them that there is a payoff that makes it
worth them investing in this product or service.
So both are important but I really agree with Victor by the way you've got to start with
the user.
Like if the user is just not getting the value from your value proposition that's the whole
point of this class then we're in the wrong place.
So this piece of definition is what we're trying to get to with the who and when you
see and by the way I don't think we have it this semester but the startup secrets class
on go to market which by the way is on the iLib YouTube channel you will see we talk
about personas and this is one of the things that we talk about is how do you get to all
parts of the persona that is going to be the champion for your product or service in whatever
enterprise or government or non-profit you're selling to.
So very important question thank you very much for that.
Any other questions on who before we move on?
All right good.
The key word here is ultimately segment so if we're not going to sell to everybody we
need to find a segment of people that we're going to sell to and the trick of this is
actually in your workbook so I'm not going to pitch it to you tonight because it's a
significant thing to go and spend some time looking at and that is to define your minimum
viable segment.
I'll just define it for you as simply as this which is to say you're all going to get to
learn about building the smallest product you possibly can your MVP and if the whole
market out there the whole world was where you went and targeted that then this would
very quickly get pulled in all sorts of different directions for all the potential users that
could use your product or service and they all have different needs.
The MVS simply says you want to find one path where you get the same needs for the same
users that allows you to sell the same product over and over and over and over and over again
without you having to change the product.
You can learn a lot more about that in the workbook but that's the notion of a segment
and if you do this right then you end up with a minimum viable segment which is a good dance
partner as I call it to your minimum viable product.
Now does anybody in the room not know what these two terms are because they are terms
that have been built in startup legacy for the last decade or so but it doesn't mean
to say everybody knows them.
Anybody have any questions on those?
All right good so only secret I want to give you here is one simple one which is you want
to evaluate this part of your who you're selling to through the eyes of the customer.
So we talked about who this is let's just focus on the user.
If the user can identify with the product you're selling you're on the right track.
What's the best way to find that out?
What's that?
I said ask the user.
Yeah absolutely all of you can do this without spending a single penny.
Just go out and talk to them and if you're not clear that your user is identifying when
you talk to them with what you're trying to sell them they say well that's not me I don't
need to buy that or I don't need that or that's not a problem I identify with.
Keep asking until you find the person who says oh yeah that's the problem I have and
keep asking until they say not only do I have it but then that's where we'll start to get
into more of the value proposition but it's the pain there is big enough for me to actually
start to engage with you but everything you do should be looked at from your user's eyes
not from yours.
In other words don't pitch them anything ask them everything.
Make sense?
I see a lot of nodding heads.
All pretty obvious.
So now that we've talked about defining who it's for we're going to define what we're
going to solve for them what problem we're going to define for them.
So there's a famous statement here and it's one of my favorite which is a problem well
stated is half solved and the reason that's true is that if you can really clearly identify
what the pain or need or opportunity is that you're going to address becomes very easy
to start getting your team to focus on well what product or service will you build.
But imagine if you get in the room and the opposite is true there's five engineers you've
hired for argument sake or five people you're working on a service building a service for
and you can't even agree what it is you're building and or if you didn't do the first
part who you're building it for that's where a lot of startups go wrong by the way is they
can't get that crisp to say we need to solve this particular pain point this hair on fire
pain point for people first.
So now the question is what's the best way to go about doing that here are a few frameworks
for you first of all this one is a very simple one it's for use think about problems that
are unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved so those of you with boards I'm going to recommend
you put up just for use and just take a moment to think about as you are thinking about for
example Vivian framing your idea what about it is unworkable unavoidable and underserved
and urgent and I'm going to take you through each of these I just want you to capture the
four use on your board so Celine if you do this I'm sorry stellar if you do the same
for Celine health just put them up on the board for the moment just want to get us used
to kind of creating the basis for what we go through and you're all going to build out
your value propositions on your board so just to be clear so the only person I didn't meet
is Sharon hi welcome good to have you here I know you I know you're building a new kind
of bike seat can you just tell us what it's about yeah I do not yet have a name hence
just the word bike seat but I'm specifically looking at solving the problem of some of
the long term health issues that are caused through for women through biking and I'm doing
that through looking at how to design a bike seat that reduces pressure and friction that's
perfect I don't even need to go any further so I'm going to just ask you to put up these
four use and tell me why in your own words for the moment just one example of something
that you think is either unworkable unavoidable or urgent or underserved you don't need to
tell me right away but I'm going to take you these frameworks and I'll come back to you
so I'm giving you a heads up that I'll come back to you and ask you great now that you've
got these let me take you through them so unworkable is sort of obvious but it's really
interesting some people think they've got an unworkable problem but the real definition
of something that's unworkable is that it is going to cause a problem that when this
happens the consequences are so great that somebody could get fired for it so let me
give you an example because it's a very interesting one and you might have all lived through it
so when the iPhone first got introduced people were lining up to buy them that was the great
news the bad news was when they got them they couldn't get them activated and worse still
when they did get them activated all the iCloud services to do things like download their
contacts and their calendars weren't working either so that problem was so bad so unworkable
a lot of people got fired in fact Steve Jobs was quite famously on a tirade about it and
it was a problem that was created by a brand new technology in a mass market and with a
lot of people that obviously were very unhappy about it and today guess what when you buy
an iPhone it's pre provisioned you already have all of that worked out and that took
years actually to figure out I happen to be one of the investors in a company that solved
that problem for carriers on the other side of this like AT&T was worth tens of millions
of dollars just fixing that workflow and making it possible for you to just pick up an iPhone
and turn it on and effectively get your new number working so these unworkable problems
do get people fired they're that painful and they cause all sorts of things now ideally
they're much more interesting than that so for example you've got social problems where
you've got things that are causing people to get sick or for example not able to get
education or like Connected not able to get that right resources that will help them in
a desperate situation then that also is unworkable you will have your own way of saying it.
Gulnaz would you say what you think is unworkable about Connected?
If I understand it correctly if so if we teach digital literacy skills that kids cannot use
yeah that's useless kind of well no let's put it the other way around what happens
if you don't solve the problem if we don't solve the problem so we are trying to close
the socio-economic gap in Kazakhstan that is also caused by educational inequality okay
but what if what happens in Kazakhstan if we don't solve the socio-economic gap what
happens to Kazakhstan yeah I mean the one example is like people protest this year and
there was like a huge wave of unhappy people great so I mean this it's it's important and
I want to make sure that we give gave you air time for this not every problem that comes
through the iLab is a problem that's technology like the iPhone's not you know getting to
to work it can be a social problem like this is a really big challenge for a nation that's
trying to develop its people that they can't get the education the resources they need
it causes huge unrest great unhappiness and guess what that population is not going to
get out of their third world status unless they get the education they need this is a
really unworkable problem this is one of the biggest problems of our time is that we have
huge social divide so thank you for addressing it and thanks for taking that mission up that's
an example of an unworkable problem anybody got any questions or an idea of where their
particular thing is unworkable today so I don't know whether let's see who have I not
talked to so far cohort is there anything about what you're doing that's unworkable
we're looking largely at the improving the graduation rates for black students yeah right
what happens if we don't do that if we don't do this 20% of students won't graduate from
high school okay so yeah I don't even need to say any more than that that's a big problem
20% of students have you got the data on that already can you show that show that to people
yes is public data yeah so you're in a great place because you're already starting the
problem that's unworkable you can give data behind it and there are real consequences
for that which is again inequality in our society through not being able to educate
people interesting enough you guys should be talking about how do you connect that and
yourselves about how do you make sure that your value prop comes to life in that way
but thank you for sharing that anybody got any yeah go ahead sure Facebook for instance
what unworkable problem did they solve so the good news about this is you asked what
will open up a whole thread here there's B2B versus B2C and Facebook is obviously very much
a B2C company and they're very different sets of problems when you start talking about B2C
generally speaking they're not about unworkable or unavoidable they're much more about what
we'll talk about which is latent problems that are aspirational and that ultimately become
blatant and critical so we're going to get there but don't don't worry it's coming up
any other questions on unworkable first yeah go ahead how do you know that you're not actually
hypothesizing that this is unworkable because I can give an example but a lot of times what
you think is unworkable could just be something else and I'll go ahead and give an example
just to contextualize that for example oral cancer if you think that oh you may just need
to raise awareness but the problem may not be related to awareness the problem may be
related to access of care there's lack of access so you could say you know what's unworkable
is that there's no awareness and you would be blaming patients but in fact there's just
lack of care access to care so yeah you answered your own question by the way which is great
because you said quite rightly it might be this or it might be that and so what would
you do you'd keep drilling on the the question you asked yourself until you found what is
the root cause of it and so honest answer is many times the reason customers sorry startups
fail is because they don't do what you were doing which is to say well it could be this
it could be that who should you go to to ask the question it's on the board yeah just go
and ask the user okay tell me what the real problem is here tell me what's at the root
of this is it lack of awareness or is it lack of availability or is it my inability to use
the product or the service or whatever it might be does that make sense again the answer
is going to be so obvious when I said 90% of the time it's going to be back to what I said
here which is ask the user get to the customer's viewpoint of this and let them tell you where
their pain is what the problem is and why they're not being able to get the solution
to it sounds so obvious but the more you do that the better better off your value proposition
is get defined alright so next you unavoidable the good news is that everybody in this room
faces two completely unavoidable things what are they taxes and death absolutely right
one of the joys about our lives is that it it does eventually have to come to an end
and so taxes and death or I put a bit more graciously aging a part of the reality of
our lives but guess what because of that there's a whole lot of money that gets made in both
those industries like the aging and the care that goes around that is a huge industry likewise
paying tax is a massive industry and I'm not just talking about QuickBooks and TurboTax
and all those things that help out with that it's actually a whole accounting industry
that is spawned as a result of the fact that we have to pay taxes we have to account for
what we spend and we have to do all the things that relate to that so why like this unavoidable
part is there are actually a lot of things that are not so obvious right up to your point
earlier at the sort of outset that seem unavoidable until you start to dig and you think about
actually you know what I do need to get my kids educated because if I don't get them educated
they're not going to be able to pay for themselves and get you know self-sufficient and be able
to go and build their own lives etc. so guess what education is pretty much unavoidable
too so you know both of you have good basis to talk about that it's unavoidable also for
almost all societies to address that issue at some level if they're going to be socially
and sorry economically viable and so governments do care about it so again you can get these
things to work for you if you can find the right ways to address them now one of the
other things I always love to do here is give an example that is pretty obvious but how
many of you have had COVID at one point it was pretty unavoidable right so what did we
do we all when got vaccinated well maybe not everybody there was a choice but the point
is some health things are also unavoidable and some challenges like that are unavoidable
and they give rise to all sorts of opportunities some of you are even wearing masks in here
totally appropriate guess what that's a whole business that didn't exist beforehand and
don't just think about the mask think about every piece of the supply chain that builds
a mask it's a huge business that came up now we have testing testing has become a huge business
because of COVID etc. etc. so you see where I'm going with this it's not necessarily
something that you face immediately and say oh that's unavoidable but when you start to
think about all the implications of it then you realize there's lots of businesses that
come out of it okay this one is easy urgent so I do actually want to get another group
involved here so space health Midori tell me a little bit about what your business is or
your idea isn't and why it might be urgent okay yeah thank you space health has a goal
of providing the commercial space sector with a medical professionals for the future just
with the expectancy that this industry is going to blow up and you know people that
are going to space for space tourism are going to need medicine in space very cool
now I'm going to challenge you though is that urgent like does everybody in this room feel
like they are going to need health as one of the first things that they spend money on
in space I mean health in space at least not now okay so and I'm not trying to take your
idea down but it's one of the most important criteria is to think about now let's just
challenge that for a second and say but to your point anybody who's going to space so
that's the space user the customer if you like who's came out to space I'm sure they
feel like they want to check their health before they go and they're going to need
health and safety when they're up there so I'll eat my words and say if you can find
the right user if you can get in touch with whether it's the space agencies or the people
who are actually you know doing the experimentation up there I'm sure there's a tremendous opportunity
for space help so this is where parts the value prop need to tie together and so you've
got a tremendous opportunity if you can pick that segment that's there for who that really
clearly sees this as urgent and I'm sure they will so thanks for sharing okay so what is
a tip here for all of you is the following urgency is all relative so for those of you
not going to space you could care less about this right so relatively for you it's not
important now let's take a reality in business which is if you're selling to somebody whether
you intend to or not you're going to compete with something or somebody and their time
so lots of you will think you've got a unique solution but here's the bad news there is
finite amount of time money and resource people and everything else that goes around what
you're trying to sell into so you're always going to have to be something that is at the
highest priority if you're going to get people's attention because guess what they won't spend
time with you otherwise so it's no good for example trying to sell a low-income family
a very high definition television set when they haven't even got the basics of their
food and water running or they aren't educating their family it's just obvious when I say
that well it's the same and true in business too if you're going to try and pitch somebody
something for example that's a nice to have new extension for example to their existing
workflow system but they haven't got basic security in place and they've just been hacked
you're not going to get any attention so you have to think about what their priorities
are now what's the best way to find this out ask back to the same old question now I'll
give you a little clue here what you want to do here is say rather than even introduce
what you do whenever you talk to a potential user or customer ask them what their number
one priority is right now don't ask them about or don't tell them anything about you just
say what's your number one priority if you get up in the morning tomorrow what's the
number one thing you need to focus on and why and then if they tell you say when do
you think you're going to get to number two and then let them tell you number two oftentimes
they won't even get to number two what you'll find out is that there's some pain point that
they really have that's really so compelling that's what they're focused on and obviously
if you can address that you're in a good spot if you can't expect to get delayed and to
get deep prioritized and to be spending time waiting to get engaged on your value problem
so that's why urgent is so important now let me give you another startup secret which is
pretty obvious which is that sometimes certain shifts in the market create urgency so a good
example right now is how many of you have mobile phones duh all of you right but if
I'd ask that question 20 years ago it would be none of you that shift has been totally
dramatic so what is it done to every industry it's created urgency for people to respond
to it when you bank today using your phone pretty obvious you don't need to go to a
bank for most of the things because you can do it all on your phone again 20 years ago
that wasn't the case and so banks had a very very urgent response that they had come up
with to be able to make it possible for all the users that now said I don't want to go
to a bank and deal with the teller I just want to do it on my phone and the first banks
that moved there were actually not the existing incumbents there were a lot of new banks that
got started as a result of that trend so you want to look for shifts that create urgency
things like mobile I'll tell you there's another major one that's going on right now which
is AI AI is going to be involved in everything and so everybody's scrambling to figure out
well how do I engage AI to make my process more effective more efficient and save time
and money for people so urgency can be something that you also ride based on shifts in the
marketplaces so I'm going to ask is I don't know anything about it what is CRSP design
essentially we make low cost so affordable robotics toys for children starting out in
South Africa and to use the framework that we've got up here why is that urgent so when
the idea originally started was a personal problem I had 20 years ago when I was a child
and I wanted to get into the space but growing up in a low income family nothing was affordable
enough to be able to like for me to access it and then now if you fast forward to like
2010 2015 the world was moving towards the 4IR fourth industrial revolution and specifically
for Africa we were lagging behind so this was an urgent like issue for me personally
being an engineer at the time realizing that our schooling systems weren't actually solving
for this and I think we also went forward to creating a sense of urgency by helping the
government create a curriculum for this so what this eventually did is now schools have
started scrambling looking for resources exactly like this so there are times when as the startup
you can actually identify the problem before the users even I don't know know they have
it and then push forward policy or whatever that then creates a new market then the issue
becomes how do you capture value okay so we will I'll hold that thought because I call
that a latent need to a framework that comes up later and it's interesting the way you
described it too but I would say that's you're going to be challenged with exactly the thing
that I'm describing which is how do you get people to say this is more important than
10 other things that we could be spending our resources on do you agree yeah so that's
why the urgent is pieces so important alright last you is underserved and this one is pretty
obvious I already gave it away there's only finite time money and resources for you to
be able to engage on things and so you have to help people understand why they should
prioritize you but the underserved piece is an interesting thing particularly in B to
C marketplaces so anybody got a B to C value proposition in here they're selling to consumers
yeah of course you do taste of Kenya so tell me about what do you think's underserved in
the market for tea well it's a coffee market right essentially yeah so at the moment Kenyan
coffee consumers can't afford the Kenyan products in the market so they buy instant coffee which
is from Brazil so none of Kenyan coffee consumers who are low income can afford the coffee that's
being sold in the market so you actually the beauty of your solution is not only is it
underserved in that people can't get the coffee from their own local market but it's also
too expensive so you've got two problems that we're addressing you know both the pain unworkable
for people who can't afford it and it's underserved in the sense that literally there's no supply
for it at the moment which is great thank you Zipporah so now that you've all heard the
for use I want you to just take a moment in your group and put down the for use and take
a moment for example on Taste of Kenya and put what one criteria is that you think we
just gave you two makes your product unworkable unavoidable urgent and underserved let's take
a few minutes on that in each group almost everybody's come up with some for use if not
all of the for use land I only have to look around the boards to see that so I'm going
to just take one or two boards and just ask for the rest of you to volunteer so first
of all I was lucky enough to listen to Celine health and Stella and Scarlett are serving
a market for women who obviously have an unavoidable problem Stella and Scarlett do you want to
just talk about that sure so Celine how's going to personalize mental puzzle management
for mid-aged women or whoever enters mental puzzle even though they enter it early so
the unworkable part is that when the climatic symptom hits like hot flush night sweats and
it hits it just really decrease their functionality like among this woman so they cannot work
so our solution can help them work that's perfect and unavoidable mental puzzle is just
unavoidable every like half of this room is going to enter this part of what we were talking
about earlier aging it's just a reality for women yep urgent just when the symptom hit
when you are not feeling comfortable it is urgent that you it's just like you get a flu
and you need to take medicine or you need to do something you stop going to work so that
is an urgent problem you need to fix right and underserved so currently if you search
online to find articles or research dedicated to pregnancy this age you have so many million
billions of research results coming out but for mental puzzle age this population you
find barely like a hundred like one in a hundred of them yeah that little so only two percent
of the research funding are devoted to this population so this population is underserved
thank you very much so I had no idea about any of that although without revealing who
it is in my family I have somebody in my family who would say this is really a critical issue
and it does cause her to be literally unable to function at certain period of time and
there's way too little information about it and way too few solutions around it and many
women go through this so all those four years felt very real to me as I was listening to
that and I see a lot of women in here are nodding their heads around it so congratulations
on finding such a great for you problem alright just because of time I don't want to go around
and do every board there's too many boards here but I would love to give anybody a chance
you had to say who had an aha moment I know you guys did for example but I want you to
volunteer anybody have an aha moment when they were going through their four years and
care to share yep go ahead so Hannah just left but interestingly enough we started
off with a bit of a debate and it turns out with some ideas and I think with our one it
could maybe be solved by just having a new policy in place not even having a business
or a startup you know so in those cases I don't know what that means in terms of the
problem you're solving is it one if it's too social focused that you actually can't
solve it as a business and you're better off joining government in lobbying internally
well that's a big aha by the way so one of the things that I always want to say when
I mentor at the iLab is don't be afraid to recognize what you're trying to do is not
a good thing to do really seriously because you know this is your life so you don't want
to spend it on something that's not a real problem that you can solve as a startup and
so what you just identified I think is a great example of that you might realize that actually
this is a problem that needs to be solved in government first with policy so I actually
want to give you a round of applause for being that honest about it I think that's huge that
was a big aha anybody else want to share an aha we'll do one more yeah go ahead Dan
for TeraFlow it's a software that helps pharmaceutical companies understand why the same drug works
in some patients but not in others so normally when I talk about TeraFlow I talk about like
cancer and the need to get the right drugs to the right patients but I think really the
problem we're trying to solve is that usually our client is a scientist that has kind of
stuck their head out by convincing the pharma to fund this expensive clinical trial and
they have an unavoidable problem because they have to prove to their vice president that
this experiment was worth it and what our software does is basically provide a very
clear interpretable report that shows to other stakeholders that what they're doing is important
and if they didn't how much money would they lose potentially well if the drug fails to
go to market because they didn't discover the right biomarkers it would be billions
so this is what we want to try to do and thank you Dan it was a brilliant example is
we want to try to identify the problem in a way that your user or your buyer is going
to say well of course I need to do this if I don't do this I'm going to lose billions
my drug may not get to market because I can't even identify the right biomarkers now you're
going to get people's attention now you're going to build something that is compelling
that causes people to act and want to buy that's why these four users are so important
great example all right next framework is a fun one it's actually one of my favorites
because it addresses this question that came up with B2C so I think it was you Vivian who
asked about Facebook so how many of you use Facebook or any of its derivatives like Instagram
or WhatsApp good pretty much everybody now if I was to say to you why I would argue that
every one of you has what some people call Maslow's hierarchy of needs or some other
you know form of it social needs security needs physical needs emotional needs you know
economic needs etc these are all needs we have and basically if we don't have the met
we end up in a bad place so what is it that Facebook addresses for us what need is it
connection people it's a huge need do you know what the number one cause of unhappiness
in the world is loneliness the number one finding of the longest study at Harvard ever
since 1938 of happiness is one thing connection and people have social connection they are
happier so this is a very big need that's what Facebook addresses and by the way social
networks in general address now there's lots of other things to do I always joke about
it on the other side which is you know guess what we all want to meet people and date and
eventually you know find somebody to partner with and get married have kids whatever it
is not all but generally speaking that's a huge need so that's why things like bumble
took off or at the other extreme why Facebook in the first place took off because people
just wanted to connect to get together on on different things that they had similar interests
around huge huge things build from that so anyway be to see if that makes sense different
approach different framework but some similar principle at some point it becomes unworkable
for people for example that are in you know foreign nations to stay in touch with their
families back home without a social network WhatsApp took off for that very reason way
too expensive to pick up the phone and call home tremendously cheap to do it on WhatsApp
for free basically that's why it took off that was actually a critical need for people
there are whole industries that are built on that for example financial services in
the third world is still incredibly expensive to do things like do basic payments and send
money around the place but on social networks weibo and and Tencent in China for example
that was enabling of that and solving of that problem alright so I have an example here
that brings it all together and hopefully it will be a useful one for you to see because
it's sort of B2B and it's sort of B2C has anybody used rent the runway was a Harvard
startup so yeah a couple of you have okay just because you've talked Vivian let me ask
this young lady at the back why do you use rent the runway I used it once like ten years
ago because I was going to forget what event in DC and it was easy and I knew I would never
need to wear that like whatever I wore I knew I would take a lot of pictures in and not
want to wear it again okay great so if you at the moment it was urgent in that moment
you had to go to this event Vivian why did you use it same I am a foreigner I have basic
clothes with me in the States only and as I can see as you can see and I was invited
for like a nice event and I couldn't show up in my ex-boyfriend hoodie actually I think
you should have done it would have been a real winner but that's a whole other story
so this is a fun story and for those of you don't that particular garment should go on
rent the runway that would make a lot of money alright so the thing is this is a good example
saying that sort of crosses between B2B and B2C in lots of different regards so rent the
runway in many ways is unworkable is an unworkable problem for people who can't afford to go and
find a dress or a or an outfit or something for a particular occasion which they're going
to go to sometimes it's a basic thing like a graduation party and they want to show up
it's also underserved in the sense that people can't afford to get access to those things
let alone you know do it for one particular thing and it's really interesting by the
way it's unavoidable for certain people who feel like they've got to show up not in their
boyfriend's hoodie but actually looking smart for their parents for example when they're
going to an event there's so many reasons why this is something that just was underserved
as a result because the only alternative solution to it was going and spending a lot of money
on a one-off basis that just made it completely unworkable so anyway lots of views about rent
the runway and one of the things that's interesting about it by the way is it's really struggled
as a business despite that and that's because it's business model is tough and that's why
we did the session last time so working with a great value prop is not the only part of
a business that's important it's one part of it if you can't make it economically viable
which is what we talked about last session it's still not going to be sustainable so
that's how to think about these two workshops that we just did last time and this time together
the second thing I promised to do was to talk a little bit about the latent need that you
brought up so there are often times needs that start out as latent meaning people don't
think about them day to day they're not like at the top of their mind and aspirational
we just gave you an example which is a latent need is to look good you don't necessarily
think of it every day but you do want to get up and feel good and it's aspirational also
in the sense that when you're looking good and feeling good guess what you can probably
feel like more confident to do your job or your work or you know play your sport or whatever
else it is but certain needs evolve to becoming really critical and blatantly so so let's
take an example how many of you have an iPad do you think that's blatantly critical or
is it latent and aspirational?
Tell me more tell me more yeah okay so it's turned into your main thing that you take
notes and everything else with it right okay good so there are people by the way who have
the other extreme anybody here feel like they're on the I just use it when I need to to watch
a movie or whatever Intata?
Interestingly enough I had an iPad for a long time then I wasn't using it that much
I got to Harvard and then I was like oh snap I need a new one because everyone is using
it then I got into HBS classes and they're like no technology allowed so I sent back
the one I just bought so it went from like it wasn't critical then it was critical then
I didn't need it anymore.
Well let me let me tell you why I use the iPad as an example because there's a vast array
of people use them for a lot of different things and some people would say yeah it kind
of nice and other people would say no I got to have it and when it was first announced
people joked about the name and they said oh it's just a big iPhone why would I want
one of those and it really didn't take off for a long time until people started building
applications for it and they became really critical for certain people so for example
if you're a pilot today you might use this for navigation and trust me it's critical
it's not like you're not going to take it with you this is what you use to make sure
you're going to get home so it depends on the application it's also true in medicine
for example that has become critical in certain situations where it's too difficult to use
a keyboard and people just need to write and they just want to for example touch something
to actually activate a particular function in an operating room so it depends on the
application so what I try to say about this framework is as follows try to understand
your use case is it something people think is just nice to have or is it really critical
and if you can identify the difference between something that's nice to have and must have
guess which one you want to be in da you want to be in the top right there but again ask
your user find out what they're doing with it if the iPad had never made its way into
medicine or you know flight navigation or those other critical applications probably
wouldn't have taken off but it's made its way into a lot of those things and then for
some users in the B2C class they critically consider their entertainment to be like I
got to have entertainment this is a super important thing to me I don't need a television
I'll just have an iPad and there are people who've gone to YouTube as their basis for
educate I mean for entertainment so that's their interface for it anyway fun fun thing
for you to play with I encourage you to put your diagram out there and when you talk to
users map where they're telling you they are ask them how critical this is what else is
a priority instead what else would they do what they spend their money on if it's not
on what you're offering them any questions on that before I move on yeah Victor just
follow me up on that when they build the iPad they didn't know they are going to need to
build that many applications on it right yeah so they didn't really solve a critical problem
at the time of building that the application so how would you think about if you have the
chicken egg first or the egg first so let's take a moment to answer Victor's question
because it's very important one which is you know the chicken and egg question comes up
a lot so you've got an idea and you think there's some opportunity out here in the
market I realize I've just drawn the same diagram I've drawn above but anyway starting
it fresh the answer is that one of the most amazing things about Steve Jobs is he was
somebody that people said never talk to users he's famous for it like it was his idea to
come up with the iPad but what he was brilliant at was identifying it great vision for what
this thing could be and then he built the important piece which is a whole business
opportunity for many markets which is a platform that said anybody in here can take my device
here use my platform and build the application they particularly need and so guess what hundreds
then thousands then tens of thousands now millions of applications have been built for
that platform and this is a business model that is really fascinating and whole studying
of itself that we could get into it's a very viable way to build products what it really
says is as follows you've got to make this platform easy enough for your idea to be adopted
by the users and to solve their own problem for example you remember in the last session
I told you that open source works this way it says that anybody can take the code that
you offer for example to create and I mentioned websites and Acquire and Drupal the idea of
a website and extend it any way they want to make that website capable of integrating
Instagram at one extreme and at the other extreme sales force to be able to do things
like give people a great experience when they go to the Grammys and take photographs and
upload them to the site and at the other extreme have a close relationship with all those customers
so they can keep selling them other things like records and merchandise and everything
else that is a whole industry now experience management and it was built on a platform
an open source platform just like the iPad was an open platform for people develop applications
so great so what was wrong with pebble anybody know this this particular product what you do
so what do you think was wrong with it really was it urgent it's as urgent as an Apple watch
what was it open I think it runs Android so various thing that I I don't want to get drawn
into this too much but I will tell you I wrote an article you can find it on LinkedIn when I
bought my first Apple watch I offered it to anybody who wanted to tell me why there was a
reason to keep it because I didn't think there was a need for it it actually was a useless
gadget when it first came out it was like it didn't even stay on I had to do this to be
able to look at the time I mean it was like and there were no applications for it to speak
off so I think it was a bit like the pebble and what worked was that they had a development
platform again and they had a large developer user base who started create applications now
there's no way I would give up my Apple watch it's now used for some critical things like my
health I monitor my sleep with it all sorts of other things my blood pressure all sorts of things
so it's become critical to me and by the way actually for timekeeping which is a big part
of my job that I need to get back on time it is actually the thing that keeps me on time so
with that I'll just simply say let's talk afterwards because it's a great discussion like a
lot of things there aren't answers but there are questions you could ask in the frameworks that
would reveal to you why pebble would be successful and why Apple watch sorry wasn't
successful and why Apple watch was successful some of which by the way is marketing too
alright when you start building your product there are a whole set of things that are basically
dependencies that you want to be aware of and I talk about this in the workbook because you
need to get a couple of concepts clear and they basically are how your product actually fits into
the solution that a customer has and so I will say it and then you can go and look in the workbook
the first concept is that your product is very unlikely to be the whole solution that a customer
has and we started talking about smartphones so I'll just give you an example why is a smartphone
its own not a whole product what what do you need with a smartphone to make it useful go
ahead apps yep what else yeah absolutely it's absolutely useless into you unless you have a
carrier and unless you have some apps for it although I'd say one of the apps is built in
which is the phone but the point is that almost every product if you look at it has some aspects
of it that need to make it a whole solution for the customer so that's the first concept you'll
find in the workbook the second one is once you realize that you realize well actually you have
dependencies on your product being successful like if there weren't networks and I gave you the
example that when the phones couldn't be provisioned on networks they were just bricks they were
useless or if you don't have the app that solves your particular problem it's also useless to you
so what you want to do is figure out what are those dependencies those external factors that you
need to work with in order for your product to meet the needs end-to-end the solution if you
will and if you don't pay attention to those again you'll be selling something that can't really
solve the problem that you're trying to address so it's in the workbook you can go look it up
there's some examples including Apple Pay which is quite a fun one and also Tesla which is another
fun one which is still to this day having a big dependency on charging stations and the availability
of electrical you know access for people to really say oh I'm definitely going to buy a Tesla I know
lots of people who won't because they just know they can't rely on it so debt is an important thing
to think about next up is what we want to make sure happens in a positive way for you which is
how do you make sure you really do cut through the noise so every startup I know will say that
they are some way faster better cheaper you're all nodding your heads and I'm sure that that's true
for a lot of your things so anybody think that they are not faster better or cheaper it's
probably not in this room they're probably like decided I'm really not in the right place David
you're having a good laugh about this so are you working on something that you think is faster
better cheaper tell me more about it we're gonna help David get beyond this by the way so I'm in
the the travel space so what I'm doing is I'm developing an app that would help customers
find outrageously cheap airfares so what we're dealing with at least you know I mean it could
vary but 30 to 90% off okay good I'm gonna just to hold that for a second is there any
other thing about it that's that's better because you said cheaper basically but is it better
because it's faster or it's so that would probably be the the tech behind it right so
the sauce behind it was I would call it but to the customer is there any reason why they say
oh this is way better it's a better experience is it easier than Travelocity or you know pick
if I so it works in a totally different form so basically the customer tells me where they want
to leave from yep but they're never telling me what where they want to go to necessarily so this
is this is sounds interesting I'm just gonna put it destinationless okay that's definitely different
so by the end of this class I want you to come up and tell me whether we can get rid of fast
about a cheaper and come up with a better framework for you and I'm gonna start talking a
little bit about why I think it's a dangerous thing so the reason I hate faster better cheaper is
that there are people out there have more resource than you do as a startup so if kayak or Travelocity
or pick your favorite decided to come after you David they're gonna have more resource to try to
put whatever it is the tech behind what they do and so there's probably something in your secret
source that is more than just faster better cheaper maybe it's something that's defensible maybe it's
some IP maybe it's something beyond the tech it's a network the way you actually connect to people
to get the data for your affairs there may be a whole bunch of things but in the end we want to
make sure that you end up there and here's why if you can get to what we call a 3d breakthrough
something that's truly disruptive truly discontinuous and really defensible then you as a startup have
a chance even with small resources in fact it's the story of why startups succeed is that they make
these big breakthroughs they punch through the noise with something that's just completely
disruptive like a business model like Google had to use advertising and selling sell instead of
selling software to give away their office suite where Microsoft was having to get you to pay for
it was totally disruptive it caused Microsoft to be a dial tone as a stock for many years that's
what we mean by this so let's get into these 3d's and see if we can identify some for you so first
of all disruptive is as I said sometimes a technology but often a business model like Airbnb
changed the travel industry they didn't actually invent anything they don't even own the homes that
you go and visit or the places you go and stay at what they created was a means to connect people
and give them experiences by sharing resources that other people were not using genius right that
could have been invented sitting here tonight and that's one of the things that's so exciting about
business models is why we spent time on it last time but then there are also technologies so I
would argue multi-touch is one of these multi-touch was such a game changer because the minute you
could use that interface now instead of having to have a dedicated user interface for every single
thing you did so remember that example of in the operating theater imagine if you had all the
a all the instruments that you needed to work with on a one single interface that could change
during the operation as you were going through various different stages of it I'm describing a
real thing by the way as opposed to you have to go to every single instrument learn that interface
and figure out when you go and find it you know how to use it no it just flows for you and
actually it's monitoring the patient at the real in real time too so you can actually see what you
need to spend time on where you need to focus that's what multi-touch did it can save lives it's
that critical it's not just for playing games on phones but by the way it's a very big industry too
so that's what we want to try to have you find so that's what we mean by disruptive now I'm going
to use an example was Amazon a disruption when it first came out no why not because that's good
in the same in the UK was the first in the United Kingdom commerce my best knowledge okay very good
anybody else think it was a not a breakthrough nothing new in the way of products but is it
wise why is the success of Amazon then been so great and by the way I want to hear why you think
it wasn't like a breakthrough too I'm just as interested somebody over here I think said it
wasn't yeah go ahead David well I think Amazon because just of the success in marketing right
or just being user-friendly you know just getting to the customer because what I what I'm
discovering is a lot of these big companies that people kind of like in a way idolized
that just older ideas that other people had before you know that's all it is there's nothing
really new but they just happen to blow up and everyone know their name okay so they became
bigger they had more scale they became faster they became better and they became cheaper
which is why it's really dangerous to try to compete with them but yet they succeeded so I
would argue the reason they succeeded was and there was in Jeff Brazos's quote you all see
this this these trucks driving around no other business gave you these two things it wasn't
do you want low prices or do you want fast delivery you can have both by the way there was
actually a third if you read his quote to go backwards which was choice and in fact it was
how it was how they first got going Amazon succeeded as a bookstore to start off with
because you couldn't get access to the long tail of books that people wanted literally
physically you couldn't get access you had to go find those books in bookstores and suddenly
they said nope we'll find you any book on the isbon code or wherever it is in the world
that you need to get access to so it was it was first and foremost selection but then when they
really focused in it became actually not even selection but fast prices I mean sorry fast
delivery and low prices so it is actually a breakthrough it's a breakthrough that they
managed to do because they built huge scale and they got the economies of scale to put
behind that it's also a fascinating example for another D so that's the disruption they
first had it was discontinuous what came next discontinuous is something that you couldn't
do before this next thing what is that AWS cloud computing was invented by Amazon and
why did they why were they able to invent it because they got such scale in their operations
that their compute resources became accessible at a price that was so marginally efficient to
sell to other people that now people could start using the cloud as it became known as a basis to
build their own business they rented their if you will their hardware infrastructure their
storage and their compute to people who wanted to use it and they had such economies of scale
that it was actually extremely effective for them to do that we're actually leveraging something
that already built the huge data centers etc to do that that story by the way was told right here
in this iLab by the guy who got behind it or actually created it Andy Jassy who's a donor to
this iLab and it's an interesting story to listen to so it's something that started out as a
disruption it became a discontinuous innovation it gave rise to cloud computing anybody here
using the cloud i'm sure Terraflow must be yeah almost all of you are huge game changer i mean
and what's interesting about it and this is where i want you to think about discontinuous
things is you couldn't do certain things today without the cloud so pretty much everything we
do on our mobile phones couldn't do without the cloud and anything that you're thinking about in
terms of for example how we solve this problem of working after COVID how would we have done that
if we hadn't had the cloud we'd have all disappeared and been unable to communicate and connect and
do zoom and all those other things so these are discontinuous innovations that's what those
things are about and then finally the third D is how does it become defensible so there are lots of
ways things can become defensible here are a few examples you can have great IP that's the typical
one some breakthrough innovation so i'm going to guess here that dan you would say something
about Terraflow is going to be protectable as IP am i right okay and are you going to go after a
patent for it perhaps even possibly so if you don't is there some effect that you think you'll
have that will cause customers to get to say that hey we will not take Terraflow out of our
business once we've got working it i've got it working with us will it become part of their
end-to-end way that they bring drugs to market for example okay and once it does will they take it
away no it's the way they're used to interpreting the data communicating so that gets to what i
call switching costs it's a whole discussion at MBA level that we talk a lot about once something
becomes adopted by your customers and it's proven to be very effective it's really difficult to
take it away from them and actually i will say the same keep using the same example if i gave you
a brand new spanking you know best-in-class phone but i told you you had to give up your phone number
for it and you had to change carriers for it would you adopt it you would okay most people would
say no there's a couple that say yes so it's not an always absolute thing but the point is there
are switching costs associated with everything similarly like if i said to you you could go to
another university but it doesn't teach your course well of course even if that university is way
less expensive and maybe easier to get to it doesn't teach what you need so it's what you're being
delivered and how you're being delivered it and how difficult it is to adopt it that is important
when you start to think about defensibility so think about network effects think about switching
costs think about ip think about things that give your your customer a basis to work with you
that causes them to say i wouldn't want to switch i wouldn't want to go anywhere else
this is something that i've got used to and then my favorite example of this is follows
so if i came up with a much better social network like you loved the way that you could post photos
it was way easier but nobody else was on the network would you adopt it of course not nobody
to share anything with that's why there's such huge defensibility in the networks that have been
built like instagram and whatsapp etc so networks is a very good example of it and then data is a
fascinating part of it so vivian's building a uh an actionable data product for marketers
if your data gets broadly used everywhere and more and more marketers contribute to it so it
becomes better and better what's your competitive advantage in what's your moat
that i am going to be the person who understands the human face the most there you go you will have
more data on why people are doing things what it is and by the way uh what vivian's doing is really
fascinating she's giving people the ability to read what it is that users are responding to
and if she has better data on that than everybody else guess what that's incredibly powerful for
marketers and the more people that use it the more data she'll get the stronger a network effect
will be the bigger her moat will be you're nodding but i'm making this up as i go is that true
good all right so now it's your turn i want to have uh each of you take your value prop
and tell me what you think could be i'll go back to the 3d's defensible disruptive and also
discontinuous about it and let's help you do all do that so i'll walk around and make sure you do
it so get your 3d's up and let's get some uh help for those i'm going to just tell you that
everybody's coming up with very good um 3d's so first of all i was most surprised by taste of
Kenya because consumer products are very difficult to create defensibility with but um
zippora and her team have got a great answer to this and if i get this wrong tell me they've
got 10-year contracts that they're writing with people which is locking them into a situation
sorry go ahead with the farmers which is locking them into a place where other people won't be
able to compete as i understand it and then over here i was really excited when i heard a little
bit about space health and why is it disruptive it isn't space it's a new and scary we're always
going to be going pretty obvious space in of itself is a whole disruptive industry it like
changes the notion that we're actually bound to our planet very disruptive and it's actually
becoming an industry because of that and there are a whole bunch of things that are changing
because of the fact that we can access space very very interesting i mean we're thinking about
all sorts of new industries as a result of that new materials that we might create new forms of
for example life that we might explore etc so it's very disruptive okay so i was also very excited
when i heard about cohort first thing i heard from them what about what's disruptive sorry
discontinuous is what used to be an education an analog is now being turned digital by them
that's a great example very disruptive things going from analog to digital perfect example
of discontinuity a discontinuity all right then we came to Sharon's new bike seat i was thinking
oh bike seat that can't be that you know defensible but then i heard that what she's doing is actually
measuring all the data in use while the bike seat is being ridden and the form of the bike
seat is changing on the fly as a result of that data now the question that i didn't get to hear is
why is it defensible uh defensible ip with the technology and then the other thought was like
long-term contracts with bike share companies don't you think your data will become defensible at
some point too that as well and it's important because women specifically in a lot of issues but
in bike health issues are understudied as well so there's actually not enough data about that
right all right so i could keep going around the room but just for time i won't i will encourage
you all now to start thinking about instead of talking about better faster cheaper what do you
do that's disruptive discontinuous and defensible because that's going to set you up for success
and look at all the great ideas you have you've all got a great basis to go defend your business
and to to make it really stand out in this breakout way so well done very very exciting
okay so we're on to the last leg and this is the piece that hopefully will help you decide
whether you've got a business that's worth pursuing and that's how you evaluate it
so your business or your value proposition needs to be something that is going to last
and endure and be sustainable and so there are only a few frameworks here but they're
quite important the first one is something i've already been testing with you as we've been
going through this evening what was the situation before your product and what is the situation
after your product so for argument's sake saline health if people don't get any cure for the
challenges they address in with going through menopause they're going to be out of work a lot
and dysfunctional a lot and they're going to obviously have personal health issues on top of
all of that that may lead to other complications in their life so that's pretty clear what the
before is the after is what would you say higher productivity among those women it just they just
function normal and give back their life that like a high quality of life they should have so
literally you could say acute pain or absolute joy and there might be a whole bunch of other
things that you might expound on this and i'd encourage you to really go to the absolute
extreme if you possibly can't say if their mothers for example that they might be able to
look after their families and sustain that their livelihoods as mothers etc or if their
workers obviously that they're you know they're supporting their community etc there's a lot
of things that could could be great if they get their health back whereas if they don't
they're dysfunctional in their their situation in life so try to bring those things out the
other thing thing about this is where you get challenged is when you are a consumer product
and i i put um taste of kenya up here which is sometimes people will say something is well
it's nice to have it's like a vitamin versus you know a morphine so i have a question for you
because i know you've got the answer which is why do you think the before and after and in uh
you know taste of kenya is so powerful so to the farmers if we don't serve them they're going to
cut down their coffee trees so coffee is going to be extinct in kenya uh for the consumers
they're never going to have a half to drink ever going to get to drink kenyan coffee
okay so it's pretty much a national issue at some level the way you just described it which is great
so anyway the before and after we want to make sure that you can say it in a way that this is
something that's not a nice to have vitamin but it is really a necessary penicillin or morphine
something that is actually vital to their health now it's not always going to be the case but the
more you can define it in those terms which is so critical to people they say okay yeah i've got to
have that then the more likely you are to be able to say great i'm on to a good track so just because
i'm again going to keep us on time i encourage you to just do this as a t diagram when you're
doing your um your value problem just do the before and after and you can do that anytime
obviously very easy exercise to do the more you can speak to your customers again back to this
whole approach to don't ask this in a vacuum speak to your your user your customer and say
tell me all your problems before and remember you want to get them to list those all as long as you
can and then if we deliver this for you what will it look like afterwards what will be all the things
that you'll be celebrating that you can now do that you couldn't do before whether it's getting
your health back or it's whether it's drinking your favorite coffee or whether it's being able to
for example get access to the engineering talent that you didn't have before or whether it's making
sure your data actually is delivering the right insights that you need as in terribly there are
all these things that you'll be able to do and that's critical to put out on your value problem
makes sense one question how do you actually make sure that that is something you could measure
that's what this next framework is so the gain-pain ratio is incredibly simple and yet very
powerful and what it is is it's measuring the gain you deliver to your customer versus the pain
for them to actually adopt what you do now i'm almost certain that all of you could tell me all
the gain that you deliver but i'm almost certain that you probably couldn't tell me all the pain
and the challenges of adopting it so let's talk talk talk you through an example
so how many of you use venmo great me too became really obvious to me that first of all you know
just sending money for to pay for basic things and services why on earth would i write a check ever
again totally the most dumb thing it's become so convenient it was very easy to use from the
minute i started using it however it wasn't always that way and the pain that first went on
as venmo got first adopted was it was yet another app for users to use they had to connect it to
their bank and they weren't sure whether it was really secure and to start off with not everybody
had it so it wasn't really that useful because the network didn't exist and this is sort of the
cold start problem that a lot of you might have with your idea so you got to think about all
of that and you also got to remember all those things so here's my tip for you which is super
easy which is when you go to talk to your customer don't pitch them your idea again ask all the
reasons why they have pain but then ask them this one question what are all the reasons you would
not buy my product so why would you not buy this product tell me all the reasons and keep asking
that question over and over and over again until you get them to tell you all the pain points they
would have i can give you a clue about some of them number one is well i don't really need it that
badly so guess what i could use the alternative well that's a bad starting point so you're gonna
have to figure out you know why and what is it that they don't like about the alternative that
actually if you gave them something way better they might use it the second might be cost that's
always an easy excuse but then there's other things that are not so obvious like for example
training how do i retrain people to use this new approach to doing things or if you're selling a
bike seat it might be as basic as well my supply chain is already in place and i don't want to
change and disrupt that it's too easy for me to just buy all the component parts i have they're
already cheap and you'd slowed all down i've had to design this new bike seat in and get all this
new data you know flowing into this new device and that'd be a new complication for me to worry
about how is that all going to fit with this thing i sell already very effectively called the bike
i'm making it up but it's the kind of thing you want to pull out before you you know end up saying
okay i've got my value prop nailed so let's keep going with the venmo example the other thing that's
always there is a startup in the middle of this equation is a inertia and the risk of you as a
startup being something that a customer is going to rely on so do i really need this is one of the
things but also what happens if i put my money in this network and this startup fails i just
lost whatever money i was sending to people that's a huge risk people don't want to do that unless
they feel like oh this is like bank like security so these are things that you have to think about
upfront by the way there's some things that you know these products often don't think of initially
such as well how can i split the bill and do the tips then we figured that out and eventually
they got through that issue so whatever it is that you have assume that there's a reason why people
will initially resist you even if it's just that you're a startup and they don't take a risk on you
and think about how you'll overcome that so now the question is what's the right ratio
of gain to pain before somebody will take a risk on you
anybody want to take a guess yep go ahead no pain well that would be awesome so it'd be infinite
so your ratio is infinite i love it all right go ahead dan why 10 to 1 because you got to get
people over that activation energy yeah to me get excited about your product and make it a priority
yeah so what's interesting about bigger faster better sorry cheaper better faster is do you think
30 to 90 cheaper is going to cause people to do something to change how might they might use
for example their travel and what it caused david's business to take off
we're not asking david so we're asking you anybody what does anybody think
yes yep i would say for certain users yeah so why i always say this there are not answers here
i would agree with both viewpoints so for certain classes of user for example if you are selling to
a pharma company and they're you know doing experimentation i would say 10 to 1 is probably
right because it's very expensive for them to go change their workflows to develop new drugs
but for a consumer if you can offer a 30 to 90 cheaper solution david might really be on to
something i would want to send you know save that money maybe even 10 percent would be enough of the
threshold maybe not maybe 20 maybe anyway you get my point you've got to measure this and you've
got to ask your user and you've got to be clear what's the threshold for you on the gain pain
ratio where you would make a change that would make you take the risk and get over the inertia
that's why this is such a useful formula can i ask a question about that example um because i feel
like there's the pain of maybe like switching platforms you normally use to look for travel
but it strikes me that with that particular example there's another pain of changing the way
you travel because you're not putting in a destination so i'm wondering how you think
about those two because one seems like more a longer term shift that you're trying to prompt
so i'm gonna let you and david debate that afterwards but because it's it's specific to him
the principle though is still the same which is what you're asking david to do is say david
why would i take this risk and why would i use your service versus what i'm already doing
and i'll give you an answer that i think is important to sort of use in a general sense
so that it's not about david's business which is if the customer has something that they're
comfortable with and you really are not giving them at least an order of magnitude improvement
in something or a significant gain in something they're not going to do anything life's too short
they're too busy they'd rather just carry on doing whatever they're doing the greatest inertia and
the greatest reason that people fail is because they're not solving a valuable enough problem
that where the gain-pain ratio is big enough that somebody will make a change
or that'll adopt something and it can be on either side of this equation too by the way
for example let's use a case in point that we've all experienced which is it's incredibly easy
to download an app it's point click download the app so that pain if you will of trying something
is incredibly low but then if you start using it and it's no good it's also incredibly easy to
point click delete so you've got to find something that is really valuable on a sustainable basis
for somebody and ideally make it so easy for them to adopt it that it's going to be a very successful
go-to-market motion for you when you start selling it and that's what this pain gain ratio is all
about so by the way venmo did some very clever things they added all these security measures
they made sign up so easy for example you could just scan a qr code to pay in certain situations
and there are a whole set of things that became obviously so simple that we've all adopted it
and it's now friction-free and because the network's there we talked about that too
it's obviously got huge defensibility because nobody else is going to just disrupt that because all
the people that you already pay on venmo it's just one click for you to pay them obvious stuff right
so let me make sure that you get a clear idea of what are the things to look for on gain-pain so
first of all on on the gain is pretty obvious you know how much money do you make people how
much time do you save them all that stuff you're going to you're going to nail that I know that's
not the problem on the pain side don't forget how you are going to have to help people find you
try you buy you adopt you get trained into your system and everything else that's associated with
owning you all of that is pain all of that has to be factored into your gain-pain ratio
and in the middle don't forget all these things that are associated with what ultimately come down
to risk and are inertia for people to change anything if you do that you have the basis to
evaluate your value prop and you're in the power seat at that point because you can keep telling
yourself your thing's great but until you see that tipping and customers are pulling you to market
and saying yep this is really something I've got to adopt you know you haven't got it right
so uh terror flow was easy for me to to uh pick down uh I would say you have work to do on your
your gain-pain because the way you expressed your value prop is very clear like for you know
translational scientists and we know the who is for with traditional r package you know ours are
for those of you don't know hugely widely adopted language that's used for statisticians
um due to you haven't quite got the unmet needs yet so that's great you'll probably
can figure that out I might say based on what I've learned the inability to gain the insights
necessary to define the data data path for them uh terror flow offers the platform but allows scientists
to extract clinical breakthroughs now you're going to have to decide how will you declare that as at
least an order of magnitude since that's the term you came up with better than the alternative of
doing nothing because otherwise they will do nothing make sense okay good so I will just simply
say we got to the end naturally otherwise which is you already know where we're headed I already
told you what the value prop is I gave you the statement up front now what I'm going to just
just put it all together for you which is this value prop statement is actually built by all the
frameworks we just took you through and again this is in the workbook so the four piece defining
who it is for use this minimum viable segment again that's in your workbook I drew it very briefly
here and talked about how do you find the same needs that you can address with your first product
don't get pulled all over the place find a set of users for whom you have the same needs your
minimum viable segment check that they are latent and critical needs ideally rather than
latent and aspirational that's the black and white framework or if they start latent and
aspirational be clear how you're going to get them the question that Victor asked from just using
something that was just a basic platform a basic product like an iPad to a place where it becomes
mission critical and then how do you define what's urgent and underserved and unworkable etc that's
the four use if your audience tells you that if your customer tells you that then you know
you're dealing with the right customer and you've identified the right pain points for them same
with what are they dissatisfied with things that are unworkable if they really are unworkable
they're not going to put up with it and if they're underserved in other words they're not being able
to get for example the coffee they need or for example the comfort they need or the travel access
they need or the safety they need or the health they need etc then spell it out that's where it'll
go in your value problem and then don't just say it's faster better cheaper tell people why it's
disruptive and it's a discontinuous innovation it's gone digital as opposed to used to be analog or
it's now online and accessible and then it provides something which you want to make sure they are
very clear is an order of magnitude breakthrough and that's where you use the gain-prane ratio
you don't just say it's x you say it's 10x and here's why because for you to adopt it
even with the pain of you know retraining etc you're going to get this enormous gain
that is compelling and then finally it's unlike the things that at the moment are also unworkable
for one reason or another or are not addressing your need or underserved it's your value problem
so with that we're finishing one minute early now any questions before we wrap up
yeah go ahead Sappora could you please walk us through the black again
so a lot of products might start out as being something that in this framework
are latent and aspirational in other words people would like to have this is a nice to have
but really where you want to get to is a place where it's blatant
and critical
so this is a must have so i don't need to tell any of you this but all the things that are subsistence
for you are must haves food water health anything that enables you to do your job they're all must
haves all the things down here like well depending on the thing you like but you know
what you spend your money on is your business but entertainment might be a nice to have in
certain circumstances compared to health pretty obvious to state that or fashion might be a
nice to have versus come i mean versus you know it's winter in boston so things that protect
you from the cold i mean there's just basic ways to define things that are nice to have versus
must haves the more you can understand how you move from the nice to have to the must have the
better does that make sense great okay so i'll let you come up and ask any questions you like but
i want to finish now on time so thank you very much for for joining in on this i will say that the
most important thing in all of this is that it's built around you so if you don't uniquely understand
the problem you're addressing then why are you doing it because you're going to face a lot of
competition from people who do know better than you then which case what can your solution
deliver uniquely well is what we've been spending all this time on based on what you know that also
can be built around you and finally if you can bring that all together around what we talked
about last time around a disruptive business model then it's going to be sustainable and so this is
oftentimes what people refer to as founder market fit it's why you are uniquely in a position to solve
this particular value prop and and do it in a way that is sustainable with a business model
that we talked about last week so in summary have fun defining it have fun evaluating it and make
sure it's built around you and you'll have a great company thanks very much being a pleasure
