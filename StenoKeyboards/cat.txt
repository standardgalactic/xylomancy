Can you type the word cat on the world's fastest keyboard?
My guess is that you probably can't.
Go ahead, try it.
First letter is C.
Uh, there is no C.
Okay, let me help you out.
Remember, this is a stenography keyboard,
so you have to press all your keys all at once.
First, you have to look at the layout from left to right.
Each section represents the beginning, middle,
and end of the word you are trying to type.
Second, only focus on how the word sounds, not the spelling.
This means you can ditch the C for K,
and the keyboard will translate that into the correct word.
So, you can type cat by pressing K-A-T all together at once.
