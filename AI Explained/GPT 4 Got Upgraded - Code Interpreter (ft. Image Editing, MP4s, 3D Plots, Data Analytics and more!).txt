I just got access to the code interpreter plugin about 48 hours ago and have been running
experiments on it non-stop since then. I've come up with about 18 examples to show you guys its power.
Most of them I reckon haven't been seen before. I predict many industries will have to update
overnight when it's released more widely and at the end of the video please let me know what you
think and what other experiments that we can try. First though what about this one? A 3D surface
plot. Just quickly the way it works is you click this little button to the left of the text box
and then you can upload many different file types like CSV files, word files, images and even short
videos. Then it will automatically analyze the file type without you pressing anything and then
of course you give it a prompt and as with all of chatbt it becomes a conversation. So the first
3d surface plot was decent but it was too small so I simply said in natural language can you make
it four times bigger thank you and of course you have seen the amazing end result even with the
lighting. Look at these shadows there. I believe this is based on a real contour map of a volcano
in New Zealand and I could do a whole video just on this but I have 17 other examples to get to
but this one was truly amazing. Did you know for example it can generate QR codes? I said create
a QR code that I can scan with my phone to reach the following URL and lo and behold it creates it
and yes it does work. Maybe I'm easily impressed but I think that's pretty amazing and what about
a 3d scatter plot? This is truly remarkable. I uploaded the data from GapMinder and it created
this chart based on the median age of over 100 countries from 1950 I think projected to 2100
and I asked highlight the UK that this is indeed the UK's median age through those years in red
but I know what you might be thinking that is amazing that it's 3d and interactive but the blue
kind of merges and it's hard to see what's going on. I engaged in a conversation and look what it
created. It picked out the 30 most populous countries and separated them off with separate
colors. Look at that that is gorgeous. Now you might have the critique that the median age is in
descending order in the y-axis going from 20 down to 60 so in a sense the median age is actually
rising not falling but nevertheless that's easily amendable and that is truly an incredible diagram
and look just for fun I'm going to go into the data look at this I'm traveling into the data
this is so wild I don't know how helpful it is but I think that's just beautiful and crazy there
are so many industries data analytics accounting consultancy that this will affect by the way
it got all of this done in about a minute I see a lot of people online talking about five seconds
later it is no way done in five seconds you have to wait 30 seconds a minute sometimes much longer
before I move on I want to give you a killer tip that it took me quite a while to work out
so when you get access try to remember this say output the visualization as a downloadable file
if you don't add that phrase as a downloadable file what will happen is it often gets stuck
at this stage of the code it'll either say fig.show or plot.show and then just stop I found that I
encountered this problem far less often if I said output a downloadable file next did you know that
code interpreter can do optical character recognition I screenshotted this text from
a New York Times article I think it was and I asked OCR the text in this image and write a poem
in Danish about it now I don't want to exaggerate it often gets OCR wrong I don't want to get your
hopes up it fails more often than it succeeds but when it works it can do it understood the text
and then did a poem in Danish about the text now I'm going to need a Danish speaker to tell me if
that was a good poem but either way it could do it how about this one it can do interactive time
series with range sliders and selectors I uploaded a CSV file on life expectancy data from the entire
world and I just said can you pick out the US UK and India and create a time series with range
slider and selectors again that killer phrase output a downloadable file and here is what it came
up with notice how the life expectancy for all three countries rises during the 20th century
and look how I can select down here interactively a range of the data and even by clicking up here
a 10-year interval or 50-year interval here's the crazy thing I did nothing I just uploaded the
file there were hundreds of countries in there you can see here all the steps that it did and if you
click on the arrow you get to see the actual code but then it goes through shows its explanation
and eventually gives you a link that you can simply click and get the file downloaded and if you
weren't that impressed already here's where it gets fairly game-changing you can get it to do the
data analytics not just the visualizations for example I said find five unexpected non-obvious
insights from this data and offer plausible explanations for them this was back to the
median age data for the most interesting observation provide a compelling and clear
visualization now ignore the first diagram which wasn't that good because of the x-axis but look
at the insights this is data analytics you can see here that the original file was called median age
years and it was just a table of data no analysis whatsoever but look what GPT-4 picked out insight
one the global median age has been steadily increasing over time it calculated the global
median age that wasn't included in the data it was just country data and it says it's gone from
around 22 years to over 38 years in 2023 and it's projected to continue rising to approximately
44 years by 2100 and then it offers a cogent explanation this trend is likely due to a combination
of increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility rates worldwide as medical technology
improves more people are living longer birth rates are declining particularly in developed regions
it's picked this all out and then it moves on to the next insight the countries that have seen the
most significant increases in median age are these ones and again it gives an explanation as to why
their median age might have risen more than any other for example Albania has seen significant
emigration of younger people which could also lead to an older median age is it me or is that kind
of crazy that it crunched all the data visualized it but then also gave really interesting analyses
of the data now you can read the other analyses but each of them are really interesting and the
final visualization which i asked for is brilliant i think notice how the graph goes from green to
red when you get to the future projection i didn't ask it to do that now obviously in this video i'm
going to focus on the flashy visuals and the cool little tricks it can do but in terms of data analytics
that is what is going to change jobs change industries and remember this is code interpreter
alpha version one look at the difference between mid-journey version one and now mid-journey version
five a year later how about basic video editing now there is a limit to what it can do but it
can do some basic video editing if you ask it for example i uploaded a short file and asked it to
rotate the file 180 degrees and it was able to do it now i'm not saying that is massively useful
but it was able to do it here is a similar example i uploaded an image file and then said
can you zoom out from the center of the image now initially it did zoom in but then i clarified
that i wanted it to zoom out from the center just to be cheeky i also asked can you make it black and
white oh and i also asked to add music but it couldn't add music anyway here is the end result
by the way it gave it to me as an mp4 file and look it zooms out from the center and it's made
the image black and white now because i got access so recently i honestly haven't explored the limits
of what kind of video editing i can do with chat gpt code interpreter but i will let you know when
i can now back to visualizations i gave it a hypothetical scenario that sounds kind of realistic
i sent 231 cvs got 32 responses 12 phone interviews three follow-up face-to-face
interviews and one job offer which i rejected output a downloadable sanki diagram of this data
i did then get it to change the coloring slightly but i think that's a pretty cool sanki diagram
look sent cvs 231 and then receive responses and you can go down 32 phone interviews 12
face-to-face interviews and three job offers and one rejected offer obviously i could have
tweaked that for hours make it more visual make it more interactive maybe make a gif of it but
for two minutes work i think that's a pretty interesting and incredible output next and here
is one that you might say is a little bit concerning and it's about steganography now i will admit i
am not a tall and expert in fact i know virtually nothing about it essentially what it involves
though is hiding a message inside an image or inside some code and gpt4 was more than willing
to play along and it encoded a secret message into an image there is the image by the way and if
you looked at that you'd think that's totally normal that's just a silly little image right
well apparently here's what it can do to a casual observer it looks like a simple image with some
shapes but it actually contains the hidden message hello world then it provided a python function
which can be used to decode the message from the image now obviously this is just a silly example
that is totally harmless but am i being crazy in thinking this is a somewhat concerning ability
for future language models to possess especially when they reach the level of an agi often open
ai talk about future versions of gpt doing scientific research and finding things that humans
wouldn't have discovered but let me pose the scenario that it gets better than any human expert
at steganography anyway enough from me i'll let the experts weigh in on that one next did you
know that gpt4 with code interpreter can do text to speech just before anyone comments though why
did i write proceed without further question because gpt4 with code interpreter has a tendency to
always ask clarifying questions and if you have access to only 25 messages every three hours you
don't want to use up half or more of them on clarifying what it wants to do or saying yes
please do that but i found writing proceed without further question means it gets straight to it and
essentially you get double the number of prompts for your money anyway as you can see i asked turn
this entire prompt starting from the beginning into a text speech file now quite a few times it
denied it had the ability to do this but eventually i got it to work it was actually when i finally
gave it this prompt and it worked i say it worked but it didn't quite work as intended check it out
here is the text to speech that it came up with you are at gpt a large language model trained by
open ai when you send a message containing python code to python it will be executed in a state full
job at a notebook environment python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after
120.0 seconds internet access for this session is disabled do not make external web requests or
api calls as they will fail now thank you steven hawking for that message the only thing is it
had nothing to do with my original prompt now anyway when you get access to code interpreter
play about with text to speech because it is able to do it even if it denies it time for a fun one
i asked create a tree map of the letters in the following quote and i'm not going to read it out
because i am not good at tongue twisters anyway i said give each part of the tree map a different
color and output a downloadable file proceed without further question and here is the output
and i checked it for the letter p and it was correct that there were 36 instances of the letter p
in the output and look how it's proportional with the number of instances of the letter
and the size of each rectangle i think that is pretty insane okay back to something more serious
i uploaded this file which is an image of a math problem quite a hard one as well and you guessed
it i said solve the math problem in this image it then extracted the text from the image presumably
using ocr and then proceeded to solve it and i'm going to get onto this in a second it is
better at math than wolfram alpha i know that's a big claim but it's far less buggy i found wolfram
alpha crashing very frequently anyway here are the two solutions and isn't that incredible from a
photo essentially it then extracts out the math problem including the two square roots and then
solves it this is all within the same window of chat tpt no need for any other apps or extensions
next it can do radial bar plots which i think are really quite beautiful i'm not saying this is the
best one ever and i'm sure you could tweak it to make it more clear and beautiful look at that the
life expectancy in the us climbing from 1800 and then it goes clockwise reaching a projected
almost 90 by 2100 again i'm sure you could do a far better job than me in extracting out a more
beautiful diagram but aren't radial bar plots just beautiful to look at speaking of cool diagrams
how about this i didn't even specify which visualization to do i uploaded this same life
expectancy data and i just said what are the most advanced and technical visualizations you can do
with this data proceed to do them now honestly it picks some visualizations that i don't think
are the most advanced but nevertheless it was creative here is what it did it does frequently
make the mistake of cluttering the axes and having far too many labels so that you can't see anything
so scrub that one out not great but what about the next few remember it just did this on its own
this is a heat map and you can see some really interesting things from this data like india
starting with a much lower life expectancy than anyone else but gradually rising but still falling
behind the others even in 2100 and look at china look how the life expectancy drops in the 60s and
70s i think we all know what happened there compare that to the us which is a gradual continual
ascent actually aside from 2020 look how the shade gets a little darker in 2020 obviously you guys
can probably work out what happened around then but then the projections are for it to go up toward
90 by 2100 that's a beautiful and clear heat map that i didn't even ask for it to do let's look
at the next one box plot do you remember those from school you get the upper end of the data the
highest one the lowest one the median the first quartile and third quartile and it's a great
way of statistically representing a set of data and it's done it for every 50th year starting in
1900 obviously a slightly less beautiful diagram than some of the ones you've seen today but for
the statisticians in the audience you will know that this is a very useful metric for a lot of
data the individual points above and below are typically when there are outliers in the data
i would estimate that all of these visualizations only took around two two and a half minutes
so definitely not the 10 seconds as i said that you often see on twitter i mean have you ever
seen gpt4 give an answer in less than 10 seconds speaking of useful i think many professionals
will find the next thing that i'm about to showcase the most useful of all any insights that gpt4
finds trends medians analyses whatever you can ask it to add to the original file and then download
it do you remember that the original file was called median age years well notice this file name
median age years with insights it has created a downloadable new file with the insights included
and look at some of the insights that i mean you have the change from 1950 to 2100 and here is the
average median age throughout the period and the change from 2023 to 2100 notice that the
original file didn't have those columns they were added by gpt4 with code interpreter and now how
about data progression video files i was honestly shocked when i saw that it could do this but i
asked can you make a 256 by 256 mp4 that gradually reveals the lines as they progress on the x axis
this was about the median age over time here is what it did and look at how the data and the chart
progresses as time moves along i was really shocked to see this and the line in red which is going to
be labeled at the end is the global median age and remember it calculated that that wasn't in the
original file now i'm not sure why it picked out these four countries maybe because they represent
extremes by the way i think the result is phenomenal and i'm genuinely impressed that it did this even
though i know the final result could be improved dramatically for example far higher resolution
and maybe the global median age labeled from the start and actually now that it's got to the end
i can see why it did pick out these countries because niger did have the lowest median age in 2100
and it looks like corterico had the highest and the fastest aging one was albania next and this is
going to shock quite a few people what about image editing i created this image in mid-journey version
five and then here's what i asked i said use open cv to select the foreground of this image
and look what it did it picked out the foreground no blue sky now i know it's not perfect but it's
nevertheless impressive all within the window of chat bt this does actually make me wonder if open ai
and chat bt is eventually not now but in a few years gonna swallow all other apps or maybe google's
gemini but either way one interface one website one app doing the job of all others and by the way
of course chat bt is now available on ios but imagine you have one app and it can do image
editing text to speech video editing everything data analysis not at gbt4 levels but gbt6 or gbt7
levels if you can get every piece of information service and application in one interface a bit
like now people being addicted to their smartphones won't people be addicted to this one interface
again that's not going to happen now but i'm just posing it as a question to think over for the
moment though before anyone gets too carried away it does still hallucinate quite a lot so i
uploaded this image and i asked it questions about it and it answered and i was like wow it can do
image recognition it said this image appears to be a digital painting of a humanoid figure at a desk
with a rather complex background i was initially amazed until i realized that it probably got that
from the file name because when i asked it questions it got it wrong so i said what is on the desk
now look back there's this weird kind of microphone and a bit of paper and not much
else a keyboard and look what it said there are multiple floating holographic displays okay a mouse
not really a desk lamp i can't see that and then tools and devices now correct me if i'm wrong but
i think most of those are incorrect now obviously i need to do far more experiments to see if it
actually can recognize any particular images and maybe i'm putting it down too harshly but at the
moment it does seem to hallucinate if you ask it about too much of the detail of an image next
you remember how one of the key weaknesses of gt4 is that it can't really count things especially
not characters words etc and even more so it can't do division and some of you might be thinking well
with wolfram alpha it can do those things not quite here is an example of the code interpreter
plugin essentially eating wolfram alpha obviating it making it not obvious what the utility of it
is if you've got code interpreter i asked divide the number of the letter e's in this prompt by
the number of the letter t's now you might think code interpreter can improve things by doing the
character counting but it can also do the division notice how it counted the characters correctly
compared to wolfram alpha and of course got the division correct as well so if it can do advanced
quadratics and do division and character counting etc it does beg the question what would we use
wolfram alpha for that we can't use code interpreter for i honestly might not know
something that you guys know so do let me know in the comments it also got this math question
correct and notice you get these beautiful math visuals that you don't get with the base version
of gpt4 you get something more like this where the visuals aren't as clear and notice the base
version of gpt4 gets the question wrong it can't do division but with code interpreter it gets the
question right next one is a quick one pie charts nothing too special but i think it is a fairly
beautiful visualization it doesn't seem to matter how big the csv file is that you upload
this next example was really quite fascinating it was a word puzzle i have tried this particular
word puzzle on gpt4 dozens of times the reason i picked this puzzle it's called a word ladder
is because it really struggles with the puzzle if the number of steps required is more than a
certain number usually about five or six steps it gave me a really interesting border of the limits
of gpt4's planning abilities with language anyway it always gets it wrong here is a demonstration
with the base model of gpt4 you might say why is this wrong but look at how it's changed from
seas to sags which is more than one letter change and that's typical of the kind of errors it makes
what about with code interpreter well you can probably guess the ending given that i featured it
in the video but it gets it right i believe it draws upon a hard coded word set and this does
point towards the kind of puzzles that i think gpt4 with code interpreter will be able to solve
things like crosswords and sedocus okay not exactly world changing but nevertheless i think
quite fascinating and how about venn diagrams the reason i picked this example is that i had to go
through about 10 steps to get it to create this rather basic three-way venn diagram this represents
the overlap between dogs ai and desks and apparently all of them are loyal companions well we will see
about that but anyway it took quite a few steps to get it right which is pretty annoying but here's
the really interesting thing once i got it set up in the way that i like all i had to do was say
use the format above to create a new three-way venn diagram this time for mangoes movie heroes
and marma sets try to make each entry funny and use different colors proceed without further
questions so it may have been a struggle to set up initially but once done it was so easy
to iterate a new three-way venn diagram and actually it was better than the original apparently all
three are adored by fans worldwide apparently only marma sets and movie heroes can climb up trees
really fast and mangoes and marma sets can hang upside down that's crazy one or two prompts
iterating on a design already agreed upon this is honestly what is likely to happen in the future
with people spending hours to find the perfect data visualization or piece of data analysis
and then just hitting copy paste for all their other files perfect it once and then it does the
rest for you a quick couple of bonus ones before i finish you can just ask it to come up with a
visualization giving it no direction at all it came up with a distribution of prime numbers
up to 10 000 thing is i believe there's a slight mistake at the beginning because i think there's
only 25 in the first 100 and 21 in the next 100 so you probably do want to still check the outputs
that code interpreter gives you and that's another reason it's not going to instantly replace all
data analysis and data visualization it's not perfect and it's not fully reliable but you've
got to look ahead to where things are going i'm going to end where i started with this insane
3d surface map of a volcano if this is what gpc4 can do now with the alpha version of code interpreter
what will gpc5 or 6 do with version 7 or 20 of code interpreter i was about to speculate about that
but then i got distracted with trying to get inside this volcano it is kind of fun and look
i'm going above and into the volcano let me know what you will try when you get access i know they're
rolling it out steadily and i know that some people have had access to it for about three weeks
so hopefully if you want to experiment with it you will be able to soon in the meantime do let
me know if you have any ideas that you want me to experiment with and thank you so much for watching
all the way to the end have a wonderful day
