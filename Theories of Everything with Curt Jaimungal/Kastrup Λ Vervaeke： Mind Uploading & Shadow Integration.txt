This channel is about investigating theories of everything. Now that includes string theory,
or M theory, or some flavor of string theory, E8, geometric unity, even Wolfram's model,
in fact I'm speaking with Wolfram in about a week, but also broadly speaking it encompasses
Veltan Xiaowings, that is a philosophical, comprehensive theory of everything, hence
the following two guests, Bernardo Kastrup and John Verweke. Bernardo Kastrup holds a PhD in
computer science and philosophy, and is defending idealism, that is the ontology that all that
exists is the mental, in fact we're all part of one mind, which he calls mind at large.
John Verweke, on the other hand, is an associate professor at the University of Toronto near me
in cognitive science, advocating for naturalism. My name is Kurt Jaimungal, I'm a filmmaker and
the host of this podcast with a background in math and physics. This is a theologution,
which is rather than critiquing and sparring, it's about constructing and building and
understanding the other's position, consonant with love, hopefully. Round one is linked below
in the description, and it's imperative that you watch that first, or at least look at the time
stamps and skip around a few times, in order to gain a bird's eye view of their respective
philosophies and where they agree slash disagree. Today I welcome the podcast's first sponsors.

Great pleasure to be here. Great pleasure to be here. Great to see you again, Bernardo.
My pleasure, John. Okay, so let's start firstly with a recapitulation of last time. That is,
let's see if, John, if you can state what you think Bernardo says in a way that's
consonant with what he meant and then vice versa. Maybe one to five minutes and we'll start with you,
John. Sure, I'll do my very best and I will reserve any kind of critical response to later.
I just want to make sure that I am understanding. First of all, I want to comment on the fact that
I thought Bernardo's presentation of his ideas was excellent and very clear. So the main, I mean,
there were many theses put forward by Bernardo, but I think the central one that it seems to me,
everything's hanging on, is his claim for, you know, what's in the technical lingo is called
absolute idealism, a strict form of mononism, in which ultimately all of reality is some
modification or state within a unified consciousness, a unified at least at the substantial level.
And then Bernardo wants to deal with one of the crucial problems facing that, which is, well,
where does all this phenomenology, because we're in the realm of consciousness,
about an external world and material objects that seem to exist independent of our consciousness
come from. Bernardo made it very clear that he's not a solipsist, and he's in that sense
not what you might call an individual Berkleyan idealist. Objects exist when we're not looking at
them and the deep past isn't a problem for him, because the consciousness within which
reality is to be found, if that's the right way of putting it, is what he sometimes calls cosmic
mind or mind at large, which is a consciousness. So the main argument he makes, and I don't want
to say that it's exclusive argument, he made many arguments and they're all connected, but
the central argument is an argument in terms of parsimony. So he argues that the main problem
facing a naturalistic account, and I think just one small thing, I try to make clear that I think
the real competitor with his view is a kind of naturalism, that a naturalism has difficulty
explaining the emergence and also the interact, the emergence of something like consciousness
understood as subjective qualitative experience, qualia, and how that qualia could possibly
causally interact with the material domain. So there are two perennial problems, and he argues
that parsimony says the way to avoid those is just to posit that there's one underlying unified
substance, and then he faces, as I said, the difficulty of explaining how we get externality
and materiality, and the way he explains that is that there is a dissociation process,
somewhat analogous to the empirical evidence we have for dissociative states within the consciousness
of human beings, and that something analogous to that is going on in cosmic mind, and that
psychological, I think that's right, dissociation helps to explain the phenomenological
externality and the phenomenological materiality. I think that's the best I can do right now
within one device. It's pretty good. Bernardo? I think John's main message is not necessarily
metaphysics dependent. I think the import of what he has to say would still be there,
whatever metaphysics turns out to be true, whatever that argument goes. His main message,
as far as I understand, which is, of course, filtered by my own interests, has to do with
meaning. I think we in the West today are in a very peculiar historical situation,
and John points that out very well, in which we've lost our sources of meaning. We've lost contact
with the fundamental driver of life, the will to meaning, as opposed to Nietzsche's will to power,
or Freud's will to pleasure. In that sense, John is in the line that in the 20th century maybe
he was most visibly defended by Viktor Frankl, that idea of the search for meaning.
Metaphysically, John is not prepared to give up on some reality behind the concept of matter,
but he's not an extreme reductionist in the sense that he is not saying that consciousness can be
completely accounted for purely by quantitative physical parameters. He appeals to some forms
of emergence, perhaps even to what Chalmers would call some form of strong emergence,
which basically means that the emergent phenomenon cannot be directly deduced from
complete knowledge of the underlying dynamics. In other words, something real with the reality of
its own arises from or in a way related to brain processing, and that's something that has reality
is our conscious lives. And if I understood him, if I correctly recall what he said,
he's even open to some forms of downward causation. He's open to some forms of
the gestalt of our conscious experience impinging downwards into brain processes. And of course,
there is some degree of empirical evidence for that. It's difficult for me now to proceed and
point out in a critical way points where I disagree with John's main message because,
well, I largely don't. I think the point where we don't see it wise on the details of the
metaphysics, I don't think, however, that that is really relevant for the importance of what he has
to say. But I do think, and I'm trying to do my best to be critical about something, I think that
if we appeal to things that are unknown, such as some form of strong emergence,
I think the burden is on the one who appeals to it to try to close that somehow, to try to
make sense of that somehow. And I think that even has some degree of psychological bearing. And we
did talk briefly about it last time. I posed the question, you know, for people to really find meaning
in their lives, would they be satisfied with the notion that they make their own meaning?
Or do they really have to have at least the belief that there is inherent meaning out there,
that we are not making stuff up to sort of deceive ourselves? And that's the point where
I think John's message could benefit from a more explicit, well-defined metaphysical position.
I think it would strengthen his main message, his, the role, the main role he's playing in the
culture right now. That was excellent. Very fair. Very fair. Let's be recollective for a second.
As for the last conversation, I'm curious how you all think it went and what
point or point said by the other person nettles you ever since and made you,
may perhaps even rethink a position of yours, maybe not a vital pillar, but gives you pause,
at least. So John, you first, please. Well, first of all, the overall tenor, again,
I think Bernardo succeeded in, I think one of, there's goals that are preliminary to the goals
of conviction of truth, but they're necessary goals. I think Bernardo succeeded admirably in,
and I think this is important, by the way. This is not meant to be dismissive. I think he succeeded
admirably in making his position intellectually respectable. Bernardo knows, as well as I do,
that there are many, many versions of absolute idealism out there that are absolutely drecky
and horrible and woo-woo and their equivalent to postulating that leprechauns cause things.
And it became very clear to me, because this is the first time I really seriously interacted
with Bernardo, that that is not what is happening with him. And he made his position intellectually
respectable. And he did it in a responsive and congenial manner. And I greatly enjoyed the dialogue.
A couple, I mean, I have been thinking about it. I go for walks in the morning, and often
I'm talking to Bernardo in my head when I'm on the walk, which is not an unpleasant thing as well.
And a couple of things for me came up. Well, one was Matt Segal put out a commentary. I texted you,
the link, Kurt, about the discussion. And then I had like a three-hour discussion with him
yesterday, or two and a half hours about Whitehead and his version of pan experientialism and the
notion of prehension. And I found that I was coming a lot closer to that view. And then upon
reflection, I thought, well, when Bernardo was talking about consciousness, he, you know, he
said it's at this instinctive level. It doesn't have intentionality. It doesn't have reflective
rationality, reflective self-awareness. I felt that the distance between us was growing smaller
in the positions I was willing to consider and take seriously. Because I did mention last time
that I take Whitehead's proposal very seriously. I think Whitehead was a significant, one of the
most significant philosophers who was contemporary with the scientific revolution of the early 20th
century. And I think he's an important response to that. And so that happened for me. The thing
that nettles me, I don't know if nettles me is the same. And this goes towards perhaps my larger
metaphysical view, which I briefly talked about last time as being sort of a naturalistic neoplatonism.
So I've been deeply influenced by the neoplatonic ideas. So in Plato, it's pretty much an emanation
metaphysics with participation. And then, Platinus, you have a two-way movement,
dissemination, and then there's return. And that's because the neoplatonists realized that
there were sort of two problems that needed to be explained. How does the one become many,
and how does the many become one? But Platinus still gives emphasis. By the time you get to
Eringina, it's completely dialectical. They're completely equally symmetrical. And I remember
a really good book written by cats quite a while ago called The Metaphysics of Meaning.
Where he basically said that the naturalist faces the problem of getting up to unity and
explaining how normativity emerges. And then he said that the Platinus has the problem
of how do we get the diversity and how do we get down into causation? So it's basically
how do causes become reasons and how do reasons become causes. And I tend to see,
Bernardo, he won't agree with this, but I do think it's movement towards our positions being
closer. I do see, I think, I see what I would, and what Katz has claimed. I think there's a
symmetry issue. I acknowledge that, and I don't mean to imply that Bernardo isn't
acknowledging things. I'm just saying something straight out, that the problem of
emergence is a real problem. And that all we have are weak analogies that fail fundamentally
at the point where we need them to work. I see it, and again, I foresee that Bernardo won't agree,
but I see it that the problem of dissociation is an equally mysterious problem. All he has for it
is a weak analogy, the analogy to psychological dissociation. And it does, it fails at precisely
the point where we need it to work. All the empirical cases of psychological dissociation
don't produce material objects, don't produce independent external existence, etc. So that
dissociation doesn't actually supply the metaphysical move he makes. I see that symmetrical
to the way emergence relies on weak analogies. So if he'll allow me just at least a parallel in
terminology, I think he needs something like strong dissociation to produce the real differences
that we experience phenomenologically, because they're at least phenomenologically real. He
never done that. He's not a solipsist. So I see them as symmetrical. Where that leads to me more
generally is, like I said, I think my metaphysics is very much about the idea that there's a deep
interpenetration of emergence and emanation. That's why I'm attracted to Whitehead. And for me,
that's consonant with the increasing number of non-dualities we are discovering about reality,
matter and energy, time and space, and waves and particles, etc. And so my metaphysics is in that
sense more of a neoplatonic position. Now, what many people on the other side of the fence,
sort of the people who are much more perhaps scientific rather than scientific, but oh,
but neoplatonism is so anti-scientific. I argue explicitly against that. We have very good historical
argumentation that neoplatonism has been and continues to be a significant birthplace for
scientific ideas. It comes to the fore during scientific revolutions.
John Spencer's book on the influence of neoplatonism in the scientific revolution of the 20th century,
I think is very good. The recent work by Berman on Platonism and the objects of science seeing
that science presupposes intelligibility and then presupposes something like, you know,
platonic forms in order to do what it does as science. I think that's a beautifully written
and well argued book. And if you look at it, so for me, my starting place is a little bit
different from Bernardo's. And in that sense, perhaps it might be helpful if I just briefly
said what it was. They're not disconnected from each other, but I don't think they're identical.
So I start from intelligibility. So this is much more like ancient philosophy rather than sort of
a Cartesian approach, which is what has to be presupposed in your ontology in order for knowledge
to exist. So you take it as a fundamental presupposition that you reject absolute skepticism,
absolute solar system. And then the idea is, well, the universe has to be comprehensible,
it has to be intelligible. And then what the neoplatonist notes is there's this weird relations
within intelligibility. You need information in order to have knowledge. Information causes
knowledge. But knowledge can't be reductively explained in terms of information. And you need
knowledge for wisdom, knowledge causes wisdom, but you can't reductively explain knowledge in
terms of wisdom. And so neoplatonism has seen within intelligibility this causal emergence
upward and the normative constraining downward. And it tries to unfold a metaphysics that I think
best grounds are experience of intelligibility that is presupposed by our science.
And I want, and I think this is sincere, I want to see if this is ultimately reconcilable
with that, that at least smaller gap between Bernardo and I, between sort of the right
headion idea of prehension, because he tries to lay that in as the ground both of causation
and of intelligibility. And what Bernardo is saying. So maybe there, maybe there's something
there, I don't know, and I'm happy to explore it. So that's my sort of summation and initial
response. Bernardo, what did John say in the previous round or even now that,
like I said, either gives you pause or upends one of your pillars or at least shakes it
and has been corrupting you since?
Only on the negative side, because your original question was both the positive side and the
negative side. I want to talk about the positive first. It's okay. It's difficult to say that
it's because of our last discussion, because I already knew John's material. So I already sort
of have my favorite thing amongst the many things he says. And then he said it again
in our last debate. So that's the thing that is always with me. And I think that's one of
the most critical things in our culture today, which is to have a correct understanding of what
wisdom means. I think we, we've thumbled that idea so badly in the West, that we've lost our
guides. We just do not know who to look up to for orientation. And I like to call it the idolatry
of nerds. And the word nerd is appropriate, because it means that somebody has chosen one
amongst many psychic skills to center his entire life and ignore all our other psychic functions
and organs, all the other things that are key constituents of wisdom. And we take our cue now
from, from nerds who have an axe to grind, as opposed to true wisdom. So, and John takes this
seriously, he just doesn't say, well, our definition of wisdom is wrong. This is the right
definition. Now he makes it a study area. He invites you to explore that question. He doesn't
whitewash it. He doesn't make it look simple. He gives it the depth that it fundamentally has.
And he doesn't give you a ready answer. But he shows us the way to sort of revise our exploration
of that question. I think this is pretty central. I don't want to get across as too exaggerated,
but it's honest to what I'm about to say. I think it's central to whether we will make it
as a civilization or not. It's central to whether we will survive. Look, the planet will survive if
we screw up badly, give it a million years, and the planet's a garden again, just without us.
Not even without us, because the Australian aboriginals, the Inuits, the Bushmen in Africa,
they have the skills to survive that. The question is whether our culture, our way of life, our
accumulated knowledge, our civilization will survive. And I think that question rests to a
large degree on a better understanding of wisdom and a better choice about who we take our directions
from. So that I think is pretty central. Now, the thing that made me upset, nothing made me
upset, really. So I'll rather choose one of the things that John said now. I'll take this as an
opportunity to try to weave a defense. It's normal, by the way, that I am on the defense,
because I make of my work a metaphysics question. John doesn't. So if the disagreement is on a
metaphysics question, of course I am the one who will be on the defense, because I am the one
who is trying to make an explicit case. John's case doesn't rest on metaphysics. So he doesn't
need to be as explicit. So in a sense, it's natural that I have a much bigger target painted
at my forehead than he has. It's by construction. So he said now that he sees that there is some
symmetry between the analogy of dissociation, doing what it needs to do to serve the purpose
I want it to serve, and an appeal to emergence. I will take the liberty to disagree. I don't
think the symmetry is there. But I recognize the point, because I have heard this made many times
before. And if the point is made very explicit, it goes something like this. If I am a dissociated
alter of universal consciousness in you too, I happen to be here looking at you. I can shake
your hand. I can talk to you. I see you around. But the altars of a person with dissociative
identity disorder don't see each other. They don't shake hands. They are not inhabiting
common environment. So the analogy doesn't work all the way. It doesn't do what I wanted to do.
I think that's not true, because we are taking the analogy at the wrong level.
Remember, we as altars of universal consciousness, we are in a shared mental environment by my
hypothesis. If you take my hypothesis to be true for the sake of argument, we share a mental
environment. And so we see each other within that mental environment. You cannot compare that
to the altars in the mind of a person. You cannot expect those altars to see each other in the
external world, because there is no external world from the point of view of a universal mind.
Everything is within that mind. So if you want to make a comparison correctly, you have to look
at the world within the mind of a person with DID and not expect that the altars will see each other
in the external world. So the correct analogy is to look at the dreams of a person with DID
and compare that to this, a dream of my universe that undergoes dissociation. Because in both cases,
then it's within that mental context. Then it's a correct comparison. So let's look at the dreams
with people with DID. It turns out research from Harvard indicates that 25%, one quarter
of people with DID, they have dreams in which multiple altars partake in the same dream.
And they see each other in the dream. They hear each other in the dream. They interact with each
other in the dream. How do they know that? Because when the person recalls the dream,
afterwards, each alter recalls the dream from a different point of view. And they identify the
other altars as characters in the dream. So if that's the correct comparison, I would say, well,
25% is a very statistically significant number. I would say the analogy does, but it's
supposed to do if you look at it at the correct level for comparison. Now, I will acknowledge
that we don't have a full and explicit conceptual account of dissociation. It has to do with
inferential isolation. It has to do with pathways to memory access. We know that we have pieces
of the puzzle, but we don't have a complete puzzle assemble that tells us this is the conceptual
account of what dissociation is and how it happens. Well, mainly how it happens. We know what it is.
But I would say, well, that is secondary. It takes a second seat to the fact that it empirically
happens. And now there is no question about it from neuroimaging that it does happen. There is
something dissociation looks like. It can make you blind, literally. So the fact that we don't have
a conceptual account for it is not a detriment to one's ability to use dissociation in an
explanatory framework, because whether we conceptually understand it or not, it happens.
It's all there in nature. Now, you can't say the same thing about strong emergence, because
how do you have an empirical account of strong emergence that is independent of your theoretical
assumptions? That's not possible, because all you can say, well, this phenomenon exists. But to say
that it is an empirical instance of strong emergence, you have to say that there is something there
that is physically real and which fundamentally cannot be accounted for in terms of its constituent
parts. Now, that's impossible today and probably forever, because the fastest computers we have,
if they were to run simulations of nature on the basis of first principles, the laws and the standard
model of particle physics, you could simulate maybe 100 particles. A thousand would already be
on the edge. You can't simulate a protein molecule, a complex one, starting from first
principles, from the laws of quantum mechanics and the standard model, because it's an explosion
of complexity. So it is impossible to appeal to an empirical fact about strong emergence,
but it is entirely possible to do that for dissociation. So that's how I would wrap up my
defense. John, what do you think? Make sure from now on, we don't say he, we don't say John, you
because you're speaking to Bernardo and Bernardo. I am in the background. I am just an observer.
I did say Bernardo most of the time I was talking last time. I'll try to say you and Bernardo.
I think you could strengthen your case by the work that's also been done on lucid dreaming.
This sounds, and maybe that's relevant to the discussion we're going to have later about religion,
this sounds very similar to sort of identity ideas about Brahman and Brahman dreaming,
and in the dream, that's how the world, I mean, so the dream mechanism is ultimately the main
mechanism by which the ontology unfolds. And the problem that again arises for me is
most of the empirical accounts of dreaming presuppose a distinction between conscious
and unconscious processing to explain the phenomenology of the dream. So that, you know,
I have a certain amount of consciousness, but I'm not aware of all the unconscious processes that
are then generating the alternatives. And it seems to me then, if you're going to invoke dreaming,
you're going to invoke the ontology that we currently use empirically to explain it,
which posits a very strong distinction between conscious processes and unconscious processes,
in order to explain why dreams have the content they do and why they have the features they do,
etc. Like, why is this coming up? Well, because there's an unconscious process that's doing memory
compression, it's removing parasitic programs, and that's why these figures come up, etc, etc.
And so I think to invoke dreaming is, you know, perhaps problematic, because it ultimately invokes
the existence of an unconscious, which I ultimately, I don't think you can pause it yet for, you know,
consciousness at large, there can't be an unconsciousness for unconscious for consciousness
at large, because then you do have at the substantial level of your fundamental metaphysics,
you have a dualism, and I know you reject ultimately, such dualism. So that would be
the issue I would have there about that. If that makes any sense, it does, it does,
we touched on it last time. And I appealed to the difference between this phenomenally conscious
and phenomenally unconscious divide. And my point was, well, it's all phenomenally conscious,
but there is still a divide. There is a divide between the two sides of a dissociative boundary,
and there is a divide between metacognitive consciousness and non metacognitive consciousness,
processes that are conscious, you are experiencing, but you don't know that you are
experiencing them. So you can't even report them to yourself. Things like blind sight,
for instance, that seem to be going in that direction. So I just wrote a book about Jung's
metaphysics. So this stuff is still very fresh in my mind. I don't have a problem with
the idea of an unconscious as defined implicitly or explicitly by Jung, Freud, and Gianni,
because I think they are very clear, repeatedly about it throughout their corpus, corpuses,
that what they are alluding to as the unconscious is psychic, but non metacognitive. Jung goes
beyond. Jung adds even more stuff to make the definition even more specific. He says it has
to be connected in a web of associative meanings. So you have to place it into a context for it
to be conscious. But the general idea is that they are not saying that the unconscious is non
phenomenal. They are just adding higher level mental functions to what is psychic, which is
phenomenal, I think, to differentiate what consciousness means. And even dissociation,
I think, could be appealed to you to account for the quote unconscious in the sense that our ego
is largely dissociated from the totality of our being. I mean, most of us, we identify with
our adaptive selves, not with our natural selves. That natural self we were when we were five years
out. And by the time we are seven, it begins to slip away. By the time you go to college, it's gone.
And then it's a struggle later in life to sort of reconnect with your natural self.
So I think that speaks volumes. I mean, there's a lot of clinical evidence about this. And I think
that speaks volumes to the idea that not only are we not metacognitive of the vast majority of our
phenomenal contents, our experiences, but even the part of us that we identify with,
that subset of phenomenal consciousness that we identify with, seems to be in the context of
our culture, very, very largely dissociated, whatever dissociation conceptually is, seems
to be very largely dissociated from the totality of what we are.
That's a good answer. But I guess the reply, and I don't know how much more we can go on this,
it's true, because this is, well, maybe going in this direction is also very, on its own,
an interesting thing. So, you know, Searle made this a similar argument, and then he argued that
the unconscious ultimately has to be accessible to consciousness. And he did that in terms of,
you know, anything that's cognitive is representational, representations are aspectual, aspectual
is dependent on a point of view. And Ergo, he said he was willing to count on something like a
union, he said Freudian, but that doesn't matter. I think for the point he's making,
unconscious, and he would therefore say, yeah, that even the so-called unconscious processes,
insofar as they become genuinely cognitive processes, have to at least be accessible to
phenomenal consciousness. That's his argument. Now, the debate that swirled around that was,
he seemed to be denying what people have sort of called the Chomsky and unconscious,
which is an unconscious that is never accessible to us. For example, the processing that's
happening right now for you, whereby the sounds coming out of my face hole are becoming ideas in
your mind. You have no introspective, and there's nothing, I can put you through psychoanalysis
for 30 years, and you'll never access that. And so, I mean, it seems plausible to conclude that
that's, you know, the cognitive unconscious doesn't need to have access to phenomenal
experience in order to operate and process. And that's sort of the general view within
a lot of cognitive psychology, that we, in fact, most of our explanations of human behavior
require that Chomsky and unconscious. Why can you only hold for chunks and working memory?
You don't have any introspective access to that limitation. It's functional. You deeply depend
on it, but you can't bring that into, you can't stand back and go, oh, that, now I'm experiencing
why working memory is constrained. And so, I guess, since we're in here, what do you think of the
proposal of, you'll allow me to call it as, we'll call it what Jung and Freud did just for purposes
of distinction, the psychodynamic unconscious, and what I'm talking about as the cognitive
unconscious. And what I was proposing, the connection was that I think a lot of dreaming,
I'm not denying there isn't a psychodynamic unconscious for dreams. That would be ridiculous.
So I'm not claiming that at all. What I'm claiming, though, is that there's also the cognitive
unconscious for dreams. And that seems to be something that's operating without ever needing
to have access to phenomenal, phenomenal experience. Yeah, I think, look, I think
what we call consciousness, which is better called metaconsciousness, and this is metacognitive
awareness, which entails not only representation, but internal re-representation of mental content,
mental contents. It's, evolutionarily speaking, a recent acquisition, right? It came hand in hand
with symbolic thinking and language. So we are talking, what, 30, 50,000 years? I mean, to say
that it's the blink of an eye in the three and a half billion years of the existence of life on
this planet is a major exaggeration. It's much less than the blink of an eye. It popped up yesterday.
Now, why should it be comprehensive enough to encompass everything about the psyche?
Why would evolution favor that? Evolution will favor re-representation of things that would
give us a survival advantage to ponder about. But processes that need to have very quick
reaction time or which never need to be re-represented in order to be effective, why would
we develop the ability to re-represent those? Why should the scope of metaconsciousness be all
encompassing? There's no reason for that. For Freud, I think the idea of a cognitive unconscious
is much more palatable because for Freud, the unconscious, what is made of former contents
of consciousness? So it is consciousness that is the mother of the unconscious. The unconscious is
just repressed, forgotten, former contents of consciousness. So it's much more friendly to
this idea that for something to be psychic, it has to be at least in principle cognitively
accessible. But for Jung, it's totally different because for Jung, consciousness is a growth out
of the unconscious. The unconscious is creative. It's the matrix of being. And I would think that
Jung's position is more consistent with what we now know about the phylogenetics of the human psyche,
how we came from an anatomically human creature 200,000 years ago devoid of the ability to think
symbolically, which of course preempts metacognition because what is a re-representation but an
internal symbol? And then only 30 or 50,000 years ago, we've developed this ability to explicitly
introspect into the contents of our psyche. I think that's more in line with the Jungian hypothesis
that the unconscious is the matrix. And if that's the case, then I would say we have absolutely no
reason to demand from evolution an all-encompassing consciousness in the sense that the depth
psychologists defined it. In other words, metaconsciousness. Why should metaconsciousness be
all-encompassing? There seems to be no evolutionary advantage for that. On the contrary, even a
disadvantage because pondering entails delay and some reactions need to be immediate and quick.
So I appreciate that answer. I wasn't trying to give an ontological priority or a causal history.
I was trying to say that our own consciousness in the argument about consciousness has an
epistemological priority. And it seems to me that you're saying that our metacognitive,
our introspective aspect of consciousness is actually fundamentally ontologically inaccurate.
It doesn't grasp it as it truly is. And then my problem is it's sort of a Kantian argument.
Then the consciousness you're talking about is kind of a thing in itself for which I don't have
any experiential evidence. And again, it seems to me that then epistemologically we're back to a
symmetrical argument again. I think you could say that whatever is metaconscious is perforce,
phenomenally conscious. In other words, it entails qualities, it entails experience,
some experiencing of some form. So the jump from what is metacognitively conscious to what is only
phenomenally conscious, but not metacognitively so, is an extrapolation in degree but not in kind.
Because it is still phenomenal, it's still phenomenal conscious of the same kind
that you can become explicitly aware of when you introspect. And in addition to that,
there are things that I mean, most people I think who pay attention to introspection have had that
experience, you may become only later in life explicitly or metacognitively aware of something
that retroactively you know you were experiencing all along, you just didn't know that you were
experiencing those. So I don't deny that, I don't deny that we can retrospectively have metacognitive
access. But it seems to me that the way, I mean the phenomenality, the phenomenality of my consciousness
is of I hear now localized consciousness. The idea that is consciousness at large is not
phenomenologically accessible to me. And so I was trying to point out that my only instance,
my only, sorry I want to say this very correct, not my only theoretical, my only phenomenal
instance of consciousness is my own. I agree with you that that doesn't license
solipsism. But that seems to indicate to me that you are like positing a kind of consciousness
for which I have no phenomenological evidence. And that's why in the discussion I wanted to say,
well, I don't have phenomenological introspective evidence for it, right, which then you're nodding,
so thank you. And so I need some independent argument from it at large that doesn't just
presuppose consciousness at large in order to make that move. But you always need to extrapolate
somehow unless you're a solipsist. Then you say all that exists is my personal experience and
everything else is a story I'm making up. So you always need to extrapolate. We agree on that,
we agree on that. So take that as a given. Like I said, I'm at that level, I'm a neoplatonist.
And the intelligibility of the, at least whatever, we both call it the external world,
we have different reference for it. But I take that for granted. And I take that as something
that I take, I'm a realist about reason in that sense.
Can you not get to mind at large via experience from psychedelics or a deep meditative state,
Bernardo? If I follow John's argument line, you could say, well, in a sense, yes, but then
that already becomes your personal experience. So to say that that's not your personal experience
becomes a theoretical move based on what you identify yourself with, what you believe is
information you could have access to as a person. So you can make that inference,
but it's immediately a theoretical inference, which doesn't mean that it's invalid.
But in John's argument line, he can maintain his argument despite this, because he can say, well,
yes, you can make that inference, but that inference is still based on your personal
experience, your personal experience of something impersonal or transpersonal.
However, in response to your current directive back to you, Bernardo, when we did discuss
these experiences, and I've had them, like of the pre-consciousness event or
profound experiences of non-dual oneness, they gave me, and if I remember correctly,
and I may be remembering it correctly, because memory isn't reconstructive,
one of the things I was just alluding to a few minutes ago when I don't know how or why that
happens. That means phenomenologically. But it gave me something that at least,
sort of in a Kantian sense, I could give what Kant would call an intuition. There was some
empirical experience that I could use to give content to the proposal you were making of
cosmic mind. So although I agree with you, and thank you for defending me, that was gracious on
your part, that it doesn't get, I think, beyond the symmetry issue, I do think that your acknowledgement
about that that might be a better place to look for making the extrapolation,
I found that personally helpful. I found that helpful in the discussion, because I got a better
sense of, ah, and that brings me back to the point where now maybe we can move, this is how
we're apart, and I really do want to try and close the gap. I don't think we'll close it all the way,
but because when I'm in that state, I get a sense of what perhaps Whitehead is meeting
by prehension, because there aren't objects, there's this oneness where everything is
prehending everything else. Do you mind defining prehension for the audience?
Yeah, so for Whitehead, he's trying to get a word other than experience or feeling,
which he's also willing to use, and that would be, I know you're not a panpsychist, Bernardo,
but like I said, I'm certainly trying to do bridge building here, and I did talk about that with Matt.
So he came up with the term because we wanted to get away from the terms
experience and feeling, because they were laden with our egocentric sense of these terms,
and that would make him guilty of kind of a lazy anthropomorphism, for example,
and he was very worried about that, I think legitimately so. And to be fair to him,
the people, you've got Heisenberg and other people talking about these connections that seem to be
going on between consciousness and the emergence of quantum particles and things like that,
and I don't want to get into all the rule around that, I'm just trying to give a bit of background
for explanation, and I know Bernardo does not rely on that rule, and so I'm not accusing anybody of
anything here, I'm just trying to, but so Jung was very interested in, and then not Jung,
Whitehead was very interested, and he was trying to get at, okay, again,
if we take the root of ancient epistemology rather than Cartesian epistemology, Gerson does a good
job of it, right? The Cartesian project, which I think is prototypical for modernity's understanding
of epistemology, is you start from first person experience, and you try to build the world out
from that, and that has become extremely problematic. Ancient epistemology says no,
assume that knowledge is real, and then what kind of ontology must there be in order for there to
be knowledge, and it works outward in rather than inward out, and I think Gerson makes a good case
where we should go back and really look at that as a serious alternative because of the deep
blinds epistemology is now in. I think all the attempts to build foundations have basically
crumbled. Okay, all of that said, Whitehead said, I'm going to presuppose that there's
intelligibility, and there's causation, and he's very well aware of the humane problem about causation,
and then he's very well aware of Kant, and he's trying to get beyond both of those.
So what he's saying is what we need to understand is how the past is real in the present,
right? So instead of thinking of the events as billiard balls that are isolated from each other
and somehow have some specious present content, what we have to see is how the past is realized,
and I'm using that in both senses in the present. So his idea is, and if you think about it, let me
do a little bit of a thought experiment to help make this plausible. I'm just arguing for its
plausibility right now, right? So if I asked you what caused the sinking of the Titanic,
notice that your answer is dependent on the event you want to explain, like, well, it hit an iceberg.
But why did it sink in the North Atlantic? Oh, well, because they were competing with the Americans.
Why did it sink on April whatever? Well, because the iceberg broke off then.
Why is there ice there? Well, here's the previous period of glacial, and eventually what you get
is the entire previous history of the universe, which is the actual, and this is sort of a
Hegelian point, which is the actual explanation of any event. And then Whitehead said, well,
all of these events are somehow prehending each other insofar as they come into this event.
So things have things are prehending each other insofar as the past comes into the present,
and also insofar as the present affords the future. And so if you can sort of think,
you can think of all of the universe coming into this event, but also that event over there.
And then all of these events are also being drawn together, all these new emergent events
are being drawn together into the new events that are happening. And so things have this
prehensive relationship to each other. They are realizing, and I'm really playing on that word,
they are realizing and being realized in each other. And then Whitehead said,
and this is also why he used the word prehension, because it's at the root of our word apprehension,
comprehension, a fundamental sort of intelligibility process. And his idea is that realization
within things, very similar to Platinus's idea that everything is contemplating,
but it's not like how we contemplate, right? It's of the same kind as the cognitive
realizations that we're having when we are comprehending or apprehending things.
And so there's a deep continuity between the way reality is realizing itself and the way we
come to moments of realization of reality. Did that work at all? Or was that really confusing?
Ian McGiogherst is making this point now recently. It's his latest. It's here to me.
And so, I mean, I had a conversation with Jonathan Pageot, who should definitely appear
on this channel, by the way, Kurt. And I'm happy to come on and have a discussion with him at some
point. There is a conversation between me and Jonathan. No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I meant. I mean, one of these. And because I was, I was in
debate, again, this kind of debate, sorry, Bernardo, I'm talking quite a bit. It's okay. Go ahead.
It's very enjoyable. And none, none. So I was having like, like one of these, a fellowship
debate, the logos with him about this. And he said to me, he said, well, John, don't you think
there's something like relevance realization going on in reality at large? He was proposing,
of course, the Platonic idea of the logos. He's a Christian politeness, because he's,
he's an Orthodox in the sense of Eastern Orthodox Christian. And I thought, and I said,
what do you mean? And he said, well, and we sort of had to tease it out, because it was,
it was sort of an unclear idea. But, but we worked it out together. And he was,
and then I realized he was proposing something like Whitehead, you know, here's all the
possibilities that are metaphysically available. And then there's something that constrains them,
the possibility probabilities that constrains them to write to actual events. And he said,
and then that affords and makes possible, and it rules out certain things. And he says,
isn't there something analogous? And then I thought, hmm, that's a very interesting proposal
that there's something analogous to intelligence going on in the universe. And there's something
analogous to how relevance realization works. And that would help to metaphysically ground
the intelligibility of the universe, because there would be, you know, a participatory conformity,
a shared kind of identity between the way reality is realizing itself and the way
cognition realizes itself. And then for me, that came together in Nishitani's proposal,
that religion is the real self-realization of reality. That's when you get to these states
of pure consciousness enlightenment, there's no deep difference between the realizing,
the relevance realization going on here. And if you'll allow me, the intelligibility
realization going on out there. And that actually, because I think without genuine
participation, and I think this is where Bernardo and I perhaps agree,
you don't have a real response to absolute skepticism. There has to be some way in which
the mind and the world are fundamentally the same in order for knowledge to be possible
between them. And so I know this isn't your position, Bernardo, but I hope you could see
how, you know, in the last two weeks of reflection, I feel like it's closer to your position at least.
It's probably closer than you think. I mean, I wouldn't go as far as to give complete ontological
power to cognition or to the epistemic side of things. But there are many lines of evidence
indicating that how the world is cognized plays an enormous role in what the world can be said to be.
Yeah. There is a physicist from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, I quote him
a lot recently, Marcus Miller. And he tries to develop a physics of first person perspective.
So his idea is that what we call the objective outside world is constructed by an inferential
process that we make, we ask ourselves questions like, what does the world need to be in order
for me to account for this observation? And he claims that if we construct our world inferentially
like that, then statistically, you can prove that your world will be consistent with mine and
with everybody else's, even though it's not an objective world, it's constructed by our own
inferences, it emerges from a first person perspective. We also have evidence now, well,
there's mathematics sort of showing that. What is his name? It's a British neuroscientist,
forgot his name. But he shows that unless perception would be largely inferential,
in other words, instead of mirroring the states of the world as it is in itself,
we sort of construct it by inference. Unless that is the case, we couldn't maintain our structural
and dynamic integrity. Carl Friston. Right, predictive processing. There's a lot of work
going on right now, and if people are interested, there's a video I recently had with Brett Anderson
about the need to integrate predictive processing and relevance realization models together.
I won't go into the argument detail, but the main argument is, and Friston, by the way,
has moved and said, when he's using the word inference, he's using it like not necessarily
representationally, he's embodied inactive senses of that. So I'm not pinning him to
any kind of propositional tyranny. He has explicitly moved away from that, as has Andy Clark.
So when we say inference, they always do this now, which is fine. I'm happy with that. I want to
make clear that they're not falling into some sort of simplistic Cartesian
thing. But the idea is you need something what's called precision weighting within predictive
processing. It's basically the attentional function. And the main argument is what you can see is
the relevance realization machinery work and the precision weighting that's at the core
of predictive processing actually integrate really, really nicely together. And so, yeah,
I do think, you know, Friston's idea that the brain is predicting itself
proximately. And as it gets really good at predicting itself proximately,
it distally ends up predicting the world quite well. And like I said, I'm a realist about this
because I think, and again, the evidence that most of our perception is accurate prediction
rather than accurate detection. I don't like when people say it's a hallucination because
hallucinations are by definition not true. What we have is accurate prediction. So it looks like
I'm seeing the whole wall over there is white. Actually, I'm subtending a few pieces, sampling,
and I'm doing really, really good theorizing, again, in scare quotes, that's giving me
accurate prediction. And so I take it. So again, for me, but I take it that there's something
about the way the world is such that that works, right? And that there's an intelligibility.
So like, for example, what epistemologies are am I rejecting just to be clear by contrast,
I'm rejecting a very romantic epistemology that says the blank, the world out there is a blank
cabinets on which I project. And I, and the construction is arbitrary and subjective on
my part. And I'm also rejecting the empiricist position. No, no, I'm just a blank slate that
receives the truth from the world. I think both of those are deeply undermined. And so
I agree with you, both accounts. Yes. And so I that's why I've tried to coin this idea of
transjectivity, the idea that the world's intelligibility and my relevance realization
machinery together are co-creating the knowledge. You have to talk to you on McGurghurst.
I have, I talked to him once, we had a beautiful conversation. We do want to talk again. It's
just a matter of us. And what we agreed is he I would wait until his book on wisdom was done,
which it now is. So I'm going to I think he finished. He finished his weekend.
Well, you're supposed to finish mid May. So I'm going to reach out to him and yeah,
we'll have another discussion with him. It was a wonderful discussion. So for me, and I don't
know if we want to segue now, I don't want to fully the conversation. But for me, that and
Bernardo's right. I mean, sort of the deepest ontology for me doesn't have to be resolved one
way or the other. Although I am, like I said, I'm trying to show that I take his work seriously,
and I'm trying to respond by moving my position. And because I think we should be the Socratic
ideal, as we should be responsible to well presented arguments. So I'm not denying that, but
but this notion of trans activity and the co determination co creation between intelligibility,
this which I call a participatory knowing, for me, that's the ultimate grounding relationship
for meaning in life. And I think one of the reasons why I kept hesitating around the Cartesian
proposal is I think are and Bernardo, I think said something very constant with it, our reduction
of our sense of who we are as cognitive agents to proposers of propositions has disconnected us
from procedural, respectable, and ultimately this participatory kind of knowing that grounds,
and grounds in depth, our capacity for being connected to ourselves to each other in the
world. And that, for me, is the most significant contributor of the meaning crisis, not independent
of all the historical reasons. But I think the historical reasons ultimately bite into us
existentially at that deep kind of forgetting we are having. Now, we're not forgetting it
functionally. And this is where Bernardo's distinction between, you know, it being realized
and it being met a cognitively appreciated comes to the fore. Although we've lost our
met a cognitive access to all these kinds of knowing, they're of course still operating in
us, or else though I wouldn't see this floor as walkable. I'm not doing that, right? It's the
world that this is Gibson's idea that the affordance emerges in the co shaping of the world and me
together, etc. But that met a cognitive loss, which I think translates into a spiritual loss,
I would grant with what I would say grounds out in an ontological issue.
Namely the issue of, you know, what is it about the meaning making that that what makes that
possible? What affords that? And so what I'll say two sentences, hopefully or three, and then I'll
turn it back over to Bernardo. Insof, I mean, I try and it's sincere. I'm trying to move and get
closer because I think that at least the movement that I'm capable of making right now, maybe I'm
still resistant, but I'm trying to be responsible, right, helps to strengthen this account, this
ancient epistemological account of the deep participation between intelligence and intelligibility
that makes meaning in life possible for us. And that shouldn't be understood as the content,
the semantic content of our propositions. And I think, even though he may go deeper than I do,
we at least converge below that propositional level of meaning making. At least it seems to me.
If the goal was for us to get closer to each other, I think we can high five right now.
We've met at a place where I'm entirely comfortable to be with you. I'm more and more
open to this idea of co-creation, although I'll be honest with you, I started out
as a objective idealist. The world is really out there. It is whatever it is. And it happens to
be mental, and it presents itself to my dashboard of perceptual instruments as what I call the
physical world. But more and more as I keep studying the work of people like Ian, Marcus Miller,
yourself, it's becoming clear to me that I think even at an ontological level, this participatory
co-creation is deeper than just at the story level. It's not just a nice story. There is ontological
teeth to this. And for me, what is important is that if we have empirical and rational reasons
to contemplate a theory of reality seriously that does give this participatory co-creation
ontological teeth, then we should leverage that, because otherwise it becomes just psychology
and not real. And I think that's where the search for meaning can flounder, because people like me
who are always critically questioning everything. If this story reinvests my life with meaning,
and it intuitively resonates profoundly with me, but I don't have a coherent, explicit,
and well-constructed conceptual theory of reality that gives it plausible ontological teeth,
then I run away from it, driven by this need to not deceive myself, which for me is instinctual.
I agree. And so I think it's fair and honest to say that I'm trying to do that.
And part of that process is, I have explicitly argued that I think in fact it should be,
is a dialogical process. I'm aware of my side bias and confirmation bias and things like that.
And I'm also aware that the Neoplatonic tradition talked about both the dialectic within the
individual and between individuals, and then between individuals in reality. And coordinating
those three dialectics is something that I think is going to be needed for doing this. So
I appreciate what you said. I had understood that, and how do I want to put this?
I didn't do enough, I'll be more self-critical, I didn't do enough about trying to bring together
what you might call the cognitive scientific machinery and what I'll call for my sake,
the Neoplatonic ontology. I talked about it, but I did not foreground that in Awakening for the
Meaning Crisis. I've been trying to do that more recently in conversations like with you,
like with Matt, like with Sam Adams, and like with Jonathan Peugeot. So that is very much,
and this is not to, I mean, I think I'm pursuing them reliably and rigorously. I'm not claiming to
be anywhere near finished, that would just be ridiculous and hubristic. So I take your point
seriously is what I'm trying to say, and I see myself as trying to address that lacuna in previous
work, which is one of the reasons why I want to be here and do this, what's happening right now.
I don't like versions of idealism, and I've made it clear that I'm not putting this on you,
Bernardo. I don't like versions of idealism that afford spiritual bypassing, that afford not taking
seriously science. One of the things that continually impressed me is both your knowledge of and your
respect for empirical and theoretical science. You should know, maybe you move in different
circles than I do. That's not the norm for the people that I interact with when I'm largely up
against people who propose cosmic consciousness and things like that. And so to the degree to which
that's being used to do spiritual bypassing, I will remain opposed to it, because like you,
I think if we make it purely a psychological project, we're ultimately still being romantics.
We're ultimately still saying, I'm making, and I'm, even the favorite word of the romantics,
I'm expressing it. I'm expressing it onto the world, right? And so I'm deeply critical of that.
So I do think, and I think we agreed on this last time, but just to bring it foregrounded again,
I do think that there's an inescapable ontological dimension and a needed reconstruction of our
ontology in order to finally address the meeting crisis. Now, the one concern I have,
and this is not a philosophical concern between you and I, is the issue of how do we do that
without making it a requirement that everybody who wants to respond to the meeting crisis
engage in the education that's required to undertake this kind of ontological discussion.
So you understand what I'm trying to say? It definitely has epistemological
priority, but that we don't want to hijack the existential project by giving it existential
priority. Exactly. That's the key question. Yeah. What would be useful would be to get your
views on mind uploading, because I think this will further the distinction between you both.
So, Bernardo, what are your thoughts on mind uploading? Is it possible? Is it ridiculous?
So, could you be more specific, Kurt, because there's different, I mean, mind uploading is
we're being uploaded into some universal simulation. That's very different from,
I could upload my mind into some computational device. They carry all kinds of different ontological
commitments. So, that's the second one where the Ray Kurzweilian one.
You want to ask me what I think about it? Bernardo.
Complete another nonsense. I agree. I agree. I agree. Not deserving of academic credibility.
Yeah, I agree. Totally. Because it's a category confusion.
We are basically pre-assuming that a description of our minds is our minds, because what you
upload is a description. What you upload is a copy of states, at least relative to one another,
not even absolutely, because the substrate is different. One is an organic substrate,
the other one is a silicon substrate. But even if you ignore this glaring, absolutely significant
difference, and you fall into the sea of abstraction that today is plaguing academia,
to the point that we have achieved lift off from the terra firma of reality, and we now engage
in endless pure abstraction, even if I concede, which I don't, but even if I were to concede
that the substrate has no significance, which of course it has, but even then,
to upload a copy of the states from one substrate to another doesn't necessarily mean that you've
transferred the thing in itself, which is described. Are we used this metaphor again? I use it all the
time, but I don't want to overuse it, but it brings it to life. I can simulate kidney function on my
computer accurately, down to the molecular detail, but that doesn't mean my computer will pee on my
desk. So mind uploading is something that you could see the same way. You can upload a very
accurate description of the states of my mind, the dynamisms of my mind, into a silicon substrate
and replicate those dynamisms in that other substrate with complete accuracy. That doesn't
mean that my mind has moved to that silicon substrate, or that the silicon substrate has a
conscious copy of me to assume that it is, entails so many assumptions about the nature of mind,
the nature of metabolism, the nature of silicon, the nature of information. I mean, it's a hidden
pile of arbitrary unjustified assumptions that one needs to overlook to take this idea even
seriously to begin with. So I think this is just an expression of the profound confusion that faces
our culture today and which affects the most intelligent, intelligence defined in a very
restricted, old-fashioned way. But it unfairly affects the most intelligent segments of our culture
more than people who are, quote, less intelligent between air quotes, but are much more grounded
in reality. Look, I am by original education, a computer engineer. I emphasize the engineering
over computer science, which I could also say I was, but engineering is grounded in the sense that
whatever theories are, engineering is about what works. That's how I started. And we had,
at least the people I was involved with, we had physical intuition about what computation is.
But today, I see computer scientists out there, some of which you have interviewed, I found out
a couple of days ago, who are waving a PhD around and get a lot of airtime. But these guys
don't have anything more than a fake conceptual intuition about what real computing is. They
operate on 20 levels of abstraction, pre-assuming the existence of all kinds of tools, all kinds of
APIs, all kinds of things. And they live in that world of pure abstraction, so disconnected from
reality that some of them will tell you, well, I built a conscious machine the other day. Oh,
really? Okay. So what do you think of Yosha Bach's idea of consciousness as a simulated property
of computation? It's totally nonsensical, spouted out by somebody who has no clue what he's talking
about. Okay, do you mind telling the audience, because what I said was one sentence description,
do you mind giving them a better sense as to what Yosha's point of view is, and then telling us why
you think it's nonsense? And then, John, I imagine you agree, but I imagine you agree, perhaps for
different reasons, so that at that point, I'd like you to come in. Yeah, I agree for those reasons
and convergent reasons, but I'll be quiet. So, Bernardo, explain Yosha Bach's point of view.
Well, I'm not a specialist on his particular point of view. I recall that I have had an
interaction with him, but many years ago, he came to my website, and ultimately, I think I had to
block him, because he was, he was, how do you call it, trolling me online at some point.
The beginning of our exchanges were objective, were based on argument, but it got to a point where
he just sort of went down the deep end. I don't know what motivated that change. I'm not a specialist
in his particular content. I have seen snapshots here and there. So I rather speak more generally
of this notion that consciousness is a simulation. This is one instance of a trick
that is very tempting to apply in our culture. It's a trick against your, your, your own self,
which is to explain what is fundamentally not explainable in terms of the assumptions we make
by redefining that which we want to explain. You see, for instance, we have no idea what
consciousness is, right? There is a hard problem of consciousness. So if we make
reductionist, physicalist assumptions, and I'm using the word reductionist here to differentiate
that from, from John's position, if we start from reductionist, physicalist assumptions,
you have an impossible problem to deduce the qualities of experience from physical parameters
alone. That's called the hard problem of consciousness. So consciousness becomes unexplainable.
So what's the move that a lot of people do? They define consciousness as opposed to explaining it.
So some people will say, well, I solved the hard problem. Consciousness is the electromagnetic
field dynamics surrounding your neocortex. That's not an explanation. That's a redefinition.
I can do the same thing. I can say consciousness is the involuntary wiggling of my left big dough.
Hard problem solved. I have a friend who calls it the Pinocchio theories of consciousness,
explanations by redefinition. And it's not entirely arbitrary because they're usually
leveraging some empirical correlations. Like there is a correlation between electromagnetic
field dynamics surrounding the neocortex and reported experience. Or there is a correlation
between electrochemical neuronal firings and reported experience. So it leverages those
correlations loosely and then explains by redefining the term. Now we only get away with this
with the one profound mystery that seems inaccessible to our reductionist physicalist assumptions,
which is consciousness. For everything else, it would be immediately perceived as a clown
if you tried to do something like that to explain anything else. But our intuitions of plausibility
fail when it comes to consciousness. We sort of become gullible, collectively gullible,
to all kinds of nonsense because it's such a mysterious thing that you sort of give yourself
freedom to entertain stupidity validated by the notion that you needed to entertain something far
out in order to sort of squeeze this into the parameters of reductionist physicalism. There
is no other way. Therefore, it becomes plausible by construction. But that plausibility is an artifact
of the assumptions you make. It has nothing to do with reason and empirical evidence. So to say
consciousness is just a simulation is as arbitrary as to say consciousness is the wiggling of my left
big toe. Are you explaining anything by saying this? No, you're explaining nothing. You're just
engaging into an orgy of conceptual fantasies and losing ground with the concreteness of the world
with the concreteness of our own being as organic beings, metabolizing beings. I find this approach
to things no better than fantastical fantasizing, just as stupid as fantastic fantasizing.
John, your thoughts. Well, first of all, that was beautiful. And I enjoyed being present to that.
I also object to explaining woo with goo, which a lot of these things are,
you know, like, you know, this is weird, and this is weird. Oh, therefore, therefore. Yeah,
exactly. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I agree with a lot of what Bernardo said. I think it's a ridiculous
proposal. And I think the fact that we're taking it seriously, he flies in the face of good theoretical
argument, like Bernardo just said, and even our accumulating empirical evidence. I'll talk a bit
about the second first, but I put it because I want to give more emphasis to the theoretical
points. I mean, what was giving this some initial plausibility was computer human interface.
And initially, what's surprising is two things. So for example,
this isn't notice how this doesn't get as much press as the other. So, you know, we're getting
machines that can look, you know, do significant EEG and tell what you're thinking. Tell if you're
thinking of Apple or Pear, never anything abstract, by the way. Well, it turns out that now we've
realized that all of those experiments were bullshit. They all suffer from failure of replication
if you control for confounds within the data. So all goes away, right? So it's initially wait,
right? Maybe, you know, finding one to one neural correlates between our shared concepts,
and what's happening in our brains is, you know, not maybe that's something we should challenge.
Michael Anderson, for example, in his book, After Phrenology, has said, we should be giving up the
idea of like strictly localized functions, etc., in the brain. So even that kind of reading idea
that I can somehow do that, it's so I'm not saying it's been falsified. I'm saying the
stuff that gave it empirical plausibility has vanished. And so the historical inability to
find the neural correlate of consciousness, right, which everybody sort of grudgingly agrees to right
now, points out that this is actually a really, really hard problem, just at an empirical level.
So the claims that like the idea that, wow, given our current empirical success, I can plot this
graph, and in 2040, that's bullshit. That is just not paying attention. We are not having that kind
of empirical success. Now, that's not the more important argument, but I wanted to make that
argument, because that argument undermines the graphs that seem to lend the air of predictability
and science to this. Okay, there's no empirical extrapolation going on, because there's nothing
right now to be experimentally extrapolated from. Okay, now notice what I'm going to say one more
time. That wasn't an empirical, you know, falsification, but it means don't take that seriously,
because it's not extrapolation. Okay, now the theoretical point, I agree with everything Bernardo
said, and let me try and say something that I think is convergent. So first of all, the work
of my colleague Brian Cantwell-Smith at the University of Toronto in the philosophy of
computation shows that the model of computation that's being presupposed by these people
is very inadequate. What is that model, by the way? And so that model, as far as I can tell,
when I look at it, is the proposal, which was taken very seriously in first wave cognitive
science, I'm very familiar with it, that cognition is a formal system that we could capture that
the mind is very much like the game of chess. What do I mean by that? Well, chess is a formal
system in that it doesn't depend on the matter that it's made out of. I can play chess with pieces
of wood, I can play chess with pieces of stone, I can play chess with helicopters with flags on them,
a building top, right? And what's really interesting is I can start playing chess in wood,
move to metal, move to stone, move to helicopter, and it's all the same game. And so, and I can do
the same thing with computer files, see how I can move them around, because they're purely
formal systems. The problem you face with formal systems is there are knockdown arguments that
they cannot, they render qualitative experience causally inert. They have to. And also that they
cannot cap formal systems are formal systems precisely because they are completely internally
defined. And therefore they cannot grasp the meaning relation, the problem of how to get the
computer to find its processing meaningful to the computer cannot be answered within formal
systems. Formal systems can't explain development. If your formal system, if your cognition is
ultimately a formal system, it is bound by a logic, a system of axioms and functions. You know what
you can't do? You can't compute to compute within a formal system and get to a stronger
formal system. You can't, you can't work within predicate logic. And if I just manipulate it
fast enough, I'll get modal logic. That can't happen. But human beings go through qualitative
development. I am capable of cognition now that I would never be capable no much. How much information
you gave me that I was as a five year old. So formal systems can't deal with the inherently
developmental nature of cognition. They can't deal with the inherently non propositional
aspects of cognition, like procedural knowing, perspectival knowing, participatory knowing.
Also, and I think Bernardo made this point, I want to reinforce it. I argue, and this is a,
it's not consensus, but it is a prominent and increasing position within 4e cognitive science
that cognition is deeply continuous with the principles of life. So that cognition is like,
not like chess, it's more like football. The actual causal properties of the thing doing it
are relevant to its functionality. So there is no cognition without life, biologic,
auto poetic life. And so I think everything I've said is consistent with what Bernardo said,
but I think of all of these arguments converging with the ones he said. And so that is not
common sense plausibility. That's normative plausibility. There's a lot of convergence
of independent lines of argument and evidence. There's a paucity of empirical evidence for it.
So the position is radically implausible to my mind. I think that that's very close to what
Bernardo was saying when he thinks it's bullshit. And I think that we're pinning our hopes on some
kind of silicon rapture into simulated heaven. I think is a ridiculous response to the meaning
crisis. And just the idea, like what is the ontology of a simulation? You're ultimately
relying on the idea that somehow it's an illusion. What is having the illusion of consciousness?
Where's the ontological basis of that? Okay, Bernardo, what are your responses to this? And
please do so with the same intensity yelling at the camera.
It was beautiful to sit here and watch John do this. I wish it had gone on a little longer.
I was not ready to have it finish yet. John's looking clean. I don't know if that's the same
person that he said clean in all caps. John's looking clean. I don't know if that's the same
person that said John is sexy from before. I'm clean shaven now. I had a beard last time.
Maybe that's what they were right there. Okay. All right, Bernardo.
Look, I think this ties back to my favorite part of John's message, which is, who are we looking
up to for wisdom? What do we consider wisdom? Is this the arbitrary, implausible fantasizing of
Bach, Joshua Bach? Is that what we call wisdom today? Or is it just a fancy flight from reality,
which we give us license to do because we are facing problems that our assumptions do not
allow us to solve, and which is quickly going towards a religious direction. And John hinted
on it, didn't elaborate on it. I was hoping he would continue on that path. But singularitarianism,
a la Ray Kurzweil, is a distorted expression of the religious impulse in all of us. It's part of
being human that you aspire for a greater power, a power that would be or is in control, a power
that is aligned with yourself in terms of shared values. So you sort of, you exert control by proxy.
You do not have control over nature, but that greater power, which does have control over
nature shares your values. So it's controlled by proxy in the psychology of the situation.
And with a very restricted and poor set of assumptions like reductionist physicalism,
that instinct, that aspiration towards, you know,
luminosity, religious luminosity has to find a way to express itself through the restricted
channels it's given. And what happens then? Well, it's singularitarianism. It's computers
who will be conscious. Not only that, you'll be able to upload your consciousness into computers,
thereby becoming immortal, which is one of the key religious ideas, and you become immortal,
achieving more immortality. And because of the singularity machines, we'll be able to construct
ever more intelligent machines with an exponential growth. And at some point, there will be a machine
that is effectively God, the Almighty, which controls everything, and would keep us
fed, healthy, and entertained, like in a Disneyland type zoo, as inferior animals, having a great life.
And we could look upon this great singularity machine as the Almighty Father. So what you see
there is the religious impulse expressing itself in profoundly distorted ways, which are out to
write a contradictory reason. And in that sense, you might say, well, that's contradictory with
reason as any other religion. Okay, I take that. But it is much more deficient of meaning than
all the other religions, because it aims at satisfying only sort of the base level of religious
aspirations, meaning immortality and the Almighty God. But it fails to address
what is the meaning and purpose of our lives. It gives you sort of a way out of our deepest
anxieties, which is the anxiety of death, and the anxiety of not being in control. Now you can
upload yourself and live forever and exert control by proxy, because this supercomputer will share
your values, since you made it. But it doesn't give us, you know, Viktor Frankl's or John
Vervecky's will to meaning. It doesn't give us a path towards that. It may buy us the sense that we
have then time, infinite time to figure out the question of meaning later. But it doesn't give
us a path towards that, unlike the other religions. All the world's main religions give you some kind
of path to a realization of meaning. So yeah, I think that's what's going on. I think these
movements like singletarianism and consciousness uploading, they are just an expression of the
religious impulse, and as at least as irrational and as devoid of empirical foundations, as devoid
of internal logical coherence, as the better known religious myths going on around.
I thought, oh, I was just going to say, that was beautiful. I don't know if you've heard it,
Bernardo, but it goes back to your point about, you know, the elevation of the nerds. I've heard
Kurzweil described as the rapture of the nerds, from the sort of christian evangelical idea of
the rapture of the saved. So the rapture of the nerds, I don't know if you've heard that. I just
thought I'd throw that out for you. I do want at some point, Kurt, to respond.
I'll just lay down a foreshadowing. I would really like to discuss more, I mean complete agreement,
but I think this is symptomatic. It's not an isolated thing. I think we see throughout our
culture many attempts to create Erzach's religions, to try and give expression to this impulse,
which tells me two things. As a psychologist, it tells me we should be paying attention to
this impulse. If it can't be repressed, it ultimately comes out in frustrated forms.
And besides, you know, the the scientific, you know, fantasies, we of course have pseudo-religious
political ideologies that are doing similar things. So what is that impulse and why is it there,
I think is a very important question we should ask. Secondly, and in connection with that,
and I'll just lay this down, I want to come back and say more about this. One of the deep differences
is the offloading of the requirement for transformation. So one of the big things that
happens in the Middle Ages with the advent of normalism, and then it gets taken up much later
and extended, and it's part of the loss to the will to meaning, I would say, is the idea, and you
can see, you can see quotes of this, like I could get your quotes just from Descartes saying this,
that we can access the deepest truths without undergoing even the most superficial
of transformations. Before that turning point, there was the idea that deep truths required
substantial, right, that you couldn't separate the knowledge project from the wisdom project,
that deep truths required deep transformation, even in the way people read the Bible, for example,
was fundamentally different. I can talk about that later. I'm not proselytizing for Christianity,
I'm just pointing to that as an example. And so what you see with the rapture of the nerds is,
I don't have to do any transformation. I can get the deep truths just by doing some abstract
theorizing, and then I can then realize the existential change also just in term. And so
I'm just expanding, I think, Bernardo, on what you talked about when you're saying there's no
path. There's no path for transformation. There's no path, right? And I think about how ridiculous
this claim is. We believe, very deeply, for everybody until we're at, like, I believe that
kids have to go through fundamental transformations before they're capable of accessing certain
ontological aspects of reality. And I think most people, if, right, would agree with that. It's
like, no, no, the kid needs to mature more. They need to grow more, right? They need, right?
Before they can, right? So don't explain Heidegger to a 5-year-old, right? For something like that,
right? Okay. So, but we've got this fictional myth that when we're 20, that stops.
Yeah. Exactly. You don't need to go through any more cognitive transformation or development
in order to access deeper ontological commitments. Now, Plato, for my primary example, held exactly
the opposite view, right? As the child is to the adult, the adult is to the sage. Just like you
had to go through a lot of transformation to be able to see through self-deception and self-illusion
to get deeper ontological purchase, you still have to do it now. There is no spiritual bypassing.
You can't just adopt a bunch of beliefs. So the path, I'm trying to really deepen the path.
I'm trying to really say, like, we have got to give up this fiction that we're finished
in terms of our cognitive access to reality when we're 20 or 25 years of age.
This is so cathartic to listen to this. Go on, go on.
What I was going to say, I mean, even if everything else wasn't bullshit,
which I think it is about Kurzweil, at what age do you want to be uploaded?
When you're 20? Man, I don't want to be a 20-year-old forever.
How about 30? I don't want to be a 30. I'm 60 now, so I can talk. Do I even want to be 50
years old forever? Nope. It has become, I don't know, it probably has to do with the
computer revolution of the 70s and the early 80s, that the notion of nerdiness has become
elevated to an ideal. It's like, it's okay, it's good to be a nerd. It counts in your favor,
because we are so focused on propositional knowledge and the nerdish things, factual
and propositional knowledge, and we lost sight that, look, it's not okay to be a nerd. A nerd is,
by definition, somebody who has a profound imbalance in the development of a number of psychic
functions by focusing on only one. It's a jack of one trade.
Bernardo comes from a more continental position, just because of listeners. Psychic doesn't mean
anything to have to do with ESP. We in North America typically say psychological, just so
people aren't misunderstanding him here. I don't want him to make certain people in California
happy by the indication of that term. So go ahead, please, Bernardo. I just thought that was
important to answer. Thank you for that. I don't mean that. I mean psychic in the psychological
sense. We have many psychological functions, emotional functions, feeling functions, intuitive
functions, sense functions, people who really can perceive the world with the richness of the world,
which I can't, for instance, and the ability to think according to axioms and rules of derivation,
which is the nerd way of thinking. That's one psychic function, a sort of human computer,
human calculator, who is able to write code. Look, I know that. It was my life. I used to do that.
But to focus on that at the expense of maturity on all the other aspects of the psyche of the mind,
the human mind is not okay. This should not be elevated by our culture into a sort of go,
a sort of ideal. It's like... You're talking about the veneration of intellect?
Only the modern sense of it, not the ancient sense of intellect, not the ancient sense at all.
Exactly. Exactly. It's a veneration of a particular form of intellect,
which we now think it's okay. I mean, before we knew it was not okay. It was an offense to be
called a nerd. Somehow it has become okay. Where did we take this wrong turn? It's not okay to be
a nerd. It's okay to be a complete, mature, ever-evolving human being, ever-learning human being
who has emotional intelligence, who pays attention to intuition, who has empathy,
who can share in the feelings of other people and therefore can know what other people are
going through in their own minds, who has sensory skills, who is able to taste the
flavor, the subtleties of the flavor of food and wine. How many of us can't do that? Who has
maturity about life, which in the U.S., I think I am with James Hillman on this, Hillman used to
say that the U.S. is in love with innocence, which is precisely this notion that the innocence of
dividing the world into good and bad, black and white, that's a childish way of looking
upon the world, because there is evil in all of us. Things are more subtle and complicated than
just this division between two polarities. But in the U.S., according to Jim Hillman,
this has become an ideal, this cult of innocence, which is a sort of a denial of the process of
maturation. It's unfortunate. So somehow, we are no longer elevating maturity, which goes
hand in hand with wisdom to its rightful place. We now think of old people as
burdensome and old-fashioned people, not in tune with the times, as opposed to mature people who
have a lot to teach and share. We have this cult of innocence that Jim Hillman used to talk about.
We have this idolatry of nerds, which is my way of talking about it.
Sorry to interrupt. I've been thinking about for quite some time, which is the way that we view
the elderly in our culture. I wonder if the quality of a culture is how you view the elderly and in
our culture in the West. We view them as, well, we barely view them, we barely look up to them,
and if we do, it's only as a repository of stories of the past. How is it that we should be viewing
them? Well, look, I think you can make the mistake both ways. If you look at an old person, and by
definition you expect wisdom from that person, yeah, you're going too far because an old person,
old people have the same variability that not old people have. But I think what happened is that
we are no longer developing our sense for subtlety and nuance. We have become incapable
to recognize subtlety and nuance. We want to divide everything into neat
drawers with a clear label, because that's how we compartmentalize things, and that's how we
give ourselves intellectual justification for not thinking things through. We just label it quickly,
put it in a drawer, and you say, this is A, this is B, this is black, this is white,
and that means that all the subtlety and nuance where the core of the message is
flies over our heads. And because we've lost this sense for subtlety and nuance,
we don't recognize the wisdom in old people, because that wisdom expresses itself in subtlety
and nuance, not in clear-cut recipes. And everybody wants an easy right now, a clear-cut recipe.
Just give me the seven steps to happiness. That's what people want. And guess what? The treasure
is just underneath a few layers of subtlety and nuance. You cannot bypass those, but we've lost
our ability to see that. Therefore, we've lost our ability to recognize true wisdom, including
true wisdom in older people. We live in a falsified, in an arbitrarily simplified world,
and we make enormous efforts to confirm to ourselves that that's how the world is,
because it makes life more easier. So I want to follow up on that, because
first of all, the last point that Bernardo made, I want to give it some experimental empirical
teeth, because one of my colleagues at the University of Toronto, Lynn Hasher,
does work on working memory. So one of the things that Hasher made clear is we've gone from sort of
a simplistic working memory, just a holding to working memory as a higher-order relevance filter.
That's why things like chunking work, working memory, anyways, there's just a lot of good
evidence for that. Now, why am I bringing that up? Just give me a sec, because there's very important
correlations between measures of working memory, especially its ability to filter out irrelevant
information and measures of general intelligence. They at times approach a parity, so there's
something deeply connected there. Okay, what does this all have to do with wisdom in old age?
Okay, so when you take old people and young people and you give them standard IQ measures,
young people crush the old people. Why? Because almost all the problems on a standard IQ
test are well-defined problems, like mathematical problems, a pattern
completion where one of the answers is available and you have to choose it. These are all well-defined
problems. So old people, they don't do very well, because the young people get the answers faster.
Well, why? Well, the older people, the negative view is, well, they're more distracted.
And so, you know, let's put the old people away, they're distracted, we can get to the bottom line,
we're younger, we're fast. You are, you're younger, you're fast, and for well-defined problems,
you outperform. But Lynn Hasher did some work and she's even got a thing called older brains,
or wiser brains, it's in the title, right? Who? Now, Lynn Hasher at U of T, University of Toronto.
And so what happens with, you can give people, there's all kinds of ways of establishing this
empirically. What happens with older people, for example, when they're reading a text,
they will keep more of the possible meanings of a term active than young people. So that looks like,
if the point is to get through, the older people are distracted. And if you give them a well-defined
problem, they're over here and the young people are zeroing on the correct answer that's there to
be found. But what if you switched to an ill-defined problem? An ill-defined problem, which we don't
know, we don't know what the important representation of our initial state is,
the goal state, what are the relevant operations? What are the relevant patterns to pay attention to?
Now, when you do that, older brains outcompete younger brains because they keep more options
alive, which makes them better at dealing with the multivariate dynamics of situations like
messy, emotionally-laden interpersonal situations, which are, by the way, prototypical situations
where we look for people's wisdom. So I'm not claiming, Bernardo's right, that there's no
simple correlation, old age wisdom, but we ignore the potential for being more wise
with an old people because we have this seriously algorithmic notion of what intelligence is
that blocks us from seeing this defect as something that actually affords
wise response to ill-defined problems. Now, I think that, and I think that gives a lot of
teeth about what Bernardo's saying about losing nuance, losing nuance. I think, for me, it's, and so
I mean, there's a lot here about propositional tyranny and that, but I think what, I like to put
this within the Framian perspective, that I think we have confused the halving of propositions with
the becoming of wise, the becoming of mature. So Fram famously, he's an existential psychologist,
he divided human motivations up into two broad camps. They're having needs. These are needs
met by having something, having water, having oxygen, having food, and it's very important
that we be able to categorize that, manipulate those objects, secure control over them.
We have what Boober would call an IIT relationship to them, and there's nothing wrong with that.
If you don't have an IIT relationship with water, if you treated water as an important
individual that you shouldn't trespass on for moral reasons, you're going to die, right?
So you need to have that. Then he said there is what he called the being mode. I'm not quite
happy with that term, but what he meant is that there are needs that are met by becoming being,
like I have a need to become mature. So these are developmental needs, and these are needs that
are not met by categorically manipulating things. These are needs that are met by the project,
the Victor Frankel type project, of meaning making, because what I'm doing with becoming
mature is I'm trying to construct an identity that is responsible to the meanings in the world.
Neither one of these is good or bad, but what Fromm argued is we get into modal confusion.
We try to satisfy being needs within the having mode. So then instead of becoming mature,
I buy a car instead of being in love. And notice we even use this word, I have a lot of sex.
And the point is we're not satisfying the developmental needs because again,
my point, we're not going through any significant transformation. We're just acquiring stuff,
and we do this epistemically. We acquire propositions as opposed to going through fundamental
transformations. So we're locked in modal confusion. And so we spin this faster and faster
because it doesn't meet the needs. And what we're told by our culture is because you need
more and you need more more frequently and more often. And so we spin faster and faster and faster
as our being needs astrophy and we fall into addictions around our having needs. And I think
that's not just in the marketplace of mercantile products. I think it's in the epistemic marketplace.
We are doing the same thing. We are confusing the having of propositions
with the transformation that's required to become wise and virtuous.
Okay, you said many interesting points. This is being fantastic.
John, what you just mentioned reminds me of addiction in the reciprocal narrowing.
At one point, I would like you to talk about love, which is the opposite of that reciprocal opening
or some positive feedback effect there. And the reason why is because in many religions,
there's a God is tantamount to love. And in Bernardo's view, many people would see
mind at large as synonymous with God, which means there may be some relationship there
that I'd like you all to explore. Well, I mean, and this goes from one, I have a couple slogans
on my signature and Gmail. And one of them is love is it's a classical slogan from Christian
Neoplatonism. Love is its own kind of knowing. And I'll try and work towards that in an important
sake. So it's not just that God is love, is that love is a kind of knowing. And, you know,
and John in the epistles, you know, says God is agape, right? And he's trying to he's trying
to bring both of those sides together. I think there are similar things in seek, seek, not
seekism, Sufism, because it's basically an integration of agape kind of love with Neoplatonism.
But, but I'm just trying to make clear that I'm not making an exclusivity imperialistic
claim on Christianity's behalf. Neither am I, neither am I dismissing dismissing it.
But I think we should we do well to pay attention to that tradition, because I think of Jesus as
the sage of agape. I think that's a way of trying to understand him. I think there's similar ideas
in the Buddha with Karuna. And you want to talk about Jesus in the Buddha, maybe we can do that
also. Yeah, we will, we will either way go through the explication on love. So the idea this came
to me, right, there was a bunch of pieces, but I had the great good fortune to be friends and
colleagues with Mark Lewis, who's one of the premier neuroscientists, and cognitive scientists
doing work on addiction. And he's doing it, he did it also from the inside, because he was also
himself an addict. And you're always an addict in some sense. So you want to read the autobiography,
you can read memoirs of an addicted brain. And he part of the reason why he went into
neuroscience was to, it was to, to understand addiction. I have a friend of mine who said,
people go into psychology to study their defects. And since mine is relevance realization, again,
that I guess I'm worried about being irrelevant. But the point is that
Are you being facetious? Are you being honest?
Both. My intent was there's there's some truth to it. But hopefully there's also some humor in it.
So what's what's Mark's model? You know, and Mark was, you know, one of the first people to propose
a dynamical system interpretation of emotions. He's a forerunner in a lot of ways. He's also,
you know, he's also a gifted therapist. He's kind of polymath in this important way.
And so I was also, I was at a conference and it was not just him, but a bunch of psychologists
and neuroscientists where it was a, it was, you know, a mini, it was a symposium within the
conference on basically challenging the disease model of addiction. And the disease model of
addiction is the idea that, you know, you ingest the substance, and it's like a disease in you,
and we have to get rid of the disease. And that aligns with a lot of sort of governmental
policies and the way governments like to deal with things. Even though the evidence that prohibition
is a completely failed strategy with dealing with addiction. So what they, and it doesn't
account for the data well. So you have weird phenomena like this, you have Vietnam soldiers
using opiates in Vietnam, opiates, opioid prices, right? And then they come back to the United States
and without any therapy or anything else, the vast majority of them stop using. They're in
highly stressful situations. They're taking opioids to escape trauma. That should, they should,
they're, they're ingesting this substance. It's inherently addictive. They come back and they
don't. That's just one among many facts, empirical facts. It's like the disease model isn't fitting
well. I have this substance, it infects me and it compels me. So instead, Mark proposes a learning
model of addiction. And it goes like, and he calls it reciprocal narrowing. It goes like this. So
I'll use alcohol just because I can presume that most people are familiar with that, that, that
intoxicant. So I face some stressful situations. So I drink some alcohol to reduce the stress.
The problem with that is it reduces my cognitive flexibility, makes me much more susceptible
to impulsivity, hyperbolic discounting. It basically shrinks. And what happens there is my world,
my world, I don't mean physically, but the options available to me in my world shrink.
Now that means that my problems become more exigent and pressing on me, right? And I've lost
the ability to manipulate and get to alternatives. So now I'm more stressed. So I'm going to drink
more alcohol, and I'm going to reduce my cognitive flexibility anymore, even more. And then the world
is going to shrink down. And then I'm going to shrink down. And I use this idea from Clifford
Geertz about an agent-arena relationship. Our agency is always codefined by how we turn the
world into an arena for action. And the arena is always codefined with the type of agency we're
assuming. And so what happens is your agency is shrinking and the world's optionality is
shrinking until the world can't be any other than it is right now. And you can't be any other
than you are right now. And that's when you're addicted. That's addiction. And this fits the data
way, way better. But governments don't like this because the kind of changes you have to bring
aren't changes where you can simply prohibit a substance, right? So what I was having, literally
having lunch with Mark, you know, and I've done a lot of work on Play-Doh and the Play-Doh
Platonic notion of Anagaga. And I said to Mark, I said, but if there's reciprocal narrowing,
isn't there reciprocal opening? And he went like that. He was like, yes, of course, there has to
be. And then I thought about this. And this is clearly what Play-Doh advocates for. You can see
it very clearly in the Republic. You know, I get, I bring about a sort of intracyclic harmony.
And that reduces my impulsivity, my self deception. I see more real patterns in the world. I then
get better at detecting real patterns. I internalize that. And right, I better afford my inner
justice. And then that allows me to connect better. And so I reciprocally open. And Play-Doh,
I think rightly describes that as love. Now he thinks of it as Eros. But Socratic Eros is very
different than our meaning of Eros. I'll put that aside. Let's just say it's love for now. Well,
why might that be the case? Well, if you look at the work of Aaron, that's a last name, not a first
name. How do you get people to sort of fall in love with each other? You get them to do mutually
accelerating disclosure. You get them to be on theologutions. Yeah, sort of. So what it is is,
if I open up a bit about me, and you reciprocate by opening up a bit about me, first of all,
I start to see you better. And you start to see me better. So we're doing Mindsight Resonance.
And that allows me to that not only can I open up more, I can open up better,
because I can open up more, but I have a better sense of how you're seeing things because you've
opened up to me. So I start to open up more and better. And then you reciprocate by opening up
more and better. And we do this, we reciprocally open. And that's what that will make people fall
in love. Now, not necessarily erotic love, it can be phileic love, it can be agopic,
right? But that reciprocal opening, we know it as love. It is a way of knowing by which we
bind ourselves to, right, we bind our being needs to another being, and we reciprocally go
through transformation and open up to each other. And I think we can fall in love. This is, I think,
a platonic claim that we should think about taking seriously again, we can fall in love with reality.
We can fall in love with the world in a profound way. And I think part of the meeting crisis is
getting people so they can fall in love again with reality and with the depths of reality.
And so the reciprocal opening and the love and the anagogy, I think all converge in sort of a
coherent manner. And I think reciprocal opening is also what's happening in therapy. That's people
come in with the propositional knowledge of what needs to change. It does almost shit. So there's
almost nothing for them. What a good therapist does is take them through a process of reciprocal
opening until they get to be a different person living in a different kind of world that is now
viable to them. They want to be that person over there living in that world, but they don't know
how to get there. Because they don't have the religious and wisdom traditions that afford people
the serious play, the developmental play in reciprocal opening that affords that kind of
transformation. So I hope that answered your question. You're watching this channel because
you're interested in theoretical physics, consciousness, and the ostensible connection
between the two. What's required to follow some of these arguments is facility with mathematics,
as well as discernment of the underlying physical laws. And you may think that this is beyond you,
but that's false. Brilliant provides pollucid explanations of abstruse phenomenon such as
quantum computing, general relativity, and even group theory. When you hear that the standard
model is based on u one cross s u two cross s u three. That's group theory, for example. Now,
this isn't just for neophytes either. For example, I have a degree in math and physics, and I still
found some of the intuitions given in these lessons to vastly aid my penetration into these
subjects, for example, electricity and magnetism. Sign up today at brilliant.org slash toe, that is

you comprehend subjects you previously had trouble grokking. Links are in the description. This
notion of reciprocal opening, so that's agape, that's love, is synonymous in many religions,
especially Christianity with God in terms of John mentioned in John's epistle. And your theory has
mind at large, which is similar to God. So is there any link between reciprocal opening and
mind at large? And then we're going to get to religion without a religion, or what do we do
to solve our current meaning crisis? Well, let me start by saying what John just said makes all
kinds of sense to me from a first person experience perspective, this idea of love as
this reciprocal opening as becoming more than you thought you were in that dance of love,
it makes all kinds of sense to me. And I think it's a beautiful way to visualize it and communicate it.
It's a very hard act to follow after that. So I will make a comment, Kurt, on your question,
but restricted to a point I think is important to not meant as a complete answer. I can't follow
what we've just had it. And I'm completely in peace for not being able to follow what we've
just seen. But I'll make a comment that I think is important. Would love be part of mind at large?
Surely love is clearly a part of nature. It's a kind of
a force that binds things together. Maybe the correlate of love on the screen of perception
is gravity. But we also know that the universe's expansion is accelerating. So there is this other
thing we call dark energy right now, which seems to have the opposite effect, to deny
that what we call evil is also part of nature would be naive, I think. And I think it's not
only naive, it's dangerous because it has led to a sort of an extreme attempt to spiritualize
reality. And I use, I'm going to use the words spirit and soul, not in the religious sense,
but in the psychological sense. So spirit is sky, air, sunlight, abstractions, single-sidedness,
summon bonum, the summon bonum of the New Testament, the pure good, that spirit is this
flights of abstraction and spiritualization. And soul is on the other hand, soul is earthly,
it's moist, it's dark, it's where the roots suck their life energy from. It's Hades,
the mythical hell, but also the place where the goddess of spring emerges from every year
to renew life. So this is all soul, it's the ground of reality and it's morally ambiguous.
It's a place where that psychologists know that there comes insight and profound deception.
Good and evil, it's where the human shadow resides. And we have this tendency probably
started already with Christianity because, you know, the God of the Old Testament was
morally very ambiguous, a tribal God, very morally ambiguous. And with the New Testament,
God was pure good. And to this day, our culture seems to have this notion that we have to go
always only towards spirit, this single-sidedness of light and goodness and abstraction
and lightness, not only light, but lightness, this airy floating quality of spirit.
And what happens is that because this has become our ideal, we close our eyes to the salt side
of ourselves, to our shadows, to the earthly, to the dark, moist, womb-like, cave-like aspect
of ourselves, which is the place in nature that is pregnant with all potentialities,
all unrealized potentials. And where growth ultimately comes from, where the energy of the
spring comes from, the energy of transformation, there is a kind of self-honesty that is required
to be in contact with that soul side of life. And we have a culture that does its best
to eliminate it from existence, to deny it, to become completely single-sided. And then what
happens, and that's the dangerous thing, what do you do with a part of yourself that is intrinsic
to you but which you do not recognize? You project it. So where does the evil go? It goes
to the criminals in prison. It goes to the Palestinians in Gaza or the Israelis across
the world, depending on which side you are. It goes to the Jews during the time preceding
the Second World War, since the late 19th century. You project that. And the moment you project it,
that's when you get into conflict. That's where war comes from. That's where civil unrest comes
from. That's where all the crap, all the shit that's happening comes from. And that's why
we become unable to deal with it with maturity. It's because we've become unable to see that in
ourselves, to empathize with that, and therefore have a subtle, nuanced approach to how we deal
with it, a mature approach to how we deal with the dark side, how we deal with the evil forces.
We are totally innocent about how to deal with it because we are so focused on love,
as opposed to the dark energy. We are so focused on air and clouds and light and abstraction,
as opposed to the humid, dark, earthly ground of our being, where we are rooted. And this lack of
sophistication, this lack of self-awareness is what makes it impossible for us to have empathy
and to understand the other side. And if you cannot understand the other side, you don't need to agree,
you don't need to give it free reign. That's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying let's give free
reign to the shadow side. No. But if you don't want to give free reign to the shadow side, you
have to know it. You have to know what it is. You have to know what it's doing. But if you
repress and deny it, you don't see what it's doing. And that's when it gets free reign. You see,
it gets free reign precisely by being ignored, by not being legitimized, by our not giving it,
not telling it the following words, I see you, I recognize your right to exist within me,
but I shall not give you free reign. Our inability to do that is what sets off this madhouse that
we are seeing right now. And it's right now popping up in the Middle East, but it's always
popping up somewhere. So that's what I wanted to say. Every time we talk about love, and now
we'll link back to your question finally, every time we talk about love, and you want to say,
well, mind at large is love, it's God, it's the sumum bonum, it's all true, but it's half of the
truth. And ignoring, denying the right of the other half to exist, to be there, is immature and
dangerous. So with the same conviction that I would say, yes, love is mind at large, it is God.
I would also say, and so is the energy that expressed itself through Hitler.
And it's intrinsic to nature and to humanity. I mean, your backyard is a bloodbath right now.
I think I mentioned to you last time, you know, ants cutting up earthworms in pieces,
why are they wiggling alive? I mean, it's a desire to look at nature. Nature is a bloodbath,
what's happening? And to deny it, to deny its existence, to not grant it the right to exist
is a very mature, very dangerous move. And today, an extraordinarily unpopular move. I mean,
you run the risk of being culture canceled very swiftly, if you say what I just said. Now, why
do I say that? Because I didn't give a damn if I'm culture canceled, you know, I don't need
anymore this recognition from the outside that it's fine, whatever way it goes. But I think it's
very dangerous. It's a degree of psychological unsophistication and immaturity that sits at the
source of the evil we see in the world. Because to control the shadow, you need to grant it the
right to exist and to be there. And only then can you police it. What does it mean to understand
the shadow part of you, the evil part of you? Does it mean to, in John's words, see its point
of views or goals as plausible? What does it mean? And how does one practically do it?
Recognize that it exists. Recognize how it feels. Before you rush to judgment and you say, well,
my shadow side is wrong. Fine, you will get there. But first, I will speak metaphorically,
because there's no other way to speak about it. First, look at it and say, I see you. You exist in
me. And it is okay that you exist in me. I am not going to try to weed you out or cut off your head.
I'm not going to deny your rights to be. You are there. It's all right. However, I have a different
point of view. I am metacognitive. I can process things in a way that you cannot. And I will not
give you free reign. Now, you may even, to the degree that is safe and conducive to health
and harmony, you may even throw some breadcrumbs to it every now and then. Endow your shadow side in
a safe, controlled way. So it can also express itself as part of nature. Because if you shut
the door in it and you say, not only do I not see you, I don't grant you the right to exist. I don't
even recognize that you exist. That's where it's going to undermine you from the ground up, from
the roots up. If you go all towards the sun and you forget where you were rooted, you will be able
to do photosynthesis, but you will not have the minerals and the water that sustain your life.
Trees are a great metaphor for this. They need the sun. They need the spirit, but they are rooted in
soul. They are rooted in the darkness, moist realm of a moral ambiguity, where the shadow is.
So I think for lacking this degree of sophistication, not only lacking it, but elevating it as a
positive cultural value to lack that sophistication is extraordinarily dangerous because it's
it decrees the end of empathy. It turns the world into a dance of projections that have very little
to do with reality. There is more in common between me and my enemy than the Bernardo who was 30 years
old would ever dare contemplate as possible. And the moment you see this, you may think, well,
I don't want to get to that realization because I hate myself. No, you would not,
because that comes with a degree of kindness and acceptance towards yourself that you wouldn't
be capable of before. And that same kindness then just gets extended to the world at large.
That ability, and I think old people have this ability, they've gone through enough shit
that they know that things are never quite black and white. That behind that evil, there is something
you share. You see, to understand something doesn't mean that you need to agree. To understand an evil
act doesn't mean that you condone it. But we've come to associate understanding with approval.
We conflate these two things. And this is a disaster. Look, I don't need to approve of what
the SS did to understand what Austrians from Austrian villages, what motivated them to join the SS.
I can understand that. And I do understand that. Do I condone it? Do I approve of it?
Absolutely not. But that doesn't mean that they shouldn't make an effort to understand,
that they shouldn't make an effort to empathize in some way, because it's only through that
understanding and empathy that we will solve our problems, that we'll solve our conflicts.
There's a lot I want to say in response to that. First of all,
yeah, I agree with that critique of pure airy spirituality. I try to make the case
that the very same processes that make us adaptively intelligent also make us
permanently susceptible to self-deception, that you can't extricate one from another.
The heuristics that allow us to avoid combinatorial explosion are the same heuristics that bias us
and prejudice. And try to somehow get the one without the other. It's a farcical endeavor.
It's a futile endeavor. And that doesn't mean we can't ameliorate the way Bernardo was saying,
but trying to get some sort of ontological separation, I think that's a fundamental
misunderstanding about how intelligence and adaptivity and meaning making work.
And so what I'm proposing now is much more like the Buddhist perspective.
Realize that everything is threatened by dukkha. Realize that everything you do,
every domain, no matter what domain you're in, you can fall prey to self-deceptive,
self-destructive behavior, because that's what dukkha is. And that's one of the noble
truths. And so I think that actually lines up with how we're increasingly understanding the
functionality of cognition. Second riff point, and these are all related. I see,
there's another point where I maybe know a little bit closer, because I see Bernardo's
mind at large much more like the Dao than like God. I'm a Tai Chi player. I have been for three
decades. And so this is not just something I think about propositionally. I mean, in fact,
you don't really know the Dao until you're doing the Dao. You can't just read about it.
And the idea that the Dao is disclosed between, you all know the famous yin and yang. And notice
that there's a little dot of black within the white and white within the black and the line
between them is sinui. And there's a dynamic penetration and inter-co-creation between the yang,
which is the expansive area, and the yin, which is the earthy grounding. And so
if, you know, mind at large is more like the Dao, and that our primary relationship is
to it is one of ongoing maturation. So you do Tai Chi in order to become more mature in your
capacity to deal with the yin and the yang. And you hope that it percolates through your psyche
and permeates through your life. And that's what you're actually, and that's how to love it.
So I mean, I would suggest that there's a way of, there is, and Bernardo expressed,
there's a kind of love that is not trying to exclude the shadow. There's even the reciprocal
opening to the shadow. And I want to point out something else. This is right out of the Neoplatonic
tradition. Now, Bernardo was speaking, and perhaps he was speaking metaphorically, but
I practice and I'm involved in like IFS and other things like that, Emotion Focus Therapy,
in which you don't just sort of describe it to yourself. You actually enact these inner dialogues.
You actually go into an imaginative space, you'll have a part come up, and instead of trying to
exclude it, you try and mature it. You try and first of all, appreciate its adaptive functionality,
and then get it to realize that that functionality is now maladaptive,
and it needs to grow. And this is, you know, this is why IFS, Mark Lewis, by the way, recommend.
Can you give a specific example? Sure. So internal family systems therapy is,
I'll try not to spill my own guts too much on this, but so I have a part of me that when
it sort of feels threatened by overwhelming experience, it's kind of like, it wants to
smash, it sort of smashes things. It wants to sort of, you know, just disrupt whatever is happening
now so that this situation cannot unfold anymore. And so you sort of, well, what's that for? And
then you start to appreciate, oh, well, that ability to smash things, that's adaptive.
When properly, you know, aligned, it allows me to criticize and escape from oppressive
things that are trying to hold me back. And so you get into dialogue with this part,
and you try to say, well, you're just smashing everything. You need to smash everything all
the time. And first of all, it says, yes, because if I don't, you're going to get overwhelmed.
And then you say, but, but can you step back? Can you sort of become aware of me, right? As
Bernardo said, the metacognitive me, and this wider scope, and you see all the skills that
are available to us now. It's like the Tai Chi. I've developed a finesse. I don't just have to
smash things. We can carry out that function, but could we do it more like a martial artist?
So I even offer my part when it starts to run, I said, hey, why don't we just sort of do
almost enact Tai Chi internally? And it starts to get into a different framing,
and it starts to think, oh, wait, I can discharge this function, but in more sort of finesse
interaction, rather than just going in and smashing it. And then what happens is the,
want an impulsive aspect of this, that's confusing urgency and intensity with legitimacy,
it starts to become less confused. It starts to realize, oh, wait, I can meet the goal.
First of all, the goal doesn't have to be met the way I thought it has to be met.
And I can meet the goal by, you know, doing this other thing. And it's a process of
basically internal dialogue. Sometimes you're imagining the part and you're talking to it.
Sometimes it's more like a direct just intuition. Sometimes you get imagery that comes up,
but you learn, it's a skill, you learn to enter into dialogue with this. It's very similar to
something that's convergent in EFT, motion focus therapy, the empty chair technique,
which is you have, you feel an inner conflict. And what you do is you move between the chairs,
and you'll have this part, go to that part, take its perspective, take its identity,
say what it wants to say. Now go to this other part, take its perspective, and you,
and I've done this, I've done emotion focus therapy with Les Greenberg and stuff like,
and what happens is the two parts start talking to each other. They start realizing
that they're there. I don't want to be too anthropomorphic. But what happens,
the point I'm making is this, there's, what's happening is a revolution right now within
the psychotherapeutic world of all these independent lines of convergence on inner dialogue,
being an effective thing. Now one of the, one of the things that's helped is
the Jungian version of this was too tied to visual imagery, speaking therapeutically. And
there's a wide variation, including no capacity for visual imagery in the populace. We have at
least five to 10% of the people that can't do visual imagery. So active imagination is not
available to them. So what's happened is people have tried to say, well, can we, can we, can we
save the baby from the, the bathwater? And can we get other forms? And they've moved into more
discourse, dialogic ways of carrying on these inner dialogues. And there's, it's sort of,
they're sort of gaining a lot of traction within the psychotherapeutic world. And I find that very
interesting, because for me, that's just the Neoplatonic tradition brought back. Because
it's very clear that with things like theurgia, the Neoplatonists were doing this inner kind
of dialectic dialogue. And then they were doing it between each other in philosophy. And then they
were doing it contemplatively with reality. And they were coordinating these three together. And
we're, I feel like, and this is just an intuition. So don't give it too much. But I feel what these
different fields are starting, starting, all starting to converge towards each other to potentially
give us a set of abilities that would give us a very powerful kind of way of notice what Bernardo
was doing, where we're going through a transformation so that we can realize not just in thought, but
in our being some fundamental patterns within oncology. But I do think that all of that is
also still a kind of love. But again, not the spiritualized airy, it's the ability, like you
say, there's a love, right? It's like what Plato talks about in, you know, in, when he compares
Philea, Sophia to Philea and Othia. I'm not trying to destroy the shadow. I'm also not condoning it.
I'm trying to understand, I'm trying to open it up and open myself up to it in the right way.
At least that's how I understand it. And I don't know if that's consonant with everything you're
saying, Bernardo, but those are some of the riffs I wanted to get on. I'm very excited about all of
this happening right now, because it seems like I participate a lot in these emerging communities
of interpersonal dialogue. And man, do they become religious for people almost automatically? I'm
very much, like I said, really trying to understand the dialectic within oncology. I think by the way
that that separation from soul and spirit is again, we get both in our culture, we get,
we get, you know, just to sort of giving into raw emergence, a kind of, you know, which is,
you know, to take the soil but not try to grow from it, right? And then you have the,
you have like the tree just receptive to the sunlight of emanation. And you know,
and even Plato was critical of that. He said, no, no, look at the sun and then go back down
into the cave. Because if you don't go back into the cave, you haven't really understood the sun,
right? You didn't, you didn't get it. You didn't get it, right? And so I really try to bring all
these things together in my work. So I was just, I'm sorry, it's not a counter argument. I'm just
expressing sort of convergence and excitement with what you were talking about. And it's very
interesting to me that the, I see these symptoms as positive symptoms rather than the generation
of Erzatz religions to the meeting crisis. So I'm interested how, I agree with Bruno. You see
all of this stuff that Kurt's violin on all this crap going on over here, but there's also this
stuff going on over here. And that, that, that's what I place my, my, I place my dollar of hope.
That's my bet is on these emerging communities of practice and how they're also converging
with each other. Sorry, that was a lot, but that was, I just, I was just really inspired by what
Bernardo had to say. To speak personally, I, I try to go by this screenwriting adage, which says
that the more personal the pain, the more general. So if you try to speak in flatitudes, no one
relates, but if you're more honest than people tend to relate, I, I get this distinct feeling
that I don't love myself. And I, I'm unsure how to do shadow integration with one particular
aspect of myself that I'll say another, probably 20, but one is laziness. So I work hard, hard,
hard, hard, hard, hard, hard. And I feel like some, well, one, I need to work hard because to prep
for some of these podcasts requires quite a bit of work, but every minute, almost every minute
that I spend that I'm not working, I'm unconsciously beating myself up saying that I'm wasting time,
I'm wasting time, I need to get back to work. And when I'm spending time with my wife, which I love,
that's like all I love to do is work and to spend time with my wife. If I'm honest, when I'm spending
time with my wife, I'm thinking, why aren't I working right now? And I, so I, I have a feeling
that comes from me not loving myself. When interjection, what do you do? Do you do the
opposite? When you're working, do you think why am I not spending time with my wife?
Sometimes, sometimes, but I would say it happens more often. But it does happen that I, when I'm
working, I'm always looking forward to spending time with my wife. I actually, I'm so happy
that the two aspects of my life that I get to do almost 100% of the time is work intensely
and spend time with my wife intensely. And when I'm spending time with my wife, I'm not working,
it's like watching a movie, going for a walk and so on. But I'm trying to point out something to you
very frequently. And this goes back to what I said a few minutes ago, very frequently,
the reason why we can't integrate with something is because of aspect disguise. Let's first give,
I'll give a description that's not pertinent to your case. And then let's try and apply it here.
So somebody will come into therapy and they'll say, why are you here? And they'll say, I'm
stubborn, like I'm stubborn, I'm even flexible. And you don't tackle that directly. You talk to
them for a while, and you get them off somewhere and you say, tell me something you really like
about yourself. And they'll say, I'm perseverance, I really keep going. And they don't realize that
those are two different aspects of the same function. And I'm trying to get you to realize
if your laziness is also the positive function of taking you into relationship with your wife,
then you can see that it's not just a drag on your work. There's also a positive aspect to it.
And you've got to get off, you've got to bring the two aspects back together.
If they're disintegrated from each other, you can't integrate with them.
They have to come back together before, because you can't properly appreciate,
in all the meanings of the word appreciate, that reality and that function and integrate with it,
unless it has been properly reintegrated back together. You leave it like this, and you try
to integrate with this, and this is going to kick in the ass. Or you try to integrate with this,
and this is going to pull you into, right? And if you don't put them back together,
you can't integrate with it. That's why I'm trying to get you to see, is your laziness
also the thing, maybe that's also, hey, I want to connect with my wife. I want to do,
there are things other than my work that are important. That was just a suggestion. I mean,
you need to do therapy to do this, but I'm trying to get you to see like that, like you have,
it's a Bernardo, it's a much more nuanced thing. Part of the problem with the current discourse
around shadow integration is it's very simplistic. It's almost like there's the black figure there,
and what I'm going to do is just sort of bind to them, right? Exactly. That is not helpful.
That is not therapeutically helpful. And that failure to deal with aspect disguise is what
blocks people. And one of the things about IFS and other therapies is they're trying to get,
they're trying to get people to see both aspects of any function.
Sorry, I was just trying to be helpful there.
Definitely are. And Bernardo, one time you told me that I take myself too seriously and I do,
and it's, I try to not, I think I've taken myself less seriously since you've told me that,
but not drastically. It's difficult for me because I'm in many ways, I'm extremely insecure.
I don't feel like I know anywhere near as much as I need to know when I look at what I have to
learn, not just for these podcasts, but what I would like to learn from my life, these theories
of everything's 200 of them. Man, I know 1% of what I should know. And I'm constantly beating
myself up like I should be farther along. I felt like I wasted five to eight years of my life in
depression and I'm so far behind where I should be. And I look at other people and think at how
much and admire how much they know. And then it pushes me to go even harder, but sometimes it
exhausts me. And I have a feeling that this and a lack of shadow integration is, well,
many other aspects are the reason why I feel the way that I feel. And well, well, that, I'll just
say that. You sound like Socrates. I'm trying to be both funny. I'm trying to be a little bit
therapeutic here. I'm trying to be funny because humor gets around defenses. But I'm also trying
to challenge you. I'm trying to say, well, you know, really knowing that you don't know is,
first of all, that's the socratic, that's the central socratic insight. Because only, and not,
not knowing it the way you know, two plus two equals four, but like, you know, Ivan Illich
knew he was going to die, right? Knowing that is the thing that grounds and makes possible
socratic humility. It makes possible wonder and wisdom begins in wonder. So the gift you have
out of this, the positive aspect of not knowing is your capacity to find this wondrous and to find
it that it calls to you and calls you beyond yourself. If you knew all of this, you'd be static
and dead. But you are capable of awe and wonder precisely because you recognize that you don't
know. And you know, and you take it seriously. But that's again, I'm trying to get you to see,
right? You have to put the two aspects together. Yes, there's times when I feel that too, you know,
like, you know, I wish I was as well read as that person, I wish I was as mature as that person,
and you can get down. But then I realized, but the part of me that's making me down, I can,
I can, I can aspect shift it. And that's the part of me that can be transformed. Oh, I don't know.
And that's good. Because not knowing makes me responsive to other people, makes me capable,
makes me responsive to the world, makes me capable of falling in love with other people
and falling in love with the world. Because if I can't find them wondrous, I'm not going to fall in
love with them. Yeah, I will speak out of my own experience and intuition. It's not an area where
I have expertise unlike John. So I will speak as if what I'm saying were facts, but it's just how
I see it. Okay, it's grammatically, it's easier to just make statements and not keep on adding
disclaimers all the time. So what I think is this, you will always try to get out of this situation
through a paradigm of victory. So you will achieve victory in some kind of conceptual
wrestling match against yourself. But you will get out of this, in fact, through a completely
different paradigm, a paradigm of surrender to what you are, to what is the case about you.
Now this may sound as bad news, but it's not because that surrender when it's authentic,
it comes hand in hand with a lot of loving kindness and acceptance towards yourself.
The judgments you pass on yourself sort of dissipate not because they are resolved by choice,
but because those values are seen through. It's like Nietzsche's transvaluation of all values.
So it's not like one side of the equation will achieve victory, it's the very fight will be
seen through. And that seeing through has the quality of a kind of an exhalation, a surrender
with a lot of comprehension, understanding and loving kindness towards yourself, which sort of
transcends those those paradigmatic, paradigmatic values of what you should be as opposed to what
you think you are and how you should behave as opposed to how you think you behave. You come to
a place where you are what you are. You're lazy. That's okay. Laziness is part of you. It doesn't
need to be judged constantly. It may surprise you because of what people perceive as my production.
I'm an extraordinarily lazy person, but I stopped fighting my laziness. I kid you not,
this is factually true. I am a very lazy person. Today, for instance, I had a whole lot of things
to do, but I gave me the excuse that I had a long debate at six. So I did absolutely nothing today.
The difference between you and me is that although I used to be very much like you, I'm not seeing the
time ahead of you. Am I in a different place? The place where I am now is, okay, I have been very
lazy today. It's fine. It's just the truth of the moment. It's what happened at that point in time.
I'm not going to drive myself nuts by judging myself. There was a time I caused myself tremendous
agony. I made a 30-second stupid mistake. I tried to remove a siren from an alarm system
in my house, knowing that it was not deactivated, knowing full well it had a safety mode and it
would go off. But I thought, well, it goes off. I only need 10 seconds to pull the batteries out.
It's okay. Well, it went off and gave me terrible tinnitus. I have tinnitus in both
ears that sound like a dentist's drill at three meters distance day and night. And it has driven
me to the point of planning my suicide twice for 30 minutes or so. Now, I went nuts against myself
when that happened. You know, I looked at the mirror and I, you were so bloody stupid. You know
that was going to happen. Look at what you did, you asshole. Now, that dissipated too. It doesn't
come as a victory. It's like you transit into another way of being that you don't achieve,
you don't secure through a paradigm of conflict and fight. You sort of just allow yourself to
slide into it. It's very hard to describe. But the good news is there is a place of peace
that is almost inevitable to arrive at. Even if you arrive at it 30 seconds before you die and
you are already in your deathbed, usually people are forced into that place through
major life dramas, a job loss, a divorce, a death of a loved one, some major thing that sort of
shakes the edifice of your narratives, which sort of overwhelms your ego, your ability to try to be
in control or to pretend that you are in control. And once that ability is taken out and you stop
fighting, you sort of slide into this place of acceptance, this transvaluation of all values in
which, you know, the judgment of yourself sort of goes away and you are just living in service of
your diamond. And my diamond is not a Socratic diamond. It doesn't tell me what not to do.
It tells me pretty explicitly what to do. So I have a particularly severe diamond. And I live
in peace with this paradigm of surrender and slavery. My coat of arms has a chain. And I added
that to symbolize the fact that my life is in a wonderful condition of permanent slavery. A
slavery towards what nature wants to do through me. A sort of complete giving up of the paradigm of
control. I'm not in control. I have never been in control, by the way. And it's all right. And
there is no point in judging me. Who am I to judge me? There is a form of arrogance built into self
judgment. What's happening is what's happening. What you are is what you are. Laziness has its
place. If it becomes compulsive and addictive, then it's something else. And then John can tell us
what happens there. But this shadow side, the shadow of laziness, the shadow of anger
that we try to repress, they have their moment. They have their moment of expression so long as
they don't become dysfunctional. That paradigm of acceptance makes space for all that. And at some
point you look back and you see, you know, my life went just like the way it went. And that was
nature. And it couldn't have been any other way. And the proof of it is that it was the way it was.
I mean, Bernardo, you're sounding more and more like a tai chi player to me all the time.
Stringerland has a good book around this, entitled, Trying Not To Try, about how you see this
thing within Taoism and Buddhism. I think perhaps also within Islam,
properly understood its notion of surrender too, because what Islam literally means.
But yeah, this idea of, and I've tried to, because what you're trying to, it's interesting,
because you're both trying and not trying. I mean, if I just sit on the couch, nothing,
I'm not doing tai chi. But if I get up and I say, I'm going to make myself get into the flow state,
that I'll never get there. So you have to do this finesse thing where you open yourself up,
but you have to let something take shape within you. But you don't just let it impulsively,
like it's this, it's why I keep using Pascal's term, like instead of the spirit of geometry,
the spirit of finesse, it's a finessing kind of thing in which you really have to,
Iris Murdoch's things, you really have to give things their just attention, the attention that
they properly deserve. And figuring out the wisdom of how much attention to give something
and finesse, I think that's a big part of maturity and wisdom. And that's what I met
by when I talked about Philea Sophia, rather than Philea Naikia, Plato consistently contrasts them.
The people that are lovers of wisdom, as opposed to the people that are lovers of victory,
even over themselves. And so I just think that that was beautifully well said.
I don't know if you do anything from the Taoist tradition, but you certainly have a sensibility
that would open you up to those practices, I think, very readily.
Probably. I have no background in this thing. So I'm just speaking from where I am.
The quality I sense in it is the quality of tuning. It's more a tuning to the flow,
frequency and energy of the moment without judging the energy of the moment. So if the
energy of the moment is like it was from me earlier today, laziness, sit on the living room
and watch electronics videos all afternoon. Then I tuned into that without that energy of judgment,
that energy of control, trying to make it be different. But it works the other way around as
well. Sometimes the energy of the moment is compulsive work. And I tuned into that too. It was
a case a couple of days ago. So that was the energy of the moment. That's what the Daimon wanted to
do through me. So on we go. Let's go with it. Transvaluating all values. In other words,
without passing the judgment, whether it's good or bad, within reason, of course. I mean,
if I'm not going to surrender to the energy of anger, which happens often enough,
but I'm not going to give it free reign. The other day, I wanted to do something physically
bad to a neighbor. But okay, there I put limits on that. You know, it got closed, it came into
here. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're not going to have free reign. You are there. I recognize
you exist. There is this anger inside me, but I'll stop you here and I will go in and I will punch
a dustbag. I'll give it another outlet. But I still, I was still in tune with it. I didn't
repress that. So I don't know. It has happened naturally to me after my 45th year, this sort of
sliding into the energy of the moment and not fighting it, you know, giving up the illusion
that I was ever in control. And just tune into the radio of nature within reason because I'm
a reflective being after all, I will use my reflection to establish the limits. I know you
both have to go soon. But I just want to respond to that, please. Yeah, sure, sure. There's just
so much. I mean, if you heard me a minute ago, you're not a Tai Chi doer, your Tai Chi player
with the verb is to playing music. And so the music getting into attunement and playing music
and achieving harmony between the different tunes that you're attuning to is very much the central
Taoist metaphor. So I think, yeah, I think you might be a Taoist without knowing it, Bernardo,
but that that's meant in affection. Schopenhauer said that the closest thing, the closest human
activity to the intrinsic rhythms and characteristics of the wheel was music. Yeah, the rhythm and flow,
the ebb and flow of music was the clearest representation, the closest representation
to the wheel as it is in itself, as opposed to how it presents to us as representation. So that
has to do with that as well, tuning yourself to the to the flow of nature that is expressing itself
through you. And your only choice is you either fight that, or you let it happen. So I just choose
now to not fight that. I want to get to religion without a religion. But before we do that,
John, what age or what moment in your life was it that precipitated you feeling more
at peace or surrendering to a part of yourself that you resisted? Because right now, when I look
at both of you, you're calm, you're, you seem to have a well developed Beltan Shaung, otherwise
it wouldn't have asked you on to this program. And I think I lack almost all of those. Now I'm also
being a bit harsh on myself when I say that, but I'm definitely not to the degree of peace that you
both are. And I'm curious, so John, what age or what moment, what happened to lead you to where
you are now? Well, that's a different question from the question of where did I realize peace? Because
I don't think peace is something I have going back to form. I think peace is something that I,
like maturity, I should always be realizing. I mean, this is similar to the point that
McGee and Barbara make that one of the surest signs that somebody isn't wise is if they say to you,
I am wise. And that has nothing to do with the synantics or the syntax of the proposition, right?
And I think the similar thing, you know, I almost think somebody who says that, you know, I'm
perpetually at peace. I'd be a little bit worried about that they there, I mean, the Buddha, for
example, classically warned against people who pursue meditation, they get that sort of spiritually
bypassed contentedness, because then they're useless. They're useless for other people. They're
useless for trying to reduce suffering, enhancing agency, improving connectedness, meaning in life.
So I just want to say that I don't want to put it into the having mode way of understanding it.
What put me on the path to trying to realize peace within and peace without, if you'll allow me that,
sort of the Jewish notion of Shalom, or the Plato's notion of justice, which has a lot to do
with that kind of peace and harmony, not with our notion today so much. But put me on that path was
a loss and an encounter. I was in a fundamentalist Christianity that now upon reflection traumatized
me. I'm grateful for it, though. I've learned with therapy in time. I'm grateful to it because it,
you know, how you have a mother tongue language, that Christianity was my mother religion. It gave
me the taste for meaning and wisdom and self-transcendence and fellowship and trying to get to a deeper
aspect and the sacred that I'm grateful for. But nevertheless, it seriously traumatized me.
And then there was experiences that brought me out of that. But, and I'm glad that that happened.
But because it was my mother religion, it left a kind of hold in me, a gap. And I did a lot of
thrashing around and, you know, became sort of a very antagonistic atheist and, you know, that kind
of thing. But, and I don't want to make it sound like they're stages. That kept going for a while,
but I'm talking about sort of attenuation on a graph. But in university, I encountered the figure
of Socrates in Plato's work. And it gave me an alternative way of thinking about how to cultivate
wisdom, self-transcendence, fellowship, a relationship to what's sacred, moving into the
depths. And that, for me, put me on a course of seeking. Now, what happens in academic philosophy,
I think Bernardo will back me up until very recently. The topic of wisdom drops off the table
and you get into, you know, epistemology and metaphysics. And, you know, and I think Bernardo
and I have shown that's valuable. And so I pursued it for its own sake. But the hunger for what I
saw in Socrates, and then later, as I just alluded to in Spinoza, wasn't being met
in academic philosophy. So I undertook Tai Chi, the past in the meditation, meta-contemplation,
practices. And I started to get a sense of the perspectival, participatory,
procedural transformations of wisdom. And then, lo and behold, fourth generation cognitive science
was emerging. And people were starting in psychology to talk about wisdom before they talked about it
in philosophy, by the way. And these two streams just started to, there was like a kairos in the
world. The world was bringing these two together and I needed them to come together. And I just
happened to be there at the right place and the right time for that convergence without the
convergence without and the convergence within met. And that was for me, the kairos, the turning
point. And that's the point from which I have not looked back. I hope that answers your question.
Bernardo, what about you?
I don't think there was a specific point where a major transition happened. I think it was a
progressive sort of giving in to what is. I still suffer from a lot of anxiety. So
taking my cue from John, let me highlight this. I take it for granted that we all suffer. So
sometimes I don't emphasize this, but I don't want to come across as somebody spiritually
enlightened because I'm anything but and then I mean it when I say it. I suffer from anxiety,
but the difference is I don't fight with it anymore that much. My anxiety is there. My anxiety is
there. And before there would be multiple layers of fights and meta fights and meta meta fights
against the anxiety. Should I be anxious or not? I'm wasting my time by being anxious. I don't have
a reason to be anxious. So how do I make myself not be anxious? Oh, that thing, you know, it's
mushrooms. That didn't stop completely, but it's a lot less, less present. There is an easier sort
of, okay, this is the energy of the moment. I'm anxious. Okay, I'm anxious. How did that happen?
I think suffering has a lot to do with it. Suffering has a lot to do with insight, with becoming
more mature, because it's the one thing in nature that makes you stop and reevaluate your narratives.
Because if you're not suffering, then you're living an Epicurean life, which is irresistibly
unexamined. Why would you stop and examine it? You're having fun. You're having a ball. So
there is something about suffering that is directly tied, I would say, even an enabler
of insight and maturation, because it forces you to stop and think because, you know, your game is
not working. Something is going wrong in the game you're playing. Something is wrong in your narratives,
in your values, somewhere, something is not right. And it's that consistent undermining that
suffer puts you through like water against a rock, you know, it doesn't kick the door open in one go.
But over the years, it softens you, like it softens the rock. It makes you less angular,
more roundish. There is more nuance, more subtlety, more finesse, as John put it, and less internal
fight. I wouldn't be able to tell you a precise moment, but it happened through suffering, for
sure. And it is happening. It's a verb, it's not a noun, it's not the place you arrive at.
It's a path that you accept to allow nature to pursue through you. And I say this more or less
metaphorically. I don't say this in a religious sense. I'm not saying that I'm controlled or
some spirit incarnated in me. And I'm trying to convey the feeling of it through metaphor.
And the feeling of it is the feeling that you are not in control. It's just that you are not
fighting with the rhythm and flow of nature as it wants to go through you at that moment.
What I could tell you is that until I was, when I was 32, I was promoted to director position
in the company I was working for, which is a major company. It was Europe's top 50.
It's in the FTSE, major, major company. If that company stopped existing today,
there would be no new electronics for five to 10 years. And at 33, I was director, probably the
youngest at the company at that time. And that was the peak of my adaptive self. The adaptive self is
that personality that has found a way to secure a place in the world for themselves,
despite all the shit that you go through, like losing my father when I was 12. And you adapt
to the circumstances and you create a way for you in the world. The adaptive self is a tool to
get there. And it reached a peak when I was 32 towards 33. And it was at that moment when something
happened, I thought I had found, well, I found a growth. I mean, the person who was then my wife,
I found a growth in her breast. And it took two weeks for doctors to rule out cancer. But in those
two weeks, I was confronted with the reality that although my adaptive self ticked every box
that it had set for itself when I was 12, like these are all the goals I achieved in my life,
although it was extraordinarily successful. At the end, I was not in control of anything. And
the carpet could be pulled out of my feet the next moment. And it can happen now. I think I
mentioned to you last time, you can get a phone call in the next 30 seconds, that will destroy my
life as I know it now. So that happened. And that was the moment of awakening. That was the first,
oh, shit. And from that point, 33 until 43, 44, say, thick 10 years, that's when this transition
happened. And in that process, there was a lot of anxiety, a lot of inner fight.
But recently, it has gotten a lot better. For some reason, all I can tell you that it's an
ongoing process that I didn't achieve. I slid into. And I would probably have
slide it into it kicking and screaming. The difference is, once I was sliding, I figured,
I can't stop this slide anyway. So let's see where it goes.
Bernardo, can I ask you a question? Sure. Because one of the reasons why I've been
trying to come up with this, work out this notion of participatory knowing is,
again, to try and get out from a purely active or purely passive epistemic and ontologic
existential stance. The romantic, I just make it, the empiricist, I just receive it.
My experience is these processes, there's similarities. That's what I try to get at
with the idea that I participate in it. I'm not just passively receiving, and I'm not making it
happen. It's again, this trying not to try. The metaphor I use is becoming someone's friend.
I can't make it happen. You're my friend. I can't just be my friend. But I have to
participate in it. And so I'm not only trying to make an epistemological point
about participatory knowing, I'm trying to give people a concept by which they can understand
how to get into right relationship with these kinds of pathways. Does that land for you?
Does that resonate for you? Absolutely. Look, I don't have a recipe,
as I'm sure you're not asking for one either because it's a naive way to go about it.
But to me, it went hand in hand with a form of self-knowledge and self-acceptance,
which was intimately tied to my view of what reality is. These two things were not separate
from me. So that's why I keep on insisting on the importance of a plausible ontology
that's conducive to this. Because for me, it was indispensable because the way I'm put together,
my intellect is the bouncer of my heart. If I do not have a plausible intellectual hypothesis to
ground whatever I'm pursuing, I shut myself off from it. And there was a lot of shadow acceptance.
Look, I never said this because I was never asked, but I will volunteer this now to probably
surprise the vast majority of the audience. A big part of my shadow was vitriolic criticism of
paranormal, new age, cosmic mind, all that stuff. I was so caustic about that. I would jump to
criticism so quickly. I would be so critical of all this stuff in my 20s and 30s. It required a
sort of involved years-long intellectual process for me to accept this because I needed the
intellectual plausibility. But it was not the only game. There was an emotional opening to
that softer side of myself that I'm giving expression to right now. If you met me 10 years
ago, I would have very little empathy. I would be very black and white. My IMTP score and a
personality test, my T score, was the maximum possible score. I have answered every question in
a way that tilted me to T. The evaluator was doing that for a company. The evaluator looked at
that and thought, you were the first perfect T, perfect thinker. Thinking over values everything
for you. I was the first to score a perfect score on the T. It would not have been a higher.
So that was my conscious self, my adaptive self. Everything was thinking because it helped, helped
shut away the trauma of my father's loss. It helped so much. It was such a brilliant adaptive move
that had its place, but then it no longer had its place. Opening up to those other
psychological functions was a process of shadow acceptance for me. A very difficult
process of shadow acceptance because suddenly I was becoming everything I was critical of.
Not to an extreme, but to even dip my toe in those waters was like,
what am I doing? And I still have it. I still have it secretly. I still am invited to,
and last week I was invited to an online conference and I really had to hold myself back
because my shadow side was screaming about the style, the language that other people were using.
I was like, come on, get a grip. Stop this. Stop this bullshit. Which of course is not the
fact of the matter. Those people have their perspective. They have their journey. They have
their path, but integrating this in a way that doesn't go to extremes either way was difficult.
It's like an onion. It never ends. There is always a new layer of acceptance of yourself,
acceptance of the world. I call it the ball of string, the ball of string. You're always unwinding
it and it seems like it's never going to change. It's endless. When you think you've got there,
then oh, no, no. Then comes the next thing. Look at this now. And you go, oh, shit. It's even worse
than I thought. There's so much convergence between your story and mine on that point.
I mean, I specifically took up, I only described the light side of it. I did describe the shadow
side of it. I specifically took up the Tai Chi and the Buddhism and everything because that was
me opening myself up to the woo-woo and to kinds of knowing that weren't computational thought
and argumentation for very similar reasons. It changed me from behind. It changed me from my
blind side. I didn't put it vocally present, but that's what happened in the process.
I think that's always how it happens. It doesn't happen to your control.
No, no. I just wanted to share with you that I resonated with what you said about that because
it's something very similar for me. I now have garnered the reputation of the person.
I suppose in this channel I seem much more the positivist, but I'm often in other things. I'm
the person who talks about all the woo that other people don't want to talk about. I wrestle with
that. I wrestle with something similar. I wrestle with how to separate critique, which anybody
who's advocating position should be open to critique and discussion from that destructive
smasher that wants to just smash it down. It's like, okay, here's how I respond, but part of
responding is to try and genuinely listen, which is often very challenging for me because I grew up
having to listen to the word of God and the word of my parents. My reactance to that is,
I'm going to speak, and I'm going to speak monologically, and I'm going to overwhelm people
with my speaking. One of the shadow reasons why I'm taking up this whole Dialogos project is to
learn, no, no, no, you don't want to be a monologue. The Cartesian monologue, monadic mind, is what
got us into this problem. If you're going to really enter into a Dialogical mind, then listening
matters as much as speaking. That's been very challenging for me because listening is often
triggering a sense of vulnerability to authority and to dictation, and I'm playing on both
senses of the word dictation there. Yeah, I recognize that. It never ends in the sense that
to this day, if you look at how I articulate my own views, I articulate them purely on the basis
of reason and empirical evidence. You still see that my shadow, although I accept it, it's there.
And that's what I think is important, that people who are in the paradigm of fight, they don't
understand. To incorporate the shadow doesn't mean that you killed the shadow, or that you
No, no, yeah. You sort of accept its expression and a big expression of my shadow. You see my work.
My work is purely on the, everything I do, I argue on the basis of reason and evidence. 100%.
And I am fully aware that that's not the whole story. I'm fully aware that there is a lot of
intuition, that there are aspects of reality that do not comply to Aristotelian logic. Why should
they? Why should the set of natural axiomatic statements of a monkey be such that they encompass
the whole of reality, right? Of course not. So I'm keenly aware that introspective insight,
intuition, feeling, these count as much to build up one's worldview, or more, maybe they count more
than reason and evidence. But I am the way I am. I have my shadow. And my shadow needs to go through
this purely on the basis of reason and evidence. I had private exercises about integrating my
shadow. One paper I published in a technical journal, the Journal of Consciousness Studies,
one of the main philosophy journals in the world today. You got the paper there, you have a PhD.
I made a point, I usually use the words extended mind or universal subjectivity,
something academic and neutral. In that paper, I thought, I'm going to do an exercise here.
I'm going to use the words cosmic consciousness, which were the words that used to give me shock,
but I made a point of putting it there. It was accepted the rest is history, but I sort of on
purpose made my life more difficult to sort of embrace the process I was in. I wrote about
cosmic consciousness. I had to look in the mirror and say, I published a paper in which I talk about
cosmic consciousness. What are you going to do now? Are you going to shoot yourself in the head?
No, it's done. It's happened. So that was part of my own exercise.
That's such a great story. Thank you for sharing that. I've done similar things, but that's really
precious. Thank you. That's really wonderful. I'm happy that you can now apprehend it mostly
through humorous lens rather than the tension that was at the time, no doubt when you were doing it.
There's still tension. There's always a new layer. Yeah, there's the humor, which also helps a lot,
I think. I mean, it's really conducive to cognitive flexibility and insight.
That's another thing that the West needs to just to throw out a random, not totally random,
but and this aligns with the stuff I talk about in a serious play. We need to figure out how to
reintegrate humor back into spirituality. That's part again of that separating the air from the
earth and the fact that somebody once pointed out, there's no humor in the Bible. That's a very odd
thing. I asked someone this, did Jesus make any jokes? So not the worst recorded. Now, I doubt
that he didn't because when you actually get closer approaches to sage figures,
Socrates has a lot of humor running through him and there's all this stuff going on. He does word
play and all kinds of humor. He could be more funny, but nevertheless, but I think of somebody
like Kierkegaard and the humor running through his work is just you can't separate, you can't separate
the philosophical and the spiritual project from the humor in Kierkegaard. And Kierkegaard said
something really interesting about these two figures. He said, I follow Jesus, but Socrates is my
teacher. And so I really resonate with that in some in important ways. But I think, you know,
I'm commending Bernardo and I'm recommending, and myself included, that we try to reintegrate
the spirit of humor into our spirituality because of all of the work about how much humor,
right? How much it integrates different kinds of knowing, how much it facilitates cognitive
flexibility, how much it opens you up to other person's perspective, affords insight. The fact
that we've kept that out of our spirituality is only detrimental. It's only detrimental. And
if you remember in the name of the rose, this was actually one of the central topics. Remember
that document that was being kept hidden and people were being killed about was Aristotle's
treatise on laughter, right? And that's what had to be kept out at all costs. And I think Echo
was pointing to something really important there, that if until we can properly reintegrate the
spirit of humor with our spirituality, I think we're still seriously truncated in our ability to
get develop a sensibility that is properly, or at least, maybe even optimally responsive
to the to the meeting crisis. So that's why I was glad to see the humor mixed with that because,
you know, people can relate those events and they can, they can, they can go back into that. Yeah,
exactly. You're always doing that. They can go back into that like that moment of like, ah,
right. But the fact that it was so spontaneously woven with humor, I just wanted to commend that
and recommend that to other people. And humor is also something you have to participate in.
You can't make it and you can't just wait for it to happen, right? Like, you have to participate
in it. You have to slide into it the way Bernardo says. Yeah, at some point you go through this
so many times that, you know, your, your self opinions and your, your opinions in general
get shattered so many times that it becomes very difficult to take yourself without humor.
That's what I meant when I told you last time, Kurt, don't take yourself too seriously, take
life seriously, but yourself less so. It has to do with that. If we take ourselves too seriously,
it, it becomes too tight, you know, the process becomes too hard to, and there's no point doing
that. John, you mentioned the meaning crisis and the way I wanted to end this was to talk about
a religion without a religion, which is your term, John. But what I mean is that it seems like
we've lost, when I say we, I mean modern people, modern people who value the intellect tend to
disparage God and disparage traditional religion. But then there's this whole. And then even Richard
Feynman said that one of the most important questions, if not the most important question, is
where do we go? What's the modern church? We can't just go back to church. You can't simply
believe. You can't just pray to a statue of Mary. I don't even think you should, because that's like
an idol. So I don't know how Catholics get around that. It's another issue. But either way, what do
we do? So John, do you mind? Yeah, talking about that a bit. And then Bernardo, I'd like to hear
your thoughts. This is more about speculation rather than there's no disagreement. It's almost
like you're building something together. Well, I wanted to say that a significant aspect of what
I mean, a dimension of what I mean by the religion that's not a religion is what has been happening
here, the kind of dialogue that is not just debate, the kind of dialogue that's, you know,
that has poesis in it and logos in it and not just logic in it. And so that's important. So when I'm
talking about the religion, so the reason I use a contradiction is because I'm trying to break out
of the way in which we've locked ourselves into an inappropriate sort of exclusivity. But I want
to say one caveat that's really important. I think it's completely empirically justified in terms
of the demographic to talk about the nuns, N-O-N-E-S. These are people who officially, who say on
census, and apparently sincerely, that they have no, they do not belong to any religion. Okay.
Now, it's a growing group and it will soon be the majority. That's the demographic fact. I do not
want to simply dismiss because I get into good faith in both senses of the word discussions,
even the logos with people who are Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish. And I want to
acknowledge and recognize that I see the sincere cultivation of wisdom and meaning and this kind
of humility and the attempt to get inner peace and to see, to get ontological depth perception.
And so I never intended the claim to be, everybody's in this. Okay. I want that very clear. I think
if people are, you know, be able to cultivate wisdom and virtue and sensibility, you know,
transcend all the stuff we've been talking about within their religion, I don't want to in any way
throw a stumbling buck in front of them. But back to the point, there is the demographic fact
that church allegiance is even now starting to decline in the United States of America.
That's undeniable. And Europe is predominantly non-religious by demographic fact and things
like this. Okay. So there is a group of people and this has been growing. And that's the people
I'm trying to address. I also helped, I also hope, and I've told that this is the case,
that what the work I do helps people who are within a religious tradition find more meaning
and wisdom within it. But I think it's the case that the nuns are a large and growing demographic,
especially in the developing world. Okay. Now, the thing we can't, the thing we shouldn't think,
still speaking demographically, is they're all Sam Harris atheists. That's not, that's not what's
going on. Are some of them that, and I say that because I want to challenge the idea that it's
primarily just intellect that makes people go into the nuns. It's not intellect in our narrow,
truncated, suffocated sense of intellect right now. Some of it is, but most of these people readily
and reliably and enthusiastically describe themselves as spiritual, but not religious,
which, and the thing about that is the fact that that is so pervasively said and so pervasively
valorized. And so little thought is given to what the hell does that actually mean,
right? In any kind of coherent fashion indicates what's going on with these people.
So what does that mean? Well, that's the point. It means something like
an incoherent sense that they want to deal with self-deceptive, self-destructive patterns.
They want to come to a more inner alignment. They want to be more in touch with reality.
They want to be more connected to other people. They want more meaning in life. They want more
wisdom. They want to be able to see, and they don't use this word, but I would make the case
that that's what they're talking about. They want to see virtue in themselves and in the world.
Right? And I think that's why we have the issue, and I'm not taking a stance on this politically,
but we have the whole phenomena of virtue signaling that expresses a hunger in our culture.
Wherever you stand on the woke pseudo religion, there is a hunger that's being expressed there.
Like, why do we need virtue signaling? Because we're hungry for. We want to see it in ourselves
and other people, but we don't want to go through the transformations, the suffering that's required.
So these people are, that's what they mean. They want to do this, but they don't find,
and this is thinking much more important than disbelief. They don't find for political reasons,
for experiential reasons, for idiosyncratic reasons, for reasons of trauma, for all,
for reason, more moral reasons. They don't find the religions relevant. That's the main judgment.
It's not falsity. It's irrelevance. I want to use a Jamesian idea here, right? The religions
aren't viable for them. And simply trying to convince them that religion is belief is often,
like, it's extremely clumsy because that's not the basis of the rejection.
And so what they mean is, you know, I find those things irrelevant to satisfying this need, but
this need needs to be satisfied. And I'm not clear what this need is. So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to do this auto-didactic, eclectic search for practices, and beliefs, and images, and groups
of people. And what they basically do, what spirituality means in practice, even though
they won't say this, and there was a very good argument, I say about this, is spirituality
means the religion of me. It means my religion. It means the, what I've done, remember, not all
religions are worship-based. So you have to give up that Abrahamic ethnocentricity. What they're
doing is they're cultivating an ecology of practice that's trying to help them engage in
self-transcendence, enhance connectedness, more inner peace, more contact with what's real,
including the reality of other people, right? Get some kind of virtue into their life. But
they suffer from the fact that, like, they suffer from any project that is driven primarily in an
auto-didactic, fragmented fashion. And so, like, they are easily prey to both internal and external
compulsive manipulation, because, you know, my student, my RA, he's not my colleague,
Jensang Kang, he's done, Jensang Kim, he's done research, you know, that, and let me say the whole
thing, because the whole thing is important. If you compare people who are religious, within a
religious tradition, to people that are outside of a religious tradition, and you compare them by
our best sort of measures on wisdom, and we are developing such measures, by the way, the people
within the religious traditions do better. That's an empirical thing. However, however,
there's no difference between the various traditions.
It just matters that you belong to one. Right. So that's why I keep saying, and, you know, and this
goes with arguments made by Stephen Batchelor, right, when he talks about Buddhism, what's
about belief, because we have reduced religio, that sense of connectedness to belief, and even
belief originally meant to give your heart to something, but we've reduced it to the assertion
of beliefs. We think, well, all of these systems, look at how much they're in conflict at the
belief level. But it turns out, I don't want to say that not having beliefs, it would be functional.
I'm not saying that. But what I'm saying is, it's clear that the functionality for the cultivation
of wisdom isn't found in the semantic content of the propositions. And now, and I agree, and I'm
going to reinforce it. I agree with Bernardo's point that, and you can't situate a wisdom ecology
in a vacuum. It has to be situated in a forwarding worldview, and I totally acknowledge that.
But what I'm trying to say here is, right, they're trying to do this back to the nuns in,
you know, you're reinforcing the very Cartesian, monologic, monadic, individualistic
frame, and the propositional tyranny, and all the proclivities we all, myself included,
share for self-deception, all of that's just getting reinforced by that religion of me.
And of course, one of the pervasive kinds of things it leads to is spiritual bypassing and
narcissism. And those are, I mean, and your Trungpa wrote a good book about this, spiritual
materialists in the socioeconomic virtue sense of materialism, not in the ontological sense.
Spiritual materialists are the worst. I mean, they're the worst of all. They're, right, I mean,
elite, because what all they want to do is show you their trophy shelf of all their wonderful
experiences that show how unique they are, and how the universe is uniquely caring about them.
And, and it's like, wow, that's, that's harder to get through than somebody who's, you know,
buying the car to become mature. Because at least that person, right, right, is confronting some
frustration and suffering you can get to them. But this person over here can have that the,
the Buddha talks about the, you know, the contentedness of the cabbage that, that would just
prevent them from the, you know, the Kierkegaardian realization of that they are always one step
away from the precipice of despair. And I thought it was Bernardo jump in at some point soon.
Well, I just wanted to commend Bernardo on something that I forgot to commend him on,
which is I have also been in a place where suicide seemed the alternative for me.
I also suffer from the nears in my left ear. So I also have not heard silence in decades. And
it also comes with attacks of vertigo. So I just, I just wanted to express
camaraderie with you, Sharon on that. Thank you, Joe.
So Bernardo, about religion without a religion. What do you see is the
disiderata of it or the criteria or the checks that need to be ticked?
I think our loss of religion goes hand in hand with our loss of the meaning of certain words,
because you see, we don't experience reality directly. We sort of tile the world around us
with a mosaic of conceptual signs, right, words. We leave the narrative that we tell ourselves about
what we are living. So words in a sense are important. And then we've lost the meaning of
so many words. We've lost the meaning. And this, I'm not taking a cheap shot at homosexuals by
saying this. Certainly, I'm a defender of homosexuals if you read my site. But we've lost
the full meaning of the word gay, for instance. The meaning, the original meaning of the word gay is
spontaneous joy. But now, now sort of linguistically, only homosexuals have spontaneous joy. Is that
fair now? We lost something. We lost the meaning of the word metaphysics, that which is more primaries
behind and precedes physics. Now it has become synonym for spiritual woo-woo. And we've lost the
meaning of the word religion. Religion comes from the Latin religaere to reconnect with the
source or with transcendence, with the ground level of reality from which the life force arises.
But because of institutionalized religion, now religion has become synonym with morals,
moral code, dogmas, and beliefs. Where is the rejoining? Where is the relinking? Where is the
religaere? Where is the religion? And the religion sort of got washed away. I mean, look at the Vatican,
they can get, and I say this with some despair, because I care about the total collapse of
Christianity in the West, and I've been to the Vatican, invited for events at the Vatican, and I
was growing hopeful over the last couple of years. But now look at what they are doing. They use their
time to talk about arbitrary morals and to insist on a, how to say, calcified interpretation of
Scripture. So they are, they contribute to this loss of the meaning of the word religion. Religion
is about the liturgy. It's about the symbolic ritual that points at a truth that cannot be
captured in a conceptual framework. Because why would the cognitive apparatus of a primate
evolved on planet Earth be broad enough to capture every salient truth about reality
in its own closed conceptual system? Why would that be the case? Of course, it's not the case.
There are relevant salient truths that cannot be said, they cannot be worded, that cannot be expressed
through a closed semantic and syntactical system. And I think what religion does is to use
a arsenal of symbols of liturgy to sort of point at that, such that you can have a direct
experience of it once you're shown the way, once you're given a hint, a set of rituals that sort
of puts you in the suitable frame of mind that is conducive to making that final leap yourself.
But that's not what we see. That's not what we see being done by institutionalized,
by the religious institutions that are supposed to nurture religion, especially after the
reformation. You go to a Protestant church, it's fashioned exactly like a tribunal. The preacher
dresses like a judge. And even Catholicism, which still holds on to symbolism, especially Eastern
Christianity, which is not Catholic, but they hold on to those symbols. But even they, the
sermon is almost invariably a moral discourse, telling you how to live and telling God what to do.
Prayer has become, we tell God what God should do. Where is the really God? We've lost religion.
So in an effort to sort of recover that word, I would say, now, what we miss is religion,
not spirituality. We need religion. And I say this, I mean, I don't have the past you've had,
John. So I don't have that trauma or that code. So I speak more freely about it.
But notice that what I mean by religion is not what religion has de facto become,
because of the way it was institutionalized for power reasons, but what the word originally meant,
what the Latin word originally meant. And I think we are in a tremendous lack of that
in the West. And I think that has a lot to do with the meaning crisis. Because if you are relinked
with that trans-conceptual source, your relationship with yourself and reality
is immediately influenced and transformed by that link. If you open that valve again,
it's a non-conceptual thing. It's not something that you can put in words and explain rationally
in a closed system. You can't do that. But it's life changing, which conceptual systems are not.
And because we have such a long history of Christianity in the West, because that's sort
of built into, and I'll be a Jungian now, it's sort of built into the collective unconscious now.
I think the shortest path back to transcendence, back to that relegare with the meaning,
is through Christianity. But it has to be a Christianity of liturgy, not a Christianity
of morals and beliefs and judgments. Nobody is going to go to Sunday Mass to be judged.
To be told everything you're doing wrong. And to hit the chest and say,
mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa three times. As Jung said, myths are living things. They have to
constantly be reinterpreted. They have to grow. And there are many departure points in Christianity
for a sort of refreshing of the Christian myth. So many. I mean, Jung pointed out one that was
very recent to him. He died in 61. And this point of departure was 1950. Pius, the 16th
elevation of the Virgin Mary, to the mother of God, she was elevated to the position of
sort of the fourth member of the Trinity, so to say. And that brings in the feminine aspect.
That's something to, there's something to be said about that. There is a new departure point.
What happened to Job? What God is that, that is so unreflective, that does what he did to Job?
What does he tell us about the divinity, about mind at large, whatever you want to call it,
about the, what is that reflectiveness? And what is our role as reflective beings
towards God? What is, what are we supposed to do for the divinity as opposed to keep telling the
divinity what to do for us? Now, I mean, that's another departure point. How do we help God?
What is the meaning of our life in helping that which is transcendent to get to somewhere it
apparently is desperate to get to? These are all points of departure to refresh the myth and,
and turn it plausible, because a myth, although it's never literal, it has to be vaguely plausible
in order to pass through the filter of the intellect and Christianity, because it has been
frozen for 2000 years deliberately since Constantine. It, it doesn't refresh itself.
This is policy in the Vatican. And if you talk to the authorities, to the powers that be in the
Vatican, it is their policy that it's the, the reliability of the tradition that makes Christianity
unique. That's their point of view. But the consequence of that is that you ossify the myth.
You don't let it evolve and maintain its plausibility, maintain its life, maintain its relevance
to everyday life as a symbol pointing somewhere. It has become so implausible, so ossified,
that it then turned into judgment, morals, beliefs and dogmas. And nobody goes to church for that.
Nobody in their sane mind will go to church for, for being judged against ossified moral codes
arbitrarily defined by a selective read of the scripture, because you can read scripture in a
way that justifies nearly anything. You just choose the book you read and you can basically go
anywhere. Read the apocalypse and have a sense about the sumum bonum. Let's have a look whether
it's really pure goodness when you read that book. And it was not for nothing that it was the most
polemical book to be inserted in the Bible. So I, I, to be honest, I sort of despair a little bit
about the end of religion. I think we need religion desperately. What we don't need is a moral code,
judgment and a set of ossified beliefs. We need something dynamic that has life in it,
that's not only outside, but sort of courses through us and informs our relationship
with ourselves and with that which is transcendent and imminent in the world, that which is beyond
Aristotelian logic, beyond language, beyond conceptual schemes. So I think that was a beautiful
point. There's really gar and religio, they're both contenders for the etymology, but they converge
on the idea of binding back or binding together. And so I just wanted to make it clear that there
isn't a conflict in that I tend to use the term religio as opposed to really gar, but they converge
anyway. So that's not a big issue. The, I was trying to capture that with, I think,
with the notion of the religion that's not religion, because I think religion has, has come to mean,
you know, the set of beliefs, the judgment, and, and, and worship is understood, understood as
acquiescence in some sort of supernatural authority, etc. Basically, all the things you
were saying have ossified. I think that is, and I try to trace out, there's a long, there's a long
history of how we got to that point where religion has come to mean that. So it's what I'm talking
about is not religion in that sense, but it's religion. Yeah, right, right. It's in the liturgy
for me, right? The liturgy is, you know, what I call, I talk about as an ecology of practices,
a whole bunch of practices that are like an ecology. They counterbalance, they, they coordinate,
they constrain and afford each other to intervene in our psyche in a dynamical and parallel fashion.
Because, you know, one of the great lessons we've learned from both pedagogy and from therapy is
one shot interventions into humans don't work, because they're so complex, self-adaptive,
that the system will just re-adapt. And so you have, and this is the, I think, the great insight
of Buddhism with the Eightfold Path. No, no, no, what you have to do, and it's the reason
that it's represented by a wheel with shared spokes, there's a deep symbolism there. It's a
self-rolling, it's a, right, it's a self-organizing thing. And what you want is you want an ecology
of practices that is as dynamically self-organizing as the thing that it's being applied to,
so that you have a shot, a hope of actually transforming that really complex, recursive,
multi-layered dynamical system that a human being is. So what I'm doing is I'm trying to really
expand the notion of what you meant by the liturgy, a liturgical, there's a set of practices,
and most of the symbols, here's why I use Corbin's notion, are not imaginary, they're
imaginal. They're not pictures in our mind, they're ways in which we enact and seriously play with
the world. Just so readers, sorry, not readers, listeners get a distinction. When the imaginary
is when I say picture a sailboat in your mind, that's different from when a child picks up a stick
and starts walking in a certain way and pretends that they're a Roman centurion.
Exactly. They're not forming a picture in their mind, what they're doing is they're adopting a
certain way of configuring their agency and a certain way of seeing the world so that they can
train skills. Why do mammals seriously play? Because that is the primary place in which we
undergo development. And so what I think what religions are often doing at the level of ritual,
when they're creating a quality of practices, is they're doing sort of sort of
imaginatively augmented reality. You know what augmented reality is when you project
virtual reality onto reality in order to see things like a heads-up display for a
depth pilot or something like that. I think religions do that. And I mean this as a cognitive
scientific proposal. They do imaginal enactment so that they can do imaginal augmentation of
reality so that they can like the child go through serious, we can go through serious
both individually and collectively, and I think that's important, development.
And again, I think this is part of the Frommian critique. Religion has degenerated into the
having of dogma rather than the developing of wise, virtuous people. And they've confused that
project, I agree with you, Bernardo, with moral, you know, moral pronouncements. It's like no, no,
no, ho, telling me over and over again that something is wrong. That's like telling somebody
in therapy. You don't want to do that anymore. Stop it. Stop it. Exactly. That's not therapy.
That doesn't help anybody, right? Stop thinking these thoughts. Yeah, stop doing that.
Right. And so what I meant by religion by religion is trying to get all of that,
you know, let me, the metaphor, all of that machinery of an ecology of practices and
magically augmented serious play, right,
honed in something that is free from all of the dichotomies that strike back to the
actual revolution, all the dualisms that I think not only cut us off from each other,
but cut us off from the world and even from ourselves and in a way that is also simultaneously
responsive to the fact that many of the mythological forms of the dualism have been
undermined by the advancement of science, right? We had the Copernican revolution and then we had
Darwin. We are being re-embedded. We are no longer pilgrims from a supernatural realm. That's no
longer a viable, and I mean it in James's sense, that's not viable for us. Now you can pretend
all that science doesn't exist. And that's just, to my mind, spiritual bypassing. And I think that
will translate into spiritual bypassing in the rest of your life. And I grew up with people that
did that and the claims of certainty that just put the lie to, had the lie put to them by the
anxiety-riven nature of their lives. It's like, ah, right? We need to somehow come up, and this is
why I'm, this is part of what I'm talking to you, right? We need to come up with a worldview,
and I want to use this next word very carefully, that properly homes our ecology of practices
and our enacted, imaginal augmentations of individual social and ontological reality
in a way that properly homes them, that validates them, that gives them, as you said, that we can
reliably point to, there's a wise exemplar, right? There's a path that seems reasonable.
And like you said, it doesn't have to be any kind of equivalent to a scientific, the scientific
theory. But I agree with you, if it doesn't pass the prima facie filter of plausibility,
people are going to be, again, cut into this horrible dualistic dichotomy against themselves,
and therefore they're not going to get the inner peace, the religio within and without
that they are seeking. 100% agree. Thank you both. Honestly, thank you so much.
It's a pleasure for me. I'm honored to have you both on, and the audience, if you could see the
live chat, the audience, the audience is overwhelmingly positive. I don't see a single negative comment.
Thank you. And where can the audience find out more about you? John and then Bernardo.
John, where can the audience find out more about you?
Oh, sorry, I was just trying to take a look at the live. I mean, the best place to get
to what I think is my apex or most important project is awakening from the meeting crisis.
And there'll be links to that. I think if you took seriously what I just said about
the exemplification of theologos, I also have an ongoing series called Voices with
Reveki, where I try to do this with people. And then if you want to see the attempt to
integrate theologos with cognitive science directed towards a lot of these issues,
I have two series out there, one complete called Untangling the World Not, that I unfold
dialogically with Greg Enriquez, and then a current one, which is on the nature of consciousness.
And so it's relevant to this discussion, the both of these discussions. And then there's one
that's being released right now called the Elusive Eye, Capital Eye, with Greg Enriquez
and Christopher Mastro Pietro. Again, a dialogical presentation of the cognitive science and the
psychology and the existential philosophy around this thing we invoke so much, and we know so
little about, which is the self. Well, what is a self? What kind of entity is it? And
how should we properly know thyself? He doesn't really mean your autobiography.
He means know what kind of thing a self is. And that's why he often calls it also being a mortal,
a mortal, by the way. So that's how people can reach me. If you want to know my academic work,
just go on Google Scholar and put in my name and you'll get the stuff I published.
If you're interested in the meaning crisis and mythology interacting, I also have a book
free online called Zombies in Western Culture, A 21st Century Crisis, which is how the zombie
mythology, as Lou said, is the mythology of our time, because we argue that it's the mythology.
I did it with Chris Mastro Pietro and Philip Misovic. It's the mythology by which the culture is
expressing, not resolving, but expressing the meaning crisis right now.
Bernardo, where can they find out more about you? And what are you working on next?
I'm working for Essentia Foundation now, which is sort of a new platform in which I'm basically
working to promote other people's work, not my own, but in this direction of a ontology of idealism,
some form of objective idealism. That's what I would point people to go to EssentiaFoundation.org.
Bernardo, I hope that there's an opportunity for you and I to hang out in person at some point in the
future. I would enjoy that greatly. I'd really enjoy that as well, and talk about our favorite
philosophers, because you dropped a few names then and was like, oh, I was itchy to talk with you
about you can go on and a few others. Okay, have a great night, both of you. Oh, and for the people
watching, if you would like to see more conversations like this, please do consider going to patreon.com
slash Kurt Jaimungal. Every dollar helps. And there are many other theologutions I'd like to
have. So for example, what's coming up is Yosha Bach, Kastar mentioned him, Yosha Bach and Donald
Hoffman. That's in the end of August. And at some point for John, I would like to get you and
I don't know if I can announce it because we're still working on it, but a special person.
Okay, what did it say? Three hours and 40?
Four hours, two minutes, 49 seconds for me. I don't know. I've got six, nine, six, three,
six, three, five. Oh, that's fine. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about that. Okay. Okay. Thank
you. Thank you, Bernardo. Thanks for doing this, Kurt. Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Kurt.
Thank you for staying up, Bernardo. I know it's probably 10 p.m. there. 10 o'clock. I have to
have dinner. Yeah, go eat, go eat. I'm going to email you, Bernardo, and ask you some advice as to
how I should speak to Rupert Spira, because apparently it's a different mode. To speak to
him, you mentioned that he's not interested in analytical conversation, so I'm going to email you
and ask you about that as well. But contrary to a lot of the other spiritual teachers,
he can engage with it, but he would try to have you have the insights directly,
as opposed to telling you what the insight is. Great. I'm looking forward to it.
Thank you. Thank you a lot. John, many thanks. Appreciate it again.
You too, Bernardo. Wonderful that I met what I said. I hope at some point we can hang it
together in person. That'd be wonderful. It shall happen. It shall happen. I see it happening.
Good. Bye-bye. All right, guys. Take care. Bye. Bye-bye.
Just a second. It's not over. There's a bonus section of audience questions.
Could you ask about the paradox inherent in the trying not to do? In some states of being,
you might be tone deaf. I feel sometimes force is needed.
I think the person is referring to Slingerlin's phrase, trying not to try,
which is not the same thing as trying not to do. There's a very important distinction there.
The idea is, let me give you the example of, I'm going to go into the flow state right now.
There we go. No, no, no. That doesn't mean you can just sit here and wait for the flow state to
happen. What do you have to do? You have to cultivate the finesse of learning how to get
into the right relationship, and that means also attitudinal and sensibility, so that there's a real
possibility that flow will take shape. This is why I try to use the notion of participation.
Repeatedly, and I understand, when you're sparring with people, you're trying not to force it.
You're trying to actually flow with the person. One of the best things if you're sparring with
the person is to compliment them. That was a really good block, because what they then do
is they monitor their blocking, and then they lose flow. I get what you're saying,
the point about, sometimes you need force. There's this notion in Tai Chi Chuan of Pung,
which is, I want to hold my arm as if water was flowing through it. It's not rigid like this,
and it's not limp like that. It's like water's flowing through it, because what that does is
it coordinates all the small muscles and the large muscles, and brain-body coordination,
so that I can flow any inertial force through it very, very effectively. By the way, you enhance
that through imaginal augmentation. Actually, practice imagining having water flow through your
hand, and then having somebody press on your arm, and know the difference between resisting it with
force and resisting it with flow, because there's a real felt difference, and there's a difference
in the functionality. I hope I'm trying to be open. I'm trying to be responsible. Sometimes
you have to just keep going, and I get that. But what I want to say is, one of the things,
you have to give up the notion even of keep going as a willpower. One of the most
disconfirmed notions in empirical psychology is the notion of willpower. It was actually
seriously proposed by Bowen Weister. There's mental energy that we ego depletion
that we have at reserve to just push ourselves through things, and then it turned out that
there's been just massive failures to replicate that. It doesn't look like that's the case.
What seems to be the case is what you want to do is develop a capacity to get more flexibility
in your framing of situations, so options open up to you. That's the effort. The effort is in
making yourself more flexible and responsive, more liable to catch the flow, and the more
frequently you do that, the more frequently you will do it. That's the way you sort of persist.
I'm sorry. I'm trying to speak almost as I would within a Taichi-Chuan instruction,
but it's very predictive of people who are trying to deal with... I will just do...
It's predictive that those people will fail, that they will fall into recidivism.
Let me give you an example. I'm going to lose weight. My willpower, you'll fail.
I've lost 20 pounds on this diet. Within five years, you'll be back to where you were.
95%. I'm really confident in that prediction. What is one of the things that tends to put
people in the 5%? Joining a group of people who are also trying to lose weight.
That is a much more powerful predictor than you. I'm not trying to insult anybody. I was
insulting myself there because I remember doing that kind of thing. You have to persist sometimes,
but try to think of the persistence as flexibility and finesse and putting yourself into right
relationship with others as a way of keeping you going, rather than you being like Sisyphus,
pushing the rock up the hill. That's how you try to answer that question.
Okay, Bernardo, I'll repeat the question. By the way, it wasn't Queer Doe. It was Mr. Chocolate
Cookie. I can't add to what John has just said. All right. Queer Doe. Now, this is actually
Queer Doe's question. Is the move toward veganism in our society an example of shedding of spiritual
bypass of thinking humans are special and supreme? Bernardo.
Look, I think if we are to have a viable civilization consuming a lot less meat and a lot
more vegetables is an indispensable element of the way out. And there are million reasons for this.
Agriculture of animals is extremely inefficient. You need a whole lot of water,
a whole lot of space. So it's a very inefficient way to produce proteins and calories.
It's a planet racking way of doing that, not to mention the incredible amount of suffering
that is inflicted on higher animals with complete nervous systems, because we treat them as products.
So I think the consumption of meat we engage in today is preposterous. It's outrageous,
morally. It's an affront to our responsibility towards future generations. And it is literally
carcinogenic towards us. It's also unhealthy. It's an endowment of a addiction that we do not
want to give up. So I think something in the direction of veganism is indispensable. But
can you remind me of the context of the question again? That's not what we actually are.
Sure. Yeah, sure. And just as an aside, there's a great video by this YouTuber called What I've
Learned that demonstrates that much of the environmental claims against meat eating has
been debunked. And I'll send you that after because it's surprising. So is the move toward
veganism in our society an example of shedding of spiritual bypass of thinking humans are special
and supreme? No, I don't think so. I don't even see, I don't even quite see the motivation for the
question. I don't think reducing the amount of meat we consume is a sign of any spiritual
transformation. I think it's a sign of reason, good, old, plain reason. If you want to do something
good to yourself, the others, animals on the planet, you will consume less meat. It's as clear cut
but now and unavoidable as that, I think. John, do you have any thoughts to add to that?
Well, I'd like to see the debunking video. I expect I will have a lot of critical responses to it
because I think the biomechanics of how much, how many people you can feed with wheat versus how
many people you can feed with the cows that you fed the wheat to is just like the cow has to use
most of that energy to be a cow. So I'm not clear how you can get out. That seems to me just to be
a rock bottom, you know, a bioeconomic fact that you're not going to be able to debunk.
I can briefly say one of them is that most of the land that cows are on or the land that
food cannot be grown on anyway. And much of the time when they talk about the water that's used
for a pound of meat, that's rainwater, which would have come onto that land anyway. And so
there's many other, there's many ways that the statistics that we know about that are alarming
with regard to meat production, speaking purely of rumen and animals that has been debunked or at
least highly contested. And I didn't know about this until just a month ago. Now that doesn't,
at all, cover the suffering of the animals, which to me is the main point. I don't like
how they're treated. I can speak from a personal experience. We have a vegetable garden here at
home. The main patch is about 35 square meters. We have different patches, but the main patch
is 35 square meters. And every year, we produce a lot more vegetables than we can eat. I am my
girlfriend and we distribute to our neighbors. We are well known for this. Around July, the food
distribution begins here. Now in that same space, I perhaps could keep three chickens and eat their
eggs. There's no comparison. When it comes to pound for pound, what they can use that space for
to produce vegetables is just incomparable to the equivalent using a lower animal. I certainly
could not have a cow in that space. The difference would be that you wouldn't be growing a cow or
a sheep or a chicken in that place where you could grow vegetables, but instead to do both.
But I'll send you the video. Well, but you know, look at Brazil. Where are they growing cows? Where
there was a virgin rainforest before? So to claim that that space cannot be used for anything else
is a self-affirming question. It's the idea that it's sort of unproductive.
Because it's just laying there and we're not growing wheat on it. We couldn't grow wheat on it.
That's to fail to see the whole intricate way in which the ecology works that supports the areas
of land upon which we grow the wheat. That's just a very atomistic appraisal. Anyways, we're
arguing in absentia. We need to see the video. And you know, Bernardo and I both, we have our
knives out and we should stop. I do want to respond to the other part of the question.
Sure. If I could be allowed. I agree with Bernardo. I think you can make a completely
justifiable justification of veganism in some way along that. I mean, I try to find the
intersection point. And I'm not saying that I'm right. I'm saying this is what has worked for me
between the moral arguments and these kinds of ecological argument. So I don't eat mammals.
I don't eat octopus because they have the complex nervous systems. They probably have
the metacognition and the fluid intelligence that is similar enough to mine that they,
in some, I don't mean metacognitively, but they value their existence in a way that's comparable
to mine. And the mammals tend to be the most egregious for the socioeconomic
and ecological, you know, and there's also the methane issues around the cows and stuff like that.
So I think you can make that, you can make that move totally that way. And I agree with Bernardo.
I think a lot of people do make the move that way. I do think it's possible that there are people who
also take up veganism as a transformative practice in which they are trying to get
out of an anthropocentric way of being. I have interacted with those people. I agree with Bernardo.
I do not think that that is a requirement in order to be a vegan. But do I think it's possible that
people take it up as, you know, something, and I don't mean an insult either way,
something analogous to kosher. Human beings have traditionally managed their diet as a way
of bringing around fundamental transformations. And one of the transformations that I think does
need to be, you know, realized today is getting out of a kind of, you know, unquestioned,
anthropocentric worldview. And veganism, I know individuals in which they live veganism,
I think that's the right verb. They live veganism as a way of trying to do something,
in that sense, religious, for the transformation of kind of, you know, a fundamental transformation
of their cognitive culture of grammar. They want to get out of an anthropocentric way of being.
And I think if people are doing it, I think that's also justifiable. I think that's a justifiable
reason for taking up veganism. And I would think of that as a, I think you could make a good case,
I'm trying to, that that's a religious act, as opposed to an act of socioeconomic or moral prudence.
I don't know if we're not going to sustain anything about that. But that's, I can, I can
see where you're coming from. I'm not sure I agree. But I can clearly see, just to give you some
background for why I said, I'm not sure I agree. I think the productization of life is a very
serious problem. But if you look at ancient cultures, they would kill a bison and eat the bison.
That could also be a form of religious expression if you respect the animal you killed, as a
sacrifice to give you sustenance. So I think historically, you know, Abraham was asked to
kill his son. The idea of sacrifice has been embedded historically as far as we can go. So I
wouldn't, my tendency is not to make anything fundamental about meat at a religious level.
What I think is fundamentally wrong is the productization of life. That I think is on a front.
It's, it's a disaster that we should never have allowed to start. But now we've allowed it not
only to start but to develop and to become addicted to it. Yeah, I see that. I think, you know, the
product, I think you call it the purification of life, the commoditization of everything.
I think that's part of the Frommian modal confusion.
I don't know if you disagree. I think there is something to speak about killing what you're
going to eat. I think it has become. And also the reverse, eating what you kill.
And eating what you kill. Exactly. It has become too easy to go to the supermarket and buy a slice
of beef and think of it as a steak, not as the muscle, bloody muscle of a leaving breathing
creature that had a high level, a nervous system. I think there is something to be said to the idea
that if you want to eat meat, one, you have to pay the integral cost. And the integral cost is
many, many, many times higher than what we are paying today. And two, if you really want it,
then kill what you're going to eat. Because killing is something that ties you up to that
life you've taken forever, for all eternity. And there is a form of respect, a form of
anti banalization when you are forced to kill what you're going to eat. And in the old times,
in the old times, like 100 years ago, you know, Europe of the 1920s, grandma would go, you know,
to the chicken pan, take a chicken and kill the chicken. And that process would be witnessed by
the kids or kill a pig. Have you ever seen a pig being killed? It's a very, very noisy, very bloody,
very long drawn out affair. I think if you were forced to have to pay that price for your sustenance,
I think it's valid, in principle, to take a life, a hunter taking a life to sustain his family.
Because it forces you a level of respect, it forces you an awareness of the cost
for that life of being robbed of it, for sustaining yours, that I think makes the whole thing
harmonious. Again, nature is not all a sea of roses. Nature entails enormous sacrifices.
The problem is that we get the benefit and we hide the sacrifice away from ourselves.
And that is what I think is dysfunctional. And we cannot feed seven and a half billion people
with meat in a way that would do justice to what I'm saying. You cannot have seven and a half
billion people go hunt wild boar. There aren't enough wild places and wild boars around.
So I think because we have become so many, the only way, the only decent way out of it
is something very close to veganism. Perhaps we can allow ourselves the luxury of meat now and then
if we pay the actual price of it instead of this fictitious price we pay today,
which is not the integral price of meat. That was very good.
Last question is from David. What did you guys enjoy most about this conversation?
Conversing, being in the presence of John and being in this dance.
The appreciating, the real capacity to appreciate both in the sense of
understand value and the increase in value, we use appreciate to mean all of those,
to appreciate the dance of the logos as an inherently valuable aesthetic
independent from the victory of the debate. I really enjoy that. I genuinely enjoy that with
Bernardo. I share it completely. Yeah. And for me, it's like sparring in martial arts.
The asshole is the person who when sparring tries to knock you out all the time because it's like,
no, no, no. That's not what we're doing here. We're trying to help each other get better at
something. And you get into the flow state when that happens and that's wonderful for both people.
The other person grows and you grow through each other and all of that has so much value.
And I think the value of that has been lost by the adversarial zero sum game
model of debate and discourse that now is pervasive in our culture. And so
while I appreciate it and I do a lot of the content, the opportunity to exemplify the joy
of participating in the flow of the dance of the logos, that's really important to me.
Exemplifying it more and more to people. Right now to my mind, I'm not saying this will go for
all of eternity, but right now to my, we can't get enough of that right now. We can't get enough
of the, you know, aesthetically pleasing. This is Plato and me making it beautiful,
the aesthetically pleasing presentation of the dance of the logos. We can't get enough of that
right now. We need more and more of it all the time. So I, I thank you, Kurt, for, for affording
this and making it possible. And lastly, before we recorded the podcast, I was feeling extremely
nervous. And so I asked John, who is an expert meditator for some advice after this, I'm including
an extra bit, which happened directly before we went live, particularly because people have
already commented that this isn't a live stream. This is a love stream. And I thought you might get
a kick out of seeing the interactions between John and Bernardo. John, you may need to help me out
right now for one minute with some breathing exercises to calm me down. Can you take me through?
I'm honest for 30 seconds. Okay, so close your eyes. And what I want you to do is move forward a
little bit so you feel off center forward and then a little bit back. So you feel off center
backwards. Now keep going back and forth slowly, a little less each time, slowly zeroing in where
you feel centered front to back. Once you feel centered back and forth, now do the same thing
side to side, move to your left, then to your right. Again, a little less each time until you zero in
where you feel centered side to side.
Okay, now repeat the same thing with your head.
Back and forth side to side.
Now when you feel centered, just feel as everything's dropping down into your lower belly.
Okay.
Thank you, my friend. You're welcome, my friend. Critique was that, well, there are two critiques.
One was from people who are unfamiliar with you, John. They're more Bernardo fans that are like,
look at John getting all worked up. That's fine. And another, I personally like that. I think that's
what made it engaging. And the number two is, yeah, exactly. I hope that, I mean, I aspire that even
if I get passionate or worked up, I've never in any way insulting or disrespect. No, nowhere near.
Oh, no, you can get a lot harder than that. Okay, I come from the corporate world 20 years. I mean,
my skin is thicker than a crocodile. It's no problem. Yeah, it's important. I get that. I also
feel affection for you, Bernardo. So do I, John. Yeah, so I want to make sure that's conveyed as
well. But you don't need to pay special attention to it or walk on eggshells. No, just be yourself.
It's fine.
