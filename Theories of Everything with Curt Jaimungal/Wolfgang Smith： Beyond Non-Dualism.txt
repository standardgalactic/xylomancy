The Vedic Union with God and the Christian Union with God are totally different and in
fact in a sense the opposite, with this knowledge comes power.
In this conversation we cover interpretations of quantum mechanics, the distinction between
corporeal and physical reality, vertical causation and irreducible wholeness.
Wolfgang Smith is a mathematician, a physicist and a philosopher of science who draws heavily
from pre-modern ontology.
He obtained his bachelors in Columbia in physics, mathematics and philosophy simultaneously
by the time he was 18, now that's unheard of.
Wolfgang was a mathematics professor at UCLA as well as MIT, publishing research in the
field of differential geometry, then he worked as an aerodynamicist at Bell Aircraft Corporation
on the problem of atmospheric re-entry.
As usual with Toad this guest goes their deepest out of any interview out there their most
technical and it should be that way because Wolfgang and I spent several days together.
In February and it was an absolute treat.
We recorded so much material with this living legend and I'm extremely honored and excited
that I get to bring this to you while I share this with you.
Enjoy.
It's good to meet you professor.
Yes, I've been looking forward to that.
I've been looking forward to this for quite some time.
So have I.
I'm going to begin by reading a poem.
If all the good people were clever and all the clever people were good, the world would
be nicer than ever we thought it possibly could.
But somehow to sell them or never, the two hit it off as they should.
The good are so harsh to the clever, the clever so rude to the good.
So friends, let it be our endeavor to make each by each understood.
Or few can be good like the clever or clever so well as the good.
I like that.
Why do you like that?
First of all, I don't remember that this has ever been said.
And I think it needs to be said.
What about that?
Do you feel like applies to our age?
I think it applies really to every age.
Be more so to our age because our age is in very great need of wisdom.
We have all sorts of things, but wisdom we are generally lacking.
I hear this plenty that we were wiser in the past than we are now.
Is that true?
Firstly, can you define wisdom?
Well, I'm not sure that I can define it, but I can point out a fact about wisdom which
we tend to forget nowadays, namely that wisdom is closely related to tradition.
It is not something we invent.
It is something we receive.
And this is something which I think is largely forgotten.
In fact, we bring up our young people to believe that everything just started a little while
ago and that we are essentially inventing wisdom.
I don't think wisdom is to be invented, it is to be received.
What do you mean that people are brought up to feel like this was all started some recent
time ago?
What do you mean?
I think the typical man of today thinks of wisdom and knowledge and enlightenment as
something that came about rather recently.
He associates it with our science, our technology, our modern outlook and I strongly disagree
with that and I think one of the main points I have to make is that wisdom is something
that actually is not invented, it is received.
And I think it is very, very important to realize that it cannot be received unless we bring
a certain humility and in fact, as I like to say, we need to approach this with folded
hands.
I'm not sure that everyone today understands what I mean by that, but I think most people
do.
You mean to say that most people nowadays think that proper morality came about from
the enlightenment and prior to that we were backward and religious and irrational?
I don't know what percentage of people today believe that, but I know one thing that practically
all our educational systems are geared to that message.
Many people no doubt are wise enough not to pay that much attention to it, to what our
schools and universities transmit in that regard, but this is indeed the thrust of modern
education.
Start from scratch, science is the key to everything and in this regard it all started
in the 20th century, if you will, with the discoveries of quantum mechanics.
Can you tell us about how you got started in physics as well as started in philosophy?
Well it clearly began at the age of 14, somehow I got a hold, a very important book by Whitehead,
Alfred North Whitehead, Science in the Modern World and I read this book with great interest
and so much so that I became absorbed in it and I remember there were times when my mother
called me down for dinner and I would say I can't come now, I'm thinking, so this is
an indication that it not only interested me but I felt somehow fascinated by these
questions and after reading a few popular science books I think for a while there I
was spellbound by what I would now call the scientific world view which made a lot of
sense to me at that time and I accepted it as a true outlook on the cosmos, but I wasn't
satisfied with this, I wanted to go deeper and so I applied to Cornell University when
I was just starting the age of 15 and I remember to this day that the application form asked
the question why, what do you want to major in and why and I said I answered that I want
to major in physics because I believe that physics is the key to the understanding of
the universe and so this shows that somehow interesting myself in physics is natural to
me, this is just how I'm constituted and so I entered Cornell University when I was 15
and I majored in physics, mathematics and philosophy and I think I was equally interested
in all three of these subjects I should say and in a sense they were three aspects of
the same enigma and let me say that it did not take long before I was terribly disappointed
in what I encountered at Cornell University, I was disappointed in the professors, I was
disappointed in what they taught me because somehow I felt that there was not enough seriousness,
it was specialization and I didn't feel at home with these people so by the time I graduated
from Cornell at age 18 I was very very disillusioned with the universities, somehow I had a conception
of wisdom which was something entirely different from the professionalism I found at Cornell
University and I should mention that when I graduated I was offered a three-year fellowship
in the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell so I could have gone on there for my PhD in
philosophy and in point of fact I accepted this and started out on a doctoral program
in philosophy and if you can imagine after three weeks I was so disappointed and felt
so out of harmony with the presiding spirit there that I went to the head of the philosophy
department and told him I have not yet touched any money I am quitting and he asked me what
am I going to do I said I am going to the state of Oregon to be a lumberjack and it
was on my way that after communicating this decision to my brother who was studying chemical
engineering at Purdue my brother took this letter to the chairman of the physics department
and said I have this young brother he is smart but he is a little crazy can you do anything
for him and so the professor of the head of the physics department who happened to come
from Austria my country he said tell your brother I want to see him Monday morning in my office
he is he's a graduate assistant in our department that's I'm offering him that so you see my attempt
to escape from the universities did not succeed I had scarcely cut my bridges as I thought then
against my will if you wish I was called back so I spent two years then at Cornell University
getting a master's degree in physics and I'm very glad that I did because this is as it turned
out this proved to be an important factor in my life I gave a I received a certain basic
background in contemporary physics so your initial bachelor's was math and philosophy and then
your master's was physics well actually I had a triple major at Cornell I majored in physics
mathematics and philosophy and I liked all three subjects very much what aspect of physics did you
do your master's in did you specialize it was in quantum theory what aspect of quantum theory
well this was way back in 1948 to 1950 these are the two years I spent at Cornell it was basic
quantum theory and incidentally we had very good professors because this was immediately after the
war and a lot of top professors from Europe came to the United States and at Purdue at that time
many of the senior professors were from Germany and in fact the head of the department his
name was Loc Horowitz he came from Vienna my own hometown so why don't you explain to the
audience and myself what is the measurement problem well the measurement problem is something very
very interesting as most people know I'm sure the world the physical universe as perceived in
quantum mechanics is something utterly different from the physical world as we normally know it
and think of it and so a physical system in the eyes of quantum mechanics is described by so-called
wave function so suppose you have the simplest system possible a single particle the wave
function description of that particle will give a certain probability that the particle is just
about anywhere in the universe it is not at any particular point in fact in reference to certain
experiments it can in fact multi-locate it can pass through two slits at the same time so in
in short the world as seen in quantum mechanics is something utterly different from the world
that we perceive in ordinary life and the world as described also in classical physics so the
transition between quantum mechanics and classical physics takes place in the act of measurement
and so you measure a quantum system and in a single instant the picture changes in place of a
multi-locating particle described by wave function which is highly mathematical and only really
trained mathematician can understand what this wave function actually has to say so in an instant
the picture changes from the quantum mechanical to the classical which means that after measurement
the particle has a definite position a definite momentum and so on after after measurement we
find ourselves to speak in the world that we normally know as a physical universe and so
what then is a measurement problem it is simply the question how does this miracle take place
and leading physicists have been thinking about this problem ever since quantum mechanics really
was discovered in 1926 to be exact but when it comes right down to it no one has given us the
answer I mean it remains an open question and so in 1995 I think it was I became interested in that
problem and I wanted to find a solution and after considerable thinking and research and reading
I put it all together and wrote the book called the quantum enigma and in this quantum enigma
I do propose a solution and the key idea there are really two key ideas the first key idea is
that we need to distinguish between the physical universe which is the universe as conceived
by the classical physicist and the what I call the corporeal world which is something much richer
the chief difficulty difference between the physical universe and the corporeal world
is basically that the corporeal world is perceivable which means that in addition to quantities
it owns qualities for example color so I postulate it that color is not just the
thing of the mind it is actually a quality pertaining to the corporeal world so the physical
universe then is the corporeal world as conceived by the physicists so in passing from the corporeal
world to the physical something is lost and I I realized this all I introduced the formalism
so with every corporeal object x I associate a physical object which I call sx and so there is
actually a kind of function from x to sx because x determines sx
so this was the first idea the distinction that between the corporeal world and the physical
and having made this decision this distinction you you still have a problem left how namely
does this transition take place because in in the act of measurement there is a passage from the physical
to the corporeal the the quantum system the wave function describes the physical
potential uh pertains to the physical universe and after the measurement is made
you are actually in the corporeal world because you couldn't have a measurement
if if the result of the measurement were not perceptible so you end up with a pointer
pointing to a certain location on a scale and you visibly read off the measurement so
measurement is a transition from the physical to the corporeal and it is quite easy to understand
rigorously that this transition cannot take place through the causation known to physics
so the causation known to physics is what I call horizontal causation and it is affected by a process
taking place in time on the other hand the transition from the physical to the corporeal plane
well it I just explained it cannot be understood on the basis of horizontal causation
so they cause a different mode of causation is required as this mode I call vertical causation
and it is easy to see on ontological grounds I mean we're here outside the the domain of physics
you can't write an equation for vertical causation you can't even talk of it as a physicist
without introducing some other notion so this is what I called vertical causation
and the defining characteristic of vertical causation is the fact that it does not take place in time
in other words it is instantaneous
I think it will be of interest to put in a little bit of a comment at this point
because many people know that the Nobel Prize in physics issued in 2022
dealt with a certain question relating to quantum theory on one side and relativity on the other
and one has known for quite a while that the two cannot both be true
now the Nobel Prize of 2022 was issued for I think three experiments
which actually were able to decide which of the two theories is true
and we know they can't both be true there's something called the bell inequalities and
quantum mechanics says the results will be on this side of an inequality
Einsteinian physics says the result will be on the other side of the inequality
so these experiments actually decided between the two issues and the winner was quantum theory
and now what does this have to do with vertical causation the answer is everything
because the the point at issue in these experiments and therefore in the Nobel Prize
was whether a physical effect can be transmitted
instantaneously in other words faster than the speed of light
relativity theory says no nothing can move faster than the speed of light
quantum mechanics says yes when you make a measurement on a particle
which is uh what's the word for you which is yeah which is entangled every every particle
entangled with this one will be instantly affected so there's a clear incompetent
incompatibility here between classical physics and uh and standard relativity on one side
and quantum theory on the other and so uh as I said quantum theory one and the implication is
that classical physics in its Einsteinian mode is uh contradicted very interesting that uh
I think this has to do with the fact that they waited such a very long time to issue that Nobel
Prize I think what more than 30 years waited and I think the reason is that this is a very hot potato
by saying that quantum theory one and relativity theory lost you're stepping on a lot of
tones it's a very sensitive matter but uh quantum theory did win and the Nobel Prize acknowledges that
and incidentally what does that have to do with vertical causation the answer again is
everything because of the it was really vertical causation that was at issue here
whether causality is a causality that acts instantaneously as quantum mechanics demands
over the heinstein was right that no causation can move faster than the speed of light so
vertical causality won ladies and gentlemen gather around for a lesson in the mathematics of slumber

henson shaving is a family owned aerospace parts manufacturer that's made parts for the
international space station and the mars rover and now they're bringing that precision engineering
to your shaving experience so here's a personal story i gave the razor to sam who's working behind
the scenes here at the tow podcast i didn't tell him who it was from i just said you need a razor
he said sure then i asked him hey how was that razor the next couple days later he's like kurt
that is the best razor i have ever used and then i said by the way that's a sponsor henson then he
said that is fantastic and he looked it up and they're an aerospace engineering company so that's
an aside story that's a true story it's packaged extremely carefully the handle looks beautiful
the assembly takes 10 seconds and the blade is as precise as i've ever seen in a commercial razor
by using aerospace grade c and c machines henson makes metal razors that extend less than the
thickness of a human hair that means it's a secure and stable blade with no vibrations so the razor
has built-in channels and it evacuates hair and cream which makes clogging virtually impossible
you blow it out and it's cleared that's what she said henson shaving wants to produce the best
razors not the best razor business so that means no plastics no subscriptions no proprietary blades
and no planned obsolescence and it's extremely affordable the henson razor works with the standard
dual-edge blades that give you that old-school shave with the benefits of this new school tech

quantum entanglement sure something is transmitted instantaneously but you can't use it to send
information and so special relativity says no information can be sent what do you say to that
well i i tend to think ontologically and ontologically there's no problem
according to quantum theory
there are effects which operate instantaneously
so from an ontological point of view this
settles the matter there's a clear contradiction here with relativity theory
so from a from this point of view from an ontological point of view
uh the matter is settled quantum theory is true at least in in on in this particular experiment
came out in favor of quantum theory there's no question about that and uh
heinstein was very very concerned about this point because he realized that the theory which
it was his life's work to develop hinges upon this the outcome of this experiment
and what is in a sense ironic it was einstein himself who first conceived the basic structure
of this experiment and he did so because he was hoping at least that this would empirically
vindicate his theory with a v quantum mechanics
so uh in connection with this uh result i would like to point out something which
is very closely related to what we're talking about here my own approach to philosophy
has always been instinctively Platonist i became interested in Platonism at a very early age
and i never really wavered in this regard something in me recognizes as the true ontology now
when you study Platonism very very carefully you discover that the Platonist
Weltanschau conceives of the cosmos as inherently tripartite the three planes if you want to
put it that way are firstly what i call the eternal plane which is a a domain
which is subject neither to space nor to time and this is really where reality comes from
reality emanates from that our domain and the second domain which i call the
the Platonist call it the psychic domain i call it the intermediary so the psychic domain
is subject to time but not to space and incidentally uh i am convinced that this is
integral Platonism but i've never in any Platonist or Neoplatonist document read
this interpretation i doubt not that all the real Platonists understood this very well
but that it is of interest that you for for whatever reason i don't think it has been
explicitly stated and then the third domain i call the corporeal this is the world in which
we normally find ourselves that domain is obviously subject to time but not to space
excuse me both time and space so uh this is the basic tripartite ontology associated with
Platonism now let me just mention for the record that i think many people will be interested to
know that this tripartite ontology is also found in the Vedic tradition which is by far the oldest
tradition in the world it anteced all others including the Judeo-Christian which came much later
so uh this tripartite ontology underlies
both the Vedic and the Platonist traditions
let me say first of all i find it very fascinating that the mere existence of this intermediary
level implies the falsity of relativistic physics it is it's it's absolutely clear and
beyond dispute because uh according to relativistic physics there is no time and there is no space
there is only a space time and the fact that there is a time only realm
uh obviously contradicts that assumption so um i was very fascinated to find to discover
that the both the Vedic and the Platonist ontology disproves all of relativistic physics at one stroke
incidentally regarding the uh intermediary or psychic realm let me point out
that even though nobody in the western world knows these things now because we are all into
the scientific quote-unquote scientific way of looking at things
uh so even though we don't know about it we spend a part of our life our conscious life in that
domain namely we enter that we are in that domain whenever we dream the dream state is
we enter the dream state uh when we dream the dream state is which one the intermediary
in the dreams there is no space in the the the space in the dream state is not real it's a kind
of a hallucination and you can easily prove that because whereas the time that we experience in
the dream state coincides with our temporal time i mean for example i think everyone has
experience being awakened in the middle of a dream and the point is the moment of awakening you
can identify in the dream uh so uh the time in the dream state is none other than the time of the
waiting state but the space that you experience in the dream state proves to be unreal in the
dream you may see a castle on three-dimensional thing and the instant you wake up you realize
that there never was such a thing meaning this belonged to the dream state but not to the corporeal
so there is a rigorous precise ontological distinction between the three states you may say
well what about the the eternal state it is true that we normally do not experience that we do not
experience it in the waking state we do not experience it in the dream state and this is
exactly where these uh yogic traditions uh enter the picture in other words to enter the eternal
state is not given to the ordinary human being it is something that can be acquired but at a great
cost as everyone that has any acquaintance with these domains knows very well it is after lifetime
of endeavor under the guidance of someone who has himself received that from a master
if you're lucky you can do that it's a great achievement and it turns out that this has not
only been always the chief gore as it were and the Vedic tradition but the same is true in the
Platonist and let me mention that this is something I did not know until very very recently when I
came across some writings by 18th century British Platonist known as Thomas Taylor
who for some unknowable reason strikes me as a perfect insider of the Platonist tradition
how that has come up how that is to be explained is totally beyond my comprehension
but I have no doubt that Thomas Taylor knows very well what he is talking about when he gives us
so to speak an inside view of the Platonist tradition and it turns out that the Platonist tradition
is identical to the Pythagorean in fact it comes from the Pythagorean if you will
later was a distant disciple of Pythagoras and now what we learned from Thomas Taylor is that
Pythagoras as a young man traveled to Egypt and actually became a disciple of an Egyptian master
and Thomas Taylor where he gets his information from I don't know undoubtedly there are sources
but what I recognize immediately is that from the description that Thomas Taylor gives us of the
life of these disciples when I read this I said to myself my god this is what I witnessed
when 50 years ago I traveled in India and lived amongst real sadhus that's how they live so
uh this explains the correspondence between the Pythagorean Platonist tradition on the one side
and the Vedic on the other in a sense they are the same tradition however there is a very decisive
feature of the Pythagorean Platonist tradition which suffice I know simply does not exist in the
Vedic what is that it is the role of geometry geometry in the hands of the Pythagoreans and
Platonists was an instrument which enabled the practicing yogi to ascend from the psychic to the
eternal plane and conceptually we can see how this is possible because geometry as a subject
studied in our schools for example pertains to the psychic realm it's the realm of of thought of
consciousness but the truth of geometry what uh what it really deals with pertains to the
eternal plane after all when you prove a serum you prove a serum and the serum is something
that is eternal uh and in fact geometry derives from the eternal plane because what we experience
if you will on the psychic realm uh comes from the eternal if if if there were not an eternal
geometry there could be no geometry as we understand it so the Greeks the Pythagoreans first of all
understood this very well and realized that because geometry does come from the eternal
and what it essentially asserts pertains to the eternal it can be used as an instrument to actually
ascend from the psychic level with this kind of having our discussion right now even though it
involves the corporeal actually takes place on the psychic there is no geometry running around
here on the corporeal plane we're talking about something at the psychic level and the crucial
point is and this is what the Pythagoreans and the Platonists understood so well the point is that
because geometry derives from the eternal realm it is in principle possible to use geometry
to ascend from the psychic to the so this is very easy to say but as I indicated a moment ago
the actual accomplishment of this is a lifetimes task and incidentally we're talking here
an authentic spiritual tradition is nothing that you can access on your own it entails discipleship
and this is vital I found in India when I was traveling there half a century ago
every 14 year old Brahmin boy would understand this very well it was simply known here in the west
it is almost totally unknown but the fact is if you want to ascend to the eternal plane
then you have to become a disciple of someone who was himself a disciple and incidentally
both in the Vedic tradition and in the Pythagorean Platonists it is well understood that this path
calls for lifelong celibacy so in India I noticed this every as I say every 14 year old Brahmin
boy understands if you want to ascend this path it will cost you lifelong celibacy and
the writings of Thomas Taylor confirm that such was the case in the Pythagorean tradition
and undoubtedly also in the Platonist incidentally what I have said so far
gives you the key to understanding a very mysterious inscription which reputedly
was inscribed over the portal of the Plato-Platonic Academy
in English it says that let no one ignorant of geometry enter here so we understand this now
in a different way because actually no one ignorant of geometry can enter here if entering means
to access the eternal plane so the modus operandi used in the Pythagorean Platonist tradition which
comes from the Egyptian differs from the Vedic in the sense that the means of access
were different of course they had the common elements of
celibacy and this incredible practice you know when I lived among sadhus in India about 50 years
ago I was amazed that these men spend a good 20 hours a day in other in other states in higher
states if you were to put a knife in their flesh while they are in these states there would be no
reaction because they're no longer in this body and so I also realized then when they did come to
normal consciousness I could talk with them and it was as you can imagine absolutely fascinating
to me to talk to someone who has just been somewhere that our wisest men in the contemporary
West know nothing about I mean we know nothing even about the intermediaries played go to Princeton
Institute for Advanced Studies I guarantee that there's not a single person there unless he happens
to have read the books that I have read knows about that and incidentally in India every just
about everyone knows about these things in fact these three states when you talk to an educated
Hindu in my day you could converse with him about the so-called Tripuvana I talked to people who were
businessmen and we could talk about the Tripuvana it was in their tradition Tripuvana is just a
Sanskrit word meaning three worlds so after this trip to India the first trip I realized how ignorant
we are in the West I mean we know a little piece of the world we don't even we don't even know
about the existence of the intermediary world which we actually enter just about every day
in the dream state and let me in this connection tell you something which illustrates what I'm
talking about here namely the fact that 50 years ago and probably doesn't exist anymore
but at that time there was this remarkable knowledge among even ordinary people in India
so when I on my first trip to India I I think I landed in New Delhi and
took a room in a hotel and that first evening I had some telephone conversations
and I was very very happy to learn that someone whom I had great admiration for
was going to arrive in New Delhi the next day by train at 11 o'clock so I was very very happy
about that and I just took a stroll in the city and went to Old Delhi and on my return
to the hotel I was accosted by I guess you could call him a fakir that means a person
who has a little bit of knowledge of yoga but not all that much and this fakir accosted me
out of the blue and says very lucky man so I he says oh yeah he said very lucky man
tomorrow at 11 o'clock something good will happen well no one in New Delhi besides myself
knew about this tomorrow 11 o'clock which is really something that elated me
and so I must have been thinking about it deeply so this fakir somehow picked that up
out of thin air well this fact of course interested me so I
went to a nearby garden with him to see what he can have to say and so he gave me a piece
of paper and he said look at it so I saw it was blank then he says please fold it and hold it in
your hand so I did so I held this paper and then he said all right now think of a number between
one and a hundred so I thought of a number I think it was 36 and then he says all right now open
your hand and look at the paper and on this paper was written 36 so I gave him something and
but on my way home to the hotel I brooded on this how what's going on and I think I figured it out
the fact that he he talked to me he accosted me in reference to something good that would happen
tomorrow at 11 o'clock this was clearly a case of telepathy I mean he was able to read my mind
so then what about the 36 that number well I eventually did figure that out too
there is something called invisible ink and so that number must have been written in invisible ink
and it became visible when I held this in my hands meanwhile he puts that number into my mind
so there were two for us supernatural powers that he had a to read someone else's mind
and B to put something into someone else's mind so here the first day in India I by chance encountered
the fuck here who had these two powers and he could demonstrate that to me now why do I speak
of fuck here well clearly these these are yogic powers and you cannot you cannot acquire them just
out of books absolutely not so this man had a guru he was a disciple of someone who was enough
over yogi to possess these two powers and therefore he could transmit it to his disciple
all of this doesn't come on the cheap on the cheap this fuck here must have spent maybe two
three years I don't know a certain period of time as a disciple subject to a very disciplined kind of
life to acquire these powers so why do we call him a fuck here which is a somewhat derogatory term
how do you spell that by the way F A T I R and if as I understand it a fuck here is someone who has
a certain knowledge of yoga not a very high law knowledge but a certain knowledge just the same
and who instead of going on I mean ideally yoga is given to us in order to go all the way
but there is a possibility that at at various stages you stop and utilize this knowledge
and it can be utilized in many ways you can become a millionaire if you play your cards right I mean
this knowledge is knowledge of a very unusual kind so the word fuck here as I understand it
refers to these yogis who instead of going on in a certain at a certain level use this half
knowledge that they have for pecuniary purposes that's all right but it was so interesting
my first day in India I learned things which here in the west hardly anyone knows as I said if
you were to go to the institute for advanced studies I don't think you would find anyone there
who has a ghost of an idea about these things and yes it's real and it's in a way science
it's a higher science than what we possess because our sciences actually our physical size
doesn't even reach up to the corporeal level this is why I had to introduce it I had to
distinguish between x and sx and that was one of the two keys to the resolution of the measurement
problem the reason the top physicists have not been able to solve that problem to this day
is that the the ontology of physics doesn't suffice if there were only
a physical domain and no corporeal domain which is higher than that there could be no measurement
so I think I have made the point in light of my contact with India that there are things between
heaven and earth that our sciences here in the west our contemporary sciences don't know anything
about well would you agree Brian with my point that these things are there in the quantum world
but in potency you need to understand quantum mechanics you do need the Aristotelian distinction
between potency and act and in fact Heisenberg understood this almost immediately when he said
that so-called quantum particles are not real particles they are potency they become real
particles precisely when they interact with a corporeal instrument and as I show in my latest
book on physics the point of it is that the reality comes from the corporeal level in other words
the reason quantum physics the reason quantum physics
deals with entities that in a sense do not exist is because classical physics
is sub corporeal you I mean this little entity is corporeal but when the physicist looks at it
it becomes physical in other words he sees it as a physical entity and as a physical entity
it still has being because the physical coaster receives its being from the corporeal
is the sx a subset of x or is it a different domain it's a different domain it's not a subset
it it is something uh you you might say it's a physicist's way of comprehending x
but the point that I'm making is that the reality comes from the corporeal it's the
complete opposite of what contemporary scientists tend to believe contemporary scientists tend to
believe that the reality that we encounter here on the corporeal level derives ultimately from
the particulate domain the domain of quantum theory but the actual fact of the matter is
just the opposite there's no intermediary here I have come to look upon physics from a rigorous
Platonist ontological standpoint and there it is very very simple or reality or being comes
from the eternal plane so iconically you have a circle with the center the center represents
the eternal plane the intermediary is is the interior and then the corporeal is the actual
circumference of that circle I sort of taught myself to think in terms of this icon
because if you do everything becomes very simple so all the reality whether in the corporeal world
or the physical uh derives from that center and now uh and how does it derive it through
vertical causation so how then is the reality of corporeal objects transmitted to the physical realm
well the physical realm breaks into two parts and this is absolutely essential you can't understand
physics without that you have to make the distinction between sub corporeal physics
which is the physics of entities which derive from the corporeal level so sub corporeal physics
deals with objects sx derived from a corporeal x and uh the crucial point here is that because
sub corporeal physics derives from the corporeal level it receives being
which is the same as irreducible wholeness
through vertical causation there's vertical causation from the corporeal level to the physical level
and that is why the physical level uh has a reality technically speaking it has being because
that being is transmitted from the corporeal to the physical level through vertical causation
so this is the story about classical physics now what about quantum mechanics well
quantum mechanics is the physics of the trans corporeal trans corporeal means
not sub corporeal do you describe that as tx so sx is classical physics yes classical physics
is a physics of physical systems sx derived from x but it in in quantum theory
strangest it obviously must be you are dealing with entities that are physical but not derived from
a corporeal entity now if you think about this and it's not quite that easy i mean these are
subtle subtle points because the the quantum world is not sub corporeal it does not have its
own intrinsic reality so this is why quantum theory is so weird this is why particles can
multi locate for example the answer is in plain terms that in itself quantum uh entities have no
reality have no being so how then can there be a classical physics a quantum a quantum physics
well the point is that the quantum realm does not exist all by itself
um there are it interacts with corporeal instruments in two ways first uh
in its definition a quantum theory is not just a mental thing it it has a certain reality
because by virtue of the instruments the corporeal instruments which define the physical system
so this already is one source which transmits reality to the none
none reality of the quantum world conceived in isolation from the corporeal
the second way in which reality is transmitted into the quantum world from the corporeal
is in the act of measurement and it is a great genius of uh heisenberg we are now heisenberg
he was the first one the first human being in history who got a glimpse of that
he said with reference to quantum theory that physics today is not
is not based upon a an outside reality but it is based upon an interplay
of the observer with the observed in other words the quantum world comes into existence
through the activity of the physicist where there are no uh corporeal uh objects acting as
instruments of measurement or excuse me i take this back we need to distinguish between the act of
defining a physical system and the act of measuring a physical system thus defined
these are two different acts but they are both acts which come from the from the uh
the activity of the scientist so the scientist gives rise to the quantum world through this
interplay between the corporeal and the trans corporeal which he actually initiates by
in two ways by defining the physical system which is done with corporeal instruments
and by measuring the physical system thus defined which is also done with physical instruments
so these are the two ways in which the physicist
creates if you will the trans corporeal world the trans corporeal world is not god made it's
man made it's not there until you a define the instruments uh set up the instruments which
define this physical system and be uh then it's there in a in a potential sense but that's not
enough it isn't fully there until you measure it and then you move from potency to act so there's x
there's sx there's the trans corporeal do you have a letter for that the trans corporeal is
it's misleading because the trans corporeal uh doesn't really exist until the physicist comes
into the picture because the trans corporeal is so to speak uh produced through the questions
that the physicist gives uh the physicist asked um i can quote the exact words of heisenberg
he says um that the the new physics is an interplay between the physicist and nature
it is it is not uh unless there is an interplay an interaction between the physicist
and his activity and nature there's no quantum there's no quantum world the quantum world
there's no trans corporeal quantum world because the trans corporeal quantum world
uh comes into play in this two-fold activity of the physicist
the first it defines a physical system and this is done through uh physical instruments
through well actually through corporeal instruments and having defined a physical system
the physicist is in a position to measure to make measurements on that physical system
and this is again done with uh corporeal instruments so it was heisenberg who had this
enormous insight right at the very beginning that uh with the advent of quantum theory
an entirely new physics has begun a physics in which the physicist is no longer the onlooker
but he is also if you will in a way the creator of what he measures it's a two-way street and uh
the way asa eddington expressed it he says the mathematics isn't there till we put it there
so it was first heisenberg then eddington soon thereafter both had the same vision of physics
and it was completely different from the classical in classical physics you postulate
that there is the nature is out there and you are merely the spectator of what is actually out there
and when you're dealing with large ensembles of of the quantum world this physics works fine
but when you come down to smaller units it breaks down and this is where this is
where in a sense the physicist himself creates what he measures so does this not apply to regular
people who aren't physicists well we're discussing physics so what is physics it's what physicists do
so the the big the big change from classical to quantum physics came about when
heisenberg recognized that when you are dealing with
what we now call quantum systems we're dealing with something that we ourselves have in a way
created so this is why uh heisenberg said that we now understand that the physicist is not simply
a spectator he is himself playing he's in a way creating the very things that he is unmeasuring
because there are these two distinguishable phases of physics there's first of all the phase
where you define a physical system which you do through corporeal instruments
and having defined it you then can measure it
and this is how classical physics how quantum physics comes about and the point is that
in in classical physics the system gains its reality through first through
being defined by corporeal instruments it's the corporeal instruments that define
what the physicist is measuring and then it is secondly again corporeal instruments
which actually measure the system that you have so so to speak created are our eyes a corporeal
instrument oh yes of course i mean i see your eyes i see the color of the pupil and there
so you don't mean to say you go into the lab and you set up a laser and then all of a sudden
quantum mechanics is created so is this an observer the table well there are really two tables
the table of quantum quantum physics which is simply the sx of of this x and then there are the
quantum tables so the sx was the classical yes that's that's classical so the difference
is that in quantum theory the physicist not only describes what is out there
but in a sense he creates what is out there as eddington said the mathematics isn't there
till we put it there we put that mathematics there and this is something that heisenberg just
understood as a metaphysician what what sets heisenberg apart from all other physicists of
renown is that he was the son of a classicist which means that heisenberg was highly schooled in
Plato and Aristotle and that gave him a new way of looking at things i don't know how many
other physicists have really followed heisenberg fully in this recognition and on account of this
new way of seeing what physics is he was able to recognize that the quantum world is ontologically
beneath the corporeal beneath the physical and the physical of course so there are really
three levels you've got the corporeal which is the sense perceived world then you have the world of
classical physics which is a sub corporeal in the sense that it deals with up with entities sx
derived from x so the classical physicists deals essentially with the corporeal world but he
is interested only at its quantitative aspect he he closes his eyes so to speak
to all the rest for example he's blind to color and the sad thing is that it's one thing to forget
about color when you put on your physics hat it's in fact necessary that's how physics originates
from that blindness what is sad is if you carry that blindness over to your normal life then you
become a materialist and in a sense you talk nonsense and not only do you talk nonsense
but you can't recognize that this is nonsense and this is more or less where the intellectual
elite of the western world stands now that they take the physical universe to be real
and the corporeal world is then what Descartes called the rest cogitans the thing of the mind
and this is what whitehead called bifurcation and he spent maybe 30 years of his life
going around to all the universities in europe and america trying to explain
to the people how how wrong this is how actually foolish but the strange thing is that very few
people got the message and in fact uh anyone who tries to explain to a physicist the idea of
bifurcation will to his disappointment learn that the likelihood is 99.9 that the physicist won't
understand a word he's saying because his bifurcationists and therefore spurious metaphysics
is so ingrained in the mind of a physicist and you know that's understandable because
you can't do physics until you bifurcate it is his bifurcation that in a sense creates
the physical universe and that's what the physicist is there to understand that's what he
thinks about morning noon at night until he regains a normal state of mind when again the
grass is green but while he's doing physics the grass is not green while while he's doing
physics he is bifurcationist he's a Cartesian and so he sees only a part of the world and incidentally
this is what makes the whole enterprise in a sense unwholesome because man was not put here on earth
to put on blinders and actually
shut off the better half of the world what the physicist casts out by his very his very modus
operandi is in fact the creme de la creme i mean the the world of color and sound and all these
innumerable things that poets think about i mean think about and artists paint this is all blocked
out as soon as you put on a physics hat this no longer exists and what what the tragedy is that
many physicists if not most after doing physics for a good length of time they forget that the
so-called physical universe is not is not the whole thing and so in a sense they are split in two
i mean the human part of the physicist is always there i mean we breathe and we feel pain and so on
i'd even feel love but uh officially we are democratian we know only atoms and the void
it's a terrible disease and it's a disease which can infect not not only individuals
it can infect the whole society and this is what i have been trying to express in all my writings
that we the modern contemporary west are a sick society this is not how man is is meant to be
we are not hitting on all cylinders in fact the higher side of our nature is as it were excluded
it has no rights it has no place in the in the public marketplace you won't learn about it in the
universities because the message is uh third we've picked up the most ancient heresy in the history
of the world the philosophy of democratus fifth century bc democratus said what was it the vulgar
think of of the of color the bitter and the sweet in reality they are only atoms and the void
it's amazing about 490 bc or something like that uh democratus came upon the scene and in
a few words he epitomized the philosophy which would dominate western civilization from the
17th century onwards so democratus was very soon followed by plato and plato completely
uh invalidated the democratian axiom so one can and all of antiquity followed in the footsteps of
plato in that regard which means that the well informed for 2000 years the well informed understood
very well that the doctrine of atoms and the void is untenable and so one can very well say that it
is the oldest heresy in the world and what we have done beginning with people like gallileo and
decart we have instituted the oldest heresy in the world as the basis of our intellectual culture
and we have done so with the vengeance because
the well done shown which gallileo and decart instituted which as i said is a revival of the
democratian and is us what might be called the the oldest heresy in the world has now been baptized
as an enlightenment so it's no wonder that we are in difficulty because i think we can all
agree that basically a certain wisdom is necessary for a good life and on a global
scale it's in fact necessary for survival you will not survive if your well done shown is upside down
and that it is so that's very simple that's all i have to say i'm going to ask you if you have
symbols for the eternal the psychic because you have x for an object in the corporeal so is it
a and is it p for the eternal then the psychic is p i just want to know about the symbology of it
like the symbols that you write down well the real symbology of it is what i call the cosmic icon
so this the circle which entails three elements the circle has the center the
interior and the boundary the circumference and so i really think that this idea of the circle
this iconic view of the circle is was known to the peterorian and platonists but so far as i know
there's no a literary evidence to that effect but that's how i think about you know since we are
tripartite corpus animus spiritus we also need to as it were understand things tripartite on a
tripartite way and so in order to understand these things that we're talking about here
the cosmic icon really need for me it needs to be there sort of in the background
when i talk for example about geometry elevating you from the psychic to the
to the eternal realm i i instinctively think of it in iconic terms so a certain visualization
is almost necessary for me and
so i think this is probably true for everyone since we are tripartite our thinking is also in
in a certain sense tripartite so the iconic iconic way of dealing with very abstract very
metaphysical things is natural because it is tripartite and we are tripartite so i'm always
skeptical of people who claim they they think just rationally i think an iconic dimension is
absolutely necessary and then it becomes real and then it has power otherwise if it is otherwise
it is in truth a cartesian risk cogitans and that doesn't amount to anything
the cart has done a tremendous harm to western civilization
by the fact that we have become cartesian in our way of and this idea of
the rest risk extensive extended entities in the so-called real world and everything else
the risk cogitans which we have degraded into a sort of a fantasy world you can see how this
opens the door to something absolutely dehumanizing because once you really become a believer
believer in this dichotomy of risk extensive and risk cogitans you you are
incorrigibly subhuman you can never again attain that human the human level unless you cast out
that idea and it's a tough thing to cast out once you've become enslaved by it
so this is why when you try to explain the idea of bifurcation to physicists they really don't get
it do you want to explain bifurcation to the audience right now yes well let me just finish this and we
can you know i'd like to ask you a question because i've wondered it but i don't know if it's
appropriate ask away judging by your name i thought that your ancestry goes back to india does it
oh okay good well then i'm glad i'm talking much about vady culture because that's what you carry
in your dna you also it's interesting you know that there is a certain parallel between your life
and mine because in my case yes i was born into a catholic family but i sort of forgot all about it
you know then came the war and uh we almost got killed in the process and so by the time
i settled in america i had forgotten all about my christianity and as i told you my mind became
engrossed in other other type of questions and it was during my college days that i became
not only acquainted with
often that i became not only acquainted with indian culture but
tremendously drawn to it yeah future tennis faggot okay we have uh
it's a great interest yeah that's right
so it became very drawn to it and i first you know if you read my book on physics i i
i relate that story
my first encounter with hindu tradition was through uh robindranath tagore
i read a very famous little book of his called gitanjali and that set me on fire
so uh the next for about 40 years of my life i lived in a vedic ambience
i traveled to india well the first time i traveled to india estate seven months
and i lived exclusively amongst the sadhus and uh i came back a different man i realized when
i was flying back uh i used to seven months because i was just finishing a stretch at mit
and starting a stretch at ucla so from the end of the winter semester to the beginning of the
fall semester i was free so i went to india and when i flew back to los angeles after seven
months of living amongst sadhus and witnessing things that are incredible i realized i'm not the
same man the man who is flying back is not the man that was flying over i had been permanently changed
and which is actually what what should happen when you open yourself to real sadhus to people who
have the experience of higher spheres you should be changed by that and uh so the the one thing i
brought with me to india great great reverence instinctively i i approached these sadhus with
folded hands and it's amazing if we were together longer many things stories i could tell you but
i invariably found that if you honor a sadhu just in your heart without any physical
evidence he knows it instantly and they always respond if you give something to a real sadhu
he will give you something back and what he gives you back is more valuable than all the golden
fort knocks so i experienced this again and again when i was in india and if there's anything good
in my life i don't think it could have come without that contact and then when i was about 40
years old i married a wonderful catholic woman and it's a sense she became my guru because
not that she ever lectured but by her mere presence she connected me reconnected me to christianity
my wife did the same for me is that wonderful i grew up christian and then i became an atheist
from when i was eight years old or so because i remember asking my brother who was a physicist
at the time how did the universe come about and he said it could have come from quantum fluctuations
that's how nothing comes from something or something comes from nothing and then i remember
sitting and thinking okay then that solves the last problem i had with the notion of god namely
how can anything be here so from that point forward i became an atheist and it wasn't until i met my
wife and just her sweetness her lovingness her endearedness i've never met someone that i felt
like i can't hurt them if i hurt them i would feel so horrible i like very much what you're saying
it's wonderful and it took me a long time also to to get to to think like that and so
you know it's amazing we have something really in common in the sense that in my life it was
tear who brought me back to my christian roots and the fact that i had gone really quite deeply
into the vedantic way turned out to be essential because it gave me something that my fellow
christians here generally have not been exposed to in other words i brought something back with me
from india which i was able to put to very good use there are very few meetings genuine meetings
between a western man and a vedic man and in fact the vedic side of india has been under attack
ever since the british came there because the british of course introduced western ideas and western
modes of living and i don't want to go back to india because i'm afraid i would not
the india that i experienced half a century ago doesn't exist anymore maybe if you go to
remote places in the Himalayan regions you you'll still meet it but uh i'm sure it's it's
essentially gone and so i was blessed in the sense that i could still absorb that
and at the time when i was in india i i thought like an indian in other words i totally forgot
about my christian background it was really it was somehow deep in my being but i wasn't conscious of
it so what i'm saying is that i was able to experience the vedic india uh in a in a rather
deep way and this has been a great blessing in my life because it gave me something that is
rather rare in this part of the world and when i got back to christianity i was able to integrate
these two these two sources if you will and in fact i will give you a book i published
a last year called vedanta in light of christian wisdom where i attack a very
now prevalent philosophy if you want to call it that the so-called perennialists people like
frito shuon ananda kumraswamy from india renege uh you know they are all perennialists perennialism
means perennialism means that uh there is one high truth and one pure religion uh with the world over
uh and in particular they think that the different religions are different paths to
the same summits that all of the major religions lead to the same place exactly and this in fact
this view is so widely disseminated nowadays that whether you talk to an educated hindu
or an educated muslim or an educated christian uh when it comes to the intellectual
class yeah this is almost unanimously assumed nowadays it's like the enlightenment of the
spiritual community so rationality is the enlightenment of the atheistic community and
then the spiritual community that feels like oh i have the answers is more of the type that
feels like well that religion is correct that really it's distorted it's it's it's somewhat
incomplete but that one's correct that one's correct amongst the really educated people
word over you find that this is almost axiomatic and uh there was a time when i was in a way
flirting with this outlook i read shuon and you know shuon was a very brilliant man and when you
read him it is easy to fall into his way of looking at things because he was a very powerful person
in fact i visited him in bloomington here he he comes from germany but early in life he converted
to the to islam and then he founded the tarika in bloomington and so i i had a personal contact
with him and at the end i realized that this is not someone you want to follow so i uh i'm probably
now the chief literary exponent of the opposite view instead of uh instead of perennialism the
idea of all religions are different ways of climbing the same mountain the first thesis and
the primary thesis which i document in this book that i just mentioned with anta in light of christian
with them the first pointer the main central pointer document is that the eschaton of the
vedic tradition and the eschaton of the christian tradition both are in a way to establish a union
with god there's no question about that that's what religion true religion is about but the point is
that the vedic union with god and the christian union with god are totally different and in fact
in a sense they are opposite because the vedic union with god i call it the nirvanic option
because never buddhism and hinduism are not totally the same but the word nirvana which
comes from the buddh expresses it so as perfectly as it can be expressed nirvana literally means
blowing out like a candle flame and this is really what the vedic paths the the highest
vedic path the vedantic path a brighter path accomplishes and aims to accomplish it's a
blowing out of the human now the point is it is a very deeply philosophical
point to discover that there is something in us which transcends the human i mean there is
something called wolfgang smith but if you wipe that out if a super yogi could put his hand on me and
this wolfgang smith is gone what would remain is the nevy karpas samadhi the supreme state
of the vedantic way the vedantic way is nirvanic it is a way of wiping out the merely human
it's hard to describe these things because this is we're touching rock bottom here we're talking
about absolutely foundational things so the vedic path is nirvanic in uh in the vedic tradition
you speak about nirvikalpa samadhi it is a state which very few sadhus even in india attain
but every now and then it is attained and for example in the early in first half of the 20th
century there was a great sadhu in india who had attained that nirvikalpa samadhi state
and i read about him when i was very young you have photographs of him there are people who
visited him and made conversations and the point is that from our point of view this was a human
being we could talk to him and he could talk to us but in reality that human side was just a facade
we think of him that way he didn't experience himself as that in other words he had attained
the actual eschatom of the vedic religion and there are various names nirvikalpa samadhi
this is not nirvana this is different it's the same exactly the same i'm convinced that
buddha even though he was not organically or historically related to india
another nevertheless he belongs in the vedic tradition so that the distinction is accidental
it's not essential so this is one eschatom and incidentally i mean it's like Mount Everest
it's it's too big for us to we can say the words but we don't really have any conception about that
now the important thing that i came to realize in the course of my life is that
the christian eschatom is something utterly different so much so that in a sense they are
anti-portal why the the key is as every christian knows that or the church fathers used to say
god became man so that man can become god but who who says that the fathers uh i mean
i mean it was assumed a saint augustin or saint thomas equinas they all would have agreed with that
who actually spoke these words i'm not enough of a scholar to but it's a formula that is accepted
in christianity as orthodox god became man so that man can become god but to be more precise
the the way of knowing god or seeing god that is offered to us by christianity
in contrast to the vedantic way is that by becoming a member of the mystical body of christ
through baptism we are able to see god the father through christ the son
through the incarnate christ without the incarnation there would be no such possibility
but this is why god became man to form a bridge as it were between the human and the divine
and through that bridge we can come to god the father through god the son and more specifically
the incarnate son there's a distinction between christ as the second person of the holy trinity
and christ as we worship him in our churches because what we worship and
what otherwise could not really be worshiped is god in the form of man this is a crucial point
so through christianity a new eschaton was given to mankind and the interesting thing
is that in vedic days that did not exist that became a reality when christ was born on earth
and that is long after the vedic period had begun so the the sadhus in india were practicing
their vedanta the long before there was a christianity so that began with the birth of christ
and it ended it was completed with a resurrection and we are we are part of that
ah we belong to that path our path is not the direct path which is practiced in vedanta
our path is through the god man and incidentally there's a wonderful passage in the gospel of
st john which speaks very directly to this it is taken from the what is traditionally called the
priestly the high priestly prayer this chord so it is before the passion when christ went into this
garden to pray he said addressing god the father he said
this is life eternal to know thee the only true god and jesus christ who was sent
this says it all coming from the mouth of god himself this says it all in other words our approach
to salvation to the union with god is through jesus christ who was sent these are the actual
words of jesus and when he says who was sent is a direct reference to the incarnation in other
words there would be there could be no christianity no other path to god than the vedic if it were
not for the incarnation it is by god becoming man that this other path was born so the vedas
know nothing about that in fact i was very surprised when in the recent days in writing this book that
i'm going to give you i was carefully thinking about all these issues and i discovered to my surprise
how very little of anything christian was known to the vedic tradition for example the story of
adam and the idea of the fall of adam and original sin which is all integral to christianity
is is not known to the vedas as in fact in sanskrit there is strictly speaking no word
expressing the judeo christian idea of sin bad karma is one thing but sin is something entirely
different and you will not find any mention in the vedic literature of sin in fact if you talk to
sin to an indigenous hindu however educated he may be he wanted to start what you're saying
i speak to people who are on the western of the eastern end meaning that they have a western
interpretation of the east and they like to say that well the east has everything that the west
has and more you're saying no no in fact you know what you just said uh is part of the perennialist
credo it all comes in the same package and so this book that i wrote which i hope will be read by
many perennialists it's the only book i know of that is a rigorous contradiction of perennialism
and not only do i contradict the notion of many paths to the same summit but i go into much more
detail for example i tried to uh demonstrate that the eschaton of christianity which is called
salvation is the polar opposite of the neovanic goal there are many words you can use to describe
it in the vedic terms let's call it the neovanic state salvation and the neovanic state are the
complete opposite why because in the neovanic state the human person has disappeared uh the
vedic paths there are many vedic paths to lesser ends but the supreme vedic paths
is a path which requires the immolation of the human being this is why if you go to india
the sadhus they all wear garu that is the color that identifies the sadhu and well
in a country that burns the bodies of the dead it is easy to see that the garu color
bears a reference to the self-immolation and incidentally living with the sadhus for seven
months as i did i came to experiences i saw that this is what these men were doing it was a self
immolation and i admire them tremendously i mean just the strength that it needs to rise above all
our human uh proclivities to give that all up to literally as it were take our body and
consign it to the flames this is what they do and uh my hat off to them and i love them dearly
i love them dearly because they were so kind to me uh they could they they immediately read all my
mind and whatever is even beneath the mind i was an open book to them uh this is automatic if you
rise to uh authentically high spiritual levels everything here in this world becomes an open
book when you look at the person you can tell his future and his past everything because in the
eternal state everything is here now so by the grace of god i got a glimpse of the greatness
of the hindu sadhus they are giants i uh and in fact when i was traveling in india
one of the great spiritual personalities was a woman her name was anandamoy ma and incidentally
your true door person whom i don't like at all he traveled to india and visited anandamoy ma i'll
give him credit for that there was a noble thing to do well anandamoy ma from childhood
um represented the highest state of consciousness i mean we of course saw her as a woman but she
did not for a moment think of herself that way so she was more divine than human and incidentally
when you got to know her a little bit the the better you knew her the more you saw the divine
part and the less you saw the human part and they're different and incidentally it was the first time
i was able to encounter a samadhi state samadhi is the super consciousness
it was on her birthday and on her birthday she always went into samadhi
and so when she was in samadhi she was not in this world at all and so there was the first time
i'd read about samadhi ever since i was 17 years old i knew about it but this is the first time i saw
a human being in that state and it's amazing because uh when she came out of samadhi for
about three or four hours she was in samadhi and when she came out of samadhi it was a sort of a
gradual continuous process and in this process her actual features changed at first she looked
like a young girl and then the more she regained her normal state the more she began to look
as we normally saw her of a rather past middle age woman and so this was supernatural i mean
how can you change in a few minutes from is it word child to an old man i mean this is
clearly supernatural and i knew of course it's a samadhi state is something supernatural
is something which in the ordinary christian tradition is not known you have to get into
the esoteric side of christianity then you will begin to re had incidentally let me say this
years before that experience in india
yeah years before that experience in india i had already read about samadhi states and uh
i visited in italy
a bona fide christian saint no question about it padre pio is his name he's since been canonized
and when i first saw padre pio he was being led into the church by another priest
and looking at padre pio i said to myself my god he's in samadhi it it was clear that
in his consciousness he was no longer seeing what we normally see this is why another priest had to
lead him by the hand
so uh having had some experience in india i looked upon our spiritual champions with a different light
i saw the supernatural side in something like padre pio and uh so samadhi is a real
is a real thing you do see it also in the west but only in the highest grades of sanctity
it's uh it is more known well i have well i speak about india i speak about india half
a century ago i don't think there's much left of that spiritual culture because india has been
westernized and contemporary western culture is like water to fire water extinguishes fire
so i have no interest even if i were young to go back to india because i've seen the best of india
and as i said when i was traveling there i could still encounter and actually speak
with sadhus of very high rank did you speak in english yeah that's that's a one good thing
that came out of the british raj it made english the lingua franca of india and for people like
myself it was a godsend because wherever i went i could speak to the people of course it's an
exaggeration when you went into the countryside in india uh the people only knew the particular
indian language of that district so but the anyone who's had a high school educations
of course new english so it did give me access and i remember i had beautiful conversations with
some of these sadhus there was one in particular he was the head of a monastery and uh he spent
20 hours a day in these samadhi states but when he came out of it he was very normal natural
and he liked me and he called me smitten under and at one point he said to me he said they are we
are seeking to enter the abode of death and they asked us to write books i've pondered over that
statement a lot of time many many times it says a lot first of all it says that the vedantic
path is a path to the abode of death and you could write a whole book explaining that it explains
everything so i was fascinated with that uh and in my book as you will read it explains what
you learn from the so-called phonetians like the the presocratics
uh pomeinidus pomeinidus uh what we have from pomeinidus in the form of fragments is a journey
quote-unquote to the abode of death so when i heard from the sadhu we are trying to enter
the abode of death and remember the ha pomeinidus said the same and so in the these presocratics were
following a basically yogic discipline which they received from the phonetians
so there was an actual connection with india there and um then as i write in this book i
recalled that socrates who was not from the in the phonetian tradition at all but socrates did
write that quote philosophy is the practice of death so in the platonists you find you find the
same vedic theme that the way to wisdom is to enter the abode of death and we can now understand this
because the samadhi state which is state of enlightenment in the samadhi state
the normal human function sees the breathing stops the heart beat does not stop completely
but it goes down into it's it's like the heartbeat of a hibernating bear very very slow just enough
to keep the body alive so vedic the vedic path is a path leading directly into death
and so the the vedic people also have their resurrection but it's a resurrection not in
human form what is their resurrection it is nirvikalpa samadhi it is that state and in india
every now and then you actually find a sadhu who is in that state and as i told you in the early
20th century one of these hindu personalities became world famous i have books here in my library
where you can see his photograph a german wrote that book he records the conversations he had with
ramana maharshi and chapter two of the book deals with a french benedict in monk who came to india
he had a face-to-face visit with ramana maharshi and from that point on all he wanted to do is follow
the hindu sadhana which he did follow successfully up to a certain point i think he was very very
advanced when he finally died but what i bring out in this book is that what he says about christianity
following his as it were initiation into the vedic religion is all wrong
so in chapter two i use the biography of ori lasso this benedict in
monk who then became in a way a disciple of ramana maharshi to show how completely distorted his
view of christianity had become then because he no longer had any idea about christianity he confused
christianity with vedanta and of course if you compare christianity to vedanta from a vedantic
point of view christianity falls short of the mark so this i think is one of the important
features of this book i correct something that might have very dangerous effect upon many readers
because it would very falsely it would essentially corroborate the false ideas of the perennialists
this ori lasso after his conversion if you will to vedanta saw everything through vedantic eyes
so he was therefore in a sense reproducing the perennialist outlook
so i regarded as an important part of my my work to rigorously disprove what people like
shu an are talking about because it's very dangerous shu an himself had attained rather high
spiritual states and that's when people become most dangerous because they have the certain
spiritual power and yet they do not have the sanctity that should go with it and then they
become dangerous can you expand more on that last point where people get close to enlightenment
what is it that they get close to and then they become dangerous to the extent that a person
makes progress in any spiritual path whether it's christian or vedantic
with this knowledge comes power and if you're not
very pure and you're in a being it can very easily happen that you misuse that power
and then you have something very dangerous
carly ewing had a phrase which said beware of undeserved wisdom good phrase he was referring
to psychedelics he's referring to you can get into certain states with psychedelics you can get
what you at least feel like our spiritual lessons what do you make of that phrase yes it's a it's
a good phrase and an important thing to understand but let me tell you this young is very very dangerous
because he certainly had a degree of knowledge way above the average
but way below the degree of authentic religion and in my first book called cosmos and transcendence
I have a whole chapter on Carl Jung which I entitle the deification of the unconscious
in other words Jung took the unconscious and essentially put it in the place of God
and so what he really was presenting was a kind of religion but it was a false religion
and there's nothing more dangerous nothing more lethal in all the world than a false religion
because even as true a religion takes you up a false religion takes you down and
in this book my first book I talk about two false religions one the religion of
Sigmund Freud which really was a kind of religion
certainly has a Satan's religion if you can put it that way and the religion of Jung
which leads in the same direction but it is geared to intellectually more advanced people so
when a priest falls and goes down it was usually through Sigmund through Carl Jung
and when a sensuous man falls and goes down it was probably through Freud
both were very dangerous characters and have had an enormous impact upon the western world
I have a friend who is a psychologist and one of the few psychologists who is quite enlightened
most of them are on the all sides of delusions and he has written book after book about the Freudian
heritage how Freud really brought us what he himself Freud called the plague so it's a very
dangerous thing Freudianism is basically a religion although it pretends to be a science
it isn't well it's it's it's certain science and so the the evil that has come into our world
first through Sigmund Freud and then through Carl Jung is enormous what makes a religion false
it's origin it comes from below
and of course the falsity is patent in what the religion actually says but in order to see that
you must have some bona fide knowledge of an authentic religion as this is very rare
in Christianity it pretends mainly to the esoteric level in other words
if you take everything literally this is all you need to know in order to be saved
you can take the words of Christ just in the most literal sense possible and if you make this
the guiding star of your life you will attain salvation on the word of God
but there are certain things in fact what we are trying to talk about I think it's one of them
there are certain things that cannot become pre-handed in Christian terms on that level
of understanding so in Christianity and incidentally this is not true for the Vedic tradition
in the Vedic tradition there's no hard and fast division between an esoteric knowledge which is
for all and an esoteric knowledge which is for an elite it's the same teaching but viewed on a
different level now in the Christian sphere I think there is a fairly sharp dividing line
between a literal understanding and a spiritual understanding and of course as I said before
they both will lead you to God but the difference is that the literal understanding
does not lead you to a higher understanding of your religion for example if you take Christianity
on its literal level you may very well end up saying well these Hindus they are all
heretics they they are pagans they believe in false gods and so on and I'm afraid many of the
missionaries that came to India for example they were not all very wise and I think one of the
reasons why they accomplished so very little is they looked upon Hinduism from an exoteric point
of view and if you do so as a Christian you don't really understand in India as I said before I think
there's no hard and fast distinction between esoteric and exoteric which means that in a sense
it's all esoteric in Christianity there is this division and you you see it in the teachings of
Christ this Christ clearly distinguishes what he says so to speak for everyone and what he says to
his disciples who needed to know more than that so the the reason why the Christian
missionary activity in India has been very unsuccessful is that in order to actually
reach even even mediocre Hindu you need to speak from a different point of view
I remember it was one time not on my first trip but I was visiting in India
I think it was during a Christmas break and I was in a monastic community in the Himalayan
foothills of quite up north and a Protestant minister came and was addressing these monks
and he was talking on a purely exoteric level which means that he saw all of Hinduism as just a
paganism and so on he had not the foggiest idea of what it was all about and I must say I was
impressed by these monks they sat there they didn't get excited or angry or anything just think how a
Christian would feel if a Hindu came and essentially made Christianity look like nonsense we would be
very upset well they weren't and they were very polite and after that after he was finished they
said well thank you very much for talking to us and goodbye so there was no connection at all and
as I said these these sadhus were not a bit angry they simply realized that this man didn't know
what he was talking about and there's something we all need to know and not get excited about it
because otherwise we'll have perpetual high blood pressure but so the fact though there has been very
little contact between Christianity and the Vedantic tradition and I firmly believe that the time
will come soon when such a contact will take place and it will completely change the outlook
of the western world so the time has come when the exoteric level is not sufficient
in the days during the middle ages for example with the next exoteric knowledge of Christianity
you could get to heaven very readily now it is not so clear because the point is on an exoteric
level you cannot protect yourself against the heresy of our contemporary world interesting
interesting in order to get out of this the real paganism is not in in authentic India the real
paganism is right here our present-day western culture and to the extent that we are a part of
that we are cut off from Christianity we cannot follow Christ and Mammon in the same at the same
time and this culture that we live in is basically it comes from below these are important things
because it's not just a matter of theory it's not just a matter of metaphysical speculation
it's a matter of life and death that's what it's all about this is why we founded the foundation
because i hope that these ideas which we are trying to express and disseminate i hope that
this will continue and you were talking about the foundation what is it called
philosophy initiative foundation philosophy initiative foundation yeah i i i split the word
philosophy into its roots philosophy love of wisdom right now that will be listed on the screen
and if you're just listening to this it's in the description you were speaking to
jonathan pageau on karen wong's channel called the meaning code oh yeah right jonathan said that
christianity transcends non dualism through salvation and that unity with god in the east
is seen as becoming the same as or becoming one with whereas at least in jonathan's words
unity with god to the christian is still retaining a multiplicity so it's not just becoming one with
but even becoming more multiplied and he says the blades of grass in heaven are more real
somehow we become more real rather than this becoming more and more illusory or the realization
quote unquote that this becomes more and more real as we make union with god and that sounds
odd because how can you union without being the same and he would say that's part of what makes
christianity difficult firstly to convey we don't have words for it we say union as the same but
there's the union with being multiplied what do you make of that well i agree that certainly christianity
is a union with god i don't know exactly what jonathan means incidentally when i had
our conversation together i was very impressed by him i was impressed by by how he looks
and how he speaks uh he is a very deep man a very fine christian and uh i'm very happy
that we had a meeting but i don't know whether he and i look upon the
vedic religion quite the same way i'd have to talk to him more to get a clear idea of how he
looks upon it there are two ways of looking upon it one is the usual way of the christian
of somehow putting the vedic religion down a few notches how how much that depends upon what
kind of a christian you are now needless to say i disagree with that there's no question of putting
one above the other because what i believe is that all true religion comes from god
and certainly this is the case in the vedic and this is the case in the christian and so
uh having said that it follows really that there is more than one religion uh
with the understanding that religion comes from god if it didn't you couldn't legitimately call
it religion it's the word is i think from really god really god for binding back and only god can
do that and only god can tell us the way so i look upon both the vedic and the christian as each
true religion which means that it comes from god and it leads to god
but that said and i think many many people would say the same thing what is somewhat unusual about
the point of view at which i arrived late in my life uh is that whereas i regard both
the vedic and the christian as true religion that means a way leading to a union with god
i do not agree for example with the perennialists that what stands at issue is the same union in fact
i have gone out of my way trying to explain that in point of fact these two unions are
anti-podal because both are extremes the vedic extreme is the extreme of self-immolation
it is to to to see it in in pictures which is the only thing that we can do actually
it's as if we take this body and cast it into a blazing fire what happens is that the body is
burned it exists no more after that as body and this is what you actually what confronts you
in the vedic religion when you take it at its highest level it is a self-immolation and this
is why the sadhus wear garu the garu cloths the vedanta is a path of self-immolation
and the christian path is something utterly different and in fact it is something that did
not really exist in the vedic age i think i've said many a time that the vedic is the oldest
religion in the world and at the time that the vedas and the upanishads were written
that was before abraham was even born so the entire judeo-christian tradition which of course
culminates in the birth and teaching of christ uh and this is um is later than the vedic tradition
so in the vedic tradition you find no judeo-christian ideas at all i was so
amazed when rather recently i discovered that basic notions pertaining to the judeo-christian
religion uh are completely unknown in the vedic world for example adam and the fall of adam and
original sin uh and what i'm curious about is remember how you were saying the way that the
more literalist christian speaks to the hindu it's not getting the message across and in christianity
there is something that talks about that like paul says to the jew i became a jew to the lawless
i become the lawless what i'm curious about is it's almost like there's the literal and then
there's some more esoteric interpretation and maybe then there's even a more mystical interpretation
regardless there's a literal then there's an esoteric and that we need to go to the esoteric
in order to combat some of the perils of today like materialism and so on so what i'm curious about
is often people stop as if the bedrock is the literal and then they go upward like i said there's
esoteric and then there's like the most esoteric like there are degrees upward but it doesn't seem
like people consider that there could be something that's more literal than the literal more real than
the real i don't know what that means but the point is that i'm not terribly convinced that the only
way to speak even to the hindus or speak to materialists and this is assuming materialism is
incorrect and so on is to move upward maybe there's a moving downward somehow but i don't know what
that looks like so i'm curious to know what your thoughts are well i think the division between the
esoteric and the esoteric is the only thing we need to consider and talk about because it's the
only thing that is real now in the teaching of christ and in fact right through the patristic age
the esoteric and the esoteric uh coexisted almost uh both were well and alive let me give you an
example in st augustine's confessions which was a book so to speak written for everyone
you will encounter the esoteric and the esoteric side by side
uh some of the most beautifully esoteric teachings that i have ever heard you find in the confessions
of st augustine i'll give you one example it's an example i love so much i've
cited it often in my writings st augustine begins a chapter speaking as it were to god
and he says let me see if i can i want to remember it precisely he says
i see these others beneath thee an existence they have because they are from thee yet no
existence because they are not what thou art now i won't go into this now that would not be the time
but let me say that this is one of the most esoteric statements i have ever read
and you could give lectures about it you could you could for example explain how all of Vedanta
is really contained in these words they go as deep and as high as the human mind can go
and yet it is something that is uh as said casually in st augustine's autobiography i mean the
confessions is his autobiography which uh weaves into one the story of his
intellectual and spiritual life and also the teachings of christ on both the esoteric and
the esoteric brain so everything is in there now during the patristic age the both levels
of understanding the exoteric and the esoteric went hand in hand it was part and parcel of
the christian heritage and then during the middle ages in the west mainly in the west
more than in the east this equilibrium was disturbed and esotericism tended to disappear
i mean there there always were and there always will be individuals who have been given from god
this higher vision but when i say it disappeared i mean for instance that it was no longer
recognized officially and i'm sorry to say that undoubtedly uh many esoteric christians
were actually burnt at the stake in the european middle ages this is a sad fact which however is
true and you can't deny it meister egghardt for example who was in the opinion of many including
my own perhaps the greatest esoterist that western christianities ever produced he was a
master of scholasticism who took scholasticism to its ultimate end which is far above the exoteric
level he actually was condemned by the inquisition and would have been burnt at the stake if he had
lived two years longer because two years after his death a a bull came out known as in agro in
uh agro dominici that is the name of the bull where 29 uh propositions i think which he had
written down were declared heretical and in a sense these accusers were justified because
uh these 29 propositions that were uh declared heretical were in fact purely esoteric and
they were formulated in a way which was clearly dangerous to ordinary people
there are things that are not meant for ordinary people and can be dangerous and so i'm not accusing
these uh uh what were they called well never mind they the censors were doing something which is
something which is inherently legitimate i mean they were protecting the flock
from teachings which would have been dangerous to them and in fact if you want to find fault
with master ekert you could say he was sometimes uh too uh too esoteric in his manner of speaking
not realizing that this could be dangerous to ordinary folk ordinary christian how is
it dangerous well for example at one point he said god can do nothing without me now obviously
he was not just jabbering if an ordinary person says that it's nonsense but when
master ekert said this it was indicative of some high truth there is a kernel of truth there
and he had incidentally i've often observed and even written in some of my books that what
the the manner of expression that master ekert used i call koanik because it is very similar to
what is used in zen buddhism in zen buddhism you have a kind of a custom a tradition that the master
teaches the disciple by throwing at him statements which cannot but be shocking
and which obviously make no sense exoterically and therefore force the disciple to ascend to an
esoteric level for example the story is told in many of these buddhist books a disciple comes to
the master and says what shall i do if i see the buddha walking down the street and the master says
kill him now it's a it's a perfect example to spoken to a disciple who has the capacity to
get the point of it this is a very powerful way of instructing him because there's another emotion
really that enters into this but at the same time you run the the risk that if the person doesn't
really understand what you are saying it may confuse him it may even hurt his religious
beliefs his face so it's a it's a double-edged sword so i've recognized the fact that master ekert
did definitely express himself in what i call a koanik way which is what got the inquisition
on his back i am definitely no friend of burning anybody alive and i'm sorry that the catholic
church did that but uh it happened uh you know there are two churches there's one that is holy
because it comes directly from god but there's always a human element if we were confronted just
by god's church by the words of christ falling from the master's uh mouth that would be one thing
but religion must have also an earthly side and so conflicts do enter and dangers do enter and
you can look at the so-called inquisition from two directions from a orthodox catholic
point of view you can say well it was necessary because we had to control the heretics from another
point of view you can say it was a catastrophe because de facto you killed off esotericism
what finally remained after so many centuries of this kind of
rule by the clergy was the effective end of esotericism
in that killing buddha koan what's the proper way of interpreting it
well um you must kill the our human way of looking at buddha uh you know in terms of
bones and flesh and blood and appetites and even perhaps some human faults we don't know
that's not the real buddha and that's not the buddha you want to set up as an exemplar
you need to understand his message and his true nature which can only be seen with a spiritual
eye not with the eyes of flesh something that karl yung said in a sense it saved me was that when
delving into these topics there's a danger of floating so far above the ground that you just
start to float and he said that's what happened to nicha and he said someone was asking karl why
haven't you gone mad why are you grounded and karl said the grounding of his feet is one his
patience the people that he sees in his practice and second his wife i found that to be the case
for me that my wife is this grounding point and if i didn't have that i don't know where i would be
because i'm just such an abstract person i feel like i could think myself into madness i could
reason myself into believing i don't exist or you're all that exists or i'm a plate and if people
hear this then they think that's a bit foolish to me it's like i don't think they've thought deeply
enough about existence or about themselves anyhow i heard that you've also expressed a similar
sentiment in one of your books there's a danger of floating too far up in the same way that there's
a danger well there's less of a danger in being just rooted mainly you start to criticize people
you become racist and egocentric and so on but it's not a danger of the same sort can you express
what your views are on that well i'm glad you asked this question good because i think it's
very very important and in fact it connects intimately with all that we've been talking about
you see
there was a time both in the east and in the west when things were rather normal
and so the people who were interested in the deep things the esoteric when it comes to the
christian world there's this division there is no such official division in the vedic tradition
it's it's all it's all one but in christianity there are these two levels and in the in the
early days when things were normal everybody was in the right place and the people who were
more or less exoteric in their dna in the natural way they would get their spiritual food from the
ordinary from the ordinary sources they would go to a religion class where a priest would explain
the words of christ and so on and if they wanted to go further beyond that
they would find a suitable teacher in the case of st august in he uh what was the name of this
wonderful saint who helped st august in to convert and to ascend to an esoteric understanding of
christianity so everything was really in order everyone had what he needed it was at hand and
as time went on the situation changed and more in the western in the east
in the eastern part of the christian world you find more of the old system of guru and
disciple but in the western world things changed very much and in a sense esotericism was
misrepresented and to a large extent it was lost they're always going to be
inspired by god and people who are very pure in their nature and can go very deep into prayer
and can ascend as it were the ladder of god but they are very very special people and what i'm
saying is that in the west the uh the normal supports for that kind of an ascent uh cease to
exist and this is a problem you did not have in the patristic era wherever you were you were
never too far from a real christian man of experience who had a kind of firsthand knowledge
of the esoteric plane and this is what in the west as i say was getting scarcer and scarcer
and finally almost disappeared and this is why the outer church collapsed and actually
this splitting up into many sects so you had the catholic church which continued as it were in a
in a single line from the actual days of christ uh in addition to that there were various sects
uh which each had a little piece of the truth but uh something essential was lacking
and uh finally things got so bad that the institutional catholic church itself
in in in a visible sense collapsed that's a sad truth and uh i've written a book about that
my book on teyate shodan uh essentially uh tells the story of a man who was somewhere along the
line he was actually possessed in a clinical sense and he exerted an enormous influence
upon the clergy and uh when you look at the second Vatican council where essentially the
the cleavage occurred you find the teyate shodan was the the the guiding spirit of that council
all the younger clergymen were somehow it was almost like a kind of madness i mean uh
uh i i actually in a sense it was because it was occult it was not a a human thing an occult
power manifested through this teyate the shodan and through teyate the shodan it really gained a
kind of power over the younger generations in the church so it was a revolution and uh
we are now in the uh in a transitional state where there's a lot of confusion and things are
things are happening which eventually will lead to a new rebirths of the christian religion
this this sprinting will be no more all who regard christ as their savior
will belong to one in the same church and esotericism will again be uh not only it will again
enter into play but in a sense it will become the norm which means that this church
which a a great christian master has called referred to as the church of the resurrection
this church will be not so much rational as it will be mystical because mysticism is
something that can be accessed by anyone regardless of his education for example
the simplest peasant and the most learned scholar when it comes to a mystical
recognition they are on the same plane they can speak the same language
so uh this is what i learned from a very holy catholic uh figure very well known
malachi martin he wrote these bestseller books which uh were widely known in the christian world
and i was lucky i spent two years in correspondence with him and i had a lot of questions in my
mind so where i would ask him these questions and he would answer them and in fact a few years
after he died i was in living contact with him for two years and then he passed away
and a few years after he passed away i i realized that this correspondence we had was very important
because it it brought up questions which were not ever officially or publicly discussed
and i felt these are very very important questions so this little book came out
uh malachi martin a response to wolfgang smith and it's simply the correspondence that we had
over two years but the issues that we were really discussing in this correspondence uh evidently
was something rather new and this is why i'm glad this book is published because i regard malachi
martin as a very important figure he has yet to be recognized uh and i feel one day he will be
he was a man of very great spirituality and a very heroic man and i hope that someday he
will be recognized and appreciate it do you think that both the esoteric and the exoteric
will be needed in the new church or will just purely be esoteric no both both are needed
because humanity always is comprised by many different types of people we are we are supposedly
we're now all the same it's not true we're not all the same and thank god for that because life
would be very boring if we were all the same so there are many different types of human beings
with many different talents and many different blind spots too and this is what makes it all
very interesting uh it would be utterly boring if we were all the same i was speaking to a
psychiatrist named ian migilchrist i was talking to him about that experience of solipsism that i
had before where just everything was in my own head and he said curt you're not the same as the plant
and you're not the same as your wife and you're not the same as god and so on well you share an
element and he said the fact that you share implies that you're different why because you don't share
with yourself and i found terribly insightful but this is a beautiful thing about the fact
that there are men and there are women and they are definitely not the same let the gurus of the
present day say what they want uh they man and woman are fundamentally different the difference is
so profound that few people are intelligent enough to even get a glimpse of that difference
what our presence civilization is trying to do in this regard is criminal it is absolutely
criminal uh telling a young girl that she can be a boy and so on not only is it utter nonsense it's
like drinking cyanide it poisons it poisons the human beings because the difference between
man and woman is in a sense sacred because like all real things it is rooted in god
going back to that other statement that could potentially be seen as dangerous which came
from meister ecart saying that god cannot do anything without me along those lines what's the
proper interpretation of that you ask a very difficult question i don't think i ever gave
this a great deal of thought because what fascinated me when i read this was to say ah ha this is
kawanic this is kawanic and this is also why ecart got into such deep trouble with the
our inquisition because the inquisition had no comprehension of the kawanic nature of discourse
so they took literally what was never meant literally i mean this statement god can do
nothing with me obviously this was not for a microsecond meant to be taken literally
because that would be flagrant lunacy and in fact the whole point of the kawanic way of expressing
oneself is to use lunacy as a means of jarring people out of their everyday complacent welternschaum
which is actually what you need to do in order to grow spiritually in order to understand say
the saying of a saint which is above the normal level you must somehow jolt yourself out of that
normal level because if you don't do it you will never understand what the saint is talking about
so uh instinctively meister ecart uh was kawanic in his um teaching not always mind you he was in
fact technically speaking uh he was a scholastic but uh if you compare him say to uh to saint
thomas equinas he was a very different kind of scholastic because saint thomas equinas did not
cross the divide between exoteric and esoteric i think their grounds were saying that and as a
matter of fact uh the last teaching that saint thomas equinas bequeased unto his disciples
it is a remark that he made to regional to what his private secretary so in the last days of his life
saint thomas equinas said to his secretary quote i see now that all i have written is um false
even worse than that is mere straw
i see now that all i have written is mere straw and this is an accurate statement
regarding his position he decided for reasons of his own to step back from the esoteric level
if he had not done that he would his fate would have been like that of meister ecart
and we would probably not even know about him he became the doctor of the church and the
paragon of christian wisdom for many many centuries precisely because he uh took exoterism
to its ultimate level he was very well aware of the division between what comes beyond that
and the exoteric plane but he chose not to follow that path he perhaps knew that in the
providence of god god inspired meister ecart to take care of the esoteric which he did in a
non-proof ultra manner supreme perfection and saint thomas equinas was to take care of the
exoteric i think it's a plausible conjecture but in any case what meister ecart did and
relatively few people recognize this is he continued what is called the scholastic methods
the scholastics had their own way of dealing with uh theological and metaphysical issues
and it is different from what you find anywhere else for example the the the use aristotelian
terminology in a way which you don't find anywhere else so it's a specific pass if you will
and meister ecart chose to take that path all the way to pull out all the stops so to speak
which of course then got him into trouble as we know saint thomas equinas did not do that
i think when it comes to things of that magnitude you cannot but uh conclude that this must
be in the will of god god wanted meister ecart to give us as it were to pull out all the stops
which he did and he wanted saint thomas equinas to uh remain below a certain level in order that
he can become quote unquote the doctor of the church meister ecart although his teaching is
if you will hire could not be a doctor of the church because he's not for everyone
and as i say if you read the writings of meister ecart there are many many things that he says
which are definitely dangerous to the ordinary christian when you were speaking near the beginning
of this answer you were saying that lunacy is a step along the path now i just want to make
clear so were you saying that or are you saying like look do not go insane go seek help if you're
feeling well i was speaking in a in a sort of an esoteric letter no i think it was a little loosely
that i was speaking because there are two kinds of lunacy in principle there's the ordinary kind of
lunacy which arises from a lack of intelligence and that's what our clinical psychologists know
about but there's another kind of apparent lunacy which is simply wisdom beyond an ordinary human
level uh when the when you wisdom exceeds a certain plane uh your manner of expressing it
can very readily be seen as lunacy and uh in the history of human religions i think you can in
just about every religion point to actual historic figures which had that kind of lunacy
so here's where i disagree with yung carlyung or maybe it's more that i don't know so carlyung
had a phrase that beware of undeserved wisdom and then you express the sentiment that there's
wisdom and if you're not ready for it it's beyond your level it can be seen as lunacy so i don't know
if what people attain when they crack or they have psychotic episodes and so on is indeed wisdom
just they weren't ready for it i was speaking to john vervecki who you spoke to as well and john
vervecki says that there's something that's incorrect if it's provoking such fear or anxiety
there's something that's miss framed so i don't know if it's as simple as if truth is a ball
and you can grab it but you're not ready for it i think somehow if you're not ready for it
you grabbed something wrong or it's not as simple as the grabbing of a ball like a true
ball and then it hurts you in some way but i think there are both we must recognize that
both of things these things are real on the one hand you have people who for example tried to
ascend in an intellectual or spiritual way and incidentally if you do this without a guru
without somebody who is really a master and is guiding you you're doing something that's very
risky i think this is what happened to niche i think niche was by nature a very very brilliant
and very very deep man who as it were by his by his dna was seeking god but in the european
culture of his day there was no one who could even understand nature uh there were very few
figures in the europe of that time in the german speaking world who had any real conception i think
one of the few people who broke out of that milieu was gutter i think he was one of the few but
gutter himself was not clear about everything but in gutter i see a man who was way way beyond
the level of his day niche was i think by nature equally deep but somehow other he he got off the
deep end he if niche had had a proper guru i think we would now know him as a great man
this is why i worry about myself and then also some of the people who are watching
because i feel similar feelings of going off the deep end in these subjects and i also wonder
how much of this exploration of theories of everything is helping versus hindering i want
to make sure that what i'm doing is good well if that's just a worry well it is an absolutely
marvelous point that you raise and the point which i think is very very essential especially in this
day and age because in this day and age i think two things are true more people perhaps than for a
long time to say ever before is too too grandiose a word but for a long time
we have in the western world observed a sort of a level of mediocrity
and true seekers after truth where it comes from the heart not from the cerebrum
were few and far between now because the world is growing darker and more dangerous there's
no question about that more and more people are whether they know it or not they're seeking god
it's as simple as that but our civilization is so confused and so anti god in its present
manifestations that many people who seek god do not in any way realize that that's what they're
doing and so there are a lot of people who are seeking something which they do not understand
and they do not also know how it is to be thought and i think the the bottom line is
they need help they need help as ever before have you heard of the dark nights of the soul
yeah yeah and you know in a sense this is almost an inevitable
episode in the life of a seeker in other words in it in one way or another everyone who
uh moves from the ordinary common way of looking at life to something that is
belongs to the supernatural belongs to the spiritual realm needs to pass through that state
but there is a great difference between someone who makes this journey under the guidance
of a qualified teacher and someone who doesn't who sort of does it on his own and this is something
that i think can be said very apodictically even though there are always exceptions to just about
every rule but we may safely take it for granted that if we truly desire higher knowledge and desire
somehow to draw closer to god we need an appropriate guide and there are basically two ways in the
Vedic way it is a question of finding a guru and then becoming a disciple and half a century ago
when i was traveling in India and i'm sure this is no longer true today but in those days if you
were in India and you wanted to find a guru and you searched you would surely find someone who was
qualified to act as your guru because as i say you could go to the Himalayan regions and you could
find areas like Rishikesh for example where you would see these real sadhus who spent
the greater part of the day in in samadhi states that only exists at then i don't think it exists
anymore today so the normal thing is when a human being seeks god and whether this is
in the Vedic or the Christian concept in one way or another you always are going to need a guru
in in India that meant in those days coming in contact with a man who has actually attained access
to higher states in the west it means associating yourself with a legitimate church which is able
to transmit the teaching of Christ and the grace that comes from that and that's a complicated
subject because not all churches are equal and they're also bad churches so it's all complicated
here's something i have been thinking about is it the case that you marry a church or you marry
a religion but let's say a church in this case because we're in the west in the same way that
you marry a woman namely that there is no perfect one and if you're going to wait around and try
and find a perfect match you're not going to find one so what you do is you commit yourself knowing
that there are flaws i i cannot look at things that way um because it is certain that in churches
there is a human element but it is equally certain that there is a pure supernatural also
i'm a catholic so i will speak in in catholic terms
what is the supernatural in the true catholic church the supernatural resides in the priesthood
and what is the priesthood first of all to make a priest it's it's like the initiation i talked
about in india you don't become a yogi unless you receive that from someone who is and who himself
received it from his own guru the same thing in principle you find in the catholic church
to become a priest
actually i should talk about bishop because priest is something lower than that
so they become a bishop someone who is already a bishop has to put his hands upon you
and say something sacred and well how did he become a bishop the same way so there's a continuous
chain going right back to our lord jesus christ and his apostles the apostles were the first
bishops if you will and they became that directly through the the hands of christ
and so the real treasure in the catholic church and in the orthodox church
the same applies in both cases is that the functionaries of religion
were all part of the same transmission which originates in christ and then through the
apostles down the line right to bishop mahogany today i shouldn't use mahogany's name because
he was a terrible bishop but a real bishop is part of that lineage and you know it's like
electricity we have light here and how is that possible there is an actual wire that connects
this bulb to something like naga falls which is where this electric power originates so
in similarly in a bona fide religion the functionaries and there is no religion
without functionaries somehow there must be a priesthood the ordinary person cannot serve as
a functionary for example i'm not a priest i cannot forgive sins i cannot do any of these
priestly acts which are an integral part of the church and so there must be this this wire
going right back to the origin which is in christ now in a chain a chain is only as good as its
weakest link and then a wire wouldn't transmit if there was a cut in it so in the same way given
that churches have an element of corruption because we're human so there's always a small
element sometimes it can be large sometimes it can be smaller it's a wonderful question
and a very necessary question because take the case of a bishop there are two things here
there is a bishop properly so called and as i told you that cannot exist without the chain of
transmission it's the only way you can create the bishop so there is a bishop but in addition
there is a human being with all the frailty of a human being and it is certainly possible
for a bishop to be an absolute role it's possible and this happened many many times so you can be
sure of that but the point is that even though both things exist in one and the same man they are
utterly different as a bishop as wicked as he may be he still can confect the sacraments he
can make another bishop he can say mass he can forgive sins he can do everything that is in the
power of the bishop you know in fish we talk about bio accumulation like plastic or mercury
they bio accumulate the more that you eat it and the more that those eat that why can't we
have something similar where the sins of a bishop rather than the sanctity being passed down in the
same way we have original sin we can have a bio accumulation of sin to a bishop our current day
bishops or that somewhere down the line a line was cut because the sin was of sufficient critical
points yeah well the critical question is not what is conceivable but what is actual and for
thousands of years now the western church and in the eastern churches they they agree perfectly
in in these fundamental matters so both the roman church and the eastern churches agree a hundred
percent that there is a spiritual line so that means there is an ontological difference between
a bishop and an ordinary person this is an ontological difference it likes the difference
between having electricity and being able to turn on the light and not having it and this is not a
matter of belief or faith or it's a matter of fact and at the same time it is also and equally true
that every bishop is also a human being and it can very well happen and has happened innumerable
times that this human being is very unworthy now let me say this war unto him who is because the
higher you rise the deeper you may fall and if a bishop commits sins his punishment will be much
worse than if you and i do that but we we have to understand the categorical ontological difference
between say a priest or a bishop on one side and an ordinary person on the other the ordinary person
may be as pious as any man can be he may be erudite a model of perfection but if he's not a bishop he
can't make a priest and if he's not a priest he cannot confect the sacraments it's as simple as
that and it's every bit as regular true as this analogy about electricity so this is a fact unfortunately
this fact has been forgotten and there's been a lot of confusion because all sorts of people have
founded churches and given religious uh instruction who were simply not qualified
and this is why the world is full of all sorts of groups that have partly the truth of christ
and partly they don't have misconceptions so this is a reality you cannot deny
speaking about lines that go back do you have any issues with evolution versus intelligent design do
you have any thoughts there oh absolutely evolution is a heresy it's a fundamentally false doctrine
there's no actual scientific evidence whatsoever about evolution and as i keep writing in in my
various articles since 1998 evolution has been mathematically disproved it is impossible and
that can be proved rigorously and it has been proved but even so i think it's ultimately
due to satanic forces evolution is so to speak the pseudo religious cradle of our civilization
so this may be one of those coins that can be misinterpreted so what specifically about evolution
do you not agree with is it that we share a common ancestor with a different species or that we all
came from a single-celled organism well fundamentally what i object to in uh evolution and why i think
that it is basically satanic teaching satanic is always inverting putting god down and satan up
it's a complete inversion and evolution is a complete inversion because instead of recognizing
that all being comes from above from what i call the eternal plane and thus from god because who
puts that eternal plane in there that is the creative act platonism is very clear about this
and of course the Vedic teaching is also very clear about this but in in reality
the entire universe i'm just gesturing the entire universe is descending from that avid
tunnel from that central point of the cosmic icon and the doctrine of evolution puts it completely
it puts the world upside down particles quantum particles as i we talked about that earlier this
afternoon and i pointed out to you that quantum particles as quantum particles don't exist
whatever existence whatever reality they they have they obtain in one of two ways
it's always through contact with the corporeal entity and there are two ways in which this
actually happens in the corporeal entity that defines the quantum system quantum systems don't
just grow on trees i mean uh every physicist if he wants to study a quantum system he has to
to set up equipment which in effect produces that quantum system so the quantum systems don't grow
on trees they are in a certain sense man-made which means that the the impetus comes from the
opposite direction that our physicists think it comes from it comes from the center of the cosmic
icon it comes from the avid tunnel realm because it was known since the days of Plato and Pythagoras
that that's where all being comes from these are absolute statements is being a synonymous with
consciousness or is being much greater or does consciousness separate like this one is two percent
or a subset of the other i've just finished an article on consciousness and in fact i added a
very essential section this morning so this is all very recent but the central point about
consciousness is that it definitely derives not just from the avid tunnel realm from but from
God himself and this is where i quote a Vedic statement namely that the fundamental principle
is what is called in a new panichad satchit ananda so sat is being chit is consciousness
and ananda is bliss so these are three nomen day names of God which are Vedic in origin
and it is from this divine trinity satchit ananda that the creation comes and this is why the creation
is tripartite because these three parts the avid tunnel the psychic and the corporeal
are manifestations respectively of sat chit ananda and in my paper i i have to explain that because
at first hearing you don't you don't grasp how ananda which means bliss is in any way associated
with the corporeal world in fact you might very well conceive the opposite that this is the veil
of tears and it's a place where there is least least ananda of all well i i i go into all these
issues very carefully and i hope i'm making a very plausible argument so the point is
that consciousness we have it all wrong and and and not just the the gross materialism but also
the people who think they are spiritualists or what have you the point is one way or another
we all try to explain or understand consciousness from below the outright materialist says aha it
it all comes from quantum particles if you have enough of them aggregating in suitable ways voila
there's consciousness but pardon me for saying so this is nonsense this is utter sheer nonsense
there's not a speck of truth in that and in fact it's a complete inversion because there's only one
place where consciousness can actually originate and that's in god himself and we have a vedic
source which tells us so one of the most profound no man day in the vedic tradition is sat chit ananda
sat chit ananda is a name of god and it's a name which tells us something about the nature of god
and interestingly enough it's triadic god is in a sense one and three at the same time
you find the same thing in christianity but in a very very different way so christianity speaks of
the the trinity yes so it also sees god as a triad the triplicity but let's leave that out of
the picture because it's completely different from the vedic not at all of the country in the sense
there are as i've already said in a way polar polar opposites so in order to understand cosmology
in a platonist cosmology you have to start with the vedic
no man day the key is unquestionably the revealed name sat chit ananda this is not a human invention
that comes from god and it is the oldest name of god because the vedic tradition is the oldest
tradition in the world by long shot even as christianity so to speak the last
i think there are in essence only these two traditions and then there are many in-betweens
but i think so far as bona fide manifestations from god himself you have the vedic and you have
the christic i don't think there's anything else on that level and they are polar opposites
and however to understand cosmology you have to go back to the vedic the vedic and the
the platonist are one and the same there's a little technical difference as i said
the platonic involves the idea of geometry in a way which you nowhere find in the vedas
but apart from this the vedic and the platonist are interchangeable
and so if you want to understand cosmology ontologically there's no other way
you can get it from the vedas you can get it from Plato in either case you get the tripartite cosmos
and this is the way you are going to understand cosmology and once you have seen that
you recognize at the glance that the modern scientific way i don't i say scientific because
it's not really scientific at all but all of our scientists think that way so it's scientific
it's the scientific way it's the polar opposite of the vedic or platonist where the vedic and
platonist sees being or irreducible wholeness which is the same thing as originating on the
aveternal plane and actually beyond that it originates in the tripartite divinity
the scientific things that comes from quantum particles if you have enough of these nonexistent
things you will have consciousness this is nonsense complete nonsense and i want to use what
little energy i have left to get this message across this is nonsense there's no evidence for
it and theoretically it doesn't make sense excuse me i sure sure in fact uh i was in telephone
connection with uh bill demsky just before christmas just so you know the demsky arguments
rely on something called the no free lunch theorems or at least one of them and wall part
david wall part is the creator of the no free lunch theorems and he had this major criticism
of demsky's work saying that this misuses my theorems and it's not rigorous he has a whole
blog post about it so i could set up if demsky wants like i've done two podcasts with wall part
i could even organize a conversation between them well uh i have looked at demsky's theorem very
carefully in fact his is the only bit of mathematics that i ever put into any of my books
in one of my books there's a chapter on demsky's stuff and i actually go through the main step
of his theory it's very simple really the mathematics is very simple and i think there's
absolutely not a shred of doubt that it is a completely rigorous mathematical theorem
and if people disagree it's just because uh evolution is against their religion
i mean excuse me evolution is part of their religion is what i wanted to say and so
it's a kind of on a religious grounds that they uh attack demsky and i'm not surprised at all
i've seen enough to realize that our religious convictions whether it's true religion or
false religion they're equally strong and equally definitive so my own conviction is
that bill demsky's theorem is a bona fide mathematical theorem as good as any other
mathematical theorem uh and it does prove that uh deterministic random and stochastic
processes cannot produce complex specified information that is you can bank on that that's
like the pittagorean theorem it simply is and if people don't like it it's their problem
and it does rigorously disprove evolution it's pattern dried and it's easy to see because
uh you couldn't have seen it before the discovery of dna but with the discovery of dna
we realize that the simplest living organism contains in every one of itself what might be
popularly characterized as tons of uh complex specified information
and that's clear and therefore this tons of complex specified information could not have
been put there by uh either deterministic or random or a combination of the two that is stochastic
process this is crystal clear and if even you know well-known scientists object it's on emotional
psychological grounds not on mathematical and one can very well understand that they would object
because if you realize that evolution is impossible then at one stroke our entire
scientific well-danshawing is kaput instantly and it would surmise surprise me enormously if
under these conditions you will not find very erudite very famous celebrated men
who will oppose that tooth and nail and incidentally I know Odebski fairly well enough
to realize that he has personally suffered terribly because he's a he's just a mathematician
who happened to prove this incredible theorem and then people like Stephen Meyer and so on
realized the importance of it and founded something called the what is it uh intelligent
design institute and they have lots of money and they're very prestigious and uh so uh
Demski became a celebrity on account of that and since the intelligent design movement
uh the main tenet is that evolution is wrong that uh intelligent design is producing all these
biological phenomena now obviously since they have so to speak become very visible
the opposition has also been very visible and very audible and so there has been a tremendous
attack upon the uh intelligent design people and especially Bill Demski and there's been
personal attacks and you know Demski is a very good man he's a little childlike he's not sophisticated
and so on which is perhaps why God gave him that insight you know there's a there's a goodness there
and a devotion to God which is natural not sectarian or anything like that so at a certain point
Bill Demski couldn't take it anymore because his personal life was attacked so he sort of withdrew
and uh then I I happened to get in touch with him uh before Christmas I think I took the
initiative I called him and we had a nice conversation and I was happy to hear that he
is back in action as it were because in fact he was just his way on his way to a conference in
Europe someplace so he's back active representing the uh intelligent design institute and uh
in fact I told him a little bit about my work and so forth and he was interested in
and he wants to visit me one of these days I hope so because he's a very very good man
I'm not taking a side here but in defense of David Walpert I don't believe he is a proponent
of evolution I think he's actually a critic of it he thinks it's incomplete so his grounds for
disliking the application of the no free lunch theorems I don't think come from that David Walpert
also has the monotheism theorem I don't know if you know about that but it says that if there's a
god there could be only one god and he mathematically shows this I have a podcast on that but anyway
I'm not terribly convinced that the criticism just comes from his emotional appeal though I think
almost all our criticisms for anything come from emotional appeals because we're deeply emotional
people anyhow let's put that aside and I'll just wrap with a couple questions which actually come from
a friend of mine who's watched so much of your work and is a huge fan his name is Matthew Wyden
he asks Aquinas says that God is being while Whitehead says God is becoming do you think these
are opposed or both captured with Platonism? Whitehead is wrong a being has nothing to do with
process see process ontology is whiter than a student so my own outlook towards Whitehead is
in a sense mixed I owe him a great deal because he opened my eyes to bifurcation and the absolute
absurdity of our scientific well done genre so we're totally in agreement on that but I'm a
Platonist right down to the bone and Whitehead certainly is not even though he's very sympathetic
to Plato and in fact in this book which I read when I was 14 he says that all subsequent philosophy
of footnotes to Plato so he was very respectful of Platonism but he was not actually in his
philosophy a Platonist there's no way of squaring his process theology with Platonism
and so I can very well understand that somebody who is a process theologist and sort of following
Whitehead in that part of his teaching might have reservations about Dempsey theorem.
At the core of Reveki's Platonism is his ontology which he calls the perceptual promise that reality
is inexhaustibly intelligible he has a Taoist definition of reality calling it the ground of
being which itself cannot be a being but is rather the unintelligible ground which all being comes
into being western religions rather consider reality to be the supreme being an inexhaustible
sentence whereas saint Maximus joined these saying God is both being and non-being what do you think
about these different ways of describing reality? Well I think Saint Maximus was basically right
there is in Christianity a tradition let's see what is it called it corresponds to
Advaitha Vedanta in the sense that it is very it it emphasizes the transcendence of God to an extreme
but there is also in Christianity a tradition which is based upon the immanence of God
so God is both absolutely transcendent and absolutely imminent whether we can grasp that or not
I have some mathematical questions and one of them is in differential geometry there's some
results by radon and moise or the radon-moise theorems it says the amount of differentiable
structures that can be placed on dimension one two and three is actually just one up to
diffeomorphism and then from five six and onward it's finite it's large but it's still finite but
dimension four it's uncountably infinite not even infinite it's uncountably infinite I haven't
heard many people talk about this and I wonder if that's related to spacetime being four-dimensional
very interesting you must realize that I got interested in differential geometry
after I took my PhD my doctoral dissertation was simply a matter of an existent theorem for
solutions of differential equations and a conversion theorem for some process of approximation
so it was very very classical and then what happened was this I knew that my profession
was going to be a professor of mathematics so I knew that I would have to earn my living so to
speak by proving mathematical theorems now I didn't want to go into any field that other people had
already worked in because I didn't want to be obligated to read hundreds of papers in the literature
in other words to me mathematics was just a job my main interest was elsewhere so I developed
a subject in mathematics which when I started was completely unexplored the theory of submersions
and I'll tell you what that is if you have an n-dimensional space and an n plus p
dimensional larger space and you have a differentiable map from the big space to the little space
which is everywhere of maximal rank this is called a submersion and what it does is it slices
big manifold we're talking differentiable manifold we're slicing the big manifold
into p-dimensional sub-manifolds and so this is an this defines a subject and I think I was the
first mathematician to systematically study submersions and when I started I was practically
the man who was building it up from nothing and I wrote about 23 papers on submersions
in each paper it made a contribution so that by the time I was finished after I don't know
30 years of being a professor of mathematics by the time I was finished the theory of submersions
one was on the on the record it it became a a recognized discipline in mathematics
and you know the funny thing is I belong now to something called academia and whenever my name
is mentioned anywhere in the journal literature they give me the actual quotation and so by
as of this morning during the last year or so my name was mentioned 210 times okay so that's one
thing but the interesting thing is that about 10 percent of these mentions go back to my
mathematical days in other words along with my recent books and all of that mention is made
so less frequently of my articles on submersions so by now submersions is a
mathematical discipline which is of interest in universities all over the world so there are people
so my old papers that are sick and go back 60 years ago are being cited in the mathematical
literature because submersions as I say is one of the accepted domains of research now
john bias who's a physicist a mathematician he has a paper on categories and smooth maps
and he references you and then I saw that paper and it was the diram's theorem on general spaces
yeah that yeah right right it's one of my 23 papers anyhow the point is I looked at
mathematics as earning my living in other words my my actual interest was in platonism
and whitehead and so on and so forth in philosophical things but we all have to run our living and
it earned me a good living I didn't it didn't take much time I had most of my time was free
sir it's been a pleasure it's been more than a pleasure thank you so much for not only speaking
with me for this long but inviting me to your home and inviting me out to dinner as well which
we'll get to shortly thank you well I can tell you frankly that when I first heard about you and
due to our friend Brian and I began to look you up on the internet and see what you're all about
I became tremendously eager to meet you because I felt that we might really have a lot to say to
each other and I so far I feel that I was on track I mean your background and mine
so different in many ways still have common interests and in fact I would say that fundamentally
you and I are very much interested in the same questions we come perhaps from somewhat different
directions you know much more about what's really going on in the technical world I'm so happy that
you came and I'm looking forward to having another couple of days at least two exchange ideas and
I'm very happy that you have some Indian blogs because as you know I have the highest regard for
the Vedic tradition well something we could speak about later is that generally in our culture we
don't have high regard for virtually anything so yeah yeah isn't it true okay okay that was a far
reaching fantastic conversation thank you for watching for four hours now this is a reminder
that on tow on theories of everything we recently published two videos that I think you'd like one
is called curt plays everything which is a video of me playing a video game that envelops the themes
of tow namely the consciousness philosophical metaphysical themes also there's a part one of
a debate that I was lucky enough to host with ronardo castrup donal hoffman and susan schneider
both are linked in the description and there's so many more plans for the future
for instance we're going to be delving deep into artificial intelligence we're going to be
bringing lectures actual lectures to the four that's coming up shortly with the mind of machines
conference with susan schneider also I just wanted to thank you for watching for listening
your viewership your financial support helps tow it wouldn't be tow wouldn't exist without
your viewership slash your sponsorships slash your support you may not know it but it's a
tremendous tremendous amount of work behind the scenes actually there's an entire video on that
called the day in the life and I'll link that somewhere here as well as well as in the description
every dollar donated over the patreon helps support this channel that's patreon.com slash
curt jimungal c u r t j a i m u n g a l and again links every link that said it's in the description
thank you so much every dollar every comment every like every subscribe every twitter share
helps tremendously thank you thank you so much and take care I also wanted to give a
shout out to brian who helped set up this interview and of course one last thank you to my friend
wolfgang smith the podcast is now concluded thank you for watching if you haven't subscribed or
clicked on that like button now would be a great time to do so as each subscribe and like helps
youtube push this content to more people also I recently found out that external links count
plenty toward the algorithm which means that when you share on twitter on facebook on reddit etc
it shows youtube that people are talking about this outside of youtube which in turn
greatly aids the distribution on youtube as well if you'd like to support more conversations like
this then do consider visiting theories of everything.org again it's support from the
sponsors and you that allow me to work on toe full time you get early access to ad free audio
episodes there as well every dollar helps far more than you may think either way your viewership
is generosity enough thank you
you
